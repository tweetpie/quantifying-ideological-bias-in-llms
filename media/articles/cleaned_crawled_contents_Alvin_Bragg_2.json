(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - When Alvin Bragg took office as Manhattan district attorney in 2022, he stunned the public and his own staff by pausing an investigation into former President Donald Trump that appeared to be hurtling toward an indictment.\n\nTwo top prosecutors were so upset with the decision, they quit. One called Bragg's hesitation to bring a case against Trump \"a grave failure of justice.\"\n\nNow, Bragg has cemented his place in history as the first prosecutor to win a criminal conviction of a former U.S. president .\n\nSpeaking after the verdict Thursday, Bragg summed up his role by saying, simply, \"I did my job.\"\n\n\"Our job is to follow the facts and the law without fear or favor, and that's exactly what we did here,\" he told reporters.\n\nTrump and his supporters insist Bragg, a Democrat, had a vendetta against the former president and presumptive Republican nominee. He has relentlessly accused Bragg of manufacturing a baseless case for political reasons.\n\nHere's a look at Bragg's background, his time in office and his history regarding Trump.\n\nBragg, 50, grew up in Harlem when New York City struggled with high crime. He once had a knife held to his throat and has talked about being held at gunpoint six times while growing up, including three times by police officers.\n\nWhen he was 15, one officer stuck a gun in his face and wrongly accused him of being a drug dealer as the teen walked to buy groceries for his father. Bragg filed a complaint over the incident.\n\nBragg went on to graduate from Harvard Law School. He began his career as a criminal defense and civil rights lawyer, went on to the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan and then worked at the New York attorney general's office, where he had his first legal tussles with Trump.\n\nBragg was a senior lawyer in the state attorney general's office in 2018, when it was engaged in multiple battles with Trump, related both to his White House policies and his stewardship of his private charitable foundation. Bragg directly oversaw a lawsuit against the foundation. Trump settled , agreeing to the foundation's dissolution, and a judge fined him $2 million.\n\nBragg left the attorney general's office in late 2018 and became a professor at New York Law School.\n\nBragg ran for Manhattan district attorney in 2021, campaigning on a platform of \"justice and public safety\" in a crowded Democratic primary.\n\nIn some ways, he was the perfect candidate for predominantly Democratic Manhattan a year after the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd had started a national reckoning with how the criminal justice system has treated Black people and others of color. Bragg, who is Black, had worked as a prosecutor but had personal experience with over-policing of the city's Black community.\n\nHe was also, he suggested at the time, well positioned to take over the criminal investigation into Trump and his company from Cyrus Vance Jr., the outgoing DA.\n\nDuring the race, Bragg was asked repeatedly how he would handle the probe. His standard answer was to cite his work on Trump-related lawsuits while he was in the attorney general's office, and his willingness to hold powerful figures accountable.\n\n\"I don't know where this investigation will go. I don't want to prejudge it. But, these types of investigations - white-collar investigations - I've been involved with for years, both doing them myself and also supervising them,\" Bragg told The Associated Press at the time.\n\nVance's investigation was focused then on whether Trump had committed fraud by lying about the value of his assets on financial statements given to banks and others.\n\nAfter winning the primary, Bragg cruised to victory in the general election.\n\nBragg became Manhattan's first Black district attorney in January of 2022. He was challenged over his approach to the job nearly from the start.\n\nOne of his first steps was a memo that, among other things, instructed prosecutors not to seek jail time for some low-level offenses, such as minor marijuana possession and sale (the state later legalized such possession) and to charge some armed robberies in commercial settings as misdemeanor petit larcenies.\n\nPolice leaders, conservative media and some centrist Democrats accused him of being soft on criminals during a pandemic-era crime spike. Bragg's staff said the memo had been mischaracterized, but his office later walked back portions of the directive .\n\nDuring the 2022 governor's race, Republican candidate Lee Zeldin promised that, if elected, he would try to remove Bragg from office.\n\nBragg faced criticism again this year when he declined to seek pretrial detention for some men accused of brawling with police officers in Times Square.\n\nThe decision drew criticism from Gov. Kathy Hochul, a fellow Democrat. Bragg defended himself, telling reporters, \"the only thing worse than failing to bring perpetrators to justice would be to ensnare innocent people in the criminal justice system.\"\n\nHis investigators later determined that several men initially arrested played only a minor role in the fight or weren't even there.\n\nBragg's most surprising early move as district attorney was to halt the investigation into whether Trump had lied on financial statements.\n\nThe lead prosecutor on that probe, Mark Pomerantz, resigned in anger.\n\nBut the investigation wasn't over. It was just changing.\n\nIn 2022, Bragg's office persuaded the Trump Organization's longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, to plead guilty to evading taxes on fringe benefits, including a luxury car and rent-free apartment. Later that year, the DA's office won a conviction of Trump's company on similar tax charges.\n\nEmboldened by those victories, Bragg convened another grand jury, which indicted Trump in April of 2023 on charges that he falsified records at his company to conceal a scheme to pay hush money to keep a sex scandal from damaging his run for president in 2016. Trump denied any wrongdoing.\n\nA jury convicted Trump on those charges Thursday.\n\nTrump and his allies have slammed Bragg as a partisan in the guise of a prosecutor, claiming he brought the case solely to damage Trump's chances of regaining the White House.\n\nTrump has called Bragg an \"animal\" and a \"degenerate psychopath,\" once made a social media post of himself holding a baseball bat next to a picture of Bragg, and described him Friday as \"a failed D.A.\"\n\nHe has shrugged off Trump's accusations.\n\n\"Many voices out there,\" Bragg said Thursday. \"The only voice that matters is the voice of the jury. And the jury has spoken.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Craig Ruttle, File)\n\nRead the latest (4/15): Trump's hush money criminal trial begins: Live updates\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - When he was elected two years ago as Manhattan's first Black district attorney, Alvin Bragg spoke candidly about his unease with the job's political demands. A former law professor, he's more comfortable untangling complex legal questions than swaggering up to a podium.\n\nBut when the first of Donald Trump's four criminal prosecutions heads to trial on Monday, about alleged hush money payments to cover up a sex scandal during the 2016 election, Bragg will be at the center of a political maelstrom with few precedents.\n\nEven before announcing the 34-count felony indictment against Trump last year, Bragg was a lightning rod for conservative critics who said he wasn't tough enough on crime. The upcoming trial will test the Democrat's efforts to portray himself as apolitical in the face of relentless attacks from the Republican former president and his supporters, who say the prosecution is the epitome of partisanship.\n\nEchoing the racist tropes he has deployed frequently against his legal adversaries, Trump has called Bragg a \"thug\" and a \"degenerate psychopath,\" urging his supporters to take action against the \"danger to our country.\"\n\nBragg, who declined to be interviewed for this story, has rejected that, comparing the prosecution against Trump to any other case of financial crime.\n\n\"At its core, this case today is one with allegations like so many of our white collar cases,\" Bragg said in announcing the indictment last year. \"Someone lied again and again to protect their interests and evade the laws to which we are all held accountable.\"\n\nThe first-ever trial of a former U.S. president will feature allegations that Trump falsified business records while compensating one of his lawyers, Michael Cohen, for burying stories about extramarital affairs that arose during the 2016 presidential race.\n\nThe charges - which carry the possibility of jail time - threaten Trump's campaign schedule as he faces a general election rematch with President Joe Biden.\n\nThey have also turned a spotlight on Bragg, who since bringing the indictment has been the target of scores of racist emails and death threats, as well as two packages containing white powder .\n\n\"Because he is the first to get Trump to trial, and because he's been successful so far, the level of hate pointed at Bragg is staggering,\" said Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served as special counsel in the first impeachment trial against Trump. \"The threat level is just off the charts.\"\n\nCiting Trump's threatening and inflammatory statements, Judge Juan M. Merchan imposed a gag order last month that bars Trump from publicly commenting on witnesses, jurors or others involved in the case - though not Bragg or the judge personally. Attorneys for Trump have sought to reverse the order, seizing on the issue as one of several arguments for delaying the trial.\n\nThe 50-year-old Harlem-raised Bragg got his early political education during visits to the city's homeless shelters, where his father worked. He said he was held at gunpoint six times while growing up - three times by overly suspicious police officers - and once had a knife held to his throat.\n\nFILE - Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, left, returns to Manhattan criminal court after a recess, Monday, March 25, 2024, in New York.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, POOL, File)\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard Law School, Bragg began his career as a criminal defense and civil rights lawyer, later joining the federal prosecutor's office in Manhattan. As a top lawyer in the New York attorney general's office, he oversaw investigations into police killings and a lawsuit that shut down Trump's charitable foundation.\n\nThough he said he had little interest in elected office, Bragg joined a crowded race for Manhattan district attorney in 2019, running on a platform of \"justice and public safety.\"\n\nCompared to many of his opponents, Bragg took a more measured tone in detailing his plans for the investigations into Trump and his businesses, which began under former District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.\n\nOnce in office, Bragg surprised many by pausing the criminal investigation into Trump, leading to the resignation of two top prosecutors who had pushed for an indictment.\n\nWhen he resurrected the case last April, the charges of falsifying records were raised to felonies under an unusual legal theory that Trump could be prosecuted in state court for violating federal campaign finance laws. Some legal experts say the strategy could backfire.\n\n\"It seems a bit of a legal reach, and the question is why are they doing it?\" said Jonathan Turley, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. \"It can be hard to escape the conclusion that this effort would not have been taken if the defendant was not Donald Trump.\"\n\nOthers have blessed the legal theory, including a federal judge, Alvin Hellerstein, who wrote in a decision last year that the law did not provide exceptions for election-related activities.\n\nFILE - Manhattan District Attorney-elect Alvin Bragg, a former top deputy to New York's attorney general, speaks to supporters in New York, Tuesday, Nov. 2, 2021. As he prepares to bring the first of Donald Trump's four criminal prosecutions to trial, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg finds himself at the center of a political firestorm. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle, File)\n\nFrom his first days in office, Bragg found himself under a barrage of criticism over a memo instructing prosecutors not to seek jail time for some low-level offenses.\n\nHe walked back portions of the directive amid fierce protest from New York Police Department leaders, conservative media and some centrist Democrats, though he later said he regretted not pushing back more forcefully. For many on the right, the image of Bragg as a poster child for Democrat permissiveness stuck.\n\n\"When you're the district attorney, you are also a politician, and there's been a slight failure to grasp that,\" said Rebecca Roiphe, a New York Law School professor who taught alongside Bragg and previously worked in the Manhattan district attorney's office. \"The fact that he's not attuned to what he needs to do politically to get things done is both a strength and a weakness.\"\n\nThough most major crime rates in Manhattan remain lower than before Bragg took office, conservatives continue to accuse him of allowing rampant lawlessness. Republicans convened a congressional field hearing in New York to examine what they said were Bragg's \"pro-crime, anti-victim\" policies.\n\nBragg was pilloried on the right again earlier this year when he declined to seek pretrial detention for some men accused of brawling with police officers in Times Square.\n\nThe decision sparked criticism not only from conservatives but also Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, and top NYPD officials. Bragg defended himself, telling reporters, \"the only thing worse than failing to bring perpetrators to justice would be to ensnare innocent people in the criminal justice system.\"\n\nHe later announced several men initially arrested played only a minor role or were not present at all.\n\nIn 2022, Bragg's office pressured the Trump Organization's longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, into pleading guilty to evading taxes on company perks like a luxury car and rent-free apartment. Later that year, it put Trump's company on trial, and won a conviction on similar tax charges.\n\nAfter that, Bragg convened a new grand jury, securing the indictment accusing Trump of falsely recording payments to Cohen as legal expenses, when they were for orchestrating payoffs to porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal , to prevent them from going public with claims they had extramarital sexual encounters with Trump.\n\nTrump denies the accusations and says no crime was committed. Now, a jury is on the verge of being picked that will make a historic decision about whether Trump broke the law - or Bragg overreached.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has agreed to testify before Congress on July 12, a day after former President Donald Trump's sentencing in his hush money trial .\n\nA spokesperson for Bragg's office confirmed Tuesday that he will appear before the House Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government alongside Matthew Colangelo, the former high-ranking Justice Department official who was hired by Bragg in 2022 and helped lead the Trump investigation.\n\nBragg and Colangelo will face what's likely to be a hostile, Republican-controlled hearing where the chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio has accused both men of conducting a \"political prosecution\" in the case against the former president. It will mark the latest effort by Trump's closest allies in Congress to discredit the recent 34-count conviction by going after local and federal prosecutors who have charged him.\n\n\"It undermines the rule of law to spread dangerous misinformation, baseless claims, and conspiracy theories following the jury's return of a full-count felony conviction in People v. Trump,\" a spokesperson for the Manhattan DA's office said. \"Nonetheless, we respect our government institutions and plan to appear voluntarily before the subcommittee after sentencing.\"\n\nTrump, the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, was convicted last month of falsifying records to cover up hush money paid to a porn actor during the 2016 presidential campaign and is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11 . Before then, prosecutors will be making recommendations to a judge about what kind of punishment Trump deserves.\n\nBragg, a Democrat, sued Jordan last year, seeking to halt a House Judiciary Committee inquiry into Trump's indictment. He later agreed to let the Republican-led committee question ex-prosecutor Mark Pomerantz, who once oversaw the investigation but left the job after clashing with Bragg over the direction of the case.\n\nSoon after Trump's April 2023 arraignment, Jordan took the Judiciary Committee on the road for a field hearing near Bragg's offices to examine what he decried as the Democrat's \"pro-crime, anti-victim\" policies. Democrats described the hearing and various efforts since by Republicans as a partisan stunt aimed at amplifying conservative anger at Bragg.\n\nJordan has proposed withholding federal funding from any entity that attempts to prosecute a former president. He has also railed against what he's described as the \"weaponization of the federal government.\" Before Trump's verdict last month, Jordan sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, demanding information about the Justice Department's role in the local prosecution of the former president.\n\nThe Justice Department responded in a letter Tuesday, saying that while it does not \"generally make extensive efforts to rebut conspiratorial speculation,\" a review by the department of all communications from the start of the New York case in January 2021 until the verdict showed no contact between federal prosecutors and those involved in the hush money case.\n\n\"The District Attorney's office is a separate entity from the Department. The Department does not supervise the work of the District Attorney's office, does not approve its charging decisions, and does not try its cases,\" Assistant Attorney General Carlos Uriarte said in the letter obtained by AP. \"The Department has no control over the District Attorney, just as the District Attorney has no control over the Department.\"\n\nHe added: \"The Committee knows this.\"\n\nBragg, a former civil rights lawyer and law professor, is in his first term as Manhattan's district attorney. He inherited the Trump investigation when he took office in 2021. He oversaw the prosecution of Trump's company in an unrelated tax fraud case before moving to indict Trump last year.\n\nHe and Colangelo previously worked together on Trump-related matters at the New York attorney general's office. During the trial, Colangelo delivered the opening statement and questioned several witnesses including former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Jim Jordan, wrote Bragg in late May after Trump's conviction in his hush money trial , accusing him of having conducted a \"political prosecution\" and requesting his testimony at a hearing June 13.\n\nIn a reply letter, the Manhattan district attorney's general counsel, Leslie Dubeck, said the prosecutor's office was \"committed to voluntary cooperation.\"\n\nThat cooperation, it added, including making Bragg, a Democrat, available to testify \"at an agreed-upon date.\" But the letter said the date picked by Jordan presented \"presents various scheduling conflicts.\"\n\nIt noted that the Trump prosecution is not yet finished.

(AP Photo/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez)\n\nA New York grand jury that voted to indict former President Donald Trump on charges involving payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to silence claims of an extramarital sexual encounter has refocused attention on the Manhattan district attorney steering the case. Alvin Bragg's decision to convene the grand jury early this year led to the first criminal charge against a former U.S. president.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Bragg:\n\nAlvin Bragg became Manhattan's first Black district attorney in 2022, following his election in November 2021.\n\nThe office prosecutes nearly all criminal cases in Manhattan, staffed by about 500 lawyers. The district attorney also is a key political figure, overseeing cases that often involve defendants with immense wealth, fame and influence.\n\nManhattan district attorney is one of the most high-profile prosecution jobs in the world, dramatized on TV shows like \"Law & Order\" and \"Blue Bloods.\" Robert M. Morgenthau, who held the job for 35 years , was the model for the fictional character Adam Schiff on \"Law & Order,\" one of the series' original leads played by actor Steven Hill.\n\nThe office has a budget of about $150 million and has used a separate $800 million forfeiture fund bankrolled by Wall Street settlements for grants to criminal justice and community organizations and big initiatives, such as testing backlogged rape kits.\n\nBragg is one of five elected district attorneys in New York City - one for each of the city's five boroughs. Bragg won a tough Democratic primary and then the general election to become Manhattan's district attorney. He took over for retiring District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.\n\nBragg is just the fourth elected district attorney in Manhattan in the last eight decades. Frank Hogan served for 31 years. Robert Morgenthau was in office for 34 years, until he was 90. Vance retired at the end of 2021 after 12 years.\n\nBragg's career includes time as a federal prosecutor, an assistant attorney general for the state of New York and a civil rights attorney who represented Eric Garner's mother as she pressured New York City officials for more accountability against the officers and commanders involved in her son's 2014 death by a police chokehold.\n\nBragg's campaign included promises to change the culture of the office and allied him with other progressive prosecutors aiming to eliminate cash bail. Shortly after taking office , he released a public memo promising the district attorney would no longer prosecute some low-level misdemeanor crimes .\n\nBragg, who grew up in Harlem, graduated from Harvard Law School.\n\nBragg inherited a yearslong grand jury investigation into hush money paid on Trump's behalf during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAfter taking office, Bragg slowed down his office's move toward an indictment against Trump and said he had concerns about the strength of the case. That sparked a public protest by two prosecutors who were leading the investigation and resigned.\n\nBut Bragg convened a new grand jury early this year after successfully convicting Trump's family company for tax fraud. He called that result a \"strong demarcation line\" for proceeding with other parts of the probe.\n\nIn general, the grand jury process is seen as extremely favorable to prosecutors .\n\nProceedings are closed to the public and there is no judge. Prosecutors call and question witnesses and grand jurors - people drawn from the community - can ask questions. Grand jurors can either agree there is enough evidence to issue an indictment, find there is not enough evidence or tell the prosecutor to file lesser charges.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - When Alvin Bragg became Manhattan's first Black district attorney last year, one of his first big decisions was to tap the brakes on an investigation that had been speeding toward a likely criminal case against former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe move won him few friends. Exasperated liberals dreaming of Trump in handcuffs threw up their hands. Conservatives gloated that the Democrat's hesitation to bring a charge was proof Trump had been investigated for political reasons.\n\nA year later, Bragg is shaking up that first impression.\n\nFresh from winning a conviction against Trump's family company for tax fraud, Bragg convened a new grand jury last week in a reinvigorated investigation that could lead to the first ever criminal charges against a former U.S. president.\n\nThe probe, lately focused on hush money payments made to two women in 2016, is one of several legal challenges Trump faces as he seeks a return to the White House. It is putting Bragg back in the spotlight after a grueling first year in office.\n\n\"We're going to follow the facts and continue to do our job,\" Bragg said, speaking broadly about the investigation in a recent interview with The Associated Press.\n\nAsked if charging Trump was a real possibility, or if the former president could rest easy, Bragg replied: \"I'm not going to tell anyone how to rest.\"\n\nBragg came into office 13 months ago amid what he calls a \"perfect storm\" of rising crime and political pressure. A Harvard-educated former federal prosecutor, chief deputy state attorney general and civil rights lawyer, he came equipped with legal and management credentials, but not much experience navigating New York City politics.\n\nHe campaigned as a progressive reformer, but one with a strong record as a prosecutor, and won an eight-way party primary before soaring to victory with 83% of the vote in deep-blue Manhattan.\n\nYet he got off to a rocky start. Shortly after taking office, he wrote a \"Day One\" memo for his staff that outlined his philosophy on prosecuting - or not prosecuting - certain crimes. Among other things, it said the district attorney would no longer prosecute some low-level misdemeanor crimes, including subway fare evasion and marijuana possession.\n\nRepublicans, and some centrist Democrats, pounced.\n\nBragg, they said, was soft on crime. New York's police commissioner said Bragg's intention not to prosecute some people accused of resisting arrest would invite violence against police officers.\n\nU.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Republican running for governor, campaigned partly on a promise to remove the independently elected Bragg from office. He also featured Bragg in a campaign ad, even though Bragg wasn't even on the ballot.\n\nThe vitriol became so rancid - and sometimes racist - Bragg said his friends worried for his safety.\n\nBut Bragg, an old-school lawyer, was hesitant to push back publicly, something he now regrets.\n\n\"I've learned that the work doesn't always speak for itself,\" said Bragg, who's been appearing more on TV and giving interviews to outlets as varied as Teen Vogue and Manhattan's West Side Rag.\n\nHe likened Zeldin's TV attack ad to an infamous \"Willie Horton\" commercial that aired in the 1980s in support of George H.W. Bush's presidential campaign. That ad featured a Black prison inmate who committed violent crimes while on a weekend leave as part of a program authorized by Bush's Democratic rival, former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.\n\n\"If someone wants to have substantive discussion, we can have that,\" Bragg told the AP. \"But if someone wants to put a Black face in an ad and have Willie Horton-type fears raised, we don't have time for that.\"\n\nWhile some types of crime increased in Manhattan during Bragg's first year in office, the number of homicides and shootings actually dropped.\n\nInside the district attorney's office, Bragg faced dissent over the direction of the Trump investigation - grievances that are being aired anew in a book by a former prosecutor.\n\nIn 2021, Bragg's predecessor, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., had authorized top deputies to seek an indictment on charges that Trump had exaggerated the worth of his assets in financial statements he gave to lenders. A grand jury had been collecting evidence. Vance retired before the case was finished, leaving the decision about whether to go forward to Bragg.\n\nBragg decided not to proceed immediately, citing concerns about the strength of the case.\n\nThe delay prompted two prosecutors leading the investigation to resign.\n\nOne of them, Mark Pomerantz, has written about his disagreement with Bragg in a new book, \"People vs. Donald Trump: An Inside Account.\" In it, Pomerantz outlines his case for charging Trump and laments Bragg's decision not to pursue an indictment.\n\nBragg countered in a statement that, in his assessment, \"Pomerantz's plane wasn't ready for takeoff.\"\n\nBragg also took issue with Pomerantz's criticism of his prosecution team. \"It is appalling that he insulted the skill and professionalism of our prosecutors,\" he said at an event this week. \"We have the most outstanding lawyers in the country working every day in the Manhattan DA's office to keep our city safe from the streets to the suites.\"\n\nLately, those lawyers have again been turning up the heat on Trump.\n\nOn Dec. 6 they won a conviction against the Trump Organization for helping the company's former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, and other executives avoid paying personal income taxes. The company got a $1.6 million fine . Weisselberg pleaded guilty and got jail time . He qualifies for release in April.\n\nAnd a new grand jury is hearing evidence related to payments made in 2016 to two women who alleged they had sexual encounters with Trump.\n\nTrump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has already served prison time in connection with those payments after pleading guilty to campaign finance crimes. He has said the Trump Organization reimbursed him for one of the payouts and rewarded him with extra pay disguised as reimbursement for legal services.\n\nBragg declined to discuss the investigation in detail, but said prosecutors had paused certain aspects of the probe until the Trump Organization trial was finished. The verdict was a green light to get back to work.\n\n\"The trial is sort of a strong demarcation line for us,\" Bragg said.\n\nWith that, the Manhattan investigation is suddenly back on the list of potential legal perils for Trump.\n\nIn Fulton County, Georgia, the district attorney is investigating Trump's alleged interference in that state during the 2020 election. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Trump's storage of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida and the former president's role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTrump has lashed out at Bragg and Pomerantz on social media, calling the district attorney's investigation \"fake,\" \"weak,\" and \"fatally flawed.\"\n\n\"THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THEY HAD WITH THE \"CASE\" IS THAT I DID NOTHING WRONG!\" he said in one recent post.\n\nBut now, a year later, Bragg and his team might have other thoughts.\n\n__\n\nFollow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips/ .\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCLAIM: A video shows Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announcing that he will \"drop all charges\" against former President Donald Trump and is resigning.\n\nAP'S ASSESSMENT: False. Bragg has made no such announcement. Fabricated audio was added to a 2022 video of the district attorney speaking at an event hosted by the New York University School of Law. A grand jury is still weighing an indictment against Trump, so Bragg's office has not actually brought any criminal charges against the former president.\n\nTHE FACTS: As the grand jury continues to investigate Trump over hush money payments made on his behalf during his 2016 presidential campaign, an altered video of Bragg has spread online in recent days.\n\nIn the edited clip, Bragg appears to say his office has \"decided to drop all charges against Donald Trump\" and that he is resigning from his position as district attorney.\n\nThe altered video appears to have been originally shared as a joke on Thursday; the audio becomes increasingly absurd as it goes on, including numerous disparaging comments about Bragg's appearance and a reference to the user who first posted the doctored clip. A close look also shows that the voice in the audio does not match Bragg's mouth as he speaks.\n\nBut in the days after it was first posted, other social media users shared the clip and its claims as real, with one Facebook post racking up more than 5,000 likes as of Saturday\n\nThe original video shows Bragg speaking at an event hosted by the New York University School of Law and was posted on his office's YouTube page in January 2022 , the same month he took office. The district attorney's outfit and the video's background match the clip circulating on social media, but instead of talking about Trump, Bragg speaks about his plans for the job.\n\nWhile it's not clear how the bogus audio in this edited video was specifically created, artificial intelligence tools that allow users to generate audio simulating real people's voices are now widely available online, resulting in a flood of \"deepfake\" videos misrepresenting high-profile people.\n\nBragg's office could not immediately be reached for comment Saturday.\n\nThe Manhattan grand jury is investigating payments made to women who alleged sexual encounters with Trump. The panel turned to other matters on Thursday, delaying any vote on an indictment, according to AP reporting .\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and that he had any extramarital affairs. The former president has lambasted Bragg over the probe and encouraged his supporters to protest.\n\n___\n\nThis is part of AP's effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - A man wanted in the killing of a woman found bludgeoned to death with an iron in a Manhattan hotel was apprehended in Arizona this week. But in a legal twist, Arizona officials are balking at sending him to New York to answer to authorities.\n\nThe top prosecutor in Maricopa County has said the suspect must first answer to his alleged crimes in Arizona, which include the stabbings of two women.\n\nRachel Mitchell, a Republican, criticized the progressive policies of Manhattan's top prosecutor, Alvin Bragg, who is a Democrat, and suggested his record on crime is reason enough for denying New York's extradition request.\n\nBut legal experts say a denial on those grounds would be extraordinary.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nRaad Almansoori is a 26-year-old man wanted in the killing of Denisse Oleas-Arancibia at the SoHo 54 Hotel in lower Manhattan.\n\nThe 38-year-old Queens resident, who police say had been working as an escort, was found dead on a hotel room floor by staff on Feb. 8. New York City police say her death was caused by blunt force trauma to the head, and a broken iron was found at the scene.\n\nAlmansoori was arrested on Feb. 18 in Arizona after police there say he stabbed a female McDonald's worker in the bathroom of the fast food restaurant in a Phoenix suburb. Police say he's also the suspect in the stabbing of another woman during a robbery attempt a day earlier in the Phoenix area.\n\nAlmansoori has been formally charged with two counts each of attempted murder, aggravated assault and attempted sexual assault for the Arizona stabbings.\n\nWhile in police custody in Arizona, police say Almansoori admitted to killing Oleas-Arancibia, telling Arizona police to Google \"SoHo 54 Hotel .\" They also believe they have the suspect on surveillance video exiting the hotel wearing Oleas-Arancibia's leggings after having discarded his blood-soaked pants in the hotel room.\n\nPolice have also said they're looking into whether there are other alleged victims elsewhere in the country. The Maricopa County public defender's office, which is representing Almansoori, didn't respond to messages seeking comment Thursday.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is preparing to bring the first criminal case against a former U.S. president. Next month's trial is centered on years-old accusations that Donald Trump sought to bury stories about extramarital affairs during his 2016 presidential run. Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n\nBragg, who is Manhattan's first Black district attorney, has been a frequent target of Republicans nationwide for his office's decision not to prosecute certain low-level offenses.\n\nMaricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell, meanwhile, is a Republican who played a key role in the 2018 confirmation hearings of conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nKnown nationally as a sex crimes prosecutor, she questioned Kavanaugh and accuser Christine Blasey Ford over her allegations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were in high school. Mitchell also wrote a memo casting doubts on the strength of Ford's claims.\n\nBoth are elected officials.\n\nIn order to answer to charges in New York City, Almansoori would need to be formally transferred from Maricopa County, where he's been in custody since his arrest, through a legal process known as extradition.\n\nBragg's office hasn't made a formal extradition request, but said Thursday that it will make the decision after Almansoori tells a court in the coming days whether he consents or intends to fight such a request.\n\nEither way, Mitchell said Wednesday she would oppose such a move because she believes it's safer to keep Almansoori behind bars in her county.\n\n\"Having observed the treatment of violent criminals in the New York area by Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg,\" she said, \"I think it's safer to keep him here and keep him in custody so that he cannot be out there doing this to individuals either in our state, county, or anywhere in the United States.\"\n\nBragg's office fired back that Mitchell was \"playing political games in a murder investigation,\" calling it a \"slap in the face\" to the victims in both states.\n\nMitchell's office has said other jurisdictions can't legally claim a defendant until after their cases are completed in Arizona.\n\n\"This applies to every fugitive case when the defendant is found/arrested in Arizona,\" the office wrote in an email, citing a state law dealing with criminal prosecution . \"All pending criminal matters in Arizona are to be resolved first before extradition to the outside state occurs.\"\n\nBragg on Thursday countered that extraditions are ultimately decided governor-to governor . Arizona's governor, Katie Hobbs, is a Democrat. So, too, is New York's governor, Kathy Hochul.\n\n\"In some ways that underscores the political grandstanding,\" Bragg said. \"This is not the Maricopa County attorney's decision.\"\n\nMitchell's office didn't respond to requests seeking comment Thursday, but in a morning appearance on Fox , she doubled down on her comments about Bragg, saying she was \"putting the victims first\" by intending to deny extradition to New York.\n\n\"Let me be clear: my heart goes out to the next of kin of the victim in New York,\" Mitchell said on the show \"Fox and Friends.\" \"We're not saying that he will never be prosecuted in New York for what he did, but we're saying we're going first.\"\n\n\"We have two very violent crimes here,\" Mitchell added. \"We have two women that were stabbed, and he is facing a lengthy mandatory prison sentence here.\"\n\nAlissa Heydari, director of the Vanderbilt Project on Prosecution Policy at the university's law school in Nashville, Tennessee, said it's virtually unheard of for a prosecutor to refuse an extradition request solely because of their counterpart's prosecutorial policies.\n\nJustin Murray, co-director of the Criminal Justice Institute at the New York Law School, dismissed Mitchell's rhetoric as political grandstanding.\n\nBragg's policies dealing with lower level crimes, he stressed, don't have any bearing on the treatment of suspects charged with murder.\n\n\"This accusation has no foundation whatsoever: while Bragg's office sometimes shows leniency in misdemeanor and lesser felony cases, his office continues to vigorously prosecute violent felonies and, especially, homicides,\" Murray wrote in an email.\n\nTypically, the two jurisdictions work it out amongst themselves, said Alafair Burke, a professor at Hofstra Law in Hempstead, New York.\n\n\"This isn't unprecedented. Serial killers have been caught, leaving homicide charges in multiple states,\" she explained in an email. \"The norm is for prosecutors to talk it out together and figure out a reasonable strategy for sequencing the cases.\"\n\nBragg is no stranger to politically-charged, extradition dust-ups.\n\nLast year, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he wouldn't cooperate with any request by Bragg's office to extradite Trump, a resident of the Sunshine State, as he faced possible indictment on the hush-money charges.\n\nLike Mitchell, the one-time presidential hopeful who ended his campaign last month also cited Bragg's prosecutorial policies, saying the Democrat \"consistently bent the law to downgrade felonies and to excuse criminal misconduct. Yet, now he is stretching the law to target a political opponent.\"\n\nIt all proved moot, though, as Trump returned to his native New York of his own accord to answer to the charges.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Alvin Bragg Claims Victory as Jim Jordan Seethes About YouTube Gun Vids\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\nJim Jordan (R-OH) has made himself the Republican gadfly attempting to sting Alvin Bragg , the Manhattan D.A. who has secured the first, and so far only, conviction of former president Donald Trump .\n\nBut now the biter appears to have been bitten-by none other than Bragg. Bragg's office is taking credit for being part of efforts to have YouTube restrict content that shows people how to build firearms or make illegal modifications that allow them to rapidly fire ammunition on a fully automatic setting, confirming an angry claim made by Jordan.\n\nLast week, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee sent the site's parent company a letter demanding to know the story behind YouTube's recent decision to block videos that provide such content.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJordan's letter is a legal request for Alphabet's communications regarding its \"interactions with the executive branch and other entities regarding changes to its firearms content policy.\" It also called out Bragg by name, given that the prominent prosecutor publicly pressured YouTube in April over his concerns about the proliferation of how-to videos of \"ghost guns,\" homemade firearms that aren't stamped with a serial number and are virtually untraceable.\n\nBut in the wake of that letter, Bragg's office is actually doing something of a victory lap.\n\n\"The office stands by any efforts made to encourage companies to act responsibly and prevent children from accessing tutorials to manufacture dangerous guns that can be used in violent crimes,\" a spokeswoman told The Daily Beast.\n\nYouTube did not respond to questions about whether Bragg's public pressure campaign was the deciding factor in its decision to finally clamp down on gun videos. However, in reality, Bragg wasn't the only one.\n\nIn 2021, the policy group Everytown for Gun Safety called on YouTube to take down videos that serve as detailed step-by-step instructional manuals on how to build unserialized pistol and rifle frames. Everytown warned the company that this trend \"allows potentially dangerous or prohibited individuals to manufacture and own untraceable weapons without serial numbers or background checks.\" There's even a danger to experienced firearms enthusiasts who otherwise pose no harm to the public, given that 3D-printed guns are sometimes made of plastic that can't withstand the explosion of a fired round inside the chamber.\n\nThe next year, five Democratic senators pleaded for YouTube to remove ghost gun videos as well, noting how \"this content is a clear and direct violation of YouTube's existing community guidelines on firearms.\"\n\nAnd in 2023, the Tech Transparency Project, which is funded by several social advocacy groups, released a study showing how YouTube's video recommendation algorithms steer preteen and teenage gamers toward content about real life shootings and weapons-despite company assurances that its engineers \"made delivering responsible recommendations\" their \"top priority.\"\n\nViewed in that light, Bragg's letter to YouTube in April requesting to meet face-to-face with YouTube representatives was merely the latest entreaty asking the company to abide by its own rules.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) speaks during a campaign rally hosted by Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump at the Forum River Center in Rome, Georgia, U.S. March 9, 2024.\n\nBut to Rep. Jordan, who sees conspiracies everywhere he looks, it's all part of some underhanded leftist coercion scheme-as opposed to the desperate attempts of policymakers who are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Any politician who wants to zero-in on gun violence is essentially prohibited from trying to cut off the flow of weapons. For decades, Democrats haven't made any headway with Republicans, who won't agree to any kind of new gun restrictions whatsoever. And they can't even fully utilize the Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives (ATF) law enforcement agency, which remains critically underfunded and just had the conservative-leaning Supreme Court overturn the Trump-era ban on bump stocks-the easily configured attachable gear that uses a fired weapon's recoil to keep it jiggling in place to rapidly pull the trigger faster than anyone could naturally, essentially making it shoot like a sloppy machine gun.\n\nIn his letter, Jordan claimed that \"YouTube has censored First Amendment-protected speech as a result of government agencies' requests and demands in the past.\" He went on to write that \"these revelations raise serious concerns about whether and to what extent the executive branch is working with third parties and other intermediaries to coerce and/or collude with YouTube to censor lawful speech regarding the Second Amendment and firearms.\"\n\nHowever, Jordan couldn't resist turning the letter into yet another partisan screed that somehow connected guns on YouTube to his fervent love of MAGA. In his letter to the company, Jordan wrote that Bragg \"hired the third highest-ranking Department of Justice official to assist in his partisan prosecution of President Trump,\" alluding to the fact that Bragg brought a prosecutor onboard to help develop the criminal case against Trump, which ended with a trial in which jurors concluded the former president committed 34 felonies.\n\nHowever, it isn't clear that YouTube is going very far at all with its new restrictions. Although the company claimed it would no longer allow videos that \"provide instructions on manufacturing\" things like ammunition, many videos are still online. Popular videos still show how to assemble a kit for making ammunition at home, a popular option for budget-conscious firearms enthusiasts who'd rather avoid the high prices of professionally manufactured hunting ammo. Others run through the basics , with detailed looks at how to operate machinery in a safe and clean manner. Taking these down would arguably endanger otherwise responsible gun owners who merely want more control over their own ammunition supply; for example, competition shooters and hunters sometimes prefer \"hotter\" loads that exceed the power of most factory-made cartridges.\n\nThen again, YouTube has yet to eliminate the hundreds of videos that explain how to use milling machinery to professionally turn a hunk of metal into the functional part of a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle. An \"80 percent lower,\" as it's called, is essentially a metal piece that is four-fifths complete-an item that's easily purchased online without any government paperwork. As of Monday afternoon, typing in \"80 percent\" in YouTube's search bar immediately triggers the algorithm to recommend \"80 percent lower milling instructions.\" The list of results is virtually endless.\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\njose.pagliery@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Alvin Bragg's Case Against Trump Is Stronger Than You Think\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump just can't shake Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg off him. While Trump is on the verge of successfully delaying his federal criminal prosecutions until well into the red zone of the 2024 election , or even after the election, the New York state election interference trial is now scheduled to start on March 25. The case is a strong one and will have excellent jury appeal-especially to a jury drawn from a savvy and mostly liberal Manhattan jury pool. Here's why so much of the criticism about Bragg's prosecution lacks merit.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney has brought 34 felony counts against Trump for falsifying business records to cover up the fact he made \"hush money\" payments to actress Stormy Daniels to try to stop her from going public with their affair-this on the heels of Trump's well-publicized comments to Access Hollywood where he bragged about grabbing women by their genitals and how he sought to come onto a married woman.\n\nThe charges of falsifying business record are felonies, rather than misdemeanors, because they are alleged to have been done to cover up another crime-namely, election interference . The prosecution theory is that Trump was desperate to keep Daniels quiet because her revealing the affair-in conjunction with the Access Hollywood tape-would hurt Trump's chances in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMisplaced criticism of Bragg's case coalesces around two areas of supposed weakness: legal arguments that the case should be removed or that it's preempted by federal law and weak evidence in the form of witnesses former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and Daniels.\n\nTrump's arguments for removal to federal court revolve around his convoluted and internally contradictory claim that the case should only be heard in federal court because he was acting as a federal officer and/or that the federal court needs to assert jurisdiction to protect him against a politically motivated prosecution .\n\nTrump's argument that he is an officer of the United States clash with his own argument that he is not an officer of the United States and therefore cannot be disqualified from the Presidency under the Disqualification Clause of the 14 th Amendment because that provision applies only to officers of the United States.\n\nIt's worth noting that Trump co-defendants failed at their attempts to remove their Georgia election interference cases brought by Fani Willis , which may have caused Trump to give up his own attempt to remove that case based on the federal officer theory . Trump's arguments for removal to federal court were rejected by the federal court which found that that he was an officer of the United States and that his alleged actions were not official acts of a president.\n\nTrump's argument for preemption fared no better. The preemption argument rests upon Trump's reasoning that Bragg's reliance upon a violation of federal election law as the crime being covered up meant that federal election laws \"preempted\" any state charges. That argument also was rejected by the court for the simple reason that federal election law does not preempt New York state criminal violations.\n\nNaturally we can expect Trump, his supporters, as well as commentators anxious to promote themselves by taking contrarian positions, will continue to endorse these supposed weaknesses in the case. But here's what is important to remember: those arguments are all moot for now until and if Trump is convicted. If he is convicted, then he may again raise them on appeal but until then any regurgitation of the criticisms are just wasted breath. The case is going to trial and criticisms of the prosecution's legal theories now have zero relevance.\n\nAdult-film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, speaks as she departs federal court in Manhattan.\n\nThe \"weak evidence\" criticisms also will likely be shown up as uninformed during the trial. It's become a cliché in media to disparage Cohen as a flawed witness due to his convictions and loquacious nature. But those views ignore the fact that cooperating witnesses with prior convictions and other \"baggage\" are used every day by prosecutors across the country and the Manhattan DA's office is hardly relying solely on Cohen.\n\nRather-like so many of the white-collar cases that the office is known for (and many of the far more complex than this one)-the spine of the case is in the paper trial of the money, i.e., Bragg will be bringing the receipts to trial and its those \"receipts\" that Cohen will be corroborating through his testimony. He has been remarkably consistent about the payments to Stormy Daniels throughout the years. Moreover, in a remarkable poke in the eye to critics of Cohen's credibility, Judge Arthur Engoron specifically stated that \"Michael Cohen told the truth\" in Engoron's opinion finding Trump liable for fraud to the tune of over $350 million dollars.\n\nCriticizing the case because it involves money paid to Daniels is not only weak but also smacks of misogyny. Dismissing Daniels' narrative by reducing her to the category of \"porn star\" is understandable when coming from Trump-a man found liable for rape-but inexcusable when repeated as a supposed criticism of the case. Sex is always an appealing angle whether in commercials, true crime or the porn industry, but the fact that a witness in court works in a sex-related industry or even the sex trade has no place in assessing their credibility.\n\nAs a former sex crimes prosecutor who faced the challenges of prosecuting sexual abuse committed against women and children who were often victims of the sex trade industry, I know firsthand that credibility has nothing to do with what you do for a living or how you may have been sexually exploited or abused. As a trial lawyer, I'll take the credibility and jury appeal of Daniels over the credibility of Trump as a witness any day of the week.\n\nThe Daniels story is the strongest aspect of Alvin Bragg's case. Why? Because it will be very easy for a jury to understand that Trump wanted to conceal his affair with an actress known for starring in adult films at a time he was worried about his voter appeal to women. Really, it's one of the oldest stories in the world: a rich man wanted to buy silence. The jury will get that.\n\nShan Wu is a former federal prosecutor who served as counsel to Attorney General Janet Reno.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Republicans Have Met The Enemy and His Name Is Alvin Bragg\n\nAs a Manhattan grand jury works through a potential indictment against former President Donald Trump, Republicans are figuring out who to blame if charges are brought against their perpetual party leader.\n\nPredictably, Republicans won't blame Trump, even though he's admitted to authorizing hush money payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels after he had an affair with her in 2006. And it doesn't appear as if Republicans will blame Michael Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer who helped concoct the hush-money scheme in 2016. And, for the most part, it won't be President Joe Biden, either, as he's staying away from this as far as possible.\n\nInstead, Republicans appear apt to blame everything on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who's overseeing the case against Trump. He's their bogeyman.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith a lingering back-and-forth on whether Bragg would or should testify before Congress about the case, Republican lawmakers aren't growing more cordial. They're weighing their options-and floating subpoenas-marking an unprecedented consideration for Congress to interfere in a local investigation.\n\nBut of course, they say it's not without reason.\n\n\"It is pretty clearly a wrongful persecution of a free American citizen who happens to be the former president of the United States,\" Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA), who's already endorsed Trump's 2024 bid, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday.\n\n\"Because of those circumstances, I think it's appropriate for Congress to inquire into what drove that decision making process for Bragg,\" Higgins said.\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has already called for committees to probe Bragg's investigation. House Oversight Chair James Comer (R-KY), Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH), and Administration Chair Brian Steil (R-WI) have requested testimony and documents from Bragg, telling him in a letter that he is \"about to engage in an unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority.\"\n\nBragg has signaled he wouldn't comply with GOP attempts to haul him before Congress. Over the weekend, the trio suggested Bragg could be subpoenaed if he sticks to that.\n\n\"When he says he's not going to cooperate with Congress, unfortunately for Mr. Bragg, he doesn't have the luxury of determining whether or not he can comply with congressional requests, because he crossed over two levels of government, from the local level to the federal level, to try to prosecute something that clearly if there was a reason for prosecution, it should be done by the Department of Justice,\" Comer said on CNN Sunday.\n\nThroughout the halls of Congress, and particularly within the House Republican conference, those about Bragg have been growing. But lawmakers are still pondering how-and when-to strike.\n\nHiggins for instance says if Republicans do take action against Bragg, timing would be everything. He said lawmakers \"need to let the president's legal team function unencumbered from congressional inquiry at this time.\"\n\nThe congressman suggested that potentially subpoenaing Bragg \"would be an interesting conversation amongst my colleagues,\" but that \"the appropriate timing of something like that should include consideration whether or not that case is moving towards permanent closure, and allow that to happen.\"\n\nThen there's an entirely other end of Republican rhetoric, like that from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who's said \"it's time to arrest Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg for prosecutorial misconduct after hiding hundreds of pages of exculpatory evidence.\" Greene hasn't supplied evidence for those claims, but she has further insisted that Bragg is \"breaking the law and trying to incite civil unrest.\"\n\nWhile Greene is, as usual, furthest to the right on the issue, the standard GOP approach seems to be demanding that Bragg testify before Congress-noting that, if he doesn't cooperate, he should be subpoenaed.\n\nEarlier this year, House Republicans announced they would use their newfound majority to launch a number of broad investigations , including one into the \"weaponization\" of government. The Bragg-focus fits into their rhetoric, and would theoretically give the investigations a focus they've largely lacked.\n\nDemocrats say Bragg is being used as a sort of scapegoat for the GOP-and that Republicans are searching for someone to blame for Trump's apparent wrongdoings.\n\n\"I think it's a gross abuse of power by a congressional committee under the official authority of the House of Representatives to intervene in an ongoing criminal investigation in a local jurisdiction,\" said Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY), who served as lead counsel on the first impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\n\"Congress very clearly does not have jurisdiction over this nor is it appropriate for Congress to try to influence an ongoing investigation,\" Goldman added.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, said she expects Republicans would continue to defend Trump \"no matter what his problem was.\"\n\n\"It's gross honestly,\" she said of members targeting Bragg.\n\nOver in the Senate, some ardent Trump supporters think the Republican brouhaha over Bragg has its place. Republicans there are in the minority and don't have power to go after Bragg in committee. But they're cheering on House colleagues-even while having some doubts about what can be accomplished there, too.\n\n\"I think it's always useful to provide some oversight. So I know that-I understand the House is looking into it. That seems like a good thing. I don't know what their actual, you know, what control they have. They might just be able to surface some good information which could be helpful,\" said Sen. J.D. Vance, (R-OH), who's already endorsed Trump's 2024 bid.\n\nAsked if he'd support a subpoena for Bragg, Vance responded, \"He certainly has made some very questionable prosecutorial decisions. So I think him testifying before Congress would probably be a good thing.\"\n\nOthers like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who's also already issued support for Trump's 2024 bid, said he's going to leave any Bragg antics to the House.\n\n\"I'm not going to pursue that myself. But if they can establish some connection between what the federal government does and what he's doing, I think that'd be fine,\" Graham said.\n\nWhile Graham seems content to let House Republicans handle this one, Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) has openly supported McCarthy's call for a probe into Bragg's investigation.\n\nBragg's office, in a previous statement , said it is \"not appropriate for Congress to interfere with pending local investigations\" and that the inquiry by federal lawmakers \"serves only to hinder, disrupt and undermine the legitimate work of our dedicated prosecutors.\"\n\nTrump earlier this month posted on his beloved Truth Social that he expected to be arrested on March 21. But the week went by without his prophecy coming to fruition. This week, a new round of standby for an indictment began, before reports emerged that the jury assigned to Trump's case will soon be on a month-long hiatus. That could delay any indictment of the former president until late April at a minimum.\n\nJury breaks can be walked back-meaning Bragg could still force jurors to return to address a possible indictment sooner. But there is no inevitable deadline for a Trump indictment. Bragg, for most intents and purposes, has time.\n\nBut Trump's already gone on the offensive, bashing Bragg online and insisting the whole case is a hoax. In a Truth Social post last week, Trump said, \"It was all made up by a convicted nut job with zero credibility, who has been disputed by highly respected professionals at every turn. Bragg refuses to stop despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\"\n\n\"He is a Soros backed animal who just doesn't care about right or wrong no matter how many people are hurt,\" the former president added.\n\nTrump in another post also showed a side-by-side of him holding a baseball bat next to Bragg's head. The post was later deleted.\n\nAs the timeline for a possible indictment gets more unclear, Republicans are left with a longer window to weigh their options. Other Republicans seemed to hope their interference wouldn't be needed after all.\n\nRep. Chip Roy (R-TX), a staunch conservative and member of the Judiciary Committee, told The Daily Beast Wednesday evening that he's leaving decisions on what to do next on Bragg up to Jordan.\n\n\"But you know, [Bragg] seems like he's kind of, you know, maybe, I don't know, maybe backed off a little bit,\" Roy said.\n\n\"But we'll have to see,\" the congressman added while stepping into a car outside the Capitol. \"We'll see what he does.\"\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Judge Says Manhattan DA Can See Trump's Rude Rape Trial Deposition\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\nA federal judge on Thursday decided to give the Manhattan District Attorney exactly what he wants : a video copy of former President Donald Trump's damning testimony in an unrelated rape and defamation case that was decided earlier this year.\n\nFor months, DA Alvin Bragg Jr.'s prosecutors have been trying to get their hands on a taped deposition in which Trump actually said stars like him get away with sexual harassment \"unfortunately- or fortunately .\"\n\nAlthough that interview was part of the recent civil case in which Trump was ultimately found liable for sexually abusing the journalist E. Jean Carroll, Manhattan prosecutors have been trying to weaponize his deposition for their own upcoming criminal trial in March 2024-for lying on business records to cover up his sexual affairs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn state court documents, prosecutors reasoned that his history of insulting responses about sexual misconduct allegations is relevant to his alleged criminal scheme of paying off people to keep women silent to avoid public embarrassment.\n\nBut Trump's lawyers tried to block that move, arguing that particular evidence at his rape trial was actually meant to stay secret under a protective order. New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan asked the federal judge who oversaw the rape trial to weigh in.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan disagreed. On Thursday, he gave Carroll's lawyers permission to hand it over.\n\n\"Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP may comply with the People's trial subpoena,\" he wrote in a court order on Thursday.\n\nThe decision means prosecutors can get the tape, but it doesn't mean they can use it at trial-at least not yet. That decision will be up to Merchan, the state court judge overseeing the Manhattan DA's case, who will decide if and how prosecutors can present it to jurors at trial. Merchan will decide if Trump's comments about women and sexual relations are relevant to the criminal case about his false business records and sexual affair coverups.\n\nWhile the cases are entirely separate, the courtroom scrimmaging shows how the former president is drowning in so many legal headaches that they're starting to overlap. In a similar fashion, the Manhattan DA's long-running investigation benefited the New York Attorney General, who is currently suing Trump over the way he routinely inflated property values to lie to banks and tax collectors. Also, the House Jan. 6 Committee's expansive examination of Trump's role in the 2021 insurrection helped fuel the Department of Justice's indictment of Trump earlier this week.\n\nIt's unclear how exactly Manhattan prosecutors working on the fake business records case will use Trump's rape trial testimony, which shows him being unapologetic about sexual assault and resorting to misogynistic jabs at the lawyer questioning him.\n\nIn the video, Carroll's lawyer asked the former president about his previous gloating that he could grab women \"by the pussy.\" Roberta Kaplan asked whether Trump felt that celebrities could get away with it.\n\n\"Historically that's true with stars. If you look over the last million years, that's largely true, unfortunately- or fortunately ,\" he said.\n\nTrump later clarified that he considers himself a star.\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\njose.pagliery@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

That would include Trump being barred from speaking about his former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a motion filed Monday, prosecutors wrote that Trump's history of making nasty comments about rivals shows he'd likely do the same in this criminal trial. It added that Trump has already gone after Bragg and those under him publicly, claiming to be the victim of a politically charged prosecution that's unfairly singling him out.\n\n\"[Trump] has a long history of making public and inflammatory remarks about the participants in various judicial proceedings against him,\" the motion said. \"Those remarks, as well as the inevitable reactions they incite from [his] followers and allies, pose a significant and imminent threat to the orderly administration of this criminal proceeding and a substantial likelihood of causing material prejudice.\"\n\nThe motion specified that it's not requesting that Trump be blocked from speaking about Bragg-a move that suggests the district attorney isn't trying to silence Trump completely, but instead hopes to protect witnesses and those who work under him.\n\nNew York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan has yet to rule on the request, which specifically asks that Trump also be ordered not to speak publicly about any prospective jurors.\n\nMonday's motion acknowledged that it is requesting a gag order similar to orders approved in Trump's federal criminal trials.\n\nTrump stands accused of falsifying business records regarding alleged hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, that occurred before the 2016 election.

      "text": "Manhattan DA Insiders Worry the Trump Hush Money Case Is Weak Sauce\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\nThe indictment that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is currently seeking against former President Donald Trump-over his payment to silence a porn star about their sexual affair-is based on a crime that was so flimsy it was never viewed as a standalone criminal case, according to three attorneys who have worked on that investigation.\n\nThese insiders spoke to The Daily Beast on the condition of anonymity, because they are not authorized to discuss the ongoing criminal investigation.\n\nA grand jury may soon decide whether to indict Trump for faking business records and dodging campaign finance laws when he used his company-the Trump Organization-and his personal \"fixer\"-Michael Cohen-to quietly pay hush money to the adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep the revelation from derailing his 2016 presidential campaign. Journalists from around the globe are now staking out a courthouse in downtown New York City, awaiting the possible arrest of the former American president.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut that criminal probe is just a small slice of a much more expansive criminal investigation into Trump's lies to banks, insurance companies, and government agencies.\n\nBragg, who inherited the investigation from his predecessor, Cy Vance Jr., shut down the wider operation soon after entering the office-and only recently revived this narrow portion as a single case.\n\nHis decision to bring back what has been deemed the \"zombie\" case surprised several insiders who have been briefed on the various iterations of the Stormy Daniels case over the years.\n\n\"The Stormy case was the easiest, the most straightforward, but had the risk of being nothing more than a misdemeanor. The business fraud case had more heft, but was complex and sprawling, and much more difficult. There was never any discussion of breaking them apart,\" one source told The Daily Beast.\n\nWhat initially drew prosecutors to the case was the way the Trump Organization paid back Cohen in separate checks broken up over a year, engaged in a monthly cover-up using this private business while Trump was in the White House.\n\nBut New York County prosecutors never considered pursuing the hush money case by itself, because, for one thing, investigators on the DA's Trump team couldn't even agree whether Trump committed a serious crime.\n\nFaking business records is merely a misdemeanor in New York, and three sources said Vance wouldn't greenlight an indictment that would involve a historic law enforcement action against a former president-all to land Trump less than a year at the city's notoriously violent jail on Rikers Island.\n\nStill, they determined this particular criminal charge could be bumped up to a felony if business records were faked to commit or hide a separate crime-a fact prosecutors wrestled with for months. A recent tell-all memoir by an ex-prosecutor who previously led that team, Mark Pomerantz, goes into vivid detail explaining how he had to resort to building a \"creative legal theory\" to pursue the case.\n\nOne version entailed this local DA attaching the state charges to the federal crime; after all, the whole idea was that Trump had failed to properly log the hush money payment publicly in closely scrutinized reports filed to the Federal Election Commission. But chaining state-level business records charges to an alleged federal crime would open Pandora's Box, according to one source, because doing so would conspicuously highlight how this should have been a federal case instead.\n\nAnd that was quite the risk, because the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York had already chosen not to indict Trump.\n\nFederal prosecutors aggressively went after Cohen and even categorized Trump as \"Individual-1,\" but they stopped there. The feds gave immunity deals to get incriminating information from the Trump Organization chief financial officer who cut the checks, Allen Weisselberg, and the National Enquirer media executive who helped broker the hush money deal, David Pecker.\n\n\"The hush money case had no exact state charge. It should have been the feds,\" said a second person who spoke to The Daily Beast.\n\nAssistant district attorneys and their outside advisers were also unclear about whether this novel approach would even hold up in court.\n\n\"DANY would have to argue that the intent to commit or conceal a federal crime had converted the falsification of the records into a felony. No appellate court in New York had ever upheld (or rejected) this interpretation of the law,\" Pomerantz wrote in People vs. Donald Trump: An Inside Account . \"There was a big risk that felony charges would be dismissed before a jury could even consider them.\"\n\nThe DA team's second version was even more of a stretch. This one involved attaching the business records charge to a bonkers underlying crime: viewing Stormy Daniels' attempts to sell her story on the eve of the 2016 election as her trying to extort Trump. In his book, Pomerantz acknowledges this is \"a somewhat awkward construction\" that would act as if \"Trump was, in effect, a blackmail victim.\" That would turn Trump's payment into money laundering, he figured. But the \"soft-core extortion\" theory, as Pomerantz called it, was hoisted on its own petard.\n\n\"Legally, the hush money payment had not become dirty money until [Stormy Daniels] received it, so neither Cohen nor Trump had committed money laundering by sending it,\" Pomerantz wrote in his book.\n\nThe book says Vance twice commissioned outside lawyers-a rare step that's nearly unheard of for such a law enforcement office-to research the matter. Vance decided against any criminal charges in late 2019 and revisited the decision in early 2021, but he ultimately decided against it.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin, though, seemed to come when Bragg inherited the case at the start of 2022. In his book, Pomerantz recalls a Feb. 9, 2022, meeting during which Bragg said he \"could not see a world\" in which he would use Cohen as a witness to indict Trump. On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the office said that four people who were present at the meeting disputed that recollection.\n\nJoe Tacopina, one of Trump's defense lawyers on this case, told The Daily Beast he wasn't surprised that lawyers who have long been close to this investigation have their reservations about making the Stormy Daniels matter a standalone criminal case. \"I've spoken to two FEC chairmen. It's not even close. I don't understand how they could do this. It'll eventually get tossed aside,\" Tacopina said.\n\nHowever, skeptics could view Bragg's recent decision to hire a top attorney at the Department of Justice as a way to overcome concerns that the state case can't hold up on its own-or is somehow weakened by the DOJ's decision to not charge Trump even after leaving office. Matt Colangelo, who left an extremely prominent position as the nation's acting associate attorney general, previously worked on fraud investigations against Trump at the New York Attorney General's Office.\n\nAnd Bragg has apparently come around on Cohen, making him a key witness before the grand jury that's poised to indict Trump any day now.\n\nStill, these three sources cheered on Bragg for taking on the case-and noted that this could merely be the first iteration in a larger investigation.\n\nKaren Friedman Agnifilo, who served as the previous DA's top deputy for years, said the Stormy Daniels case merits more serious consideration than it has received so far.\n\n\"I disagree with people who think this is not an important case. This was Donald Trump's first attempt at interfering in an election. He did it in 2016 and again in 2020. In terms of what it represents, I think it's significant,\" she said, noting that the DA was smart to move on this first because the statute of limitations might run out in May.\n\n\"The 11 payments to Michael Cohen-then recording false information in the business records-were done by a sitting president who was in the Oval Office at the time. I don't know how anyone could view this as not serious,\" she said.\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\njose.pagliery@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "NYC Prosecutors Had to Prove 'Trump Was Not Legally Insane'\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\nAs they prepared to potentially indict Donald Trump for relentlessly lying to banks about his wealth, Manhattan prosecutors were forced to consider whether the former American president was a criminal mastermind or had just lost his mind, according to a new tell-all memoir by a member of that team.\n\nIn his book about how that investigation fell apart, former special assistant district attorney Mark Pomerantz explained the kind of hurdles his team had to overcome to build a historic criminal case against the Teflon Don.\n\n\"To rebut the claim that Trump believed his own 'hype'... we would have to show, and stress, that Donald Trump was not legally insane,\" Pomerantz wrote.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Was Donald Trump suffering from some sort of mental condition that made it impossible for him to distinguish between fact and fiction?\" he asked, noting that a group of high-powered lawyers advising the DA's office \"discussed whether Trump had been spewing bullshit for so many years about so many things that he could no longer process the difference between bullshit and reality.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast on Friday received an advance copy of People vs. Donald Trump: An Inside Account , which hits store shelves next Tuesday.\n\nThe book has already managed to piss off Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg Jr., who claims it could hurt the investigation he paused but just revived-as well as Trump, who is threatening to sue for defamation.\n\nPomerantz was recruited in December 2020 by Bragg's predecessor, Cy Vance Jr., to come out of semi-retirement and lead the investigation. But he and another top lawyer quit in protest when Bragg, who inherited the case, wouldn't pull the trigger in February 2021.\n\nPomerantz: We Had a Case, Not a Slam Dunk\n\nThe book offers a rare look inside the way prosecutors build a criminal case, detailing how investigators collected evidence, interviewed witnesses, and disagreed over how exactly to proceed with what could be the most significant undertaking by a local DA in American history. Pomerantz is convinced that the evidence proves Trump lied on financial documents, and he lays out the various criminal charges his team was ready to slap on the disgraced former president.\n\nBut the book also shows this case wasn't easy-despite the commonly held view that Trump should be indicted already.\n\n\"We had a case, but it was not without issues, and certainly could not be described as a slam dunk,\" Pomerantz wrote.\n\nOne of the most surprising revelations is that junior prosecutors on the team had serious reservations about their ability to successfully prosecute Trump in court-even though, according to Pomerantz, no one thought he was innocent. Although the evidence clearly showed that the Trump Organization routinely lied to banks about the head honcho's wealth, in some cases simply multiplying fanciful numbers to hyperinflate the value of golf courses and buildings, it was harder to prove that Trump did it with the intent to defraud. The book describes how overworked prosecutors under pressure to wrap up the investigation before the scheduled political departure of Vance, the DA who greenlit the investigation, at one point \"had a mini-revolt.\"\n\n\"The team thought it would be irresponsible to try to indict the case before the end of the year,\" Pomerantz wrote, adding later that \"many of the lawyers were relentlessly negative, dwelling on all the difficulties and issues with the case and seemingly refusing to acknowledge the positives.\"\n\nSome team members referred to the case as \"weak,\" while another cited \"many fatal flaws.\" Some met privately with Bragg to tell him about their reservations. At Zoom meetings, a few team members remained quiet and stone-faced, making Pomerantz feel as if he alone was charging forward.\n\n\"It was frustrating to feel like we were about to march into battle and were strapping on our guns and equipment, but when we looked around at the rest of the platoon we saw a lot of conscientious objectors,\" Pomerantz wrote.\n\nThe Michael Cohen Factor\n\nAnother surprising twist was that the entire case unraveled in part because of the DA's reliance on witness testimony from Michael Cohen-the lawyer who paid porn star Stormy Daniels hush money to keep her quiet about her sexual affair with Trump, got convicted for that and perjury, got disbarred, and has spent much of his time trashing the boss that betrayed him. The head of the office's major economic crimes bureau, Julieta Lozano, refused to believe a word out of Cohen's mouth-and eventually left the team.\n\nIt only got worse when New York Attorney General Letitia James filed public documents detailing the extent of the fraud at the Trump Organization, only to have Cohen do several interviews crediting himself as a key witness. It reached a breaking point at a meeting on Feb. 9, 2022, when Bragg \"commented that he 'could not see a world' in which he would indict Trump and call Michael Cohen as a prosecution witness,\" Pomerantz wrote.\n\nThe former prosecutor laments the Cohen situation, writing that \"his relentless focus on his own importance had not been helpful to his credibility. Unfortunately, he had studied the art of self-aggrandizement at the feet of the master. Cohen's penchant for publicity, exaggeration, and grandiose statements had played into the hands of people who distrusted him.\"\n\nWhile the book was expected to offer a damning portrayal of Bragg's mishandling of the case, it actually does some of the opposite by explaining how the top prosecutor just couldn't be convinced that the case was strong enough. The real break appears to be Pomerantz's insistence that it's better to try and fail than simply give up.\n\nHowever, he still takes stabs at the new DA.\n\nTaking on Alvin Bragg\n\nIn one scene, Pomerantz describes how Bragg totally bungled his first big briefing about the most consequential case his office might ever bring.\n\n\"Alvin came into the meeting late, spent much of the time looking at his phone, and then left early, saying he just wanted to see the important documents, as though the whole sprawling case could be reduced to a collection of a few crucial documents, which made no sense,\" Pomerantz wrote. \"This was the key meeting for the new district attorney to 'vet' our incipient case against the former president!\"\n\nThe DA's office shot back with this statement, attributed to Bragg: \"After closely reviewing all the evidence from Mr. Pomerantz's investigation, I came to the same conclusion as several senior prosecutors involved in the case, and also those I brought on: more work was needed. Put another way, Mr. Pomerantz's plane wasn't ready for takeoff.\"\n\nAnd the DA took a personal shot at the author, saying, \"Pomerantz decided to quit a year ago and sign a book deal.\"\n\nBragg's office also pointed to a critical statement made on Friday by the state's association of district attorneys, which expressed \"strong concerns\" about the memoir.\n\nApparently, the prosecutors on the previous iteration of the DA's team understood the gravity of the investigation, with one interoffice memo warning about how a prosecution \"might trigger civil unrest, or... public tumult,\" and even threaten the lives of the prosecutors themselves.\n\nInvestigators even considered bringing a lesser charge against Trump that seemed easier to prove but would only result in a dud.\n\n\"I thought a misdemeanor case would be a 'chickenshit' maneuver, because the misdemeanor charges would undervalue the seriousness of the misconduct we had been investigating,\" Pomerantz wrote.\n\nIn the end, Pomerantz and Dunne settled on what they considered the best angle to prosecute Trump: tie it all together to show that Trump acted \"with the intent\" to commit crimes because the trail of fake documents was so unbearably long.\n\n\"The right way to proceed, we thought, was to bring felony charges based on the full panoply of false business records that Trump had helped to generate: the phony documents relating to the hush money payment and Michael Cohen's reimbursement, the false financial statements, the false accounting spreadsheets that were created to support the financial statements, and so forth,\" Pomerantz wrote.\n\nAll told, the book describes what seems like a zealous special prosecutor steeped in complex financial records who couldn't get colleagues on board with a moonshot case-and a change of leadership that sealed its fate.\n\nThe question now is whether Bragg is finally ready to do it. After much prodding by Pomerantz to hire a bigshot federal prosecutor to takedown Trump back in early 2022, Bragg finally did it recently when he recruited Matthew Colangelo, a top Justice Department official who previously helped take down the former president's law-breaking Trump Foundation charity.\n\nAnd as Bragg said last month, \"We now move on to the next chapter .\"\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\njose.pagliery@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Republicans have further whetted Trump's appetite for legal retribution by pushing the storyline that the Biden administration has \"weaponised\" the US justice department to deliberately persecute the ex-president.\n\n\"Of course [Bragg] should be - and will be - jailed,\" Bannon told Axios .\n\nHe said Bragg could be prosecuted under the US constitution's 14th amendment, which guarantees equal rights, the fourth amendment, which outlaws unreasonable searches and government property seizures, and \"scores of other laws\".\n\nBannon compared the aggressive tactics to be pursued by a putative second Trump administration to \"the evolution of any war\" the US has fought in its history, including the war of independence, the civil war and the first and second world wars.\n\n\"They only get nastier over time,\" he said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denounced Bragg for pursuing the state case that found the ex-president guilty last week on all 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to conceal the payment of hush money to an adult film actor, Stormy Daniels, to help him win the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe district attorney has yet to say whether he will call for a jail term in advance of a sentencing hearing scheduled for 11 July. That date is notably four days before the Republican national convention, where Trump is due to be formally adopted as the party's presidential candidate.\n\nBannon's comments on Bragg were echoed more broadly by Trump himself on Tuesday in an interview with the rightwing Newsmax channel in which he accused his political opponents of forcing him to take revenge by unjustly prosecuting him.\n\n\"It's a terrible, terrible path that they're leading us to, and it's very possible that it's going to have to happen to them,\" Trump said, referring to last week's conviction, which he has falsely claimed was ordered by Biden. \"Does that mean the next president does it to them? That's really the question.\"\n\nTrump is known to be hunting for a Maga (Make America great again) committed loyalist to serve in his administration as attorney general if he triumphs in November. He presumably hopes to avoid a repeat of his first appointee to the post, Jeff Sessions, whom he fired for recusing himself from an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\n\"If you get the right person, it's like magic,\" he told Fox & Friends in an interview last weekend. \"It's like in real estate: you know, you put a good super in a building, the building runs well. You put a bad one in, it doesn't.\"\n\nSign up to Trump on Trial\n\nStay up to date on all of Donald Trump's trials.

He accused GOP congressional members of peddling conspiracy theories and pushing false narratives by alleging that the justice department had directed the prosecution of Trump that led to last week's felony conviction.\n\nBragg, an elected New York state official, does not work under the authority of the justice department, which is a federal agency."

      "text": "Who is Alvin Bragg, the DA who got a grand jury to indict Donald Trump?\n\nIn getting a grand jury to charge Trump over his hush money payment to Stormy Daniels in 2016, the Democrat has carved himself a place in history\n\nAlvin Bragg's official biography describes him as a \"son of Harlem\" who became Manhattan district attorney after \"a lifetime of hard work, courage and demanding justice\".\n\nIn obtaining a grand jury indictment against Donald Trump over his hush money payment to Stormy Daniels in 2016, the Democrat has now carved himself a place in history, as the man behind the first vote to criminally indict a former president.\n\nNow 49, Bragg is a Harvard-educated former assistant New York state attorney general and assistant US attorney in the southern district of New York.\n\nIn 2021, he was elected as the first Black Manhattan DA and only the fourth permanent occupant of the post in 80 years.\n\nIn office, his biography says, he has focused on \"protecting everyday New Yorkers from abuses by the powerful, and correcting past injustices by vacating wrongful convictions\".\n\nThe biography also highlights the creation of a Special Victims Division, handling \"extremely sensitive cases in a trauma informed and survivor centered manner\", and an expansion of a Hate Crimes Unit.\n\nBragg has prominent critics, however. Chief among them is Mark Pomerantz, an experienced New York prosecutor who joined an investigation of Trump begun by Bragg's predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr, but resigned in February 2022.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Pomerantz said Trump was \"guilty of numerous felony violations\" in his business and political affairs and called Bragg's initial decision to stop pursuing an indictment \"a grave failure of justice\". The two men exchanged shots in the press.\n\nLast month, Pomerantz published a book in which he described efforts to make Trump's hush money payment to Stormy Daniels a viable path to prosecution.\n\nPomerantz called the Daniels payment a \" zombie case \" because it would not die. A month later, it emerged that Bragg was homing in on a Trump indictment in the very same case.\n\nBragg's official biography now highlights a six-count indictment against the Trump ally Steve Bannon for fraud, and the conviction of Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization chief financial officer, for tax evasion.\n\nBragg has also faced criticism for his approach to crime, not least from the New York City police commissioner, Keechant Sewell.\n\nIn early 2022, Bragg issued a memo instructing prosecutors to avoid seeking prison time for all but the most serious crimes. In a city where crime is always a key political issue , and in an atmosphere of heightened concern fueled by the disruptions of the Covid pandemic, Sewell told NYPD officers she was \"severely troubled\".\n\nBragg said the memo had been misunderstood. After a meeting, he and Sewell agreed that \"police and prosecutors would weigh the individual facts and circumstances of each case with a view toward justice and work together to keep New Yorkers safe\".\n\nLater in 2022, the issue of crime and punishment in New York flared forth again. After a Hispanic Harlem shopkeeper stabbed a Black assailant, Bragg charged the shopkeeper with second-degree murder. After an outcry , the charges were dropped ."

It prevented the former president from attacking witnesses, court staff, jurors and relatives of Judge Juan Merchan, who oversaw the trial.\n\nTrump's legal team has unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the gag order, arguing that it prevents voters from being able to hear from a presidential candidate.\n\nBut Bragg and others have said that part of the order should remain for jurors, prosecutors, their staff and their families, given a high number of threats, the New York Times reported .\n\nBragg specifically has faced an onslaught of death threats and harassment since Trump was found guilty. He has received more than 100 threatening emails via his campaign website, the New York Daily News reported , citing a source who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nSeveral of the abusive messages obtained by the Daily News use racial slurs including the N-word, \"gorilla\" and \"primate\", it reported, adding that Bragg also faced death threats and racial abuse throughout the seven-week trial.\n\nIn one instance, a package was sent to Bragg from Portland, Oregon, containing a picture of Bragg alongside a noose, with the caption: \"I am past the point of just wanting them in prison.\"\n\nThe New York police department has logged 56 \"actionable threats\" since the start of April against Bragg, his employees, and his family, the Times reported.\n\nA representative for Bragg did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nTrump has aimed his own ire at Bragg even before the hush-money trial began. Last April, he reportedly told a close circle of advisers that he planned to escalate political attacks against the DA after a grand jury voted to indict him.\n\nTrump also accused Bragg of being a psychopath, and alleged that the hush-money trial was a political move.\n\nBut much of the hate towards Bragg came after Trump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the New York state hush-money trial - making the presumptive Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election the first former president to be convicted of a criminal offense.\n\nSince the trial, supporters of Trump have urged the former president to jail Bragg if he wins back the White House in November. Steve Bannon, a former strategist in Trump's White House, has led the charge.\n\n\"Of course [Bragg] should be - and will be - jailed,\" Bannon told Axios , arguing that Bragg would be prosecuted under the US constitution's 14th and fourth amendment.\n\nOther Republican-led states have promised to prosecute Bragg for his role in the Trump hush-money trial. The Missouri attorney general, Andrew Bailey, declared on Thursday that he would be filing a lawsuit against the state of New York for its \"direct attack on our democratic process through unconstitutional lawfare against President Trump\"."

      "text": "Trump's conviction on all 34 counts is a full-blown victory for DA Alvin Bragg\n\nProsecutors took a case that was about boring paper crimes and successfully turned it into one that was about something simple: lying\n\nDonald Trump's conviction on all 34 felony counts on Thursday marked a full-blown victory for Alvin Bragg, the first-term Manhattan district attorney who was criticized for using a novel legal strategy to bring a historic criminal case against a former president.\n\nThe decision to convict Trump on all 34 counts is significant. Jurors could have acquitted him on some and convicted on others. But the fact that they went all-in, and relatively quickly, suggests they believed the wider story prosecutors told at trial. It is a full-throated win for Bragg and the worst possible outcome for Trump.\n\nFalsifying business records is a misdemeanor in New York state. In order to elevate it to a felony, Bragg had to show that Trump did it with the intent to commit another crime. Bragg argued that Trump had falsified the records with the intent to violate a New York state law that says it is illegal for \"any two or more persons who conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means\".\n\nThe statute has rarely been used to prosecute . The prosecutors offered a range of what the \"unlawful means\" were, including violating campaign finance and tax laws. Some legal observers said Bragg was stretching to bring the case. A little over a month ago, one law professor called the case a \"historic mistake\" .\n\nBut over the last several weeks, prosecutors transformed a complex legal case into a carefully constructed narrative that was easy for jurors to understand. They took a case that was fundamentally about boring paper crimes and turned it into one that was about something simple: lying.\n\nAt every step, prosecutors were focused on keeping jurors attention on their bigger picture. Their first witness, former American Media chief executive David Pecker, led them into the jaw-droppingly seedy world of tabloid journalism, laying out how he would pay for stories and then not publish them for the benefit of friends like Trump. It established the world that Trump operated in and showed the lengths he was willing to go to in order to keep bad stories from coming to light.\n\nPecker also delivered one of the most devastating moments in the trial against Trump. After several days of revealing how he bought and killed stories on behalf of Trump, he ended his testimony by saying how much he continued to admire Trump. It was a critical moment that showed how loyal those around Trump are, and severely undercut Trump's claim that everyone was out to get him.\n\nPecker also established a critical link between Trump and his fixer Michael Cohen, telling jurors, in a memorable line, that \"every time we went out for lunch I always paid. He [Cohen] never paid. I didn't think he had authorization to pay without Trump's approval.\"\n\nProsecutors constructed their case carefully, sprinkling in the duller but necessary information - bank records, checks and invoices - in between scintillating testimony. Even though those documents were the key pieces of evidence of Trump's crimes, prosecutors made sure the jurors knew how they fit into the larger piece of the puzzle.\n\nStormy Daniels was a key witness who helped the prosecutors do this. Even though the payment to her was not illegal, and even though she never spoke to Michael Cohen ahead of the 2016 election, her sparkling and, at times, lurid testimony helped raise the stakes for the jury. By giving the dramatic details of her affair with Trump - from whether he wore a condom to the sex position they used - she reminded jurors of why Trump would want to go to such lengths to conceal the story.\n\nProsecutors also masterfully set up Cohen's testimony for the jury. Cohen, a former Trump fixer, was a problematic witness for the prosecution because of his prior convictions for perjury and his known penchant for lying. Cohen himself admitted on the stand that he was \"obsessed\" with Trump.\n\nSign up to Trump on Trial\n\nStay up to date on all of Donald Trump's trials. Guardian staff will send news and updates directly to your inbox.\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nBut from the beginning of the trial, prosecutors prepared jurors to brace themselves for Cohen. Pecker and Keith Davidson, Stormy Daniels' lawyer, corroborated much of what Cohen would later say on the stand. The fact that Cohen was merely confirming what two witnesses before him had said made him seem more credible.\n\nPecker and Davidson also both testified extensively about what a jerk Cohen was, portraying him as someone who would do anything for Trump - and who was also extremely annoying. And they made no effort to conceal why Cohen would be upset with Trump. After Trump failed to take Cohen to Washington, Davidson testified that he thought Cohen was going to kill himself.\n\nSo when Trump's lawyers tried to do everything they could to attack Cohen's credibility, it fell flat.\n\nWhile prosecutors took pains to tell a precise story, Trump's team did not make a concerted effort to tell a counter-narrative. They sought to undermine the credibility of witnesses, specifically Daniels and Cohen, but many of the details they testified about were corroborated by others. They barely put on a defense case. Instead, it seemed they were hoping they could generate at least enough doubt for one juror to vote against a conviction, triggering a mistrial.\n\nThat appears to have been a severe miscalculation. In the end, it took only 12 hours for the jury of 12 Manhattanites to reach their unanimous verdict of guilty on all 34 counts."

And that's why, in 10 days, president Trump will assume the office of POTUS.\n\nTrump, Steinglass noted, \"threatened to retaliate\" against the court and prosecution.\n\n\"Such threats are designed to have a chilling affect to intimidate those who have a responsibility to enforce our laws in the hopes that they will ignore the defendant's transgressions, because they fear he is simply too powerful to be subjected to the same rule of law as the rest of us,\" the prosecutor said.\n\n\"This defendant has caused enduring damage to public perception of the criminal justice system and has placed officers and court in harms' way,\" Steinglass added.\n\nWe're at the part of sentencing when both prosecution and defense are going to state their respective positions on what they believe his sentence should be.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass , addressing the court, noted that Donald Trump has been found guilty of 34 felonies, but said that prosecutors would support a sentence of unconditional discharge given the practical issues at play: Trump is going to be president in less than two weeks.\n\nAlthough the prosecution is not pushing for incarceration or fines, Steinglass went through the threat that Trump's behavior has played to the US.\n\nIn front of the courthouse, around 15 anti-Trump protesters are gathered along with about 20 Trump supporters.\n\nIn the park across the street from the courthouse, a Trump supporter has unveiled a huge flag reading \"Trump won trifecta\".\n\nWe're getting formalities out of the way.\n\nBoth sides were provided copies of the probation report.

He claimed Biden \"set this precedent in 2021\" by revoking Trump's own clearance in response to his role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol where Trump supporters attempted to overthrow the winner of the election.\n\nJames mocked Trump's move in a statement to the New York Times . \"What security clearance?\" it said, describing his actions as \"just another attempt to distract from the real work the attorney general is doing to defend the rights of New Yorkers and all Americans\".\n\nZaid, a lawyer who represented the whistleblower in the investigation that led to Trump's first impeachment over his dealings with Ukraine, said he was \"honored by President Trump bestowing upon me a Red Badge of Courage, but if he and his partisan minions think this will deter me from holding them accountable to the rule of law, they are sadly mistaken\".\n\nBy law, he said, he was \"entitled to lawful due process, to include being informed why after 25 years of access to classified information I am suddenly untrustworthy, and I fully expect to be afforded the opportunity\".\n\nEisen wrote that he viewed his \"inclusion on Trump's list as a backhanded compliment in response to our court successes against his administration this week\".\n\n\"I intend to return it in the best way I know how: by filing many more lawsuits against his and his cronies' wrongdoing.\"\n\nLast month, the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, revoked the security detail and clearance for Mark Milley, a retired decorated army general and former chair of the joint chiefs of staff, who went on to criticize Trump after serving under his first administration.\n\nTrump also revoked the security detail for three of his former administration officials , including the former secretary of state Mike Pompeo ; Brian Hook, a former top aide; and John Bolton , his former national security adviser; as well as Anthony Fauci , former longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases."

      "text": "Donald Trump vows to escalate attacks against Alvin Bragg - sources\n\nThe former president was stunned by the indictment at first, but after 24 hours he indicated he wanted to politically 'rough 'em up'\n\nDonald Trump has told advisers and associates in recent days that he is prepared to escalate attacks against the Manhattan prosecutor who resurrected the criminal prosecution into his hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016 now that a grand jury has indicted him.\n\nThe former president has vowed to people close to him that he wants to go on the offensive and - in a private moment over the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida that demonstrates his gathering resolve - remarked using more colorful language that it was time to politically \"rough 'em up\".\n\nTrump had already signaled that he would go after the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, weeks before the grand jury handed up an indictment against him on Thursday, saying in pugilistic posts on Truth Social that the prosecution was purely political and accusing Bragg of being a psychopath.\n\nBut the latest charged language reflects Trump's determination to double down on those attacks as he returns to his time-tested playbook of brawling with prosecutors, especially when faced with legal trouble that he knows he cannot avoid, people close to him said.\n\nThe episode at Mar-a-Lago came on the sidelines of strategy meetings Trump had with advisers and associates about how to respond to the indictment from a legal and political standpoint, sessions which were described by two sources close to the former president.\n\nThe case centers on $130,000 that Trump paid to Daniels through his former lawyer Michael Cohen in the final days of the 2016 campaign. Trump later reimbursed Cohen with $35,000 checks, which were recorded as legal expenses. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal tax evasion and campaign-finance violation charges.\n\nWith the indictment under seal until Trump's scheduled arraignment on Tuesday, the exact charges remained unclear on Sunday, though they are expected to include the falsification of business records and additional charges that elevate what would otherwise be a misdemeanor to a felony.\n\nTrump was initially caught off-guard by the indictment and spent the following 24 hours absorbing the news that was relayed to him by several of his top advisers. Later, at one point, Trump repeated to himself almost incredulously that prosecutors had actually charged him.\n\nThe shock had dissipated by the weekend, when Trump's tone changed and he told his team that he wanted to attack the case and fight the prosecutors. He steadfastly contends he did nothing illegal and won't accept a plea deal that would force him to admit culpability.\n\nThe ex-president's pugnacious tone has only accelerated in recent days with a series of critical posts about New York state supreme court justice Juan Merchan, to whom the case has apparently been allotted after he presided over a separate matter involving the Trump Organization last year.\n\nOn his Truth Social platform, Trump said Merchan had \"railroaded\" Allen Weisselberg, the former chief executive of the Trump Organization, who on Sunday was in the middle of serving a 100-day sentence in the Rikers Island jail complex after pleading guilty to tax fraud charges in that case.\n\nReferencing Merchan, Trump said: \"The Judge 'assigned' to my Witch Hunt Case, a 'Case' that has NEVER BEEN CHARGED BEFORE, HATES ME\".\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nTrump has also since pivoted his focus to seeing how he can benefit politically from the indictment, the sources said, and he was encouraged that it had boosted his poll numbers over potential rivals for the Republican nomination who found themselves forced to come to his defense against Bragg, a Democrat.\n\nWith a grim fixation on having a mug shot taken, Trump has asked whether his team could print it on T-shirts that could serve as a rallying motif for his supporters - an idea that his advisers have been particularly enthusiastic about.\n\nTrump also spent the weekend reviewing a Yahoo news poll that showed him leading Florida governor Ron DeSantis, whom he considers his closest rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, 57% to 31% in a hypothetical one-on-one contest. The poll also found Trump was attracting the majority of support, at 52%, when pitted against a wider, 10-candidate field.\n\nThe polling illustrated the perilous dance for DeSantis and Trump's other challengers, who have so far struggled to find a way to defend the ex-president strongly enough to ensure the support of his core base in the Republican party without undercutting their pitch as being worthy successors to him.\n\nTrump's advisers observed over the weekend that DeSantis had struggled in that test when his only response to the indictment was to snap back in line behind the former president, calling the case \"the weaponization of the legal system to advance a political agenda\"."

You can find all of our live US politics coverage here\n\nDonald Trump announced he is dispatching Treasury secretary Scott Bessent to Ukraine to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy , while also predicting the war in the country would end \"soon\".\n\nThe US president made the news on Truth Social:\n\nI am sending Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent to Ukraine to meet President Zelensky. This War MUST and WILL END SOON - Too much Death and Destruction. The U.S. has spent BILLIONS of Dollars Globally, with little to show. WHEN AMERICA IS STRONG, THE WORLD IS AT PEACE.\n\nTrump's announcement came after Zelenskyy, in an exclusive interview with the Guardian, warned that he does not think Europe could replace the United States as the country's top security partner. Here's more:\n\nTwo senior officials have resigned from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Reuters reports, after a Project 2025 architect who is now a top White House official ordered it to cease its activities.\n\nReuters reports that Eric Halperin , director of enforcement, and Lorelei Salas , director of supervision, said it would be impossible to stay at the CFPB after the order by Russell Vought , the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. Here's more, from Reuters:\n\n\"As you know we have been ordered to cease all work. I don't believe in these conditions I can effectively serve in my role, which is protecting American consumers,\" said Halperin wrote. \"Today I made the difficult decision to resign effective today.\"\n\nSalas said she believed the decision by Vought to halt all supervisory work was illegal.\n\n\"It has been an honor to be part of this team - I thank you and ask that you stay strong,\" she wrote.\n\nIn an email, an OMB spokesperson said the agency had not received Salas' resignation and said: \"They did not resign. They were placed on administrative leave.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also accused Halperin of insubordination, citing a Politico report according to which Halperin had told staff last week that the agency's work stoppage did not apply to pending cases. Halperin could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nDemocrats have decried the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the CFPB, which was created after the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from misconduct by banks and financial institutions. Here's more:\n\nSteve Bannon will serve no jail time after pleading guilty to a fraud charge connected to duping donors into thinking they were funding construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border, the Associated Press reports.\n\nThe plea deal resolves a long-running case against Bannon, a top ally of Donald Trump and an architect of his Maga political philosophy, which began at the federal level before being disrupted when Trump pardoned Bannon near the end of his first term, and was then taken up by prosecutors in New York. Here's more on its resolution, from the AP:\n\nBannon, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump , pleaded guilty to one scheme to defraud count as part of a plea agreement that spares him from jail time in the \"We Build the Wall\" scheme. He received a three-year conditional discharge, which requires that he stay out of trouble to avoid additional punishment.\n\nAsked how he was feeling as he left the courtroom, Bannon said, \"Like a million bucks.\"\n\nBannon spoke to reporters afterward and called on U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to begin an immediate criminal investigation into New York Attorney General Leticia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nDefense attorney Arthur Aidala called the case against Bannon flimsy, saying it was never about his client.\n\n\"Mr. Bannon deserves credit. He wants to fight. Everyone knows Steve Bannon, he always wants to put up a fight,\" Aidala said.\n\nThe district attorney's office said Bannon is barred from fundraising for or serving as \"an officer, director, or in any other fiduciary position\" for any charitable organization with assets in New York state, under the plea agreement. He's also barred from using, selling or possessing any data gathered from donors to the border wall scheme.\n\n\"This resolution achieves our primary goal: to protect New York's charities and New Yorkers' charitable giving from fraud,\" Bragg said in a statement.\n\n\"New York has an important interest in rooting out fraud in our markets, our corporations, and our charities, and we will continue to do just that,\" he added.\n\nA federal court has approved a request by prosecutors to drop charges against two co-defendants indicted alongside Donald Trump for allegedly hiding classified documents, marking the end of the unprecedented, and ultimately fruitless, effort to convict the president prior to his return to the White House.\n\nAfter Trump won the November election, special counsel Jack Smith dropped charges against Trump over the documents, and in a separate case involving attempting to stop Joe Biden from entering the White House. However, Smith allowed the prosecutions of the co-defendants in the documents case, Carlos De Oliveira and Walt Nauta , to continue.\n\nThe 11th circuit court of appeals has now agreed to drop those charges. Here's more, from Reuters:\n\nThe U.S. Court of the Appeals for the 11th Circuit approved dropping the case against Trump valet Walt Nauta and property manager Carlos De Oliveira, who were charged alongside Trump in a case accusing Trump of illegally retaining classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago home and social club. All three pleaded not guilty.\n\nA lawyer for Nauta, Richard Klugh, said the decision \"closes out a prosecution that was misguided and which should never have been filed.\"\n\nThe charges were brought by former Special Counsel Jack Smith, who also accused Trump in a separate case of conspiring to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election.\n\nSmith dropped both cases after Trump won the November election, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.\n\nAt the time, prosecutors said they would continue the case against Nauta and De Oliveira, who faced obstruction charges.\n\nBut after Trump took office, the acting U.S. attorney in south Florida, who had taken over the case from Smith, asked the appeals court to drop it.\n\nProsecutors asked the appeals court to intervene last year after U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, dismissed the charges against Trump and his two co-defendants, ruling that Smith was unlawfully appointed as special counsel.\n\nThe court had not weighed in on that issue at the time prosecutors asked to drop the case.\n\nRepublican speaker of the House Mike Johnson said he met with Elon Musk about what he called his \"exciting\" efforts to dramatically downsize the federal government.\n\n\"I met with Elon yesterday about this, to get an update, and it's to me, it's very exciting what they're able to do, because what Elon and the Doge effort is doing right now is what Congress has been unable to do in recent years,\" Johnson said, referring to the Musk-chaired \"department of government efficiency\" that has been behind the attempts to dramatically cut the federal workforce and disrupt agencies such as USAid and the Consumer Financial Bureau.\n\nJohnson said previous attempts by his lawmakers to audit the federal government's operations have been blocked by agencies' unwillingness to share information, and added that judges should not stop Doge's efforts.\n\n\"That's why this is so exciting. They're uncovering things that we have known intuitively have been there, but we couldn't prove it,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"I think the courts should take a step back and allow these processes to play out. What we're doing is good and right for the American people, what Doge is doing is making sure that your taxpayer dollars, all of us, are spent in the way that they're intended to be spent.\"\n\nReacting to his administration's setbacks in courts across the country, Donald Trump has defended his efforts to upend the federal government by closing down agencies and attempting to remove large numbers of federal workers.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, he also took a swipe at \"highly political judges\" that he blames for blocking his efforts. Here's what he said:\n\nBillions of Dollars of FRAUD, WASTE, AND ABUSE, has already been found in the investigation of our incompetently run Government. Now certain activists and highly political judges want us to slow down, or stop. Losing this momentum will be very detrimental to finding the TRUTH, which is turning out to be a disaster for those involved in running our Government. Much left to find. No Excuses!!!\n\nIn an interview with CNN yesterday, Democratic senator Chris Murphy said the Trump administration had not quite yet tipped the United States into a constitutional crisis, but was certainly bringing it close.\n\n\"So far, they've been talking tough, but I think largely have complied with these court orders. I think there's going to be a question as to how well they've complied with the orders, but if they were to outright ignore an order, as JD Vance ... [is] suggesting, that is maybe the greatest challenge to democracy in our lifetimes,\" Murphy said.\n\nConcerns that the Trump administration would ignore court orders were heightened yesterday, when a federal judge said that the White House had ignored his ruling ordering an end to a freeze on federal funding. Here's more on that, from the Guardian's Anna Betts :\n\nA federal judge said on Monday that the Trump administration had defied his order to unfreeze billions in federal funding and issued a directive demanding that the government \"immediately restore frozen funding\".\n\nIn the order , US district judge John J McConnell Jr in Rhode Island instructed Donald Trump 's administration to restore and resume federal funding in accordance with the temporary restraining order he issued in January, which halted the administration's freeze of congressionally approved federal funds.\n\nThe ruling appeared to be the first instance of a judge finding the Trump administration had violated a court order pausing a new policy rollout. The Trump administration on Monday said it is appealing.\n\nLast month, the Trump administration's office of management and budget issued a memo halting federal grants and loans while it evaluated spending to ensure it was in alignment with Trump's agenda and policies. The administration later withdrew the memo, which caused widespread confusion.\n\nThe American Bar Association has hit back at Donald Trump 's efforts to pause federal spending and dismantle agencies created by Congress, saying that the administration must adhere to the rule of law and respect court decisions.\n\nIn a statement , the bar association's president William Bay singled out Trump's attempt to freeze federal loans and grants that Congress had authorized, calling it \"a violation of the rule of law [that] suggests that the executive branch can overrule the other two co-equal branches of government.\"\n\n\"The money appropriated by Congress must be spent in accordance with what Congress has said. It cannot be changed or paused because a newly elected administration desires it. Our elected representatives know this. The lawyers of this country know this. It must stop,\" Bay said.\n\nHe then called for elected officials and attorneys to work to ensure that the Trump administration respects the courts:\n\nWe call upon our elected representatives to stand with us and to insist upon adherence to the rule of law and the legal processes and procedures that ensure orderly change. The administration cannot choose which law it will follow or ignore. These are not partisan or political issues. These are rule of law and process issues. We cannot afford to remain silent. We must stand up for the values we hold dear.\n\nGood morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump 's efforts to upend the federal government have been given a dim reception by judges nationwide, who in recent days handed down rulings blocking his attempt to curtail birthright citizenship for undocumented immigrants, allow Elon Musk and his cohort access to the Treasury's payment systems , coax government workers to resign en masse and freeze federal funding , among others. But as the decisions have come down talk among Trump administration officials of ignoring decisions they disagree with has increased. JD Vance was the most prominent of those who have floated these ideas, musing over the weekend that \"judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power.\" Such statements have sparked worries among Democrats and legal scholars that the Trump administration will create a constitutional crisis by defying the courts. You can expect to hear plenty more about that today, as the president's campaign, and the legal battle it has created, continues.\n\nHere's what else we are watching for:\n\nTrump will host King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House beginning at 11.30am, then sign unspecified executive orders at 3pm. Yesterday's orders included new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports , and regulations to hold off on enforcing an anti-bribery law .\n\nToday may be the day that House Republicans release details of their big bill that is expected to cut taxes and government spending and pay for Trump administration priorities such as mass deportations. Mike Johnson and his team have a press conference scheduled for 10am.\n\nHamas said they are holding off on the release of future Israeli hostages over breaches of the ceasefire deal, prompting Trump to say \"let hell break out\" if more aren't freed by Saturday. We have a separate live blog covering the crisis in the Middle East, and you can read it here ."

      "text": "Republicans accused by New York DA of meddling in Trump hush-money case\n\nAlvin Bragg writes to committee chairs seeking his testimony saying there is 'no legitimate basis for congressional inquiry'\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, on Thursday accused Republicans in the US Congress of interfering in his investigation of Donald Trump over a hush money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nA letter from House Republicans demanding testimony and documents related to the investigation \"only came after Donald Trump created a false expectation that he would be arrested ... and his lawyers repeatedly urged you to intervene\", Bragg wrote in a letter of his own.\n\nSuch circumstances, he said, did not represent \"a legitimate basis for congressional inquiry\".\n\nBragg published his letter as it became clear another day would pass without an indictment of the former US president for offences related to the $130,000 payment made in 2016 and potentially including falsification of business records, tax fraud and/or campaign finance violations.\n\nThe grand jury considering the case is not due to meet again until Monday.\n\nLast weekend, amid reports an indictment was imminent, Trump said he expected to be arrested on Tuesday.\n\nThat day came and went without an arrest but aides to the former president have told outlets, including the Guardian , that Trump wants to be seen in handcuffs and has even mused on how being shot while being arraigned might help him return to the White House.\n\nTrump is under extensive legal jeopardy as he runs for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\nAn indictment is also thought likely in Georgia, over Trump's election subversion efforts there. Trump also faces federal investigations of his election subversion and his retention of classified records , a New York civil suit over his business practices and a defamation suit arising from an allegation of rape by the writer E Jean Carroll.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and claims to be the victim of political witch-hunts mounted by Black prosecutors he says are racist .\n\nBragg is the first Black Manhattan DA and only the fourth man to fill the post on a permanent basis since the second world war.\n\nThe payment to Stormy Daniels was made by Trump's then lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, and discovered in 2018. Cohen went to jail, in part over the payment, and turned on his former boss. But Bragg's investigation of what members of his own team came to call a \" zombie case \" has never run smoothly.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have accused Bragg of acting politically while neglecting crime in his city. They have also repeatedly called him \"Soros-backed\", a reference to donations by the progressive financier George Soros, a target for antisemitic invective on the US right.\n\nIn the Daniels case, the Republicans made their demands to Bragg on Monday.\n\nNorm Eisen, a former White House ethics tsar now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, called the Republican letter \"a transparent effort to interfere with the investigation of Trump in New York\", with \"no legitimate congressional purpose\" and \"contrary to law\".\n\nOn Thursday, Bragg addressed his reply to Jim Jordan, the chair of the House judiciary committee; Bryan Steil, chair of the administration committee; and James Comer, chair of the oversight committee.\n\nThe Republican congressmen, he said, had attempted an \"an unprecedented inquiry into a pending local prosecution\".\n\nClaiming \"quintessential police powers belonging to the state\" of New York , Bragg accused the Republican congressmen of \"tread[ing] into territory very clearly reserved for the states\".\n\nHe also said the Republican request would interfere with law enforcement efforts requiring confidentiality.\n\nNonetheless, Bragg requested a meeting with committee staffers, to \"understand what information the DA's office can provide that relates to a legitimate legislative interest and can be shared\".\n\nHe also said he would \"submit a letter describing [the] use of federal funds\"."

      "text": "Wall Street's Candidate Loses Manhattan District Attorney Primary\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAfter donating $8.2 million to her own campaign, Tali Farhadian Weinstein fell short.\n\nTali Farhadian Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor backed by Wall Street, has lost the Democratic primary for Manhattan district attorney to former New York state Chief Deputy Attorney General Alvin Bragg. Now the Democratic nominee, Bragg will almost certainly sweep the general election in November and serve a four-year term beginning in 2022.\n\nAs Manhattan's top prosecutor, Bragg will oversee some of the most consequential criminal cases in the country, including the ongoing investigation into the finances of former President Donald Trump and his organization. On Thursday, the incumbent DA charged the Trump Organization with grand larceny and other offenses related to tax fraud. Bragg will also be the country's preeminent prosecutor of white-collar crime, given the DA's jurisdiction over Wall Street, where he will lead investigations into multinational investment schemes, money laundering, and workplace violations.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWeinstein's loss comes as a win for progressives and some government reform advocates, who argued that the multimillionaire's close ties to Wall Street presented a conflict of interest. Of the 27 donors who made contributions over $35,000 to Weinstein's campaign, all but one were Wall Street or business leaders. Weinstein, who worked as a prosecutor in Barack Obama's Department of Justice and is married to hedge fund executive Boaz Weinstein of Saba Capital Management, also contributed $8.2 million of her own money to her campaign in the final weeks of the race, some of which went toward ads attacking Bragg.\n\nIn total, Weinstein, one of the most moderate candidates in the primary, raised nearly $13 million: more than five times the amount Bragg raised, and more than the amount the seven other candidates raised combined. Her powerful war chest allowed for a digital ad campaign and mailers that helped boost her name recognition. Only two months before the election, two polls showed Weinstein in the lead with twice as many votes as Bragg; she led him 16 percent to 6 percent in a Benson Strategy Group Poll, and 11 percent to 5 percent in an internal poll paid for by the campaign of another candidate, Tahanie Aboushi. (Unlike New York City's municipal elections, New York state's district attorney races do not have ranked-choice voting.)\n\nRelated Wall Street's Candidate Gave Herself $8 Million for Manhattan District Attorney Race\n\nBut as the June 22 election drew nearer, the gap in the race narrowed. Buoyed by a New York Times endorsement, Bragg - who ran on a platform to the left of Weinstein's - gained steam. A poll conducted by Data for Progress two weeks before the race showed Bragg tied with Weinstein, and a poll the following week showed him ahead.\n\nBragg, who oversaw cases against film producer Harvey Weinstein and the Trump administration at the state attorney general's office, focused his campaign on criminal justice reform rather than prosecution. He has vowed to not prosecute most low-level crimes, such as sex work; to offer restorative justice programming for cases involving serious crimes; and to never seek sentences longer than 20 years - though he noted he may find \"exceptional circumstances.\"\n\nWeinstein, meanwhile, leaned into a narrative peddled by right-wing pundits and law enforcement officials that framed the election as a referendum on public safety. Although rates of many violent crimes have decreased over the past year, factors including the Covid-19 pandemic and increased access to guns have contributed to a rise in gun violence in major cities across the country - making crime a central issue in the DA's race as well as in municipal elections. But missing from this framing is the fact that before 2020, violent crime in New York City had dropped to its lowest level in decades. The number of murders in New York City last year - between 400 and 500 - is similar to what it was in 2012, when the murder rate was said to have plummeted.\n\nAnd though Weinstein, who has called herself a \"progressive prosecutor,\" supported some criminal justice reforms, her platform was more moderate than those of her peers. She pledged to invigorate the office's wrongful conviction unit, seek only minimum sentences \"as a default rule,\" and \" reduce significantly \" the use of convictions for nonviolent offenses. But unlike the race's left-most candidates, she did not promise to stop prosecuting nonviolent misdemeanors, seek sentences less than 20 years, fully decriminalize sex work, or dramatically change the focus of the DA's office. While her progressive opponents lauded the state's 2019 bail reform laws that eliminated cash bail, Weinstein said she believes that judges should be allowed to consider a suspect's potential threat to public safety before setting bail - a practice currently prohibited under the bail reform legislation.\n\nBragg's and Weinstein's different tones on public safety and criminal justice became a sticking point during the final weeks of the race. In several ads, Weinstein sought to frame Bragg's stances against incarceration as a threat to women and public safety. In one TV ad , a woman slams Bragg's opposition to a law that would require police to make an arrest in domestic abuse felony cases, and argues that he \"would put women and families at further risk of abuse.\" As several of his and Weinstein's competitors in the race denounced the ads, Bragg, who is Black, described them as part of the \"worst tradition of our politics playing on racial overtones.\"\n\nWeinstein's campaign tactics continued to put her on the defensive. During a televised June 17 debate, several of the seven other candidates criticized the former federal prosecutor for her advertisements and for paying almost no federal income taxes in four recent years, as ProPublica reported . Weinstein and her husband maintained that their tax filings are completely legal because their net worth fell after significant losses at Saba Capital Management.\n\nBragg's victory marks a major win by progressives, who saw the rare opening for the Manhattan district attorney - a position only three people have been elected to in the last 79 years - as an opportunity to enact progressive reform. Bragg, a Harlem native poised to become the borough's first Black district attorney, says that reducing mass incarceration will be his top priority.\n\n\"We are one step closer to transforming the District Attorney's office to deliver safety and justice for all,\" Bragg said in a statement. \"One that ends racial disparities and mass incarceration. One that delivers justice for sexual assault survivors. One that holds police accountable. One that prosecutes landlords who harass tenants, employers who cheat their workers, and stands up to hate crimes. And one that stops the flow of guns onto our streets.\"\n\nWAIT!

But with one week to go until New York City's primary election, the race has devolved into a contest between a self-funded millionaire with Wall Street support and a crowded field of candidates struggling to keep up.\n\nTali Farhadian Weinstein, former general counsel to the Brooklyn district attorney's office, gave four contributions to her own campaign between May 20 and June 7 totaling $8.2 million - more than the total amount raised by the other seven candidates combined. A poll released last week by Data for Progress shows Weinstein, whose husband is a hedge fund manager, and former chief deputy attorney general for New York state Alvin Bragg leading among likely Manhattan Democratic primary voters. The poll asked respondents to rank their choices, but the DA election will not have ranked-choice voting.\n\nWeinstein's campaign has spent more than $6.25 million in the final weeks of the race, including on mailers attacking Bragg , and reported just under $3 million on hand. Major Republican donors have also contributed large sums to Weinstein's campaign, New York Focus reported. She also interviewed for a federal judgeship during the early months of the Trump administration, the New York Times reported earlier this month.\n\n\"Tali did interview for an opportunity to serve her country and uphold the constitution of the United States,\" spokesperson Jennifer Blatus said. \"I think that it would have been good to see a pro-immigrant, pro-choice judge at a time of a chaotic state of affairs at the beginning of the Trump Administration.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

(The group did not endorse any candidates in the race.) \"The whole reason that there is this movement around DAs is that not only are they powerful offices, but they have unilateral executive authority that is really rare to be able to wield in progressive hands.\" Though Thomas said he didn't have insight into \"why the field didn't really clear for one candidate,\" he noted that activist support was divided in this race. \"A lot of the institutional left was focused on the mayor's race and city council races.\"\n\nThe race has attracted national attention and split groups on the left. Color of Change PAC endorsed Bragg in May. Sen. Bernie Sanders and the Working Families Party endorsed civil rights attorney Tahanie Aboushi. Hillary Clinton endorsed Weinstein on Tuesday.\n\nWeinstein, who did not register as a Democrat until October 2017, has branded herself as a \"proven criminal justice reformer\" while at the same time campaigning as a more conservative alternative to the rest of the field, where other leading candidates are in a battle to prove who has the most progressive bona fides . Weinstein wants to crack down on violent transit crimes, enhance certain penalties for crimes against transit workers, expand eligibility for drug courts, and allow judges to consider public safety risk when setting bail - a practice New York outlawed in its 2019 bail reform law. (The incumbent DA, Cy Vance, also opposed allowing judges to assess public safety risk when setting bail.) Weinstein is also the only candidate who opposes decriminalizing sex work.\n\nAsked about Weinstein's opposition to the 2019 bail reform law, Blatus said, \"Tali believes in taking the safety for her fellow New Yorkers into account at every stage of a criminal proceeding.\" On Weinstein's position on decriminalizing sex work, Blatus said Weinstein supports a state Senate bill that \"would decriminalize those involved in prostitution, while still holding pimps and buyers accountable.\"\n\nBragg has raised $2.35 million; Assemblymember Dan Quart has raised just under $1.8 million, which includes some contributions from older committees; Aboushi has raised $1.24 million; public defender Eliza Orlins has raised just over $1.15 million; former prosecutor Lucy Lang has raised just over $1.5 million, including $500,000 she gave to her own campaign; defense attorney and former prosecutor Liz Crotty has raised just over $700,000; former prosecutor Diana Florence has raised $566,700.\n\nOrlins's campaign has accepted at least two large-dollar contributions from major GOP donors. The campaign declined to comment. Quart's campaign returned parts of contributions from an individual and his associated LLCs that exceeded campaign finance limits after reporting from City and State last week.\n\n\"With a super PAC advertising against us, our campaign is making sure that voters across Manhattan get a clear sense of the difference between the candidates in this race,\" said Blatus, Weinstein's spokesperson.\n\nVance, the incumbent, took office in 2010 and is not running for reelection. He faced criticism for his office's handling of sexual assault cases , and a group of survivors called on him to resign last year. He originally declined to bring charges against film producer Harvey Weinstein in 2015 and did so only after the takeoff of the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office has jurisdiction over some of the most powerful interests in the country, including Wall Street and the Trump empire ; the winner of the DA race will take over the criminal investigation into Donald Trump and his business associates.\n\nCorrection: June 16, 2021 A previous version of this article stated that Hillary Clinton endorsed Tali Farhadian Weinstein in May.

      "text": "America May Finally Be Done With Donald Trump\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAs military bases shed their Confederate names and the ex-president's legal troubles worsen, we seem to be moving on at last.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump points to the crowd as he leaves after speaking at a campaign rally, March 25, 2023, in Waco, Texas. Photo: Evan Vucci/AP The U.S. Army began to strip its bases of their old Confederate names last week, as Donald Trump faced a possible criminal indictment. The timing was hardly a coincidence.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump points to the crowd as he leaves after speaking at a campaign rally, March 25, 2023, in Waco, Texas.\n\nNeither reckoning would have been possible if Trump were still president. Both have been winding their way through the government bureaucracy for the past two years since Trump left office and are now happening at the same time as part of a growing repudiation of Trump and Trumpism.\n\nThe big question is whether Trump, who held a surreal rally in Waco on Saturday, can stage a comeback and halt the nation's efforts to move on, or whether he will finally be thrown into history's dustbin.\n\nTrump's Waco event, the first rally of his 2024 presidential campaign, where thousands of MAGA zealots cheered as the ex-president raged, came one day after a much smaller but more significant event on an Army base in Virginia.\n\nAt a modest ceremony on Friday, Fort Pickett, named for Confederate Gen. George Pickett, remembered as the losing commander of \"Pickett's Charge,\" the doomed Confederate assault on Union lines at the battle of Gettysburg, was officially renamed Fort Barfoot, in honor of Col. Van T. Barfoot, who won the Medal of Honor in Italy during World War II. Barfoot received the medal for his actions on May 23, 1944, when he single-handedly took out three German machine gun nests, capturing 17 German soldiers, and then blew up a German tank with a bazooka.\n\nIt was the first time a U.S. Army base named for a Confederate had been renamed, marking an official repudiation of white supremacy by the U.S. military. Fort Pickett, now Fort Barfoot, is the first of nine Army bases scheduled to be renamed this year, as the Pentagon moves to purge the military of its tradition of commemorating Confederate fighters. The bases were originally named when they were built in the South in the first half of the 20th century. At the time, the Army agreed to name them after Confederates to satisfy white Southern leaders, whose demands were part of a broader reassertion of Southern white supremacy during the Jim Crow era.\n\nRelated George Floyd's Murder May Finally End the Army's Fealty to Defeated Confederate Traitors\n\nThe Pentagon resisted calls to change the base names for years. They refused to do so after a 2015 shooting by a white supremacist at a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, killed nine people, and again after the deadly 2017 \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Pressure grew more intense following the social protest movement sparked by the murder of George Floyd in 2020, but Trump, then president, fiercely opposed the idea. Claiming that the Confederate names were part of the nation's heritage, he attacked the Pentagon for even considering any changes. In June 2020, Trump tweeted : \"These Monumental and very Powerful Bases have become part of a Great American Heritage, and a history of Winning, Victory, and Freedom.\" In an interview with Fox News at the time, he said: \"We won two world wars, two world wars, beautiful world wars that were vicious and horrible, and we won them out of Fort Bragg, we won them out of all of these forts. And now they want to throw those names away.\"\n\nAfter Trump was defeated in 2020, he vetoed legislation creating a commission to rename the bases, but Congress was finally able to override it. If Trump had been reelected, he almost certainly would have continued trying to obstruct the renaming efforts.\n\nWith Trump gone, the commission completed its work, and many of the nation's largest and most prominent military bases will get new names this year; Fort Bragg in North Carolina, the base Trump talked about in 2020, will be renamed Fort Liberty at an event tentatively scheduled for June. A sign and a tank mark the entrance to Fort Pickett on Aug. 25, 2021, in Blackstone, Va. Photo: Steve Helber/AP The renaming of Fort Pickett last week prompted no protests and hardly a murmur of criticism, apart from a few nasty comments on the Facebook page of the Virginia National Guard, which uses the base. Indeed, the lack of outrage seems to be one more small sign that Trump's power, and his ability to generate anger outside of his devoted base, are waning.\n\nA sign and a tank mark the entrance to Fort Pickett on Aug. 25, 2021, in Blackstone, Va.\n\nTrump's mounting legal problems pose a more direct threat to his power and are a more personal form of reckoning. Although some Republican pundits and political figures have claimed that Trump will regain political strength by being indicted, the ex-president's own fury at the prospect, which was on full display in Waco, reveals the truth: Trump is deeply afraid of ending up in prison.\n\nHe has spent his life exploiting legal loopholes and has often succeeded by outlasting his opponents. But his victories have mostly come in civil lawsuits when he was in business or while he was president and controlled the Justice Department . He has never faced the kind of legal peril that he does now .\n\nThe threat seems to be driving him even further around the bend than ever before. He now openly engages in full-throated conspiracy theories while inciting violence against his opponents; he held his rally in Waco knowing that it was scheduled in the middle of the 30th anniversary of the federal siege of the Branch Davidian compound there , which ended with a deadly government raid and fire that has taken on deep symbolism among violent, far-right extremists.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nTrump is so obsessed with the criminal investigations against him - there are now at least four underway - that he talks about little else in public. Last week, he viciously attacked Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who seems likely to seek an indictment of Trump in connection with an alleged $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump's rhetoric is once again inciting his rabid supporters, just as it did during the January 6 insurrection. After Trump publicly attacked Bragg last week, calling him, among many other things, a \"degenerate psychopath,\" Bragg's office received an envelope containing white powder and a typewritten death threat that stated \"ALVIN: I AM GOING TO KILL YOU,\" followed by 13 exclamation points, according to The New York Times .\n\nTrump's public descent into vengeful fury plays well with his rage-fueled base. Other Republican politicians - even his likely GOP opponents in the 2024 presidential race, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis - are still so intimidated by Trump's hold on the MAGA crowd that they refuse to confront him, so he may yet win the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nBut this time, he may be forced to campaign from a prison cell.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "With a Crowded Progressive Field, Wall Street's Candidate Gains Steam in Manhattan DA Race\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nProgressives focus on background as a Wall Street-backed candidate raises millions.\n\nOn February 18, four of the eight candidates vying to replace the outgoing New York institution Cy Vance, who is not running for another term as Manhattan's district attorney, gathered for an online debate hosted by a group of public defenders. Most of the candidates are far to the left of Vance, with decarceration a running theme. All four have vowed to cut the office's budget, decriminalize sex work, and vastly reduce the number of low-level misdemeanors that the district attorney's office prosecutes, among other reforms.\n\nThe amount that they have in common has made for a crowded field in which it's not easy for voters to discern their differences. Instead, the candidates' identities and backgrounds have become frequent refrains - and, sometimes, sticking points.\n\nAt the debate, Tahanie Aboushi, who is running as a civil rights attorney, challenged the only public defender in the race, Eliza Orlins, questioning whether someone with her \"privilege\" could serve effectively.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\n\"You've often referred to people you've represented as your clients, those that you seem to have transactional relationships with,\" Aboushi said. \"How do you reconcile your privilege, having not had the experience of the overwhelming majority impacted by the office, with the need to have that lived experience for the next district attorney of Manhattan?\"\n\nAboushi has leaned heavily on her family history in the campaign. Both of her parents were born in occupied Palestine. Aboushi and her nine siblings, including New York Jets player Oday Aboushi, were raised by their single mother. Her father was arrested and sentenced to 22 years in federal prison for charges related to his involvement in a conspiracy to rob commercial trucks and their drivers, according to court documents.\n\nBut the implication that the relationship of public defenders to their clients is purely transactional strains credulity. Orlins has spent more than a decade with The Legal Aid Society, which does not charge defendants to represent them.\n\nOrlins, visibly annoyed, underscored her bond with the people she works with and for. \"You can ask any public defender ... and they'll tell you that the comments about us 'clocking out' are kind of offensive,\" she said, before adding that she recognizes her clients of color face police aggression that she doesn't. \"Certainly I recognize, Ms. Aboushi, that I am white. I have never really spoken any other way.\"\n\nAboushi's performance at the debate was followed, in early March, by a major endorsement from New York's Working Families Party, which cited Aboushi's \"first-hand personal experience\" with the criminal justice system alongside her professional bona fides. She's also racked up endorsements from significant progressive power players, including New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, New York state Assembly Member Yuh-Line Niou, and former gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon.\n\nOrlins, for her part, has leaned heavily into her career as a public defender. \"I am the only public defender in this race,\" she said on Monday , launching her first ad, which broadcasts the fact that she has represented 3,000 defendants over the past decade-plus. Her messaging calls to mind the campaign of Tiffany Cabán, a public defender who captivated the city's social justice movements and came within a handful of votes of winning the Queens County District Attorney race in 2019. While Cabán was able to lean on her background - growing up a queer Latina in a Queens housing project - as well as her career as a public defender, Orlins - a graduate of the prestigious Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. - can lean only on her experience. (She has also had brushes with celebrity, competing as a high-profile contestant on Survivor in 2004, when the show was at the peak of its cultural relevance, and, in 2018, on The Amazing Race.)\n\nLucy Lang, a former assistant district attorney, has also emerged as a contender. A public poll that concluded on April 21 found Tali Farhadian Weinstein, formerly general counsel for the Brooklyn DA and one of the most conservative candidates in the Democratic pool, at the top with 16 percent, trailed closely by Lang at 12 percent. Lang, after more than a decade as a prosecutor, became executive director of the Institute for Innovation in Prosecution at John Jay College.  She's been endorsed by other progressive-leaning prosecutors around the country, including Marilyn Mosby (Baltimore), Kim Gardner (St. Louis), and Sherry Boston (Dekalb County, Georgia).\n\n\"In New York City politics, representation matters,\" said Nick Encalada-Malinowski, a campaign director at the grassroots organization Vocal New York. \"It's something that people in general think about. So Tahanie's story of having her father incarcerated speaks to people in a way that other candidates aren't able to.\"\n\nAlvin Bragg, the only Black candidate, meanwhile, often mentions being stopped at gunpoint by police three times while growing up in Harlem. And while the left remains divided among progressives, Wall Street has strategically coalesced around a single candidate, hoping to snatch a victory for the status quo even as the public clamors for change.\n\nFarhadian Weinstein has dramatically out-raised every other candidate, raking in more than $2.26 million by January. Bragg reported $1.3 million in donations, Aboushi raised about $771,000, and Orlins raised just under $600,000.\n\nAn internal poll paid for by Aboushi's campaign, conducted by Tulchin Research of 500 Manhattanites and released on April 14, ranked Farhadian Weinstein at the top of the pack alongside Aboushi, both with 11 percent of the vote. Two other candidates, Bragg and Dan Quart, tied for second with 5 percent, and Eliza Orlins got 2 percent, with 57 percent of voters undecided. And since the election is a county race and won't have ranked-choice voting, there's a real possibility that Farhadian Weinstein could rake in the most votes in the primary on June 22.\n\nThe public poll conducted by Benenson Strategy Group found Aboushi at 5 and Orlins at 4.\n\nBut the endorsements haven't cleared the field for Aboushi either; while Aboushi ranked above the other three progressives in her campaign's internal poll, her lead is anything but certain. With more than half of the voters undecided according to the single poll, the race remains fluid.\n\nAnd some endorsements yielded their own backlash. The Working Families Party's endorsement of Aboushi, which wields significant power because of the party's influence in New York state, was slammed by some members of the party's Manhattan chapter, which had voted to endorse Orlins by a 10-to-9 margin, according to Working Families Party spokesperson Ravi Mangla. In the tight world of New York City movement politics, the director of a group that played a large role in the Working Families Party's endorsement of Aboushi, New York Communities for Change, is married to a partner at a consulting firm doing work for Aboushi's campaign.\n\nUntil the January filing period, Aboushi had lagged behind Bragg, Quart, and Orlins in fundraising, but she has since kicked her efforts into high gear, raking in more than $1 million as of May 7 , according to her campaign. Bragg, who's won a number of high-powered allies from his years working as a state and federal prosecutor, is projected to raise around $2 million by the next filing deadline, according to his campaign, while Quart expects to raise \"several hundred thousand dollars more\" by the May deadline in addition to the $632,000 filed in January. Orlins, meanwhile, has raised $1,001,000, her campaign said. Farhadian Weinstein's campaign did not respond to a request for an updated total.\n\nFarhadian Weinstein's war chest has allowed for a powerful digital ad campaign and frequent mailers that have helped propel her candidacy. The former federal prosecutor has fashioned herself as a \"progressive prosecutor\" to the left of Vance - advocating for the elimination of cash bail and promising to increase funding for violence interruption programs - as have many mainline prosecutors recently, as support for criminal justice reform has finally become politically beneficial. But she has stopped short of backing some of the more robust reforms that Aboushi or Orlins have endorsed, such as pledging not to seek sentences of over 20 years.\n\nAnd her close ties to Wall Street raise questions about her stated commitment to prosecuting white-collar crime. Not only is Farhadian Weinstein married to Saba Capital Management hedge fund executive Boaz Weinstein (the couple purchased a $25.5 million apartment on Fifth Avenue in 2012), but a significant portion of her $2.26 million in donations comes from Wall Street and business leaders. Of the donations she received during the last filing period, 21 were $30,000 or more, and many came from Wall Street executives and business interests. Each contributor can donate a maximum of $37,829 total; one business leader, Standard Industries executive David Millstone, and his wife, Jennifer Millstone, donated $35,400 each.\n\nFarhadian Weinstein, for her part, has repeatedly told her story of flying from Iran to New York in 1979 with her family as a child, where a border agent let them in despite slapdash documents. That the childhood memory of being cleared through customs is the most profound experience with law enforcement she can muster says more than the story itself.\n\nTahanie Aboushi stands in front of the New York County Supreme Court building in Manhattan, N.Y., in January 2020.\n\nThe focus on personal experience has also distracted from a more meaningful look at the candidates' professional backgrounds.\n\nA closer look at Aboushi's legal career complicates her image as a civil rights attorney. Her day-to-day lawyering involved work on behalf of employers or on other cases that did not involve civil rights claims. The Aboushi firm, made up of three members of the Aboushi family, practices all kinds of law: commercial litigation, employment law, white-collar crime, immigration, corporate, public interest/pro bono, personal injury, not-for-profit, and bankruptcy law. In some cases, she actually worked on the opposite side of the person fighting for their civil rights.\n\nAboushi is not listed as the attorney of record in many cases, as many settle before going to court, but one prominent example is Echevarria v. Insight Medical. In the case, decided in 2015, Ingrid Echevarria sued her former company, claiming that she had been sexually harassed and then retaliated against when she filed a claim about it. Echevarria's case clearly falls within what is understood as a civil rights case, but Aboushi represented the company, not Echevarria.\n\nAboushi filed a motion during the case attempting to force the woman to pay Aboushi's legal fees, which she listed as $350 per hour but was willing to settle for $300 per hour. Instead, the case went to trial, and Aboushi's client lost and was ordered to pay Echevarria $50,000 in addition to covering her own legal fees of more than $80,000.\n\nTo be sure, Aboushi has done real civil rights work, much of it pro bono, on behalf of those seeking justice for civil rights abuses. Among other cases, she represented children in a Harlem public school who were beaten by an aide in 2018 and won a case later that year against the New York City Fire Department for implementing policies that disproportionately hurt Black firefighters. Several of her cases have involved holding the New York Police Department accountable: In 2015, she represented a protester attacked by police at a Black Lives Matter event, and in 2018, she sued the police force for forcing three Muslim women to remove their head coverings.\n\nAnd there's nothing inherently wrong with a corporate law practice whose partners take on civil rights cases as well; indeed, many corporate firms entice progressive-minded early-career attorneys by highlighting such opportunities. And attorneys who work on civil cases, even when on behalf of employers fending off worker lawsuits, often refer to themselves as civil rights attorneys.\n\nAboushi's campaign manager argued that the critics of Aboushi's lack of criminal court experience misunderstand the largely supervisory role of the district attorney. \"[It's] a weird understanding of what the district attorney does,\" said Jamarah Hayner. \"The head of the Postal Service isn't delivering your mail.\"\n\n\"After the past year and especially the Chauvin verdict, I can't think of anything more tone deaf than questioning the role of civil rights attorneys in systemic reform of the justice system,\" she said. \"As a black woman myself-whose rights are quite literally the result of decades of civil rights litigation-I'm really shocked and frankly hurt at the narrowness of that line of thinking.\"\n\nAboushi's lack of criminal experience has come up, in a limited way, in the election. In one early debate, Aboushi endorsed the use of gang conspiracy prosecutions, which opponents argue are deployed in an overbroad and racist manner to criminalize otherwise legal behavior. Two days later, under pressure, Aboushi clarified that she only supported such prosecutions in limited situations.\n\n\"My suggestion at the forum this week that I may pursue gang conspiracy charges under some circumstances reflects my determination to use all the tools at my disposal to hold the powerful accountable,\" she posted on Twitter.\n\n\"It occurred to me that, under the statute, groups of people who, for example, force women and children into prostitution or who conspire to abuse or silence protestors could meet the definition of 'gangs.' If those statutes would allow me to bring individuals to justice who abuse people that are vulnerable or marginalized, I will certainly use them.\"\n\nThat reasoning, however, is the same that standard prosecutors use to defend the tool and that public defenders across the city continue to object.\n\nI would like to make my policy on gang conspiracy prosecutions very clear. My suggestion at the forum this week that I may pursue gang conspiracy charges under some circumstances reflects my determination to use all the tools at my disposal to hold the powerful accountable. 1/5\n\n- Tahanie Aboushi (@TahanieNYC) October 15, 2020\n\nNone of the candidates have emerged unscathed from the campaign trail. Bragg, who has prosecuted cases with the New York Attorney General's Office and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, has come under fire during candidate forums for incarcerating people for nonviolent offenses and for declining to take hard-and-fast stances on many hot-button issues, such as whether to restrict sentences to 20 years and stop cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Others have criticized Orlins, Aboushi, and Quart for lacking managerial experience, given the district attorney's more than 1,000 employees and $169 million budget.\n\nOrlins has had her own awkward moments. In an interview with Filter , an online magazine, Orlins did not promise to stop prosecuting drug possession entirely.\n\n\"I can't say I'd categorically never prosecute possession because I don't think people should be bringing in kilos of heroin or fentanyl or crack or anything of the above, because, you know, they're endangering people in our community,\" she said. \"Personal possession is different than a truck of 10 kilos.\"\n\nBut someone with such a large quantity of drugs would not be charged with possession, but intent to distribute, a fact Orlins must know.\n\nFor now, candidates on the left will remain divided unless some candidates drop out - an unlikely outcome, according to a civil rights lawyer and former candidate in the race.\n\n\"Given the importance of this race, progressive leaders should have intervened much earlier, and more intentionally, to figure out who the best left candidate was, and encouraged folks to coalesce behind them,\" said Janos Marton, who dropped out of the Manhattan district attorney race in December and recently endorsed Alvin Bragg. \"To ask candidates to drop out now, after petitioning, after endorsements, after all that fundraising, isn't really fair to the candidates.\"\n\nIt will take a unified effort among the left to galvanize behind one progressive candidate, Marton said.\n\n\"Though if we see polling down the stretch that suggests a way to unite behind a progressive to beat Tali Farhadian Weinstein, that could change someone's mind.\"\n\nDuring a televised debate last week, Farhadian Weinstein complained that her opponents were \"putting forward purity tests\" but said that, ultimately, she was beating them all. \"In the end, everyone's taken the same approach,\" she said . \"I've been more successful.\"\n\nUpdate: May 11, 2021\n\nThis story was updated to include details of a public survey conducted by Benenson Strategy Group.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Working Families Party Weighs In on Crowded Manhattan DA Race\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBy endorsing Tahanie Aboushi, WFP sets a precedent for how other local progressive groups may endorse in the race.\n\nNew York's Working Families Party is wading into the first competitive race for Manhattan district attorney in more than a decade. The group is backing Tahanie Aboushi, a civil rights attorney based in Harlem, in a field of eight Democratic contenders, almost all of whom are trying to position themselves as the \"progressive\" choice in the race.\n\nNew York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, New York state Assembly Member Yuh-Line Niou, and Citizen Action New York, a grassroots membership organization focused on justice issues, are also endorsing Aboushi's campaign.\n\nAboushi, who launched her campaign last year on a promise to end mass incarceration, modeled her platform on her own experience with the criminal justice system in New York City. Her parents, who immigrated to the city from Palestine before she was born, were arrested when she was 14 for conspiracy charges related to selling untaxed cigarettes at their neighborhood store. Her father served just under two decades in federal prison and was released when he was 63 years old; her mother was acquitted of all charges. Now, Aboushi says, she is \"focusing on decarceration at every opportunity.\"\n\nManhattan District Attorney candidate Tahanie Aboushi visits the \"Occupy City Hall\" demonstration at City Hall Park, where hundreds of protesters call for the abolition of the New York Police Department and refuse to leave until the NYPD budget is dramatically cut, in New York City on June 26, 2020. Photo: Elise Swain/The Intercept \"Tahanie has demonstrated a deep professional and personal commitment to delivering justice for the Black and brown New Yorkers who have suffered most under the punitive prosecution of the current Manhattan's DA office,\" said New York WFP State Director Sochie Nnaemeka. \"Given her legal career holding the powerful in New York City accountable, vision and policy to build safety and community strength, and first-hand personal experience with our broken criminal 'justice' system, we have no doubt that Tahanie is the right candidate for the job.\"\n\nManhattan District Attorney candidate Tahanie Aboushi visits the \"Occupy City Hall\" demonstration at City Hall Park, where hundreds of protesters call for the abolition of the New York Police Department and refuse to leave until the NYPD budget is dramatically cut, in New York City on June 26, 2020.\n\nThe endorsement comes as eight candidates are vying to replace District Attorney Cy Vance, who has held the position since 2010. Vance has faced criticism for his office's handling of sexual assault cases and was called on to resign last January by a group of survivors who said he went easy on well-connected predators. Vance originally declined to bring charges against Harvey Weinstein in 2015, only doing so after attention to the case had taken off with the #MeToo movement. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office holds particular significance, with the jurisdiction to go after special interests of importance to groups on the left, such as Wall Street, Manhattan real estate moguls and landlords, and even the Trump empire , as Vance paved the way for last year.\n\nThe WFP endorsement sets Aboushi apart from the remaining seven candidates in the field; it is one of the more important endorsements in a race where the differences between candidates are not always clear-cut. \"There were a lot of strong progressive candidates who were really clearly running to undo the years of harm that the Vance administration had perpetuated,\" Nnaemeka said. Aboushi, however, had the clearest commitment to reducing the size and the scope of the DA's office \"and anchored her candidacy in a really strong divest, invest frame, which is central to a lot of the work the party centers. How do we divest from the things that cause harms in our community and in invest in what actually leads to real safety and transformation?\"\n\nIt also sets a precedent for how other local progressive groups, including New York Communities for Change and Community Voices Heard Power, may weigh in on the race. New York City's branch of Democratic Socialists of America held a forum with candidates who applied for their endorsement in November, but the organization ultimately decided to stay out of the race. An endorsement from WFP helped propel the campaign of former Queens DA candidate Tiffany Cabán in 2019, leading to national coverage and an endorsement from the New York Times.\n\nOther leading progressive contenders in the race are public defender Eliza Orlins, state Assembly Member Dan Quart, and former federal prosecutor and former New York state Chief Deputy Attorney General Alvin Bragg. The field also includes several candidates with previous ties to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, like former prosecutors Diana Florence, Lucy Lang, and Liz Crotty. Tali Weinstein, who worked in the Department of Justice under Barack Obama and as counsel to the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, is also in the race and is the top fundraiser so far.\n\nCrotty is the only candidate who has not styled herself as a \"progressive,\" and the other seven candidates have only small differences in their platforms. Weinstein is the only candidate who says she opposes decriminalizing sex work. On the issue of whether candidates would support defunding the police, as discussed during a forum hosted by Color of Change in January, Aboushi, Quart, and Lang answered \"yes\"; Orlins said she would support cuts of 50 percent of the budget; Bragg agreed to $1 billion in cuts; Weinstein and Crotty said \"no\"; and Florence said she could not answer and did not believe in the word \"defund.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nNew York's primary election takes place on June 22; the candidate who wins is expected to take office in January, as the borough leans heavily blue. No Republicans are currently running for Manhattan district attorney.\n\nIf elected, Aboushi plans to decline as many charges as possible to change the culture of the DA's office: move the focus away from securing convictions and instead address the root causes of crime and invest in community groups to ensure that people have access to housing, health care, income, food, transportation, and utilities. Aboushi is also running on ending cash bail and decriminalizing poverty, mental health issues, substance abuse, and sex work.\n\n\"You can't incarcerate out of poverty, you can't incarcerate out of substance abuse, you can't incarcerate out of the gun violence.\"\n\nShe currently practices law at the Aboushi Law Firm, which she and her siblings founded in 2010. Last January, Aboushi and her partner won a federal discrimination case brought by Black firefighters in New York in 2018 challenging a departmental policy forcing them to shave their beards or be placed on light duty, arguing that the policy was discriminatory and ignored a skin condition that affects 45 to 85 percent of Black men. Aboushi also represented a woman who won an $85,000 lawsuit in 2018 against the New York Police Department for forcibly removing her hijab after she was taken into custody.\n\n\"You can incarcerate people. But you're never going to incarcerate your way out of these problems,\" Aboushi told The Intercept during a December interview. \"You can't incarcerate out of poverty, you can't incarcerate out of substance abuse, you can't incarcerate out of the gun violence. It's just not going to happen. Because that's the state that we are in now. ... We are doing everything the opponents of transformation want us to do. It's happening right now. And you're still telling me crime is rising. So let's step back and talk about the root causes. Let's step back and prioritize our families, and prioritize the stability and safety of our families, instead of conditioning one constituent's safety on the incarceration and destabilization of other constituents.\"\n\nAboushi's campaign has endorsements from Real Justice PAC; Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib; former WFP gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon; activist Linda Sarsour; Akeem Browder, whose brother Kalief was detained for three years on Rikers Island without a trial and eventually killed himself; leaders from seven New York City Housing Authority developments; Incarcerated Nation Network, Inc., a network of formerly incarcerated people working to end mass incarceration; and Coalition for a District Alternative, a progressive group mobilizing residents, activists, and neighborhood groups in the Lower East Side.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Donald Trump Is Out of Power - and Out of Luck\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe ex-president is finally fair game for an entire legion of lawyers.\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump departs after speaking at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., on Nov. 15, 2022. Photo: Alon Skuy/AFP via Getty Images If politics were football, Donald Trump would be a JAG.\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump departs after speaking at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., on Nov. 15, 2022.\n\nNFL fans know what that means: Trump is \"Just a Guy.\"\n\nIn professional football slang, being a JAG means that a player is average, nothing special. A JAG lacks game-changing talent and unique status. A JAG is not a star. If a JAG makes too many demands, he'll be kicked off the team and thrown out on the street.\n\nTrump is finally finding out that being a former president is not the same thing as being president. Both in the courts and in politics, it turns out that being a former president is a lot like being a JAG.\n\nFor four years, Trump used his special status as president to shield himself from criminal investigations and other legal actions. Trump's position was clearly a factor in the decision by Robert Mueller, the special counsel in the Trump-Russia case, not to bring charges against him. The nation's main recourse for holding Trump accountable while he was president was impeachment, and he became the first president in history to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives. But the Republican-controlled Senate failed to convict him each time, and so Trump came to believe that he was bulletproof.\n\nBut now that he is out of office, Trump is finally fair game for an entire legion of lawyers. The legal system grinds slowly, but nearly two years after Trump left the White House, a dizzying number of cases against him are finally ramping up, seemingly all at once. Prosecutors are having a field day with Trump. He is facing a legal perfect storm.\n\nTrump's status as \"just a guy\" was confirmed Tuesday by a jury in New York, when his real estate company was convicted of tax fraud and other crimes. The jury found the Trump Organization guilty of all 17 counts of financial crimes the company was facing. Donald Trump was not personally charged in the case, but prosecutors did say during the trial that he was complicit by \"explicitly sanctioning tax fraud.\"\n\nThe criminal prosecution against Trump's company came as he, his children, and their family business are also facing a civil case brought in September by the New York attorney general, charging them with fraud for radically overstating the value of company assets. If they are found guilty, Trump and his children could be barred from running businesses again in New York.\n\nThe New York criminal case against Trump's company now appears to be leading to a renewed effort by local prosecutors to investigate Trump personally. After Tuesday's verdict in the criminal case, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said that the case against Trump's company was just \" one chapter in the book ,\" and that his office's investigation of Trump is still underway.\n\nIn fact, the verdict came as Bragg was also reportedly gearing up to revive a long-stalled criminal investigation into Trump's secret hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. The money was designed to buy Daniels's silence during the 2016 presidential campaign about her erstwhile affair with Trump.\n\nSeparately, E. Jean Carroll, a writer who claims Trump raped her in the mid-1990s , also sued the ex-president in late November for battery and defamation in New York. She had originally sued Trump for defamation while he was president, after he claimed he hadn't assaulted her because she was \"not my type.\" That earlier lawsuit is still tied up in court over Trump's claims that he can't be sued for the comments because he was acting in his official capacity as president when he made them.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSimilarly, a federal appeals court heard arguments Wednesday over whether Trump should be immune from lawsuits brought against him in connection with statements he made on January 6 . A district judge ruled against Trump in February, saying that the three lawsuits, brought by police officers who were at the Capitol on January 6 and Democratic members of Congress, could proceed despite Trump's claims of presidential immunity for his speech.\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court showed that it also now considers Trump a JAG. The court sided with the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee, ruling that the panel had the right to obtain Trump's tax returns. The legal battle between Trump and the committee over his tax returns had gone on for years, beginning when he was president. But once he left office, he could no longer count on the support of the Justice and Treasury departments to shield his returns. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., the New Jersey Democrat who chairs the Ways and Means subcommittee on oversight, noted that the Supreme Court ruling came after the panel had waited almost as long as it took to fight the Civil War.\n\nOn yet another front, an appeals court ruled in favor of the Justice Department and against Trump last week in the ongoing case involving his apparent theft of government documents . The appeals court overturned the decision by a lower court judge to create a so-called special master to review documents that the government took from Trump's Mar-a-Lago home during an FBI raid in August. The ruling clears the way for the newly appointed special counsel, Jack Smith , to finish the criminal investigation in the documents case. The legal maneuverings around the special master had slowed the case to a crawl over the last few months, but in its ruling, the appeals court made it clear that the lower-court judge had been wrong to give any special treatment to Trump in the way in which materials seized under a search warrant are handled.\n\nSmith, the new special counsel, has also been put in charge of the criminal investigation of Trump's role in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and he has been busy on that front since taking over on November 18. Two of Trump's White House lawyers were forced to testify last week before a federal grand jury about their former boss's efforts to overturn the election; this week, meanwhile, Smith has sent grand jury subpoenas to officials in Michigan, Arizona, and Wisconsin, seeking any communications with Trump or his aides in connection with his efforts to overturn the 2020 vote. Smith seems to be intensifying the criminal probe of efforts by Trump and his allies to upend the results in key swing states so that he could win in the Electoral College.\n\nWhile Smith ramps up his investigation, the House January 6 Committee, which will effectively go out of business when Republicans take over the House in January, plans to make criminal referrals to the Justice Department based on its investigation, the committee's chair said Tuesday.\n\nSeparately, a Florida appeals court on Tuesday ordered Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser who later became a key figure in efforts to overturn the 2020 election , to testify as early as Thursday before a grand jury in Atlanta investigating Trump's efforts to overturn the election in Georgia. Flynn is expected to be one of the last witnesses before the Atlanta grand jury, which is a \"special purpose\" body and will not issue indictments; instead, it will recommend whether anyone should be prosecuted. The Georgia case, in which Trump may face charges of leading a conspiracy to send fake electors from Georgia to the Electoral College, may eventually pose a grave legal threat to the ex-president personally.\n\nAnother new verdict in a January 6-related case also is bad news for Trump. Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the far-right militia known as the Oath Keepers , was convicted last week of seditious conspiracy in connection with the Capitol insurrection. The verdict, showing that a jury believes there was a conspiracy behind the riot, raises the legal stakes for Trump and his lieutenants.\n\nTo once again try to shield himself from the legal tidal wave, Trump announced right after the midterm election in November that he was running for president again in 2024. But just as he no longer enjoys special legal status, his political power also seems to have ebbed. Almost all the major candidates Trump endorsed lost in the recent election, dragging Republicans down to one of the worst midterm performances in modern history for a party out of power. In a final insult on Tuesday, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock defeated the Trump-anointed Republican, former football player Herschel Walker in the Georgia runoff election. Failure in the midterms has finally led more Republicans to call for an end to the party's addiction to Trump. (His rant last weekend demanding that the Constitution be suspended so he could be reinstalled as president apparently didn't help.)\n\nAs the year ends with Trump's JAG status confirmed, he can only console himself with right-wing dregs, like Elon Musk's laughable efforts to publish Hunter Biden's dick pics.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "NYPD Accused of Fabricating Domestic Violence Survivor's Murder Confession\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office dropped the murder charges against Tracy McCarter last year, citing insufficient evidence.\n\nA woman who was charged with murdering her husband in 2020 sued the New York City Police Department, alleging that police officers fabricated the confession that was the basis of the case against her. The federal civil rights lawsuit also alleges that the Manhattan District Attorney's Office obtained a search warrant for an email account she created to draw attention to her case - and never disclosed it, as required by law.\n\nProsecutors dropped their case against Tracy McCarter last December, citing insufficient evidence. In the lawsuit, which was filed on November 2 in the Southern District of New York, McCarter said she had \"sustained serious physical and psychological harm as a result of being wrongfully arrested, charged, imprisoned, searched, and prosecuted.\"\n\nThe lawsuit names four NYPD officers who were involved with the arrest and one investigator from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office who worked on the case. All four of the police officers have previously faced civilian complaints of misconduct, though such allegations are famously hard to prove . A spokesperson for the NYPD declined to comment on whether any of the officers are being investigated in relation to McCarter's case, citing the pending litigation. The district attorney's office declined to comment on the allegation involving the undisclosed search warrant.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAccording to the NYPD's disciplinary guidelines, making false, misleading, and inaccurate statements is cause for termination. There's no data showing how often that happens, however.\n\nStill, New York City taxpayers end up footing the bill when officers are accused of abusing their authority. The majority of lawsuits against the NYPD are settled, according to Jennvine Wong, a staff attorney with the Cop Accountability Project at the Legal Aid Society, a public defense organization in New York City.\n\nThose settlements are paid out from the city, not NYPD coffers, and New York City is on track to pay more than $100 million for such lawsuits this year alone, according to an analysis by the Legal Aid Society . As The Intercept previously reported, that figure is separate from the $30 million the city paid to settle lawsuits ahead of litigation, while 16 of the 20 officers named in the lawsuits with the highest payouts have been promoted .\n\n\"It seems like unless the story makes it to the press, somehow, cops are not actually paying the price for their perjury or for their false statements that are made in investigations,\" said Wong. \"It's obscured in a way that they've always been obscured, with DA's offices pleading out a case to a lesser charge or dismissing cases, or avoiding calling that particular officer to the stand and calling a different officer instead.\"\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance speaks on stage during National Night Out Against Crime in New York on Aug. 3, 2021.\n\nPolice arrested McCarter , a nurse at New York-Presbyterian, after the death of her estranged husband, James Murray, in March 2020. The lawsuit provides the following account of their relationship and Murray's death: Murray struggled with alcoholism and abused McCarter when he was drinking, including choking her. On the night of his death, he drunkenly went to McCarter's apartment demanding money. After she refused, Murray put her into a chokehold. McCarter held out a kitchen knife in an attempt to ward him off, but Murray tripped and fell into the kitchen knife, piercing him in the chest. (This account was later confirmed by forensic experts hired by both McCarter's team and the prosecution, according to the lawsuit.) McCarter said she immediately called for help and applied pressure to Murray's wound.\n\nA transcript of body camera footage reviewed by The Intercept shows McCarter in distress and pleading for officers to help Murray. \"Jim. Please stay with us,\" she screamed, according to the transcript. \"Oh god. Oh god. Why [unintelligible] did you do this Jim? Why did you do this? Why did you do this? He tried to take my money. Why did he do this? Oh my god.\"\n\nShortly after, Officer Shahel Miah handcuffed McCarter. Another officer, Samantha Cortez, stated, \"She said he tried to take her money and she stabbed him in the chest.\" The transcript of the body camera footage does not show McCarter making the second part of that statement, but Cortez memorialized it in her report nonetheless, according to the lawsuit.\n\nFormer Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance's office cited the alleged confession to charge McCarter with second-degree murder, an offense that carries a possible sentence of 25 years to life. McCarter's lawyers later tried to refute the claim with body camera footage, but the judge overseeing the case ruled against them.\n\nAt the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, McCarter was jailed on Rikers Island; she was ultimately released on house arrest in September 2020. Meanwhile, the prosecution used Cortez's account as probable cause to obtain search warrants on McCarter's phone and computer, including for dating apps that she shared with Murray. District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who entered office in January 2022, dismissed the charge against McCarter in December of that year after determining there was insufficient evidence to prosecute her.\n\nMonths after the charge was dropped, McCarter learned that the district attorney's office had withheld information about its surveillance activities. In August 2023, Google notified McCarter that it had given prosecutors access to information about an email account she used to communicate with people who were advocating on her behalf. Google, in its email, wrote that a court order had previously prohibited the company from notifying her about the request.\n\nMcCarter's lawyers later obtained the warrant from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. It shows that prosecutors got a search warrant for the account, StandWithTracy, in December 2021, during Vance's last month in office, on the grounds that it was being used to \"commit or conceal the commission of a crime.\" Prosecutors were seeking access to the emails, addresses, and calendars associated with the account, according to the warrant .\n\nNew York law requires prosecutors to turn over all documents related to the case. The district attorney's office provided McCarter's legal team with documents related to other search warrants, but those records did not mention the activism account.\n\nIn the lawsuit, McCarter alleges that the warrant was based on \"false information from members of the NYPD.\" Her lawyers asked the district attorney's office - now run by Bragg - about the basis for searching the account, but prosecutors refused to turn over that documentation without a court order, the lawyers said.\n\n\"We don't know what could possibly have been used to justify searching an account that was created to advocate on Tracy's behalf as a survivor of domestic violence who was criminalized,\" said Tess Cohen, one of McCarter's lawyers. \"We didn't even know the search happened or what the result of that search was.\"\n\nFor McCarter, the surveillance of the account was \"beyond terrifying.\"\n\n\"That is Orwellian,\" she said.\n\nPeople gather at Foley Square to demand that the mayor of New York take action to shut down Rikers Island, on Aug. 10, 2023, in New York.\n\nNew Yorkers have previously complained about the conduct of all of the police officers named in McCarter's lawsuit, according to The Intercept's review of the public database for the Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent agency that investigates police misconduct.\n\nOne detective, Carlos Pagan, has faced six CCRB complaints for offenses such as use of force and abuse of authority dating back to 2011. None of those complaints have ever been substantiated, an outcome that means the CCRB found enough evidence of wrongdoing to recommend discipline. The majority of CCRB complaints are found to be unsubstantiated, but that doesn't always mean it's because there was no misconduct - the process for proving a case is difficult and burdensome.\n\nMiah, the officer who handcuffed McCarter, has been the subject of three complaints. One of them, for abuse of authority, was substantiated, though the CCRB does not publicly provide details of the basis for the complaint. Miah did not face disciplinary action from the NYPD, according to a department database .\n\nCortez, the officer who said that McCarter confessed to stabbing Murray, faced a complaint for abuse of authority in September 2021, yet the investigation has been closed pending the outcome of the criminal case.\n\nAnd Alexander Cruz, a detective who signed off on search warrants and the criminal complaint against McCarter, was the subject of a CCRB complaint in 2008 for abuse of authority. He was exonerated during those proceedings but was named in a lawsuit the following year alleging he filed false police reports and gave false testimony. The suit resulted in a $27,000 settlement that did not include an admission of wrongdoing. The NYPD later disciplined Cruz for knowingly filing \" inaccurate, and factually incorrect departmental reports\" on 19 occasions and making \"incomplete and inaccurate entries into the department memobook.\" (His penalty was losing 15 vacation days.) The CCRB database lists Cruz as inactive.\n\nMiah referred questions to the NYPD press office, which responded with a link to the department's discipline database. Cortez did not respond, and Pagan and Cruz could not be reached for comment.\n\nEmily Tuttle, a spokesperson for Bragg, told The Intercept that the district attorney's office takes into consideration police officers' records. The office maintains \"records with any information that could negatively impact a testifying officer's credibility and proactively disclose it in any prosecution where they may be called as a witness,\" Tuttle wrote in an email.\n\nMcCarter is seeking an unspecified amount in damages related to her loss of income and the trauma she said she endured as part of her arrest. According to her lawsuit, the experience left her with post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideations, and medical bills for in-patient counseling she sought for her PTSD. She was suspended from both her job and her master's program during the case, and she opted for a hysterectomy instead of a simpler medical procedure out of fear she'd be incarcerated and not receive adequate medical care for her condition.\n\nIn an interview, she said she hopes lawmakers in Albany, New York, will take note of the alleged misconduct in her case and review laws that protect police, prosecutors, and judges. She said, \"The legislature actually prevents the accountability necessary in a just society to stop these abuses of power.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "What It Means for Trump's Campaign to Start in Waco\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nHolding his first rally near the site of an infamous federal raid could be seen as \"a coded message to those on the extreme.\"\n\nEvery revolutionary movement needs martyrs. The modern U.S. militant right­ has long had its own, and the most important among them have been dead for three decades: the 70-plus men, women, and children killed in the spring of 1993 at the conclusion of a 51-day government siege at a compound outside the Central Texas city of Waco. They were members of an armed Christian sect, unfamiliar and isolated, and for many Americans, Waco was another footnote in the country's long history of violence. In the worldview of right-wing militancy, however, Waco is foundational: a gory testament to the dangers of gun control and the deadly power of federal authorities. Waco fueled the rise of the militia movement in the 1990s and inspired the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995; it continues to influence contemporary militant thinking. All of this should be borne in mind when Donald Trump holds the first official rally of his 2024 presidential campaign in Waco on Saturday.\n\nIn the run-up to the rally, Trump hasn't mentioned the events of 1993. Instead, he has grabbed hold of the news cycle by warning of his potential indictment and arrest over an alleged campaign finance violation in 2016 and evoking the specter of violence. He urged his followers to \"PROTEST, TAKE OUR NATION BACK!\" He warned that an indictment could lead to \" death and destruction \" and \" create years of hatred, chaos, and turmoil .\" He added : \"They are not coming after me. They are coming after you. I'm just standing in their way.\" These statements channel the same anxieties that Waco has long stirred about the existential danger of a federal government controlled by Democrats.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nOath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes - who was convicted last fall of seditious conspiracy for his role on January 6, 2021, the last time Trump called on his followers to defend him - told me in an interview before his arrest that he'd seen the \"existential slaughter\" of Waco as \"a huge wake-up call.\" Mike Vanderboegh, founder of the Three Percenters, another national militant group whose members were charged over January 6, viewed Waco similarly. It made him and other militia leaders believe they could be the government's next victims. Before his 2016 death, Vanderboegh told the historian Robert Churchill of Waco: \"It scared the crap out of us, and we couldn't count on anybody but ourselves.\" Trump's message to militants on the right has long been that they can count on him. He speaks their language about the \"deep state,\" traitorous liberals, and the potential for civil violence. His presidency marked the first time militant groups felt they had an ally in the White House; neither Vanderboegh nor Rhodes had love for either Bush administration. This was why people from a constellation of groups, from Oath Keepers and Three Percenters to small, little-known outfits around the country, joined the crowd at the Capitol on January 6.\n\nLook just beneath the surface, and you can see Trump and his allies playing directly into the particular fears and narratives of right-wing militancy. On November 19, 2020, Trump attorneys Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani unleashed his campaign's master theory of how the election had been stolen. It went something like this: America's foreign adversaries, including Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China, had teamed up with powerful business interests and politicians to hack Dominion voting machines. It may have sounded strange, but it also fit the outlines of something called the New World Order conspiracy theory. The militant right has been fascinated by this for decades, including in the post-Vietnam era, when the movement was dominated by Ku Klux Klan paramilitaries. The theory can take several forms, the most virulent of which holds that a cabal of elite Jewish businessmen are trying to undermine America and other Western democracies from within to establish a global tyranny; they pay off politicians and sow chaos via animalistic hordes of immigrants and racial and religious minorities. The more palatable version of the story does away with race and religion and keeps the focus on the threat of tyranny at the hands of a globalist elite intent on taking away the rights of patriotic Americans, starting with guns. Rhodes expressed sympathy with the latter version, and Vanderboegh with a less conspiratorial reading of it. Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, was a believer in the former. He thought that Waco previewed a coming battle against the New World Order. In the lead-up to his rally there, Trump and his allies have echoed the New World Order theory, claiming that George Soros, the Jewish American investor and philanthropist, is behind the pending charges against him. Trump called Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney leading the investigation, who is Black, a \"SOROS BACKED ANIMAL.\" The Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance accused Bragg of being \"bought by George Soros,\" pursuing baseless charges against Trump while he \"allows violent criminals to walk the streets.\"\n\nThe investigation, which centers on an alleged hush-money payment by Trump to porn star Stormy Daniels, is arguably the least serious of the litany he faces. This has made it even easier for Trump to bring rank-and-file Republican leaders such as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on board with his persecution narrative. It's the typical dynamic with Trump: an opposition that seems to inadvertently strengthen his hand while he lines up the backing of deeply irresponsible and cynical Republican allies. Yet Trump has been signaling that this campaign will be different from his last two: more divisive and violent in its rhetoric, more revolutionary in its aims, and more openly intertwined with right-wing militancy and its apocalyptic mindset. In a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference this month, he called his 2024 campaign \"the final battle.\"\n\n\"In 2016, I declared, 'I am your voice,'\" he said at the conference. \"Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.\"\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump dances while exiting after speaking during a rally at the Waco Regional Airport on March 25, 2023 in Waco, Texas.\n\nTrump's campaign has denied choosing to hold the rally in Waco because of its history. But the event, which will be held at the city's airport, comes as the violence of 1993 resurfaces in the public consciousness. Last month marked 30 years since the start of the siege, an anniversary that will continue until April 19. Two television series have been launched to coincide with it: a six-part dramatization on Showtime and a three-part documentary on Netflix called \"Waco: American Apocalypse.\"\n\nBack in 1993, the people living in a compound known as Mount Carmel on the outskirts of Waco were members of the Branch Davidians. Their leader, David Koresh, said he was a prophet and that God had spoken to him, telling him to prepare his followers for an apocalyptic battle. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives suspected the Davidians of having an illegal weapons cache in the compound that included machine guns and grenades. Instead of speaking with Koresh, the ATF sent agents to raid the compound in a military-like operation. Four were killed in the ensuing fight, which ended in a ceasefire, requested by the ATF so it could evacuate its wounded and dead. A joint siege of the compound by the ATF and FBI followed, featuring armored vehicles, heavily armed federal agents, and a crush of TV news teams. Then-President Bill Clinton had come into office a month earlier with promises of stricter gun control; some Americans saw their worst fears about gun confiscation and federal overreach coming true. The siege reached its ugly conclusion on April 19, as federal agents again went on the offensive, sparking another shootout and a massive fire inside the compound. The number of Branch Davidians who died was deemed unsettled in a special counsel's report because some of the bodies were commingled and burned beyond recognition.\n\nOn the far right, the Waco dead became martyrs for gun rights and a scare story about the willingness of a Democratic-controlled federal government to violently crush resistance. Militia groups mobilized. Churchill, the historian who interviewed key militia leaders from this period for his definitive book on the movement, put Waco at the center of their motivations, tied closely to Clinton's gun control push, the steady militarization of law enforcement agencies, and an earlier federal raid that had killed the wife and child of a white supremacist in Ruby Ridge in Idaho. The movement was rooted, Churchill wrote, \"in its members' perception that their government had turned increasingly violent.\" One militia leader told him, \"Waco was the second shot heard round the world.\"\n\nMcVeigh, a Gulf War veteran and white nationalist in his 20s, had visited Waco during the siege and was incensed by its bloody outcome. When he set off a truck bomb at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, he billed it as revenge for Waco. He did it on April 19, 1995, the two-year anniversary of the mass death at Mount Carmel.\n\nMilitia leaders of the 1990s condemned McVeigh, but as fears of right-wing militancy spiked and investigative pressure intensified, the movement dwindled. Yet Waco remained central to the militant movement's belief system when it reemerged in 2009 after Barack Obama's election. Vanderboegh, who'd first become a leader in the 1990s, told Churchill in an interview the historian shared with me that he believed the government had sent a message: From now on, it would be \"operating by Waco rules. It's this catch-22: 'We will do anything that you can't keep us from doing.' And it told the rest of us out here, you know, we're kind of paying attention and we're saying, 'We're next year's Davidians, or the year after that. Somebody has got to do something.'\"\n\nThis created a mindset across the movement, Vanderboegh added, that \"[an] attack on one is an attack on all.\"\n\nVanderboegh went on to found the Three Percenters, one of the two largest militant organizations in the post-2009 wave, alongside Rhodes's Oath Keepers. Rhodes hadn't been involved in the movement's earlier iteration but remembered well watching Waco play out on TV as a young libertarian working at a gun store in Nevada. He often cited a quote attributed to Vanderboegh: \"No more free Wacos.\" For Rhodes, it wasn't that the Branch Davidians or Koresh were heroes. In his telling, the story was primarily about the bad guys: the Clinton-led government and mainstream politicians and journalists who, as he saw it, \"dehumanized\" the hard-line Christian gun owners cordoned off in their compound. This dehumanization, he believed, helped to pave the way for the government violence that followed. He worried about a similar dynamic playing out in the political and media climate of the present day. Rhodes, who has a law degree from Yale and is of Mexican descent, seemed to sympathize with one Waco victim in particular: Douglas Wayne Martin, a Black, Harvard-educated attorney in his 40s. Martin called police when the initial ATF raid began, claiming the government had fired the first shots, and then called a city council member, asking him to contact the media. He died in the compound on April 19, along with three of his children.\n\nIn an interview in the summer of 2021, as he braced for his own possible arrest, Rhodes recounted the arsenal government forces brought in for the Waco siege and raid - armored vehicles, helicopters from the National Guard - and the violence that followed. He saw the heavy-handed government tactics at Waco as designed \"to prove a point, set an example.\" I asked him what point they were making. His response: \"Don't fuck with us.\" On trial last fall for seditious conspiracy, Rhodes cited Waco again, saying that when he'd infamously gotten the Oath Keepers involved in the Bundy Ranch standoff with federal authorities in 2014, it was to keep the Bundy family \"from being Waco'd.\"\n\nThe contradiction, of course, is that there is no overreach greater than overturning an election, which is what Trump tried to do - and what Rhodes aimed to help him accomplish. In open letters in the buildup to January 6, Rhodes asked Trump to overturn the vote and deploy the National Guard to administer a new election, then call the Oath Keepers and other armed Americans to help put down any pushback. Trump's segment of the right, Rhodes included, spent 2020 dehumanizing liberals as traitors and Black Lives Matter protesters as domestic terrorists. The idea that America is already in or approaching a form of autocracy was necessary to justify the idea of launching an anti-democratic power grab of their own.\n\nTom O'Connor, who was an expert on right-wing militant violence in the FBI before retiring in 2019, recalled how Trump's infamous request in a 2020 debate for the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by\" had been taken by members of the group as a call to action. He worried that - whatever Trump might have intended with the rally's location and whatever he might say on Saturday evening - the decision to hold it in Waco will send a powerful signal to those who are listening for it: \"It will be perceived as a coded message of revolution to those on the extreme.\"\n\nI had called up a different former FBI agent, Michael German, after Powell and Giuliani gave their Dominion press conference in November 2020. German had gone undercover in militia groups in the post-Waco era, and he recalled the times during his embeds when the faxes would begin to whir with rumors of black helicopters and warnings that the globalist invasion by forces of the New World Order was finally happening. These were the most dangerous moments, he told me - when militiamen were so paranoid that violence felt more likely. Only in late 2020, the rumor-mongering was happening on a national scale, and the messages were coming from the president and his legal team. As January 6 approached, Rhodes published an open letter urging his members to D.C., \"to stand tall in support of President Trump's fight to defeat the enemies foreign and domestic who are attempting a coup.\"\n\nAt Rhodes's trial, this letter and other extreme rhetoric were used against him. The prosecution never proved that there'd been a plan among Rhodes and the Oath Keepers to storm the Capitol - a fact that gave pause to some journalists observing the proceedings, including me. Prosecutors focused instead on the general sense that Rhodes had given his members that they needed to do something to stop the transfer of power and halt the conspiracy he believed was playing out before it was too late. Trump, more than anyone else, created this sense, yet the buck has not stopped anywhere close to that high. And now again, Trump is asking his supporters to rally to his defense. It reminds me of something Rhodes told me days before his arrest: that Trump had used the Oath Keepers as \" cannon fodder .\" After Rhodes's arrest, Powell reportedly stepped in to fund Rhodes's legal defense. Trump has since vowed that he will pardon January 6 convicts if he returns to the presidency.\n\nI was talking recently about militancy with Eric Robinson, a lawyer who was an official with the Joint Special Operations Command until 2018 and before that worked at the National Counterterrorism Center. His professional focus was overseas, and his study of American militancy is personal in nature. It comes from growing up with an interest in America's Civil War and then seeing one for himself as a captain with the 101st Airborne Division in Baghdad, where he learned, he says, \"what civil war thinks and talks like.\" Robinson noted how poorly the typical label of \"anti-government\" fits the militant groups on the right today. \"They're not anti-government. They're anti-Democrat,\" he said. They see themselves, he added, \"as the legitimate authority\" in America, awaiting the time when they will come to power.\n\nOne trait of a successful insurgency is what military strategists call tactical patience. The Taliban had this mindset. So did insurgents in Iraq: Defeats were temporary, and eventually the war would tilt back in their favor. Members of Al Qaeda in Iraq who were imprisoned during the U.S. occupation could wait it out until their side regained enough power to spring them; one of the first things the Islamic State did when it took the city of Mosul in 2014 was open the jails. This is not to ascribe any similarity between people convicted over January 6 and jailed Islamist militants, except for one: Both are cadres of the committed. I imagine Rhodes and others will be paying close attention to Trump's inaugural rally and wondering what it means for the once and perhaps future president to be giving his speech at the airport in Waco. They might be thinking that all along, time has been on their side.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg Sues Jim Jordan to Block Meddling in Trump Case\n\nFormer President Donald Trump embraces Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio at a rally in November 2022. Michael Conroy/AP\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has filed a lawsuit against Congressman Jim Jordan, telling the Ohio Republican to back off the DA's case against Donald Trump.\n\nEven before a New York grand jury officially indicted Trump, Jordan and other top House Republicans were threatening Bragg with an investigation of their own, apparently aimed at helping defend the former president.\n\nBragg's lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court, asks a judge to block a subpoena that Jordan issued to attorney Mark Pomerantz, who left Bragg's office last year. Bragg also wants the judge to prohibit Jordan from continuing to \"harass\" the Manhattan prosecutor's office.\n\nBack on March 20-well before Bragg's grand jury indicted Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records-Jordan, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, and two other Republicans sent Bragg a letter accusing him of leading a politically motivated investigation into Trump. The Republicans demanded that Bragg provide Congress with details of his probe. Jordan argued that Bragg's interest in prosecuting Trump-\"while adopting progressive criminal justice policies that allow career 'criminals [to] run[ ] the streets' of Manhattan-requires congressional scrutiny about how public safety funds appropriated by Congress are implemented by local law-enforcement agencies.\"\n\nLast week, Jordan also subpoenaed Pomerantz, a longtime white collar crime prosecutor who Bragg's predecessor, Cy Vance Jr., had brought into the DA's office to help investigate any potential Trump-related crimes. Pomerantz quit after Bragg took over, citing frustrations with Bragg's initial unwillingness to pursue criminal charges against Trump. Pomerantz later wrote a book about his decision and his belief that Trump has committed numerous crimes.\n\nJordan has also taken to both television and Twitter to attack Bragg.\n\nAlvin Bragg allowed Charles Lindsay, a notorious gang member, to walk free from four felony charges if Lindsay attended five \"counseling sessions.\"\n\nBut if you're a Republican running for president, you're held to a different standard of \"justice.\"\n\n- Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) April 1, 2023\n\nIn a Fox News interview, Jordan even threatened to subpoena Bragg himself and warned that if Bragg resisted, \" everything is on the table. \"\n\nBragg and Jordan have continued to trade jabs-Jordan has said he wants to hold a Judiciary Committee hearing in Manhattan to highlight what he believes are high crime rates, while a Bragg aide countered that cities in Jordan's home state had higher crime rates.\n\nBragg's lawsuit is an escalation in the back-and-forth, however, with the request that a federal judge force Jordan to drop his subpoena of Pomerantz. In the complaint, Bragg points out that he's a local prosecutor and that Congress has no power to interfere with local criminal investigations. What Jordan and his GOP colleagues are really doing, Bragg says in the suit, is trying to create \"a retaliatory political circus designed to undermine the rule of law and New York's police power.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

He could be imprisoned if he commits a crime during that period.\n\nThe seemingly lenient deal comes about a week after US Attorney General Pam Bondi launched a \"Weaponization Working Group,\" which she said would examine \"federal cooperation with the weaponization\" by Bragg and New York Attorney General Letitia James \"to target President Trump, his family, and his businesses.\" In remarks to reporters after his plea Tuesday, Bannon urged Bondi to launch criminal investigations into Bragg and James.\n\nBannon last year served four months in federal prison in Connecticut for contempt of Congress; he had refused to comply with a subpoena from the House January 6 committee. Bannon was also named last year as co-conspirator in a federal racketeering and fraud cases against Bannon's former patron, exiled Chinese mogul Guo Wengui. Bannon was not charged in that case. Guo and another codefendant were convicted and remain imprisoned.\n\nFederal prosecutors in 2020 charged Bannon and three other men with defrauding \"hundreds of thousands of donors\" to a crowdfunding campaign called \"We Build the Wall,\" which raised more than $25 million in private money to support Donald Trump's promised border wall. Brian Kolfage, the founder and effort, had assured donors he would not take a salary, but prosecutors said that the defendants arranged to secretly pay Kolfage more than $350,000, in part with funds routed through a separate non-profit Bannon ran. Federal prosecutors alleged that Bannon-who was famously arrested aboard Guo's $28 million yacht-also used We Build the Wall to pay his own personal expenses.\n\nHours before leaving office in 2021, Trump pardoned Bannon, who was a v ocal supporter of Trump's lies about the 2020 election. The other three defendants, who Trump did not pardon, received prison sentences of three to five years.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's office hit Bannon with similar charges in 2022, in a case Bannon has claimed was politically motivated. In a hearing in November, prosecutors in the case revealed that Bannon was initially wary of the wall fundraising effort.\n\n\"Isn't this a scam?\" Bannon wrote in an email read in court by Manhattan prosecutor Jeffrey Levinson. \"You can't build the wall for this much money.\" Bannon, according to Levinson, later added: \"Poor Americans shouldn't be using hard-earned money to chase something not doable.\"\n\nBannon changed his mind, Levinson said, after realizing that he could use the effort to make money for his own nonprofit group.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "How the Right Explains Trump's Authoritarian Logic to Themselves\n\nSteven Wilson\n\nLast year, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg unsealed a criminal indictment against former President Donald Trump for 34 counts of falsifying business records. To right-wing pundits, this amounted to a declaration of war-a \" legal jihad ,\" in the words of a Wall Street Journal op-ed. It was only one of a series of indictments . And Trump, along with his clique, needed an explanation of how all this was just a witch hunt. In the spinning of Trump's crimes, a portmanteau has appeared that holds the logic of their argument: \"lawfare.\"\n\nIn July, Trump's defense team used it in a motion to toss out his guilty verdict. At this summer's National Conservatism Conference, John Yoo (of the torture memos ) and John Eastman (of the coup memos ) discussed \" Lawfare: The Criminalization of Politics .\" House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan even proposed legislation that would \" defund the lawfare activities \" of state and federal prosecutors.\n\nAs institutions prove their independence by holding Trump accountable, he calls them corroded, arguing that he must be allowed to further break laws and democratic norms to fix them.\n\n\"We want to restore both the perception and the reality of respect in the judicial system,\" Elon Musk told Trump in a rambling two-hour X interview on August 12. \"Just, you know, stop the lawfare.\"\n\nThe timing is important. Trump and his allies intensified attacks on the legal system only after the former president was on the losing end of it. Trump has long campaigned on restoring law and order. But what to do when he's held to it? The corrupt courts came after me, he tells us, and they could come after you, too. Unless, of course, the country reelects Trump to clean it all up.\n\nIt's tempting to flatter myself with the idea that the former president is suddenly obsessed with Lawfare , the online publication focused on national security and threats to democracy where I work as managing editor. But the right's version of lawfare-and other Trumpian variants such as the redundant \"legal lawfare\"-have taken a longer, stranger journey to Trump's Truth Social page. The term's modern usage is often attributed to Air Force Maj. General Charles J. Dunlap Jr. Reacting to debates about war strategies used during the 1999 Kosovo campaign and in the wake of 9/11, Dunlap defined it as \"the use of law as a weapon of war.\" He later clarified lawfare as a value-neutral tool, but many still use it pejoratively.\n\nIn the 2010s, the word \"lawfare\" moved to the domestic politics of South America. When progressive leaders like Brazil's Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Argentina's Cristina Fernández de Kirchner faced dubious corruption charges, the Anglicism \"lawfare\" appeared nearly daily in speeches and media stories. Kirchner in particular called out the use of manipulative legal procedures to delegitimize progressive leaders.\n\nTrump and his supporters are doing more than merely swapping left with right. In August, the former president told Musk that lawfare is something that happens \" in banana republics and third world countries ,\" an unprecedented phenomenon in the United States until his prosecutions in New York, Georgia, and other jurisdictions. Crying lawfare helps Trump cultivate an image of America akin to a corrupt Latin American country-a banana republic he alone can redeem. (Trump's team has warned his legal woes mean America is becoming like \"Cuba and Venezuela.\")\n\nThe lawfare label thus lends an ironic twist to his legal proceedings. As institutions prove their independence by holding Trump accountable for breaking laws and democratic norms, he calls them corroded, arguing that he must be allowed to further break laws and democratic norms to fix them. Trump's recent embrace of the term lawfare reflects his understanding of law as a pliable means to a political end, rather than a check on power and an impartial instrument of justice. For an emerging right, all is fair in law and war.\n\n\"You have to retaliate against them in exactly the same way until you get some deterrence,\" Yoo reportedly said on the NatCon panel. \"If we're not going to become a banana republic, unfortunately we're going to have to use banana republic means.\" Another recent Newsweek op-ed captures the right's have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too lawfare. \"If we want to get back to 'neutrality' [of the law] at this perilous point,\" author Josh Hammer writes , \"it's going to first take bloodying up some noses.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Why Trump's Sleaziest Criminal Case Is So Important\n\nDonald Trump appears at a Manhattan criminal court on February 15, 2024, for a hearing in his porn-star/hush-money case. Brendan McDermid/AP\n\nEditor's note: The below article first appeared in David Corn's newsletter, Our Land . The newsletter comes out twice a week (most of the time) and provides behind-the-scenes stories and articles about politics, media, and culture. Subscribing costs just $5 a month-but you can sign up for a free 30-day trial of Our Land here .\n\nSince the beginning of Donald Trump's indictment-o-rama, the politerati have considered the criminal case filed in New York City against the former president by District Attorney Alvin Bragg to be a sideshow. Though this case has key elements of a bona fide scandal-porn star! hush money! alleged extramarital affair!-pundits and politicos have struck a dismissive attitude toward Trump's Stormy Daniels mess and the legal peril it poses him. Perhaps because it's not as weighty a matter as swiping top-secret documents or attempting to overturn an election by subverting the constitutional order of the republic. Also perhaps because this caper involves the less-sexy charge of falsifying business records to hide a possible violation of election law. Bor -ing, right?\n\nYet on Thursday, a New York City judge kicked aside a Trump motion to cancel the prosecution and set a trial date for March 25. Presuming there are no postponements in this case, this means the first criminal trial of a former president will focus on Trump's effort to pay off an adult movie actor in the weeks before the 2016 election. Up to now, the presumption was that special counsel Jack Smith's election interference case against Trump would come before a jury first, with Smith's stolen-documents case, the Georgia RICO case, and the Bragg case lagging behind. But Trump has successfully delayed the two Smith trials with assorted motions and maneuvers, and the Georgia case has hit its own snag, as District Attorney Fani Willis has had to defend herself against the allegation that her romantic relationship with a fellow prosecutor working on the case somehow amounts to a conflict of interest.\n\nIt might be fitting that the sleaziest case will go first. But this prosecution ought not to be diminished. It also involves alleged criminal actions taken to influence an election-or prevent an election from being influenced by Daniels' claim that Trump had a tryst with her at a 2006 charity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe while his wife, Melania, was home with 4-month-old Barron. And here's an important fact: The Justice Department and a federal court have already declared that a crime occurred in the commission of this $130,000 payoff.\n\nThose of you who might need a refresher course in the Trump-Daniels Affair are fortunate. About a year ago, I published a comprehensive rundown of this nasty business based on court records and public accounts. If you believe possessing a thorough knowledge of all this will impress your friends, you should read this article . But for our purposes now, you only need to recall this: Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to arranging the bribe paid to Daniels, and he was sent to the hoosegow for that and other infractions of the law. That is, a crime did happen. The question now is whether Trump will be held accountable for it.\n\nIt's tough to keep track of all of Trump's legal woes. But you might remember that when the feds were prosecuting Cohen, they referred to Trump as \"Individual-1\" in their court filings. In the sentencing memo that the US attorney's office filed in December 2018 after Cohen pleaded guilty to making an illegal campaign contribution with the Daniels payment and to other unrelated charges, the prosecutors stated that regarding that payoff to Daniels, Cohen \"acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1.\"\n\nTrump's Justice Department said the hush-money payment was a federal crime, and its prosecutors declared in an official proceeding that Trump had been a co-conspirator and caused this crime to be committed. Yet nothing happened to Trump. Cohen was shipped off to federal prison in upstate New York to serve two and a half years.\n\nThis episode raised the question of high-level corruption. Following the resolution of Cohen's case, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York intended to continue investigating the matter, which could have included further probing Trump's role. But in his book, Holding the Line , Geoffrey Berman, who served as the US attorney for the Southern District, revealed that Bill Barr, who became attorney general around this time, tried to kill \"the ongoing investigation\"-and that Barr in a \"highly unusual\" move suggested that Cohen's conviction be reversed. Berman wondered if Barr's goal was \"to ensure that the president could not be charged after leaving office.\"\n\nIt was classic: The boss got off; the lieutenant did the time. Bragg seeks to remedy this unfairness. Legal experts will tell you that the case-with its 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide the $130,000 payment-is not a slam dunk. But it is important. As Norm Eisen, a former Obama White House counsel, puts it, \"It is really an election interference case-the gateway drug to what later developed with election interference in 2020.\" And in the aftermath of Trump's $83 million loss in the sexual assault and defamation civil case brought against him by E. Jean Carroll, a trial that showcases Trump's alleged infidelity could reinforce negative attitudes about his personal conduct.\n\nAnd there's more: This is a state prosecution, not a federal affair. Should Trump be convicted in this case, he could not pardon himself if he were to return to the White House. Nor could he order this case shut down were it to last that long due to appeals. One wonders what might happen if Trump is sentenced to prison and he wins the election. Will he defy the New York legal system? Will marshals from the Empire State seek to haul him in and find themselves in a standoff with Secret Service agents? As bizarre as the Trump years have been, they can become wilder.\n\nWhile it made sense for Smith to go first with a trial related to Trump's effort to end American democracy, that's not what's in the script now. The hush-money case, which forces Americans to once more confront Trump's scuzziness, ought not to be scoffed at. It reveals so much about the man: his phoniness, his personal dishonesty, his hypocrisy, his corruption. Of his many alleged crimes, it may not be the greatest. But it may be the Trumpiest.\n\nDavid Corn's American Psychosis: A Historical Investigation of How the Republican Party Went Crazy , a New York Times bestseller, has been released in a new and expanded paperback edition.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Manhattan Prosecutor Promises Security After Trump Calls for Protests\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks to reporters before his speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference on March 4, 2023 in National Harbor, Maryland. Anna Moneymaker/Getty\n\nHistory has shown that when Donald Trump calls for protests, violence may be around the corner. So when the former president lashed out at the Manhattan prosecutor's office on Saturday, District Attorney Alvin Bragg had to prepare for the worst.\n\n\"Our law enforcement partners will ensure that any specific or credible threats against the office will be fully investigated and that the proper safeguards are in place so all 1,600 of us have a secure work environment,\" Bragg wrote in an email to staff on Saturday. He didn't mention Trump by name, referring only to \"public comments surrounding an ongoing investigation by this office.\"\n\nThose public comments came from Trump on Saturday morning, amid reports that he could soon be indicted in New York for possible campaign finance violations. \"THE FAR & AWAY LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE & FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WILL BE ARRESTED ON TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"PROTEST, TAKE OUR NATION BACK!\"\n\nIf they can come for Trump, they will come for you.\n\nThis type of stuff only occurs in third world authoritarian nations.\n\n- Rep Andy Biggs (@RepAndyBiggsAZ) March 18, 2023\n\nBragg's email reassured employees that the office is continuing to coordinate on security matters with the NYPD, as well as with the prosecutor's own security officers and the state court system. ABC's Jon Karl reported on Sunday that an online watchdog had noted that some Trump supporters are beginning to call for violence.\n\nBragg's office is reportedly nearing the end of its investigation into Trump's alleged hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. (Trump denies having an affair with Daniels.) Michael Cohen-the former Trump attorney and fixer who pleaded guilty in 2018 to making the payments-testified before a New York grand jury this week. Trump was also invited to testify, which is generally one of the final stages of a grand jury investigation.\n\nAs Mother Jones' Russ Choma pointed out , a sudden arrest of Trump on Tuesday would be highly unusual:\n\nWhite collar criminals are typically given the opportunity to turn themselves in, and any courthouse appearance by Trump would be a highly choreographed affair involving the Secret Service, worked out well in advance.\n\nTrump's supporters claim that any arrest would only help him win back the presidency next year. \"If they indict Trump on fake charges,\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said on Lindell TV, \"he is going to win 2024 in a landslide victory.\"\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu-a Republican who has said the party should move on from Trump-had a similar take Sunday on CNN's State of the Union . \"I think it's building a lot of sympathy for the former president,\" he said. \"It does drastically change the paradigm as we go into the 2024 election.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Judge Fines Trump $9,000 and Threatens to Throw Him in Jail\n\nDonald Trump at Manhattan criminal court Justin Lane/Pool Photo/AP\n\nThe judge overseeing Donald Trump's New York criminal trial fined the former president $9,000 on Tuesday for violating a gag order-and he warned Trump that any further violations might result in jail time.\n\nTrump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records for his role in a 2016 scheme to cover up an alleged extra-marital affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels. (Trump denies any affair.) As in other recent legal proceedings involving Trump, the judge in the New York case, Juan Merchan, issued a gag order prior to the trial. That order was relatively narrow, prohibiting the former president from attacking or denigrating jurors, witnesses, court employees, prosecutors or their families. Criticism specifically of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who is bringing the charges, as well as of Merchan himself, was not prohibited by the order.\n\nLast week, prosecutors said Trump had already violated the gag order 10 times in just the opening days of the trial and asked for a $1,000 fine for each instance. Merchan, in his ruling, found that Trump had indeed violated the order in nine instances-in one, in which Trump reposted someone else's statements on his Truth Social platform, Merchan said it wasn't clear that it was Trump's own statement.\n\nThe fine of $9,000 is a relatively paltry sum, and not just because of Trump's wealth. In the civil fraud trial last fall in which Trump was found liable for more than $450 million, Trump was fined $15,000 for two violations of a similar gag order. Merchan, in his ruling, acknowledged that Tuesday's contempt fine might not be large enough to deter Trump from future violations, but he noted that it was the maximum amount allowed by law.\n\n\"While $1,000 may suffice in most instances to protect the dignity of the judicial system, to compel respect for its mandates and to punish the offender for disobeying a court order, it unfortunately will not achieve the desired result in those instances where the contemnor can easily afford such a fine,\" Merchan wrote, adding that if it was up to him, he could image a fine of as much as $150,000 being more appropriate.\n\nBut, Merchan wrote, since he can't level that kind of fine, he may have to contemplate something more serious that money.\n\n\"Because this Court is not cloaked with such discretion, it must therefore consider whether in some instances, jail may be a necessary punishment,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nMerchan will hold a hearing on Thursday to consider three additional possible violations of the gag order. To fully abide by Merchan's order today, Trump must delete seven posts from Truth Social and two posts from his campaign website by 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday. He must also pay the $9,000 fine by Friday.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Under Cross-Examination, Michael Cohen Spills About His Past With Trump\n\nMother Jones; Laura Brett/ZUMA; Jane Rosenberg/AP\n\nDonald Trump's criminal trial for engineering a hush money scheme-to save his 2016 campaign from a slew of stories about his infidelities-entered its dramatic final stages on Tuesday, as his former fixer, Michael Cohen, completed his testimony for the prosecution. Then, just as Trump's attorneys seemed poised to attack, the former president's defense team was surprisingly ginger when finally given a chance to strike back. Tuesday began, as Monday ended, with prosecutors walking the normally voluble and combative Cohen through his story, calmly explaining how Trump okayed every step of the scheme to pay off adult film star Stormy Daniels for keeping quiet about a sexual encounter she testified to having with Trump. As the prosecution's case wound down, tension was high in the courtroom. Trump's lawyers were expected to come out swinging at Cohen, attacking Cohen's credibility and long history of lying (much of it for Trump's benefit, he has said).\n\nTrump attorney Todd Blanche started with a sneering jab at Cohen, asking him if they had ever met-and when Cohen said they hadn't, asking if Cohen had indeed once described Blanche as \"a crying little shit\" on TikTok. Cohen agreed it was the type of thing he would say, and that was as hostile as the afternoon got. Blanche seemed to wobble through a series of questions designed to make Cohen confirm that he had previously lied, and did, indeed, harbor a deep dislike for his former employer. Among other odd bits of testimony that Blanche elicited from Cohen were confirmations that:\n\nThe cross-examination will continue on Thursday, but so far has been a far cry from the Trump team's attack on Cohen during last fall's civil fraud trial-where Cohen also testified, and where Trump's lawyers didn't hold back, repeatedly trying to provoke Cohen and even taunting him about whether he lied to his wife. In that case, Trump's attorneys repeatedly engaged in shouting matches with Cohen, who quickly became flustered. On Tuesday, however, Cohen remained calm throughout his testimony, answering slowly and methodically as Blanche probed.\n\nEven Trump, who at the fraud trial was a noisy presence while his ex-fixer testified, sat quietly, eyes mostly closed, as Cohen-whom several judges have had to issue gag orders to keep Trump from attacking outside court-spoke.\n\nThe trial will likely finish up next week. Cohen is the linchpin of the prosecution's case against Trump, and prosecutors said on Tuesday that he would be their final witness. Trump's attorneys told Judge Juan Merchan that they have very limited plans for calling witnesses, but are still undecided on having Trump take the stand in his own defense.\n\nDespite the subdued cross-examination, on Tuesday morning, Cohen repeatedly delivered for prosecutors, with testimony that flowed smoothly from the previous day. Cohen testified on Monday how he orchestrated payoffs to adult film star Stormy Daniels and others who, in the closing weeks before the 2016 election, threatened to go public with embarrassing stories about Trump. In Daniels' case, it was a story of a sexual encounter at a golf tournament which, on the stand, she refused to call either a relationship or romantic. Despite reaching an agreement to pay Daniels $130,000, and Trump insisting that the deal get done, Cohen couldn't get Trump to pay out the money in the final days before the election, and opted to supply it himself. On Tuesday, he detailed his efforts to get repaid, testifying that, while in the White House, Trump personally signed off on payments to reimburse Cohen in the guise of legal fees. Cohen barely did any legal work, he said.\n\nCohen also testified that when word leaked out about the coverup in 2018, Trump urged him to stay loyal and keep his mouth shut.\n\n\"'Don't worry. I'm the President of the United States. There's nothing here. Everything's going to be OK. Stay tough,'\" Cohen said Trump told him the last time they spoke. \"You're going to be okay.'\"\n\nBut, Cohen said, he wasn't okay when he became a target of then-FBI Director Robert Mueller's investigation. At that point, Cohen said, turning to jurors and appearing emotional, he had a conversation with his family, who questioned why he was clinging to his allegiance to his old boss, who had done so little for him since taking office.\n\n\"Why are you holding onto this loyalty? What are you doing? We're supposed to be your first loyalty,\" Cohen said his family asked him.\n\nProsecutors also guided Cohen through some of his lowest moments-his plan to use his once-close relationship with Trump to sell access to him after he was elected, his repeated and flagrant lying on the former president's behalf, and his conviction for making the payments to Daniels and another woman, for which he served a year in prison. Discussing those low points was part of a strategy by prosecutors to get ahead of attacks by Trump's legal team-which, at least initially, did not come.\n\nUltimately, the case may come down to which version of Cohen jurors believe: the temperamental, toadying, vengeful serial liar, who Trump's attorneys tried to draw out with their barbed attacks, or a formerly temperamental, toadying, vengeful serial liar, who now professes remorse for his subservience to Trump. Cohen, for his part, seemed very willing to confess his sins under direct examination from prosecutors. Over the course of his day-and-a-half of testimony, Cohen described how he sought Trump's attention, buying properties in his buildings and then offering his services as a hyperbolic attack dog who would rage against anyone threatening Trump's success-long before he ran for president. Cohen also talked, at length, about how he constantly returned to Trump to detail his exploits in what he acknowledged were desperate attempts to win approval and affection.\n\nBy the time Blanche got his turn to attack Cohen and his credibility, Cohen seemed to have confessed to almost everything Blanche tried to ask about. One of the biggest revelations from the initial cross-examination may be that, despite Trump's repeated efforts to portray the case against him as a conspiracy closely controlled by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Cohen testified that he has never personally met Bragg.\n\nBefore the day's testimony began, excitement for the expected drama was running high outside the court. There were no signs of any protesters-either for Trump or against him-but a crowd of over one hundred curious members of the public began lining up as early as 4 a.m. to secure a coveted seat in the courtroom, or a nearby overflow courtroom where the trial is being shown live. Many of the hopefuls appeared older or retired, and seemed most excited to see liberal commentators passing by on their way into the courthouse. But most of those in line were disappointed, with only about 20 tickets handed out for admission to the courtrooms; several dozen journalists were left without a ticket as well. One man, who seemed to be a Trump supporter, was berated for cutting the line and refusing to give up his ticket.\n\nAs it became clear that only a few would be able to attend, at least one person towards the back of the queue paid a woman at the front $350 in cash to get in-she had earlier rejected an offer of $80. Given the anti-climactic tone of the afternoon's testimony, the buyer may regret his largesse.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Did Trump Push the NY Judge Too Far?\n\nMother Jones; Steven Senne/AP\n\nOnce again, former President Donald Trump is about to find out just how far he can push a judge. On Tuesday morning, Trump's attorneys faced an angry barrage of questions from New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan, demanding they explain why Trump should not be fined for what prosecutors in his hush-money case say was \"willfully and flagrantly\" violating a gag order Merchan imposed on March 26.\n\nThe hearing kicked off the second day of testimony in the historic case that focuses on whether Trump had falsified business records to pay off adult film star Stormy Daniels, among others, to keep negative stories about him from getting out in the runup to the 2016 election. It's the first time a former president has been charged criminally, but it is just one of several criminal cases Trump is currently facing. Trump has admitted he made the payments but has denied that he had an affair with Daniels. On Monday, his attorneys said Trump had not committed any crime, he was simply trying to \"influence an election. It's called democracy.\" But, prosecutors say that the steps that Trump and his allies-including both Trump Organization staff and campaign workers-took to make those payments and keep the stories secret amount to a criminal conspiracy.\n\nBut before testimony could begin, Merchan spent most of Tuesday morning focused on whether Trump had violated the gag order Merchan imposed in March. The judge did so after Trump repeatedly spread rumors about Merchan's daughter and denigrated several potential witnesses. The order allows Trump to complain about Merchan and Manhattan Attorney General Alvin Bragg, but forbids him from making \"threatening, inflammatory, denigrating\" statements about potential witnesses, court employees or their families, or jurors. At Tuesday's hearing, prosecutors said they had ten instances of Trump violating that order when he complained about his former fixer Michael Cohen-likely to be a witness in the case-and reposting commentary from Fox News host Jesse Watters that alleged there was a conspiracy to sneak \"undercover liberal activists\" onto the jury.\n\nBragg's office proposed a $1,000 fine for each violation for a total of $10,000.\n\nMerchan did not immediately decide, but he appeared to be deeply irritated by Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, who claimed Trump was just responding to attacks from others. Blanche seemed unable to provide examples, nor could he cite case law supporting his claims, Merchan noted.\n\n\"You've presented nothing,\" Merchan told Blanche.\n\nShortly after this exchange, when Blanche insisted his client was doing his best to abide by the gag order, Merchan appeared to be openly scornful of the claim. \"You're losing all credibility with the court,\" Merchan told the attorney.\n\nThe scene was reminiscent of Trump's civil fraud trial last fall, also in New York, when he was found liable for more than $450 million for defrauding banks and insurance companies. During the trial, Trump used his Truth Social media platform to attack presiding Judge Arthur Engoron, courtroom staff, and several witnesses-including Cohen and Engoron's clerk-until the judge also issued a gag order. After Trump continued his posts, Engoron held a hearing similar to Tuesday's, during which he made Trump himself testify. After Trump claimed he had done nothing wrong, Engoron scornfully declared, \"As the trier of fact, I find that the witness is not credible.\" He fined Trump $15,000 for his gag order violations.\n\nWhile threats of fines of several thousand dollars would amount to a relative pittance compared to Trump's wealth, the former president did tone down his behavior after the ruling and appeared to abide by that gag order-at least for the remainder of Tuesday. Merchan ended the day in court without deciding whether he would fine Trump the $10,000 requested by the prosecutors.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Florida Man Unconditionally Discharged Into Oval Office\n\nMother Jones illustration; Chris Graythen/Getty; Fulton County Sheriff's Office; J.Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe American people have spoken. Donald Trump is the 47th president of the United States.\n\nAt noon Monday, Trump himself spoke, swearing-not especially credibly-that he would \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.\"\n\nA lot of other Americans spoke to get us here, too. More than four years ago, at the very same Capitol where Trump was just sworn in, his supporters spoke. \" Hang Mike Pence ,\" they said.\n\nJust three weeks later, Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican, spoke, journeying to Mar-a-Lago to talk directly to the disgraced former president and to pose obsequiously for the cameras.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell spoke after Trump's second impeachment trial, declaring that Trump's actions had been a \"disgraceful dereliction of duty.\" But the Senate minority leader kept speaking. He insisted that the Senate no longer had any power to convict Trump or to bar him from once again seeking office. Forty-two of McConnell's Republican colleagues spoke in agreement, voting to acquit Trump and to allow his political career to continue.\n\nTrump, of course, never stopped speaking, and he soon announced another run for president.\n\nThen, in quick succession, the prosecutors all spoke. Merrick Garland announced he was appointing Jack Smith, who produced two speaking indictments against the former president. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg spoke, charging Trump with 34 felonies that may, or may not , have actually been felonies. \"This office upholds our solemn responsibility to ensure everyone stands equal before the law,\" Bragg declared . In Georgia, Fulton County DA Fani Willis spoke, charging Trump and his cronies in a 98-page RICO indictment.\n\nThe Colorado Supreme Court spoke, declaring Trump ineligible to run for president. The US Supreme Court spoke , and-unanimously-said the Colorado court was wrong. So then Republican primary voters spoke, choosing Trump as their nominee.\n\nNew York judges and juries spoke-declaring Trump liable of sexual abuse, defamation , and fraud , and convicting him in Bragg's criminal hush-money case-but voters seemed not to be listening. In Georgia, a judge spoke , blasting that state's prosecutors' \"tremendous lapse in judgment\" and \"odor of mendacity\" in a ruling that would ultimately derail Trump's trial there. SCOTUS spoke once again, awarding Trump broad immunity and sending Smith back to the drawing board. In Florida, Judge Aileen Cannon spoke, announcing that Smith's appointment was, somehow, invalid from the very beginning.\n\nIn the meantime, another special counsel, Rob Hur, had spoken, explaining that he wasn't going to charge Joe Biden with crimes because, in part, Biden seemed to be \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" Biden's supporters very much did not want to listen to that-at least until Biden himself spoke at a debate and removed all doubt.\n\nKamala Harris spoke, and briefly restored joy . But she'd spoken before, telling voters that \"Bidenomics is working.\" Voters disagreed, and they disagreed even more when Harris said there was \"not a thing that comes to mind\" that she would have done differently than Biden.\n\nEven as Biden seemed to slowly disappear, he, too, kept speaking-at times in ways that were nearly impossible to comprehend. \"We gotta lock him up,\" Biden said about Trump . \"Politically lock him up. Lock him out.\" Days later, Biden called some number of Trump's supporters \"garbage.\" Then Biden's staff spoke about apostrophes , while Trump rode around in a garbage truck .\n\nOn Election Day, the voters finally spoke, and a plurality said that Trump should return to the White House. Most notably, the people of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona all spoke, supporting the former president whom they'd rejected four years earlier.\n\nSmith spoke again, conceding that his cases against Trump were officially over .\n\nIn New York, Bragg-along with Judge Juan Merchan-pushed on, but there was little left for them to say. With SCOTUS's blessing, Trump's hush-money sentencing went forward. Sort of. Merchan granted the incoming president an \" unconditional discharge ,\" allowing him to return to the White House with no criminal punishment whatsoever.\n\nWhich brings us back to Inauguration Day.\n\n\"The scales of justice will be rebalanced,\" Trump said to applause, shortly after taking the oath. \"The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.\"\n\nWe'll soon discover whether he was speaking truthfully.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

He did just that.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg stands with members of his staff at a news conference following the conviction of former president Donald Trump in his hush-money trial on May 30 in New York City.\n\nImmediately after his historically unprecedented conviction on 34 charges of falsifying business records , Donald J. Trump tried Thursday to suggest that the jury's decision was an affront to democracy. \"The real verdict is going to be November 5th by the people. And they know what happened here and everybody knows what happened here,\" said the presumptive Republican nominee for president of the United States, before he ripped into the prosecutor who brought the case, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. \"You have a Soros-backed DA and the whole thing. We didn't do anything wrong. I'm a very innocent man.\"\n\nAs usual, Trump got it wrong.\n\nTrump was not convicted in spite of democracy. He was convicted because of democracy.\n\nAlvin Bragg pursued Trump as an elected prosecutor, a popularly chosen law enforcement officer who did the job that voters assigned him.\n\nIn 2021, Manhattan voters were asked to fill one of the most powerful prosecutorial positions in the country. Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance Jr. had chosen not to seek a fourth term. Bragg won an eight-way Democratic primary, defeating veteran local, state and federal prosecutors, a civil rights attorney, a legislator, and a public defender who had had been a competitor on Survivor and The Amazing Race . Bragg then went on to defeat a Republican criminal defense lawyer, who had a record as a local prosecutor and top lawyer with the US Army Judge Advocate General's Corps, by a landslide 84-16 margin.\n\nBragg did not obtain his position in a backroom deal. He did not get it via official scheming, or some arrangement to \"get Trump,\" as the former president imagines. He was elected.\n\nBragg won the support of hundreds of thousands of voters because they recognized his striking experience as a distinguished Harvard Law School graduate who had served as the chief of litigation and investigations for the New York City Council, an assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and chief deputy attorney general of New York State. He ran with the influential support of the New York Times editorial board , which described the candidate as \"a talented prosecutor with the endorsement of former colleagues across the wide swath of the legal system\" and argued that he offered \"the experience, the nimbleness and the moral compass Manhattan needs.\"\n\nOn the basis of his experience, Bragg ran as the candidate who was ready and willing to hold the wealthy and the powerful, including when necessary former presidents, to account. He reminded voters that, as a state prosecutor, \"I have sued Trump over 100 times. I can't change that fact, nor would I. That was important work.\"\n\nMoreover, Bragg used his experience to distinguish himself from Vance. \"The district attorney, [Bragg] argued, had appeared soft on the rich and powerful, declining to prosecute two of Trump's children several years earlier on accusations that they misled potential buyers in the struggling Trump SoHo condo-hotel,\" noted the Times .\n\nBragg never suggested that he would cut corners, or be unfair, when it came to bringing the felony case that would ultimately make Trump the first former president in US history to be a convicted felon. What he promised was that he would not blink. He would not shy away from doing the job he was assigned by the electorate, and that he was duty-bound under the law to perform.\n\nBragg kept the promise that he made as a candidate to pursue equal justice under the law. And he did so with appropriate focus and determination.\n\nWhile the US Department of Justice, under the overly cautious leadership of Attorney General Merrick Garland, moved at a glacial pace on federal charges against Trump, Bragg and his team were rigorous and efficient. They understood the challenges associated with bringing a state case involving Trump's effort to hide the details of a dalliance with a porn star from the electorate in advance of the 2016 presidential election. Yet they chose to go forward. When the charges came down in 2023, long before federal prosecutors stepped up, the Manhattan DA was mocked and jeered for seeking felony convictions in a case that critics suggested was more about embarrassing behavior than compelling illegality.\n\nA Politico headline from the spring of 2023 announced, \"Bragg's case against Trump hits a wall of skepticism-even from Trump's critics.\"\n\nTrump regularly claimed that the Manhattan district attorney was nothing more than a stooge of liberal billionaire George Soros, who has in recent years supported efforts to elect supporters of criminal justice reform to prosecutor positions across the country. But Soros explained in 2023 that he had never met Bragg, nor earmarked direct campaign contributions to the DA's 2021 campaign. Trump's attacks on Bragg, who is Black, and Soros, who is Jewish, were so persistent, and so ugly, that Magda Teter, a professor of history and the Shvidler Chair in Judaic Studies at Fordham University, observed , \"With these attacks, Trump and his supporters, including Trump-supporting media outlets, tapped into deep-rooted antisemitic and racist ideas of Jewish power and Black gullibility, thus connecting antisemitism and racism.\"\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nTrump allies in Congress, led by House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan of Ohio, accused Bragg of neglecting the work of prosecuting street crime in order to pursue pursuing \"a radical political agenda.\"\n\nThe political pressure has been intense. Yet Bragg is, at least to some extent, insulated from that pressure by the fact that he is not an appointed prosecutor. He does not report to the White House or, for that matter, to Jim Jordan. Bragg is an elected district attorney, who respects his duty to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law, and the voters who put him in a position to hold the powerful to account.\n\nThat, despite what Donald Trump suggests, is not an assault on the will of the people that must be rectified in November. It is the very essence of democracy, extending from Bragg's 2021 election to the courtroom where Trump was fairly and responsibly prosecuted, and fairly and responsibly convicted.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

(Photo by Spencer Platt / Getty Images)\n\nWhen Thomas Dewey, arguably the most nationally prominent Manhattan district attorney before Alvin Bragg, was running for the post in 1937, he made it clear that he was prepared to go after political wrongdoers. A young special prosecutor who had made a name for himself taking on gangsters, Dewey announced his candidacy on the Republican Party line because, he said, he believed it was necessary to go after Tammany Hall , the Democratic political machine that once dominated the politics of New York City. He said, \"[I]t has become clear to me that there is an alliance between crime and certain elements of Tammany Hall. For twenty years Tammany Hall has controlled criminal prosecutions and for twenty years the power of the criminal underworld has grown. This alliance must be broken.\" Dewey got plenty of blowback from Democratic politicians, who charged that he planned to politicize the DA's office. US Representative Martin Kennedy, a Tammany defender, attacked Dewey as \" cowardly and contemptible \" and suggested that the Republican was prepared to waste taxpayer dollars on \"investigating everything from City Hall to the White House.\" Yet, come November, the overwhelmingly Democratic borough of Manhattan (New York County) elected Dewey by a landslide. The Tammany crowd continued to attack the new DA, as he kept his promises to follow the facts wherever they led him. But it didn't do Dewey any harm; he was eventually elected as governor of New York and twice nominated as his party's candidate for the presidency. Fast-forward 86 years, and another Manhattan DA is under fierce assault for supposedly wasting resources on \" a political persecution \" that his critics claim has distracted one of the nation's leading law enforcement offices. On Monday, House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) swept into New York City to conduct a hearing that attacked District Attorney Bragg, whose office has secured indictments against Jordan's political ally, former president Donald Trump, on 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. During the course of a bombastic hearing that peddled the line that Manhattan's first Black district attorney was soft on crime and overly tough on Trump, Jordan claimed that the DA's office had \"lost its way when it comes to fighting crime and upholding the law.\" \"Here in Manhattan, the scales of justice are weighed down by politics,\" Jordan raged . \"For the district attorney justice isn't blind-it's about advancing opportunities to promote a political agenda-a radical political agenda.\" More From John Nichols The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" Yesterday 6:41 pm The Pope Who Decried the Savage Inequalities of Billionaire-Class Capitalism April 21, 2025 A Pope Who Prays for Palestine April 20, 2025 Just as the critics of Thomas Dewey failed to gain traction in the New York City of the 1930s, however, Jordan's line of attack bogged down in the New York City of the 2020s. Mayor Eric Adams, a former police captain, rebuked the Judiciary Committee chair on the day of the hearing, saying , \"It is really troubling that American taxpayers' dollars are being used to come here on this junket to do an examination of the safest big city in America instead of focusing on the real over-proliferation of guns that we have witnessed.\" Representative Dan Goldman, a Manhattan Democrat, dismissed the hearing as a \" charade .\" And Former House Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler, also a Manhattan Democrat, announced in his opening statement to the hearing, \"Let me be very clear: We are here today in Lower Manhattan for one reason and one reason only-the chairman is doing the bidding of Donald Trump.\" Crowds of New Yorkers gathered outside the session to protest against Jordan's stunt, with many of them demanding that the chairman \"let the public in\" to the hearing that featured testimony from a handful of New Yorkers but failed to invite the mayor or other local officials. Bragg pushed back just as loudly. The DA sued Jordan for interfering with the effort to prosecute Trump by launching \"an unprecedentedly brazen and unconstitutional attack\" on the prosecutor's office. Countering Jordan's over-the-top claims about crime in the city, the DA's office pointed to fresh New York Police Department data that shows murders in Manhattan are down 14 percent from a year ago, while shootings are down 17 percent, burglaries are down 21 percent, and robberies are down 18 percent. The office also observed, \"In D.A. Bragg's first year in office, New York City had one of the lowest murder rates of major cities in the United States (5.2)-nearly three times lower than Columbus, Ohio (15.4),\" referring to Jordan's home state. \"If the chairman truly cared about public safety, he could take a short drive to Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Akron or Toledo...rather than using taxpayer dollars to travel hundreds of miles out of his way.\" There's plenty of honest debate in legal and political circles about whether the Manhattan DA's office should be taking the lead in holding Trump to account, and about whether so sweeping an indictment for corporate crime violations is the right approach. But there is little doubt that Bragg's decision to go ahead with the prosecution has unsettled Trump's most ardent defenders, including Jordan and the right-wing pundits who were cheering him on Monday. They have made Bragg, a former chief deputy attorney general of New York and assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York, the target of vitriolic attacks that may play well in red states but aren't likely to do the DA much damage in Manhattan. Bragg was nominated with relative ease in 2021 over a crowded field of Democratic primary contenders for the powerful district attorney post, and then won in November with almost 84 percent of the vote . He did so as a candidate who made it clear that he was prepared to initiate criminal justice reforms, as did many of his rivals in that 2021 Democratic field. And he made it equally clear that, if the facts made a case for prosecuting Trump, he would pursue that case. There was no mystery with regard to the course Bragg intended to chart as district attorney, and since taking office he has done what the voters elected him to do. Jordan imagines that he is doing damage to Bragg by \"exposing\" the DA as a politicized prosecutor, just as the Tammany Hall hacks of the 1930s thought they were exposing and damaging Dewey. There are plenty of differences between Bragg and Dewey, and even more differences between the times in which each man took office. But the notion that a congressman from a rival party is going to convince New Yorkers that there is something wrong with a prosecutor's keeping a campaign promise-especially when it's a promise to hold the politically powerful to account-remains as far-fetched today as it was all those decades ago.\n\nDewey got plenty of blowback from Democratic politicians, who charged that he planned to politicize the DA's office.

Jordan imagines that he is doing damage to Bragg by \"exposing\" the DA as a politicized prosecutor, just as the Tammany Hall hacks of the 1930s thought they were exposing and damaging Dewey. There are plenty of differences between Bragg and Dewey, and even more differences between the times in which each man took office. But the notion that a congressman from a rival party is going to convince New Yorkers that there is something wrong with a prosecutor's keeping a campaign promise-especially when it's a promise to hold the politically powerful to account-remains as far-fetched today as it was all those decades ago.\n\nYesterday 6:41 pm\n\nApril 21, 2025\n\nApril 20, 2025\n\nJust as the critics of Thomas Dewey failed to gain traction in the New York City of the 1930s, however, Jordan's line of attack bogged down in the New York City of the 2020s. Mayor Eric Adams, a former police captain, rebuked the Judiciary Committee chair on the day of the hearing, saying , \"It is really troubling that American taxpayers' dollars are being used to come here on this junket to do an examination of the safest big city in America instead of focusing on the real over-proliferation of guns that we have witnessed.\" Representative Dan Goldman, a Manhattan Democrat, dismissed the hearing as a \" charade .\" And Former House Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler, also a Manhattan Democrat, announced in his opening statement to the hearing, \"Let me be very clear: We are here today in Lower Manhattan for one reason and one reason only-the chairman is doing the bidding of Donald Trump.\" Crowds of New Yorkers gathered outside the session to protest against Jordan's stunt, with many of them demanding that the chairman \"let the public in\" to the hearing that featured testimony from a handful of New Yorkers but failed to invite the mayor or other local officials. Bragg pushed back just as loudly. The DA sued Jordan for interfering with the effort to prosecute Trump by launching \"an unprecedentedly brazen and unconstitutional attack\" on the prosecutor's office. Countering Jordan's over-the-top claims about crime in the city, the DA's office pointed to fresh New York Police Department data that shows murders in Manhattan are down 14 percent from a year ago, while shootings are down 17 percent, burglaries are down 21 percent, and robberies are down 18 percent. The office also observed, \"In D.A. Bragg's first year in office, New York City had one of the lowest murder rates of major cities in the United States (5.2)-nearly three times lower than Columbus, Ohio (15.4),\" referring to Jordan's home state. \"If the chairman truly cared about public safety, he could take a short drive to Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Akron or Toledo...rather than using taxpayer dollars to travel hundreds of miles out of his way.\" There's plenty of honest debate in legal and political circles about whether the Manhattan DA's office should be taking the lead in holding Trump to account, and about whether so sweeping an indictment for corporate crime violations is the right approach. But there is little doubt that Bragg's decision to go ahead with the prosecution has unsettled Trump's most ardent defenders, including Jordan and the right-wing pundits who were cheering him on Monday. They have made Bragg, a former chief deputy attorney general of New York and assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York, the target of vitriolic attacks that may play well in red states but aren't likely to do the DA much damage in Manhattan. Bragg was nominated with relative ease in 2021 over a crowded field of Democratic primary contenders for the powerful district attorney post, and then won in November with almost 84 percent of the vote . He did so as a candidate who made it clear that he was prepared to initiate criminal justice reforms, as did many of his rivals in that 2021 Democratic field.

Amid chants of \"Drop her charges,\" \"Free them all,\" and \"Black Lives Matter,\" they were demanding that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg drop all charges against Tracy McCarter , who has been facing murder charges in the death of her estranged husband, Jim Murray. While running for Manhattan district attorney, Bragg publicly tweeted his support for McCarter , stating, \"Prosecuting a domestic violence survivor who acted in self-defense is unjust.\" But since taking office in January 2022, his office continues to prosecute McCarter, after unsuccessful attempts to decrease the charges against her. McCarter's trial is scheduled to begin November 28. Her supporters delivered to Bragg's office more than 21,200 signatures on petitions urging him to drop all charges. Solomon Acevedo attended Monday's rally on behalf of Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. Reminding the crowd that October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, he called Bragg's prosecution \"a systemic issue in what we do when people survive domestic violence by any means.\" Related Article \"The Worst Abuser You Could Ever Have\" Victoria Law On March 2, 2020, McCarter had returned home from her hospital shift when her estranged husband, Jim Murray, rang her buzzer. The couple had been separated for seven months as Murray's alcoholism spiraled out of control, leading to violence against McCarter. That rainy night, she let him into her apartment, planning to let him sleep it off on her couch. Instead, he demanded money. She refused. Murray became violent and McCarter grabbed a kitchen knife to ward him off. Murray ended up with a stab wound in his chest, from which he later died. McCarter was arrested and, because the assistant district attorney stated her intention to seek second-degree (or intentional) murder charges , held without bail. She was sent to Rikers Island, where she spent six months uncharged as the pandemic shut down all court proceedings, including grand jury hearings. In September, a grand jury indicted her for second-degree murder. Shortly after, a judge allowed her release on electronic monitoring. Current Issue View our current issue When asked for comment, Bragg's press team pointed to his proposed plea deal in which McCarter would enter an Alford plea , which does not require an admission of guilt, for second-degree manslaughter and menacing. If she were not arrested during the next year, the manslaughter conviction would be vacated, leaving her only with menacing, which is a misdemeanor. The judge, Diane Kiesel, who authored a 906-page textbook on domestic violence and the law, stated that she would not accept either an Alford plea or a conditional discharge for a murder indictment.

Kiesel denied that motion as well. McCarter is not the only survivor facing prosecution for the death of an abusive loved one. In 2019, Poughkeepsie mother Nikki Addimando was convicted in the shooting death of her boyfriend Christopher Grover. She applied for a sentence reduction under New York's Domestic Violence Survivors Justice Act, but despite her own and multiple other testimonies about the injuries Grover had inflicted on her, the judge denied her application and sentenced her to 19 years to life . She appealed and, in 2021, the state Supreme Court's Appellate Division reduced her sentence to seven and a half years . More recently, in California, Kern County District Attorney Cynthia Zimmer pursued murder charges against Wendy Howard, a 53-year-old mother, in the shooting death of her ex-partner Kelly Pitts. Years earlier, police had investigated Pitts for sexually abusing Howard's older daughter , but the district attorney declined to press charges. At the time of his death, police were also investigating Pitts for sexually abusing the couple's daughter. At trial, both daughters testified about Pitts's sexual abuse. Howard also testified in her defense. This past Friday, the jury acquitted her of first- and second-degree murder, but deadlocked 7-5 on whether she was guilty of voluntary manslaughter. That deadlock allows the prosecutor to try Howard again on that charge. \"We are relieved that she walks free today to be with her family,\" Courtney Morris, an organizer with the Wendy Howard defense committee, told the local press after the verdict . \"But she's still in shackles. She is not free yet.\" \"There's no prosecutor who wants to be seen as 'soft on crime,'\" Leigh Goodmark, director of the University of Maryland's Gender Violence Clinic , told The Nation. \"They will tout their records with victims of violence. They will continue to insist that Wendy Howard and Tracy McCarter are not real victims. Our system has a victim-offender binary and you only get to be one of those things. If you are the defendant, you can't be a victim. Prosecutors can't-and won't-see you that way.\" Both Addimando and Howard are white. McCarter's deceased husband is white. McCarter is Black. Black women experience domestic violence at a higher rate than white women . But, according to a 2016 study, prosecutors reduce domestic violence charges for white women more frequently than for women of color. As of 2020, Black women were also imprisoned at nearly twice the rate of their white counterparts. \"The criminal legal system has become another abuser to her,\" Samah Sisay, a member of Survived and Punished and one of McCarter's supporters, told the crowd. Bragg's office, she continued, \"floats the lie that it's just the judge, not their office [pursuing charges against McCarter]. We're here to call on the Manhattan district attorney and to say, 'You have the power to drop the charges.'\" McCarter did not attend the rally, but told The Nation , \"I am grateful that greater attention is being paid to the cases of criminalized survivors . If I am forced to stand trial for a crime I did not commit, it gives me hope that a jury will see the truth, and that I will soon be free.\"\n\nWhile running for Manhattan district attorney, Bragg publicly tweeted his support for McCarter , stating, \"Prosecuting a domestic violence survivor who acted in self-defense is unjust.\" But since taking office in January 2022, his office continues to prosecute McCarter, after unsuccessful attempts to decrease the charges against her.

Kiesel denied that motion as well. McCarter is not the only survivor facing prosecution for the death of an abusive loved one. In 2019, Poughkeepsie mother Nikki Addimando was convicted in the shooting death of her boyfriend Christopher Grover. She applied for a sentence reduction under New York's Domestic Violence Survivors Justice Act, but despite her own and multiple other testimonies about the injuries Grover had inflicted on her, the judge denied her application and sentenced her to 19 years to life . She appealed and, in 2021, the state Supreme Court's Appellate Division reduced her sentence to seven and a half years . More recently, in California, Kern County District Attorney Cynthia Zimmer pursued murder charges against Wendy Howard, a 53-year-old mother, in the shooting death of her ex-partner Kelly Pitts. Years earlier, police had investigated Pitts for sexually abusing Howard's older daughter , but the district attorney declined to press charges. At the time of his death, police were also investigating Pitts for sexually abusing the couple's daughter. At trial, both daughters testified about Pitts's sexual abuse. Howard also testified in her defense. This past Friday, the jury acquitted her of first- and second-degree murder, but deadlocked 7-5 on whether she was guilty of voluntary manslaughter. That deadlock allows the prosecutor to try Howard again on that charge. \"We are relieved that she walks free today to be with her family,\" Courtney Morris, an organizer with the Wendy Howard defense committee, told the local press after the verdict . \"But she's still in shackles. She is not free yet.\" \"There's no prosecutor who wants to be seen as 'soft on crime,'\" Leigh Goodmark, director of the University of Maryland's Gender Violence Clinic , told The Nation. \"They will tout their records with victims of violence.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

He also filed a motion to dismiss. (Bragg's office declined to comment on his 11th-hour decision.) On March 2, 2020, McCarter was arrested for the death of her husband, Jim Murray. The pair had been separated for seven months as Murray's alcoholism had worsened, leading him to behave violently against her. That night, McCarter allowed Murray into her apartment, intending to let him sleep off his drunkenness on her couch. Instead, he demanded money and, when she refused, strangled her. McCarter grabbed a kitchen knife to ward him off and he ended up with a stab wound to his chest, from which he later died. (In legal filings, McCarter has maintained that Murray lunged, tripped, and fell on the knife.) She was arrested and, at the request of the district attorney's office, jailed at Rikers Island without having been indicted for six months while the Covid-19 pandemic closed all court proceedings, including grand jury hearings. In September, a grand jury indicted her on second-degree murder. She was released on electronic monitoring shortly thereafter.

His office twice attempted to reduce the charges; each time, Judge Kiesel rejected those efforts . Current Issue View our current issue As I previously reported at The Nation , the past two-and-a-half years of prosecution have negatively impacted all aspects of McCarter's life. The hospital where she had worked as a nurse placed her on unpaid leave. She applied for other nursing jobs, but background checks revealed her pending murder charge and she was not hired. The charge also prevented her from physically attending classes to complete her master's in nursing at Columbia University. (McCarter was able to attend online courses, but was barred from entering the campus.) Until October, however, the judge had required McCarter to remain within the city's five boroughs, a restriction causing her to miss the out-of-state births of her two grandchildren as well as every holiday and family milestone. Bragg's motion, said Sean Hecker, one of McCarter's attorneys, \"has righted a grievous injustice. Tracy McCarter is an innocent survivor of domestic violence who has suffered mightily from a criminal justice system that demands change.\" But, says Leigh Goodmark, director of the University of Maryland's Gender Violence Clinic , Bragg has only done what his office requires. \"When a prosecutor believes that dismissing a prosecution is in the interest of justice, that's what they're supposed to do,\" she told The Nation. \"Prosecutors are not just supposed to care about convictions. They're supposed to care about doing justice.\" Goodmark hopes that Bragg and other prosecutors will more carefully examine the circumstances surrounding the acts of abuse survivors before choosing to bring a case before a grand jury. For now, McCarter and her family are relieved at what seems to be the end of a nearly three-year ordeal. \"It's always been of the utmost importance for us to spend the holidays together,\" Ariel Robbins, McCarter's oldest child, told The Nation. But McCarter's pending prosecution and the court-imposed restrictions on travel have prevented them from doing so for the past two years. Instead, at Christmas, Robbins, her three adult siblings, and McCarter have spent 18 hours on FaceTime. When Bragg was elected last year, Robbins believed that her mother's ordeal would soon be over and that it was safe to become pregnant. But the charges remained, and she gave birth without her mother present this past August. Now, she is looking forward to resuming family holidays. \"I am excited that my mom will be able to spend Cairo's first Christmas with him,\" she said. \"We won't be taking any of our time together for granted.\" Siobhan Dingwall, a member of the Stand with Tracy campaign, told The Nation that, while campaign members are relieved, the motion is the result of relentless organizing and public pressure. \"We know this decision was only possible because of the tremendous pressure he felt from tens of thousands of people across the country who tirelessly demanded DA Bragg #DropHerCharges for the past nearly three years,\" she wrote in a statement. But, Dingwall continued, \"Tracy should never have been arrested, charged, or prosecuted in the first place. And while DA Bragg has taken the steps necessary to drop Tracy's charges, he must keep his campaign promise by immediately dropping charges against the countless other survivors of gender-based violence that his office is actively prosecuting.\" McCarter's legal ordeal is not quite over. Judge Kiesel must still rule on Bragg's motion. McCarter will appear in court on November 28 to hear whether she is really and truly free.\n\n\"After carefully reviewing all the evidence and extensively discussing this matter with members of my office, I have a reasonable doubt of whether Ms. McCarter stabbed Mr. Murray with the requisite intent to support a conviction of murder in the second degree,\" Bragg wrote in a November 18 letter to state Supreme Court judge Diane Kiesel, who has been presiding over the case.

His office twice attempted to reduce the charges; each time, Judge Kiesel rejected those efforts . Current Issue View our current issue As I previously reported at The Nation , the past two-and-a-half years of prosecution have negatively impacted all aspects of McCarter's life. The hospital where she had worked as a nurse placed her on unpaid leave. She applied for other nursing jobs, but background checks revealed her pending murder charge and she was not hired. The charge also prevented her from physically attending classes to complete her master's in nursing at Columbia University. (McCarter was able to attend online courses, but was barred from entering the campus.) Until October, however, the judge had required McCarter to remain within the city's five boroughs, a restriction causing her to miss the out-of-state births of her two grandchildren as well as every holiday and family milestone. Bragg's motion, said Sean Hecker, one of McCarter's attorneys, \"has righted a grievous injustice. Tracy McCarter is an innocent survivor of domestic violence who has suffered mightily from a criminal justice system that demands change.\" But, says Leigh Goodmark, director of the University of Maryland's Gender Violence Clinic , Bragg has only done what his office requires. \"When a prosecutor believes that dismissing a prosecution is in the interest of justice, that's what they're supposed to do,\" she told The Nation. \"Prosecutors are not just supposed to care about convictions. They're supposed to care about doing justice.\" Goodmark hopes that Bragg and other prosecutors will more carefully examine the circumstances surrounding the acts of abuse survivors before choosing to bring a case before a grand jury. For now, McCarter and her family are relieved at what seems to be the end of a nearly three-year ordeal. \"It's always been of the utmost importance for us to spend the holidays together,\" Ariel Robbins, McCarter's oldest child, told The Nation. But McCarter's pending prosecution and the court-imposed restrictions on travel have prevented them from doing so for the past two years. Instead, at Christmas, Robbins, her three adult siblings, and McCarter have spent 18 hours on FaceTime. When Bragg was elected last year, Robbins believed that her mother's ordeal would soon be over and that it was safe to become pregnant. But the charges remained, and she gave birth without her mother present this past August. Now, she is looking forward to resuming family holidays. \"I am excited that my mom will be able to spend Cairo's first Christmas with him,\" she said. \"We won't be taking any of our time together for granted.\" Siobhan Dingwall, a member of the Stand with Tracy campaign, told The Nation that, while campaign members are relieved, the motion is the result of relentless organizing and public pressure. \"We know this decision was only possible because of the tremendous pressure he felt from tens of thousands of people across the country who tirelessly demanded DA Bragg #DropHerCharges for the past nearly three years,\" she wrote in a statement. But, Dingwall continued, \"Tracy should never have been arrested, charged, or prosecuted in the first place. And while DA Bragg has taken the steps necessary to drop Tracy's charges, he must keep his campaign promise by immediately dropping charges against the countless other survivors of gender-based violence that his office is actively prosecuting.\" McCarter's legal ordeal is not quite over. Judge Kiesel must still rule on Bragg's motion. McCarter will appear in court on November 28 to hear whether she is really and truly free.\n\nOn March 2, 2020, McCarter was arrested for the death of her husband, Jim Murray. The pair had been separated for seven months as Murray's alcoholism had worsened, leading him to behave violently against her. That night, McCarter allowed Murray into her apartment, intending to let him sleep off his drunkenness on her couch. Instead, he demanded money and, when she refused, strangled her. McCarter grabbed a kitchen knife to ward him off and he ended up with a stab wound to his chest, from which he later died. (In legal filings, McCarter has maintained that Murray lunged, tripped, and fell on the knife.) She was arrested and, at the request of the district attorney's office, jailed at Rikers Island without having been indicted for six months while the Covid-19 pandemic closed all court proceedings, including grand jury hearings. In September, a grand jury indicted her on second-degree murder. She was released on electronic monitoring shortly thereafter.

But the charges remained, and she gave birth without her mother present this past August. Now, she is looking forward to resuming family holidays. \"I am excited that my mom will be able to spend Cairo's first Christmas with him,\" she said. \"We won't be taking any of our time together for granted.\" Siobhan Dingwall, a member of the Stand with Tracy campaign, told The Nation that, while campaign members are relieved, the motion is the result of relentless organizing and public pressure. \"We know this decision was only possible because of the tremendous pressure he felt from tens of thousands of people across the country who tirelessly demanded DA Bragg #DropHerCharges for the past nearly three years,\" she wrote in a statement. But, Dingwall continued, \"Tracy should never have been arrested, charged, or prosecuted in the first place. And while DA Bragg has taken the steps necessary to drop Tracy's charges, he must keep his campaign promise by immediately dropping charges against the countless other survivors of gender-based violence that his office is actively prosecuting.\" McCarter's legal ordeal is not quite over. Judge Kiesel must still rule on Bragg's motion. McCarter will appear in court on November 28 to hear whether she is really and truly free.\n\nBragg's motion, said Sean Hecker, one of McCarter's attorneys, \"has righted a grievous injustice. Tracy McCarter is an innocent survivor of domestic violence who has suffered mightily from a criminal justice system that demands change.\" But, says Leigh Goodmark, director of the University of Maryland's Gender Violence Clinic , Bragg has only done what his office requires. \"When a prosecutor believes that dismissing a prosecution is in the interest of justice, that's what they're supposed to do,\" she told The Nation. \"Prosecutors are not just supposed to care about convictions. They're supposed to care about doing justice.\" Goodmark hopes that Bragg and other prosecutors will more carefully examine the circumstances surrounding the acts of abuse survivors before choosing to bring a case before a grand jury. For now, McCarter and her family are relieved at what seems to be the end of a nearly three-year ordeal. \"It's always been of the utmost importance for us to spend the holidays together,\" Ariel Robbins, McCarter's oldest child, told The Nation. But McCarter's pending prosecution and the court-imposed restrictions on travel have prevented them from doing so for the past two years.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

No individual has a greater direct day-to-day impact on policing and mass incarceration than a district attorney. The DA decides who gets prosecuted and who does not. They have broad discretion to either reinforce or reform racial disparities within our criminal justice system. And no DA has a more prominent role in shaping the national criminal justice conversation than the Manhattan district attorney. In Manhattan, one of the largest DA offices in the country, we have allowed royalty to run the office. Manhattan has had only three district attorneys in the last 80 years, and the last two were sons of cabinet secretaries. One of the leading candidates today represents a different kind of royalty: Wall Street. Tali Farhadian Weinstein is the Big Money candidate, having raised over $4 million dollars, much of it from the wealthiest people in the world, fellow multimillionaires who run in her Park Avenue social circle, like Ken Griffin, and big money donors from Goldman Sachs, Pershing Square Capital, and the hedge fund managed by her husband, Boaz Weinstein. She's committed to using the same techniques that drive mass incarceration and policing abuses (including a widely discredited gang database). We have never had a district attorney from impacted communities, who understands what it feels like to be racially profiled, who has friends and family members who have been charged by the system, who understands on a visceral level the racial inequities baked into the system, and the immeasurable human cost of mass incarceration. Alvin Bragg would be that DA. Born and raised in Harlem, Bragg has been stopped and frisked at gunpoint three times by the NYPD simply because of the color of his skin. He has witnessed up close the trauma the system imposes on those swept into it, helping his own brother-in-law rebuild his life after time in prison. And he has never left the community that raised him; he coaches Harlem Little League and teaches Sunday School at Abyssinian Baptist Church. Every week he is in direct contact with the kids dismissed and disrespected by the criminal justice system. A year after George Floyd's murder, he would be the first Black Manhattan District Attorney: a rarity in a field where 95 percent of prosecutors are white.

Educated at Harvard, at the New York attorney general's office, he led some of the office's biggest cases-from launching the probe of the Trump Foundation to cracking down on tenant harassment. As an assistant US attorney in New York's Southern District, he prosecuted corrupt politicians and an FBI agent for lying. He was a major advocate for getting rid of a bad law in New York that covers up police misconduct (50a), and for ending stop and frisk. And where the rubber hits the road, where he had to stand up against his own colleagues to prosecute prosecutors and law enforcement, he did it, bringing a difficult anti-corruption case against an upstate prosecutor, not something that makes you popular with other DAs, but a demonstration of leadership that has led to profound respect of reformers.

Reforming the DA's office will be like taking a ship that has been sailing in one direction, and turning it into an airplane. When Larry Krasner became a prosecutor, after a lifetime as a public defender in Philadelphia, with intimate knowledge of every part of the decision-making process, he laid out a new vision for the office, and a quarter of his staff left . As the chief deputy attorney general in New York State, Alvin managed a 1,500-person staff; that matters, because what we've learned from other cities is that reformers lead to a massive turnover; some people leave because they want a lock-em-up boss, and others have to be fired because they don't work within the new regime. The police unions are out for blood and will jump on every opportunity to destroy the respect of a reformer DA, and Bragg alone has shown that he knows how to manage really difficult moments of turnover. He's also the only progressive in the field with a real shot of winning, thanks to impressive credentials and major support from big unions, heavyweights like Preet Bharara, Color of Change-the largest online racial justice organization in the country-and grassroots community groups. Current Issue View our current issue But he's not alone: There are three other progressive candidates, none of whom have a realistic path to victory. One, Tahanie Aboushi, simply lacks the criminal court experience; to reform the system, you need a deep understanding of how it works, as experience around the country has shown. Another, Eliza Orlins, a public defender, lacks any significant institutional support, and, like Aboushi, is largely funded by people outside of Manhattan. A third, Dan Quart, has a small core of local supporters, but lacks the depth of experience, both legal and lived, of Bragg. Because it's a crowded race, some of our friends on the left have dismissed Alvin as \"a career prosecutor.\" That's simplistic. Alvin has never been an assembly-line prosecutor going after petty drug cases-he's spent his career holding powerful people and interests accountable. Isn't that the exact kind of prosecutor this moment calls for? We have an opportunity to bring the change to our system that we so badly want, that we demand. We finally have an opportunity to end and reverse the damage done to Black and brown families in Manhattan by the DA's office over the past decades. The idea that everyone, whoever they are, is treated the same-is a radical and demanding notion. So is the recognition that public safety means transforming policing, not more policing. There are very few people with the skills to be national leaders at this critical moment, and Alvin Bragg is one of those few. As he always says, it is only when we believe that justice and safety are not opposed that we can actually build a criminal justice system with justice at its heart.\n\nIn Manhattan, one of the largest DA offices in the country, we have allowed royalty to run the office.

As he always says, it is only when we believe that justice and safety are not opposed that we can actually build a criminal justice system with justice at its heart.\n\nAlvin Bragg would be that DA. Born and raised in Harlem, Bragg has been stopped and frisked at gunpoint three times by the NYPD simply because of the color of his skin. He has witnessed up close the trauma the system imposes on those swept into it, helping his own brother-in-law rebuild his life after time in prison. And he has never left the community that raised him; he coaches Harlem Little League and teaches Sunday School at Abyssinian Baptist Church. Every week he is in direct contact with the kids dismissed and disrespected by the criminal justice system. A year after George Floyd's murder, he would be the first Black Manhattan District Attorney: a rarity in a field where 95 percent of prosecutors are white.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

There has been reporting that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is close to indicting Trump, presumably on charges related to the hush money he paid porn star Stormy Daniels (we don't know that for certain), possibly as early as this week. But we don't know that for sure either. 1 So where's the news here in Trump's blather, for those of us trying not to pollute the world with Trump's every lie? I see two key facts we can't ignore. First, Trump incited more potential violence at the end of his post when he urged his followers to \"protest, take our nation back.\" And GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy amplified Trump's incitement, tweeting that Bragg's alleged pending indictment is \"an outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA who lets violent criminals walk as he pursues political vengeance against President Trump.\" 2 McCarthy added: \"I'm directing relevant committees to immediately investigate if federal funds are being used to subvert our democracy by interfering in elections with politically motivated prosecutions.\" 3 Other House Republicans echoed him. Former moderate Elise Stefanik tweeted : \"This is the Far Left's final desperate attempt to silence voters at the ballot box who support President Trump and the America First Movement.\" 4 Related Article Trump Might Face Criminal Charges-But He's Unlikely to Face Justice Elie Mystal McCarthy's boss, wing nut Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, tweeted approvingly (and ungrammatically) that McCarthy \"proves again that through his leadership [the House GOP] will not tolerate the Democrat's [sic] weaponization of government and political persecution in [sic] the taxpayer's dime.\" 5 But even so-called moderates like former New Hampshire governor Chris Sununu criticized the allegedly impending indictment on political grounds. \"I think it's building a lot of sympathy for the former president,\" Sununu told CNN on Sunday. 6 There are folks on the left who worry the same thing. Legal experts fret about whether Bragg's evidence and charging possibilities are too flimsy. Political experts worry that indicting Trump over the Stormy Daniels hush money could indeed rile up his base over a relatively insignificant offense given the myriad other potential charges against him: election fraud in Georgia, inciting the January 6 insurrection, illegally possessing classified documents and then refusing to return them; that's just what we know about since he lost the election. 7 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Current Issue View our current issue I don't know enough to have a legal opinion (and nobody does, because we still don't know Bragg's case). On the political questions: Sure, I wish it were Attorney General Merrick Garland and/or special counsel Jack Smith making plans to take Trump into custody next week for bigger crimes than paying off a porn star. But Smith's investigation is steadily moving forward. On Friday, we learned that a federal judge found that Trump's attorney on the Mar-a-Lago documents case could not claim lawyer-client privilege to avoid testifying because of the \"crime-fraud\" exception: Such privilege does not cover legal consultation that abetted a client's crime. We also know Smith is trying to get former vice president Mike Pence to testify on issues related to January 6, though Pence is defying his subpoena. If Bragg makes his case first, so be it. He (and we) should not be cowed by the likes of Trump, McCarthy or the MAGA mob. 8 It's noteworthy that in his all-caps, frothing incitement post on Saturday, Trump slurred Bragg as someone \"funded\" by George Soros-an anti-Semitic dogwhistle to his followers-and race-baited the Black DA as soft on crime, a fiction McCarthy amplified. All the better to rile up the crazies to \"take our nation back\" from the radical Black Jewish-controlled cabal that has wrongly taken power behind the figurehead of Irish Catholic centrist old-school Joe Biden. I used to laugh at these wild conspiracies, but I don't anymore. 9 More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely. April 24, 2025 Chris Van Hollen Shows Us One Person Can Make a Difference April 21, 2025 Trump Could Bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia Home if He Wanted To April 16, 2025 On Sunday Bragg reassured his staff that his administration \"does not tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York\" and that law enforcement agencies are coordinating to keep them safe. Good. I could be wrong, but I'm not hugely worried about violence in New York if Trump is indicted-with so many of the bad actors from January 6 arrested, sentenced or currently on trial, a lot of the personpower that made the Capitol riot deadly is unavailable. Trump's March 25 rally planned for Waco, Tex., on the 30th anniversary of the bloody Branch Davidian clash, worries me more. 10 Whatever Bragg decides, however Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis proceeds, if/when Garland and Smith do what needs doing, the truth is the same: An armed, angry, reactionary force exists within our society and threatens our democracy. Police, prosecutors and politicians, all of us really, should be devoted to fighting them, not placating them. On Sunday, former US Attorney Joyce White Vance took stock of what's likely to unfold in the coming week and reassured her Substack readers : \"We are entering the season where the rule of law, in the form of both criminal and civil cases, is coming for Trump.\" I'm choosing to believe that, for now. 11\n\nSo where's the news here in Trump's blather, for those of us trying not to pollute the world with Trump's every lie?

I used to laugh at these wild conspiracies, but I don't anymore. 9 More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely.

Good.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

A state jury in Manhattan has found the Trump Organization guilty on 17 charges, including falsifying business information, a scheme to defraud, tax fraud, and conspiracy. It's true that the penalty arising from the charges-$1.62 million-will scarcely make a dent in the fanciful ledgers of the corporation. And it's true that former President Trump wasn't a named defendant in the case. But Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Alan H. Weisselberg, who cut a deal with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony, gave detailed and damning evidence of what prosecutors termed a \"culture of fraud and deception\" procuring tax-free perks and off-the-books compensation for Trump cronies and their family members. This overall picture should be familiar to civically sentient Americans who've suffered through the past six years of Trump-authored lies, scams, self-dealing schemes, petty nepotism, and high crimes and misdemeanors all carried out under the family political brand. As president, Trump had blithely adopted his mobbed-up model of business success as the guiding dictum of federal governance, replete with cronyist appointments , high-profile sinecures and fudged security clearances for family members, concealed foreign debts , and emoluments violations on steroids . For hidebound adherents of legal proportionality, Tuesday's verdict might carry an echo of the famous federal case against Al Capone for tax evasion. Just this past weekend, after all, Trump called for the \"termination\" of those sections of the Constitution that might frustrate his incoherent and hectoring will-to-power-and his role in fomenting the January 6 insurrection over his phony claims of election fraud certainly calls for a punishment far beyond a nominal seven-figure fine.

For all practical purposes, Donald Trump is the Trump organization, and this legal finding can't be shrugged off. \"The Trump Organization is owned lock, stock, and barrel by Donald Trump, and nothing went on there without his approval,\" says David Cay Johnston, a longtime tax reporter and analyst who's covered Trump and his properties since the 1990s, and the author most recently of The Big Cheat: How Donald Trump Fleeced America and Enriched Himself and His Family . \"Technically, it's his corporation, so this is clearly a finding that Trump is a tax criminal.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis It's also a long-overdue moment of comeuppance from a legal system that Trump, like countless other plutocrats on the American scene, has gamed to his continual advantage. \"This is the first serious holding to account of Trump and his companies,\" Johnston notes. \"Donald's great genius has always been running his companies and behaviors out of the reach of the law. He beat four grand juries back when he was in his 30s.\" It's also true that there's an apt Greek-tragic symmetry to this case's outcome: Without Trump's insatiable hubris in play, a trial probably would have never happened. \"Probably in ordinary circumstances, a case like this would have been settled,\" says former federal prosecutor Ankush Khadori. \"The only reason it wasn't is because of Trump's ego. When Weisselberg pled out, logically there were very few lines of defense left for the Trump Organization. In these cases, the company is vicariously liable-so when an employee has pled out or been convicted at trial, the company just doesn't have much of an option.\" But Trump didn't sign off on a settlement, as he had in the Trump charity and Trump University cases-in part because the Trump Organization supplies the foundation for all the delusive ego rampages that have defined his career. \"This is a man who built his public persona image of the ur New York businessman, the guy who made it big in New York,\" Khadori says. \"The only reason his company was on trial was because it was so closely intertwined with his ego.\" Current Issue View our current issue What strategy there was on Trump's side of the courtroom seemed to involve isolating Weisselberg, Trump's longtime trusted business lieutenant, as the bad actor here-in the same way that Trump had ostracized his onetime fixer Michael Cohen under pressure from still other legal troubles . But \"it looks like the jury didn't buy the defendant's argument that Weisselberg acted solely on his own behalf,\" says Melanie Sloan, another former federal prosecutor and senior adviser to the DC-based watchdog group American Oversight. Meanwhile, Trump remains in the crosshairs of a slew of other legal proceedings, from special prosecutor Jack Smith's recent appointment to lead the inquiry into the January 6 insurrection to the Mar-a-Lago documents case to E. Jean Carroll's sexual assault suit to the election-fixing probe in Georgia to possible criminal referrals from the House Select Committee on January 6. Could the New York verdict create a spillover effect? \"I have never used the expression 'walls closing in,' for the better part of a decade about this man,\" says Khardori. \"So far, most of these probes have not culminated in the way people want, and we're now going on six-plus years of this.\" But, he adds, \" Sometimes things do change.\" A case in point has been the Justice Department's own posture toward prosecutions of Trump-something that the incoming Biden administration and lead Justice officials had little apparent appetite for. But over the past few months, Khardori says, \"The Justice Department has changed. I did not expect that change, nor did I expect that change to come about the way it did. Justice was changed by the January 6 committee, which absolutely owned the news this summer. It affected the midterms, which I also didn't expect-suddenly people were being treated as not serious for denying the 2020 elections. And all that affected the posture of the Justice Department.\" Within this context, Johnston suggests, \"the significant thing is that now we've crossed this Rubicon, everything else can start to move forward. We're seeing Jack Smith is being very aggressive in putting out subpoenas as special prosecutor. So all this timidity-all this 'Oh, no one's ever prosecuted a former president,' which is offensive to anyone who believes in the rule of law-that should all peel away.\" Paul Pelletier, another former DOJ prosecutor who led many investigations into financial fraud in his long career, also sees a promising precedent here. \"That the Trump Organization was convicted of numerous tax frauds over multiple years is almost secondary,\" he argues. \"What the verdict shows is that this pattern of lawless behavior was deeply rooted in Trump's family enterprise, making it extremely unlikely that the former president was unaware of such behavior. It also shows that ethos of Trump's business practices, exemplified in the demonstrated grifting of Trump University and the Trump family's charity, reflected the moral bankruptcy of their namesake. Finally, the verdict demonstrates that, in a courtroom, where the truth can't be concealed behind empty rhetoric, powerful people and organizations can be held accountable for their behavior. None of that bodes well for the ex-president as he faces perhaps several serious challenges to his personal freedom.\" And if that's still too much to hope for, there are the well-worn rites of political survival in Washington to fall back on-particularly as Trump's run of handpicked midterm failures continued with the defeat of Hershel Walker in the Georgia Senate runoff last night. It's one thing to flack for a corrupt and venal kingmaker in Republican politics; it's another thing entirely to carry water for a law-breaking grifter who's also an electoral loser. \"Elected Republicans everywhere likely are sighing with relief in private,\" says Sloan, \"while condemning the verdict publicly.\"\n\nIt's true that the penalty arising from the charges-$1.62 million-will scarcely make a dent in the fanciful ledgers of the corporation.

For all practical purposes, Donald Trump is the Trump organization, and this legal finding can't be shrugged off. \"The Trump Organization is owned lock, stock, and barrel by Donald Trump, and nothing went on there without his approval,\" says David Cay Johnston, a longtime tax reporter and analyst who's covered Trump and his properties since the 1990s, and the author most recently of The Big Cheat: How Donald Trump Fleeced America and Enriched Himself and His Family . \"Technically, it's his corporation, so this is clearly a finding that Trump is a tax criminal.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis It's also a long-overdue moment of comeuppance from a legal system that Trump, like countless other plutocrats on the American scene, has gamed to his continual advantage. \"This is the first serious holding to account of Trump and his companies,\" Johnston notes. \"Donald's great genius has always been running his companies and behaviors out of the reach of the law. He beat four grand juries back when he was in his 30s.\" It's also true that there's an apt Greek-tragic symmetry to this case's outcome: Without Trump's insatiable hubris in play, a trial probably would have never happened. \"Probably in ordinary circumstances, a case like this would have been settled,\" says former federal prosecutor Ankush Khadori. \"The only reason it wasn't is because of Trump's ego. When Weisselberg pled out, logically there were very few lines of defense left for the Trump Organization. In these cases, the company is vicariously liable-so when an employee has pled out or been convicted at trial, the company just doesn't have much of an option.\" But Trump didn't sign off on a settlement, as he had in the Trump charity and Trump University cases-in part because the Trump Organization supplies the foundation for all the delusive ego rampages that have defined his career. \"This is a man who built his public persona image of the ur New York businessman, the guy who made it big in New York,\" Khadori says. \"The only reason his company was on trial was because it was so closely intertwined with his ego.\" Current Issue View our current issue What strategy there was on Trump's side of the courtroom seemed to involve isolating Weisselberg, Trump's longtime trusted business lieutenant, as the bad actor here-in the same way that Trump had ostracized his onetime fixer Michael Cohen under pressure from still other legal troubles . But \"it looks like the jury didn't buy the defendant's argument that Weisselberg acted solely on his own behalf,\" says Melanie Sloan, another former federal prosecutor and senior adviser to the DC-based watchdog group American Oversight. Meanwhile, Trump remains in the crosshairs of a slew of other legal proceedings, from special prosecutor Jack Smith's recent appointment to lead the inquiry into the January 6 insurrection to the Mar-a-Lago documents case to E. Jean Carroll's sexual assault suit to the election-fixing probe in Georgia to possible criminal referrals from the House Select Committee on January 6. Could the New York verdict create a spillover effect? \"I have never used the expression 'walls closing in,' for the better part of a decade about this man,\" says Khardori. \"So far, most of these probes have not culminated in the way people want, and we're now going on six-plus years of this.\" But, he adds, \" Sometimes things do change.\" A case in point has been the Justice Department's own posture toward prosecutions of Trump-something that the incoming Biden administration and lead Justice officials had little apparent appetite for. But over the past few months, Khardori says, \"The Justice Department has changed. I did not expect that change, nor did I expect that change to come about the way it did. Justice was changed by the January 6 committee, which absolutely owned the news this summer. It affected the midterms, which I also didn't expect-suddenly people were being treated as not serious for denying the 2020 elections. And all that affected the posture of the Justice Department.\" Within this context, Johnston suggests, \"the significant thing is that now we've crossed this Rubicon, everything else can start to move forward. We're seeing Jack Smith is being very aggressive in putting out subpoenas as special prosecutor. So all this timidity-all this 'Oh, no one's ever prosecuted a former president,' which is offensive to anyone who believes in the rule of law-that should all peel away.\" Paul Pelletier, another former DOJ prosecutor who led many investigations into financial fraud in his long career, also sees a promising precedent here. \"That the Trump Organization was convicted of numerous tax frauds over multiple years is almost secondary,\" he argues. \"What the verdict shows is that this pattern of lawless behavior was deeply rooted in Trump's family enterprise, making it extremely unlikely that the former president was unaware of such behavior. It also shows that ethos of Trump's business practices, exemplified in the demonstrated grifting of Trump University and the Trump family's charity, reflected the moral bankruptcy of their namesake. Finally, the verdict demonstrates that, in a courtroom, where the truth can't be concealed behind empty rhetoric, powerful people and organizations can be held accountable for their behavior. None of that bodes well for the ex-president as he faces perhaps several serious challenges to his personal freedom.\" And if that's still too much to hope for, there are the well-worn rites of political survival in Washington to fall back on-particularly as Trump's run of handpicked midterm failures continued with the defeat of Hershel Walker in the Georgia Senate runoff last night. It's one thing to flack for a corrupt and venal kingmaker in Republican politics; it's another thing entirely to carry water for a law-breaking grifter who's also an electoral loser. \"Elected Republicans everywhere likely are sighing with relief in private,\" says Sloan, \"while condemning the verdict publicly.\"\n\nYesterday 5:00 am\n\nApril 22, 2025\n\nApril 18, 2025\n\nBut in terms of personal vanity-the only force that Donald Trump really understands and respects-this verdict is a significant blow.

It also shows that ethos of Trump's business practices, exemplified in the demonstrated grifting of Trump University and the Trump family's charity, reflected the moral bankruptcy of their namesake. Finally, the verdict demonstrates that, in a courtroom, where the truth can't be concealed behind empty rhetoric, powerful people and organizations can be held accountable for their behavior. None of that bodes well for the ex-president as he faces perhaps several serious challenges to his personal freedom.\" And if that's still too much to hope for, there are the well-worn rites of political survival in Washington to fall back on-particularly as Trump's run of handpicked midterm failures continued with the defeat of Hershel Walker in the Georgia Senate runoff last night. It's one thing to flack for a corrupt and venal kingmaker in Republican politics; it's another thing entirely to carry water for a law-breaking grifter who's also an electoral loser. \"Elected Republicans everywhere likely are sighing with relief in private,\" says Sloan, \"while condemning the verdict publicly.\"\n\nWithin this context, Johnston suggests, \"the significant thing is that now we've crossed this Rubicon, everything else can start to move forward.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

In other words, Trump has chosen to fight the charges against him like a lawless thug. It's tempting to allow ourselves to feel inured to Trump's authoritarian antics, but we should never lose our ability to recoil at what he's doing. Trump isn't attacking the law; he's attacking the rule of law. Instead of availing himself of the process afforded to every citizen who is accused of a crime, he's calling for Bragg's arrest . Instead of using his overwhelming resources to fight the charges, he's using his platform-and an endless supply of free media coverage-to spread lies and misinformation about the entire justice system. Trump's strategy stands out because he is doing this by choice. He has perfectly legitimate legal defenses he could rely on. More From Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk April 24, 2025 Did the Supreme Court Just Grow a Spine? April 22, 2025 \"Elie v. U.S.\" April 14, 2025 Even so, the fact that Trump has defenses doesn't mean Bragg was wrong to bring the case. I don't know anybody who is not a grifter or a cultist who reasonably thinks Trump is innocent of these charges. We know he paid actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 in hush money to cover up an alleged affair; we know he lied about it; and, if we believe his former attorney Michael Cohen-who has already gone to prison in connection with this matter-we know that Trump improperly coded those payments as legal expenses. That's a crime , albeit a misdemeanor, and with the right documentation, Bragg should easily be able to prove Trump's guilt. But that's far from the end of the legal story. To make these crimes felonies, as Bragg claims they are, the prosecution needs to show that Trump not only falsified these records, but did so with the intent to cover up some other, more serious crime. Bragg's theory is that Trump falsified the documents in furtherance of campaign finance violations and tax evasion. He also accuses Trump of engaging in a \" catch and kill \" conspiracy with the National Enquirer and its former publisher, David Pecker, in a long-term scheme to suppress harmful stories about Trump during his 2016 run for the presidency, which would also be a campaign finance violation . All of that might be true, but the astute reader will note that Trump hasn't been charged with campaign finance violations, or tax evasion, or conspiracy. Trump can reasonably argue that he simply kept sloppy books, that he had no intent to defraud, and that if he was involved in any of these more serious crimes, surely someone would have charged him with it by now, including Bragg's own office. He can further argue that these charges are time-barred: The statute of limitations on filing false business records is five years , and the allegations against Trump mainly concern 2017 records. Current Issue View our current issue I'm not saying that Trump is going to win. I'm saying that this is how the process is supposed to work: A person is charged with a crime, they present a defense, we have a trial, and a jury renders a verdict. This is a process that has been good enough for everybody from former vice presidential candidate John Edwards (who was charged with basically the same crime as Trump and acquitted) to Gwyneth Paltrow. But Trump, apparently, doesn't have the same strength and toughness as Paltrow. He is afraid to justify his actions in a court of law. A normal politician might welcome the opportunity to beat back ticky-tacky bookkeeping charges in a public hearing. But Trump would rather threaten violence outside of a courthouse than make a reasonable argument inside of one, even when he has reasonable arguments to make. If he didn't commit these crimes, Trump should beat the charges. If Bragg's case is weak or on shaky legal ground, Trump should beat the charges. And if Trump doesn't think he can beat these charges, he should plead guilty and pay a fine. That would all be normal. Making excuses for Trump to do anything else plays into his authoritarian narrative and places him where he least deserves to be: above the law.\n\nIn other words, Trump has chosen to fight the charges against him like a lawless thug.

      "text": "Alvin Bragg, Donald Trump, and the Pursuit of Low-Level Crimes\n\nOn Alvin Bragg's third day as the Manhattan District Attorney, in January, 2021, he stated that his office would no longer prosecute low-level offenses such as subway-fare evasion, resistance to arrest, or prostitution unless they were part of an accompanying felony charge. Despite the fact that Bragg had campaigned as a reformer, the bluntness of his statement raised eyebrows. The pledge marked a sweeping departure from the \" broken windows \" philosophy of law enforcement, in which the prosecution of low-level offenses was thought-erroneously, it turned out-to prevent more serious ones. Those presumptions shaped Bragg's early interactions with police in New York, and his subsequent outlook as Manhattan's first Black D.A. Bragg told me recently that he has spent \"twenty-plus years of professional work and almost fifty years of life living at the intersection between civil rights and prosecution.\" He added, \"I decided to go to law school in large part because, when I was growing up in central Harlem, during the height of the crack-cocaine epidemic, I had a gun pointed at me six times, three by police officers\"-during search stops-\"and three during more traditional public-safety issues.\" He said that he will continue to do what he has done throughout his career, which is \"looking at collateral consequences of prosecutions.\"\n\nThe move away from the prosecution of petty crimes made Bragg an immediate target of conservatives, and the subject of frequently derisive coverage in the New York Post . (A lede from a story published this past November began, \"Soft-on-crime Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has downgraded more than half his felony cases to misdemeanors,\" and went on to accuse him of ineptly handling the felonies that he does prosecute.) Last year, amid a notably competitive gubernatorial race , Lee Zeldin, the Republican nominee, ran on a promise to remove Bragg from office. Yet, as recent events have made exceedingly clear, the disdain that Bragg inspires for not prosecuting certain misdemeanor cases is minuscule in comparison with the rage that can result from a decision to file dozens of criminal charges against a suspect-especially when he is the twice-impeached forty-fifth President of the United States.\n\nOn Tuesday, Donald Trump was arraigned on thirty-four felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush-money and catch-and-kill payments -including to Stormy Daniels and, presumably, Karen McDougal-just before the 2016 election. He pleaded not guilty on all counts. The arraignment marks a historic precedent: never before had a former President of the United States been indicted on criminal charges by a grand jury. There has been considerable skepticism among legal analysts, and among Democrats, about the viability of a case built on events that took place seven years ago, which federal prosecutors had declined to pursue, and which now appears to hinge in part on an untested application of New York State and federal campaign-finance laws. But Bragg told me that he has years of experience doing cases that involve, for example, charging \"a council member, a majority leader of the State Senate . . ., an F.B.I. agent on the civil front,\" and \"leading the team that successfully sued the Trump Foundation.\" He added, \"So I've been doing this for a long time, and I do it with rigor, with granular focus to detail.\"\n\nHe struck a similar note at a press conference following the arraignment, in which he said that the conduct \"which was charged by the Grand Jury is felony criminal conduct in New York State. True and accurate business records are important everywhere to be sure. They are all the more important in Manhattan, the financial center of the world. That is why we have a history in the Manhattan D.A.'s office of vigorously enforcing white collar law.\" He added, \"We today uphold our solemn responsibility to ensure that everyone stands equal before the law, no amount of money and no amount of power changes that enduring American principle.\" Whatever the merits of the case, which will now be decided in a courtroom, they also serve as more subtle markers of a break with tradition. The relentless pursuit of minor offenses committed by poor people had been just one hallmark of the N.Y.P.D. and the Manhattan D.A.'s office-another was a seeming hesitancy to prosecute larger offenses committed by certain wealthy people. As Jeannie Suk Gersen noted , in 2017, the decision not to prosecute Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump, Jr., for potential fraud in connection with the Trump SoHo building, which had been made by Bragg's predecessor, Cyrus Vance, was freighted by overlapping social connections, political donations, and, likely, publicity considerations. (Vance had told The New Yorker , \"I did not at the time believe beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime had been committed.\" In 2021, Vance did bring tax-fraud charges against the Trump Organization, and teed up a second case that Bragg later deemed not ready for prosecution.)\n\nOn its face, the unprecedented post-Presidential prosecution of a Florida Republican by a progressive District Attorney in a Democratic stronghold is not the hallmark of a thriving democracy. But it is also true that this is the only circumstance so far in which Trump's decades-long history of skirting the law has resulted in criminal charges against him. He has inhabited the gray areas of the law for so long that he could reasonably claim residency there. Yusef Salaam, one of the Central Park Five, who were wrongfully accused of rape in 1989 and given lengthy prison sentences-and who Trump suggested should be subjected to the death penalty-summarized the occasion of the indictment with a single word : karma.\n\nMany, however, saw the development in less spiritual terms. In the days since the indictment was announced, Bragg has been subjected to a tide of death threats and mail peppered with the N-word. Trump, for his part, said that Bragg is a \" racist in reverse ,\" and accused the Times columnist Charles Blow, who is also Black, of supporting the indictment simply because Trump is white. The former President also joined a chorus of antisemitic smears, accusing Bragg of doing the bidding of the liberal billionaire George Soros. (A spokesman for Soros pointed out that Soros has never met or communicated with Bragg or directly contributed to his campaign.) Everywhere that Trump could find an audience, he has seemed eager to peel back the gauze on his imaginary wounds. This was to be expected. In the course of the seven years that he has spent in political life, and the decades that preceded them during which he was a tabloid fixture, Trump has perfected the craft of masking self-pity as social injustice.\n\nThe disparate Republican elements that remain beholden to Trump followed his lead. Jim Jordan, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, who has demanded to see materials related to the prosecution, dismissed the charges. \"Equal justice under the law, unless you're a Republican running for president,\" he tweeted . Senator Ted Cruz denounced the prosecution, tweeting , \"Bragg is a Left-Wing Democrat who hates Donald Trump and he is targeting Trump by any means necessary.\" He has also said that Bragg, in victimizing Trump, has given him an invaluable campaign contribution. To that point, the aftermath of the indictment has brought a reported seven million dollars into Trump's campaign chest, and polls show him with his largest lead yet over his potential G.O.P. rival Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\nThe journalist Matt Taibbi echoed Cruz's note about the potential unintended consequences of prosecuting former officeholders. On March 30th, he tweeted , \"If presidents think they will be chased into jail under thin pretexts as ex-presidents, they'll try even harder to never leave office. This is how autocracies are born.\" It was a strange argument to make given, among other events, Trump's autocratic attempt to overturn the 2020 election, which preceded the indictment by two years. At the same time, the very nature of an unprecedented moment means that we lack models to predict what may come next. Progressives who suspected that Trump had lost his hold over his once faithful ranks also feared that nothing will invigorate the partisans like a sense of grievance.\n\nAmid the haze and the lingering trauma that Trump's chaotic, incompetent, and dangerous Presidency imposed on the nation, it's easy to lose track of the reality that none of these concerns should matter in this context. The fixation with \"what will happen if\" is the primary element that distinguishes the wealthy from the poor, for whom such concerns are seldom raised. The questions about why Bragg pursued this case, rather than other potential investigations, will continue. No matter the eventual verdict, the one nearly guaranteed result will be increased acrimony. But the fact that Trump has finally been brought to court for alleged crimes relating to paying hush money could yet contradict Bragg's key contention. Perhaps some lower-level offenses are worth pursuing. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Advice for Alvin Bragg from Former Trump Prosecutors\n\nIf, as expected, Donald Trump is indicted in Manhattan in the days ahead, the most important legal case of District Attorney Alvin Bragg's career will unfold in the dingy, nineteen-thirties-era Manhattan Criminal Courts Building. Bragg, who just began his second year in office, will enjoy legal glory-from Democrats and Trump opponents-if he secures a conviction. If Trump is acquitted, Bragg's decision to prosecute the former President will be seen as a major debacle that could help Trump politically. Three former Justice Department officials who have been involved in investigating Trump or in prosecuting his allies predicted a protracted, ugly, and raucous legal and public battle ahead. Their advice, over all, was for the Manhattan District Attorney and his prosecutors to ignore Trump's antics as much as possible and to hope that the former President sabotages himself legally. Jonathan Kravis, who was the lead prosecutor in the trial of the longtime Trump ally and adviser Roger Stone , told me, in reference to the former President's expected attacks on prosecutors, \"At the end of the day, there's nothing you can do about it.\" And, he added, \"If you win the case, nobody remembers what the defendant said in public.\"\n\nAssuming that Trump is indicted, Kravis and other former prosecutors said that whoever is appointed as the judge in the case, as well as the prosecutors, cannot ignore one type of comment from Trump: threats of violence against participants in the trial. A former prosecutor who asked not to be named but who was involved in the trial of a Trump associate told me that, if Trump makes statements that could incite physical attacks on the judge and prosecutors, or intimidate jurors, he could be held in contempt of court. Trump, throughout his Presidency and the two years since, has repeatedly disparaged judges and prosecutors who investigated him and his allies, declaring them to be corrupt and part of a \" deep state \" plot against him. In a fund-raising e-mail sent to supporters on Monday, he suggested that they are part of \"George Soros' globalist cabal of thugs.\" Trump has also called Bragg, who is Black, a \"racist.\"\n\nThe former prosecutor said that Trump's rhetoric could make Manhattan jurors reluctant to serve in a trial, fearing that they could face attacks from his supporters. \"You could have jurors fearing physical harm if they serve on the case and fear that their identities will be revealed,\" the former prosecutor said. \"Judges are very sensitive about their courtrooms feeling unsafe.\"\n\nThe judge could impose a limited gag order on Trump regarding his public statements about the trial. If Trump were to defy such an order, the judge could then take the extreme step of holding him in contempt of court and even jailing him. Kravis noted that Roger Stone, at one point in his case, posted a photo on social media of the judge, Amy Berman Jackson, which appeared to have the crosshairs of a gun next to her face. Berman Jackson subsequently barred Stone from posting on social media. Stone, known for his embrace of political dirty tricks dating back to Richard Nixon 's reëlection campaign, was ultimately convicted of seven felonies, including obstructing a congressional investigation and making false statements to Congress. Trump, before leaving office, commuted Stone's three-year prison sentence and set him free.\n\nKravis said that prosecutors were unlikely to request a gag order, given that it would play into the former President's narrative that he is being persecuted by Democrats who are trying to prevent him from running for President again. The situation, of course, is unprecedented. But Trump could use his position as a former President, and as the current front-runner for the 2024 Republican Party nomination, to make it more difficult for a judge or prosecutors to try to limit his public comments about his own trial. \"For someone like Trump, who is a candidate for office, restricting their speech is different,\" Kravis said. \"It's generally not a good look to be going into a court and asking for an order that prevents the defendant from making public statements about the case. In that circumstance, it's an even worse look.\"\n\nSarah Isgur, a Trump critic who formerly served as the spokesperson for the Justice Department, under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, said that Bragg and his prosecutors should try to speak and conduct themselves in a manner that is the opposite of the former President's habit of bombast and bullying. State bar rules in New York and elsewhere limit what prosecutors can publicly say about a defendant before and during a trial, in order to prevent jurors from being biased and to insure a fair trial. But prosecutors can hold press conferences after an indictment is released. Isgur urged Bragg to do just that. \"This is your one chance to look like a human being, and to explain the charges in human terms,\" she said. \"You want to sound calm, unemotional. You want to just explain. You don't want to try and sway.\"\n\nIsgur also said that, during the trial, prosecutors should not take steps that publicly humiliate Trump. When the former President is arraigned, for example, law-enforcement officials should not handcuff him, publicly release his mug shot, or parade him in front of the press, in a perp walk. \"I wouldn't do the handcuffs. I wouldn't do a mug shot. I wouldn't do the perp walk,\" Isgur said, arguing that it would fuel a group that she referred to as \"the beast\"-online partisans who want to focus on what they see as biased and vindictive prosecutors. She added that Bragg \"can't win against the beast, so he should at least try to starve the beast.\" (Trump's mug shot, whatever Bragg's wishes, is bound to be leaked. Trump, though, will likely blame Bragg.)\n\nA former senior Justice Department official who asked not to be named agreed that Bragg should strictly obey rules barring prosecutors from publicly disparaging defendants. He said that in high-profile cases it is more important than ever to obey standard practices. \"The prosecutors should emphasize that the defendant is presumed innocent and the charges are only allegations,\" the former official said.\n\nTrump, given his past behavior, is likely to behave badly. The legal rules and traditions that restrict Bragg's conduct do not apply to him. His relentless attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller , an esteemed former prosecutor and F.B.I. director, swayed public opinion against both Mueller and the F.B.I. Outside the courtroom, in particular, Trump vs. Bragg will be a vast mismatch, with Trump running circles around prosecutors in the press. Kravis pointed out, though, that Trump's public statements outside the court can be used against him during cross-examination, if he testifies. He said Bragg's best hope may be that Trump's conduct backfires with the jurors and voters. \"A defendant's public statements can be helpful,\" he said. \"They're all admissible.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "If Alvin Bragg Indicts Donald Trump, What Will the Case Look Like?\n\nMore than a week after Donald Trump created a media frenzy by claiming that he was going to be arrested, Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan District Attorney, is still deciding whether to bring criminal charges against the former President arising from the hush-money payment that he made through Michael Cohen, his ex-lawyer, to the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\nOn Monday, David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer and a longtime friend of Trump's, testified before Bragg's grand jury for a second time. Executives at the supermarket tabloid reportedly played a key role in arranging the payoff to Daniels, who claimed to have had an affair with Trump, and Pecker was likely questioned about his knowledge of the payment. A key legal issue in the investigation is whether the hundred-and-thirty-thousand-dollar payoff was effectively an illegal campaign contribution that Trump made to himself. (Cohen wired the money to Daniels's attorney in October, 2016, and the Trump Organization subsequently repaid him.)\n\nAlthough there is still no indictment, the case has already sparked a good deal of discussion in legal circles, because it could well hinge on a novel effort by Bragg to elevate the charges against Trump to a felony. According to news reports, the District Attorney is considering charging Trump with falsifying business records for entering the payoffs to Daniels into company ledgers as legal fees. By itself, falsifying business records is usually a misdemeanor. But if Bragg can show that Trump falsified the records in connection with another crime-making an illegal campaign contribution, let's say-he could conceivably elevate the charge. \"If it is done with the intent to violate another law, then it becomes a felony,\" Jerry H. Goldfeder, an attorney and an expert on New York campaign laws, told me.\n\nAppearing on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" this weekend, Joe Tacopina, a lawyer who is representing Trump in this matter, criticized Bragg's office and provided a preview of Trump's likely defense. The \"case shouldn't be brought and wouldn't be brought if it were anyone other than Donald Trump, let's be clear about that,\" Tacopina said. More specifically, he repeatedly claimed that the payoff to Daniels wasn't a campaign contribution. He described it as a \"personal civil settlement\" with Daniels, which Trump would have made \"irrespective of the campaign\" to protect his privacy.\n\nSpeculation about Bragg's potential indictment seems to have united Republicans behind Trump. Even some of the former President's critics in the Party have denounced Bragg's investigation. Peter Meijer, a Republican congressman who voted to impeach Trump after January 6, 2021, described the case as a \"billion dollar gift-in-kind from Democrats to Trump's '24 campaign.\"\n\nWith Trump out there ranting and raving-in the past week, he has called Bragg an \"animal\" and threatened \"death and destruction\" if an indictment comes-the political stakes are, indeed, high, and so are the legal ones. The lawyers I spoke with agreed that Trump's intent in paying off Daniels, through Cohen, is central to the prospect of a successful prosecution. \"The defense will probably be that the payment, the entire transaction, all the people involved, were not acting in furtherance of the campaign-that it was all about Melania, and the family, and God knows what,\" Goldfeder, who has chaired the New York City Bar Association's Committee on Election Law, said. \"That's the challenge for the District Attorney-to convince the jury that, in fact, it was in furtherance of the campaign.\"\n\nThe fact that Cohen has already pleaded guilty in a federal case to \"causing an unlawful campaign contribution,\" and served prison time, would surely add heft to the prosecutors' case at a trial. Still, Bragg's team presumably wouldn't want to rely solely on the testimony of Cohen, who has also pleaded guilty to making false statements to a bank and to lying to Congress. It is in this context that Pecker's testimony could be key. Also in 2018, as part of a non-prosecution agreement with the office of the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, American Media, Inc., the owner of the National Enquirer, admitted to \"working in concert\" with the 2016 Trump campaign to buy the story of another woman who claimed to have had an affair with Trump, the former Playboy model Karen McDougal. \"AMI further admitted that its principal purpose in making the payment was to suppress the woman's story so as to prevent it from influencing the election,\" federal prosecutors said in a news release at the time. At the National Enquirer , this policy of buying stories and not publishing them was referred to as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nShortly before the 2016 election, editors at the National Enquirer had discussions with Daniels's lawyer about buying her story, too. In the end, according to prosecutors, the Enquirer referred Daniels to Cohen, who subsequently wired the hundred and thirty thousand dollars to an account controlled by Daniels's attorney. \"The timing suggests that Trump was motivated by the election,\" Jennifer Rodgers, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at N.Y.U., told me. \"Then there is the deal with Karen McDougal, which the National Enquirer did for him and said explicitly that it was for the election. That is an obvious motivation that prosecutors will argue was present, and which would make Trump guilty of the violation. He can argue otherwise, but that is what a trial is for. It will be up to the jury to decide.\"\n\nIf Bragg does bring charges, Trump's lawyers are likely to ask a judge to dismiss them before trial. Trump's side could argue that a defendant can't be prosecuted for federal campaign violations in a state court, and, therefore, Bragg's office doesn't have jurisdiction to bring the case. His lawyers may also point out that federal prosecutors closely examined the payments to Daniels during their investigation of Cohen and declined to bring charges against Trump. Appearing after Tacopina on \"Meet the Press,\" Preet Bharara, the former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District, whom Trump fired, conceded that his former office \"chose not to bring the case.\"\n\nThis history provides some attack lines for Trump's supporters, but it's not clear how relevant it will turn out to be in legal terms. Goldfeder said that Bragg could charge the former President with violating New York campaign laws, an area where his office clearly does have jurisdiction, rather than federal campaign laws. One option for Bragg, Goldfeder said, would be to accuse Trump of making a contribution in kind to his campaign and masking the source of the money, which would be a violation of state law. Another option, Goldfeder added, would be to rely on the language of state election law 17-152, which states simply that it is a campaign violation for two or more people to conspire to further a political candidacy \"by unlawful means\"-without specifying those means. \"That is the key language,\" Goldfeder said. He added that it could well be applied to what Trump and Cohen did.\n\nRodgers told me that she fully expects Trump's attorneys to make a pretrial argument that Bragg's case is flawed as a matter of New York law. \"But I would be surprised if a judge would toss it out before trial,\" she said. \"The legal argument doesn't seem clear-cut to me at all.\" With the 2024 Presidential primary season fast approaching, there is obviously a great deal of interest in how quickly the case would proceed. Goldfeder said that if Bragg does bring an indictment and the Trump side files a motion to dismiss, the legal arguments on that matter could take just a few weeks, and then, assuming the judge ruled in favor of the District Attorney, the court could expedite a trial date. I asked whether there could be a trial this year. \"Oh, yes, absolutely,\" Goldfeder replied. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the attorney who represented Stormy Daniels.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Demise and Afterlife of Donald Trump's Criminal Cases\n\nA year before Donald Trump became the first former President to be criminally indicted, I expressed my hope, on The New Yorker Radio Hour , that prosecutors would exercise discretion not to pursue indictments against him. That take wasn't too popular with listeners; he had to be held accountable for wrongdoing, and no person is above the law. Plus, it was crucial that he not become President again. So he was indicted, and, four separate prosecutions and a total of ninety-one criminal charges later, he is on the cusp of beating most or all of his criminal cases, in large part by having won the Presidential election in November. It is worth taking stock, on the eve of Trump's second term, of not just the demise of the prosecutions but also their more enduring consequences for the institution of the Presidency, the rule of law, and our system of government.\n\nThe Lede Reporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nOnly two years before the 2024 Presidential election-in which Trump had been expected to run against President Joe Biden -Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith as special counsel, to investigate \"efforts to interfere with the lawful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election or the certification of the Electoral College vote held on or about January 6, 2021\"; Smith's portfolio also included Trump's handling of classified documents after he left the White House. The fact that it took nearly two years to decide to appoint the special counsel seemed to reflect at least some hesitation within the Justice Department about prosecuting the former President, the political rival of the sitting President-if for no reason other than an appearance of political motivation. (After all, Trump's first impeachment had involved his asking a foreign head of state, President Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.)\n\nThen came Smith's federal indictments against Trump, in the classified-documents case and in the election-interference case, in mid-2023. In truth, the indictments seemed somewhat dead on arrival. Anyone familiar with the pace of federal criminal cases, even in ordinary matters, could foresee that the timeline of Smith's prosecutions, launched less than eighteen months before Election Day, would run concurrently with the Presidential campaign, and that there was little to no chance of the cases' completion before people began voting. Even in a miracle scenario wherein Trump could be convicted before the election, the possibilities still weren't promising. If Trump then won the election, it would be implausible to have the Chief Executive perform his duties from prison or other penal confinement; if he lost the election, it would seem as if the prosecutions functionally contributed to that result, casting doubt on the integrity of both law enforcement and the democracy that Trump was accused of undermining. But the most predictable scenario was the one that played out: the federal prosecutions of the Presidential candidate were not close to finished during the election season. Indeed, they became a central part of the Trump campaign's narrative.\n\nAfter Trump's electoral victory, Smith did what he had to do and asked the federal courts in Washington, D.C., and in Florida to dismiss the two cases, consistent with the Justice Department's established position, dating to the Watergate era, that it is unconstitutional to prosecute a sitting President. Judge Tanya Chutkan dismissed the election-interference case while acknowledging Smith's position that the criminal immunity of a sitting President ends when he leaves office. In theory, Trump could be re-indicted and prosecuted for the same crimes in four years, but in practice that's highly unlikely. The statutes of limitations for the charged crimes will have expired by then; Smith's brief mentioned that a court might decide to pause that clock for four years, but the possibility would have to be litigated. Even if a future Presidential Administration had the desire to re-start these prosecutions, it is possible that Trump would have received a Presidential pardon in the meantime from the next President, as Richard Nixon did from his successor, Gerald Ford. (The idea of a self-pardon is absurd, but no case has declared a self-pardon invalid, because no President has ever attempted one, and we can only hope we won't have to face that possibility.)\n\nIn the classified-documents case, Judge Aileen Cannon had already dismissed the indictments against Trump and two co-defendants earlier this year, based on her conclusion that the appointment of a special counsel was unlawful. Smith had filed an appeal of Cannon's ruling, but this past week the Eleventh Circuit granted a post-election request by him to end that appeal with respect to the charges against Trump, thereby leaving the indictment of Trump dismissed.\n\nBut Smith is still appealing the dismissal of the prosecutions of the two other defendants, Trump's employees Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. So the Eleventh Circuit (and perhaps eventually the Supreme Court) will eventually decide whether Smith was validly appointed. If he wasn't, it would mean that twenty-five years of investigations by special counsels under four different Presidential Administrations, including those investigating Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, Russian interference in the 2016 election, the origins of the F.B.I. investigation of Russian interference, and the F.B.I.'s handling of Waco, would have been legally unauthorized. And Trump's promised investigations of his enemies would then have to be conducted even more directly by his Attorney General, without the layer of political distance and independence that a special counsel is supposed to enable.\n\nThe two state criminal cases against Trump also seem doomed to go out with a whimper. The prosecution in Georgia, led by the Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis, alleging election interference-including Trump's pressuring of Georgia's secretary of state to reverse its 2020 election results-had been on hold for most of this year, while Trump attempted to disqualify Willis and her office because of her romantic relationship with the prosecutor she'd hired to assist in the case. Having failed to convince the trial judge to dismiss the prosecution on that basis, Trump appealed. But, after he won the election, the court of appeals cancelled the oral arguments that were scheduled for this week.\n\nEven if Willis's case were to survive the alleged affair, it would additionally need to survive the strictures imposed earlier this year by the Supreme Court's decision in Trump v. United States , which held that a former President is either absolutely or presumptively immune from prosecution for his official conduct as President, though not immune for his unofficial conduct. Shortly after the Supreme Court's ruling, Smith had revised his indictment, to eliminate allegations involving Trump's official acts as President-such as his conversations with Justice Department officials-and to foreground the unofficial nature of his conduct as a Presidential candidate. But, for the case to get anywhere close to a trial, there likely would have been a long slog of litigation regarding whether the acts alleged in the revised indictment-such as pressuring then Vice-President Mike Pence to alter electoral votes-were unofficial or if they could overcome the presumptive immunity for official acts. Now that the federal prosecution of Trump is kaput, it would fall to the Georgia prosecution to assert that its indictment alleging similar conduct related to January 6th is still allowed. But a more basic principle, that a President should not have to defend against criminal charges of any kind while he is sitting, will likely put the kibosh on the prosecution for now.\n\nIn the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's prosecution of Trump, under New York law, a trial jury found the former President guilty of thirty-four counts of falsifying business records in connection with hush-money payments to an adult-film star with whom he allegedly had an affair. Trump was supposed to be sentenced this fall, but after the election Judge Juan Merchan indefinitely postponed the sentencing and gave both Trump and Bragg the chance to file briefs on whether to dismiss the case in the \"interests of justice.\" On Monday, Trump's brief argued that his \"status as President-elect and the soon-to-be sitting President\" means that no \"further criminal proceedings\" may continue, and asserted that the jury verdict must be vacated. Bragg's brief is due next week, but he has previously suggested putting the proceedings on hold until the end of Trump's term as President, rather than dismissing the case altogether. If Judge Merchan doesn't vacate the jury verdict, he could postpone sentencing until after Trump leaves office; or he could sentence Trump before he becomes President, imposing either a financial punishment that would not constrain his ability to do the job or a prison sentence to be served beginning in 2029. The most practical course is to timely sentence Trump to a fine.\n\nMost of us might have long since experienced disengagement of interest in these Trump prosecutions and come to terms with the idea that they are essentially dead. But what will live on, in zombie form, are the longer-term consequences of having brought these cases in the first place. They immediately gave Trump a basis to claim that he was being politically persecuted via law enforcement, by the Administration he was running against, and by Democratic prosecutors. That narrative gained substantial traction among his followers. And though Trump is the first former President to be criminally prosecuted, he may not be the last, and these cases may come to be viewed as the first moves in a predictable cycle of vengeance involving investigations and prosecutions of political opponents. President Biden seems to have all but confirmed such an expectation in pardoning his son Hunter. Trump's lawyers immediately seized upon it, writing, in Monday's brief to Judge Merchan, that Biden's assertions about his son having been \"selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted\" and about \"raw politics\" having \"led to a miscarriage of justice,\" constituted what the Trump team called \"an extraordinary condemnation\" of \"the same DOJ that coordinated and oversaw the politically-motivated, election-interference witch hunts targeting President Trump.\" Further, President Biden is reportedly considering issuing mass, blanket pardons, in anticipation of Trump's attempts to exact revenge on officials through criminal investigations. If Biden does that, it's hard to imagine that Trump will not feel entitled to do the same, and so on.\n\nEven in the face of the felony convictions in New York and the criminal allegations in the other state and federal cases, the Trump prosecutions appear not to have swayed voters away from supporting or voting for him. Nor did the cases help buttress the principle that nobody, not even a President, is above the law. Smith's election-interference prosecution led ultimately to the Court's landmark decision establishing a criminal immunity that had not previously been so plainly declared. We were probably better off not knowing. Now that Trump is poised to enter the White House, as if to underscore the feeling of political vengeance, the lawyers who made the arguments on his behalf will become important officials in his Justice Department. Trump has announced that Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who were his personal attorneys on the hush-money-trial defense team, will be nominated as Deputy Attorney General and Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General, respectively. D. John Sauer, who argued on Trump's behalf in the Supreme Court's Presidential-immunity case will be nominated as Solicitor General.\n\nMost important, Trump himself emerged stronger. And Presidents and their Administrations generally came out more powerful in exactly the ways that those who supported the prosecutions may have wished to avoid. Presidents have become less, not more, subject to criminal law, and have become more, not less, likely to view criminal law as an option for use against political opponents. We will be living with those unintended consequences for far longer than the next four years. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The People v. Donald J. Trump\n\nOn a glorious spring day, with barely a cloud in the sky over the Manhattan Criminal Court building and magnolia trees blooming across the five boroughs, a seventy-six-year-old businessman who has lately been living in Florida was arraigned on thirty-four felony charges of falsifying business records to disguise a payment that he made, via his personal lawyer, to a self-employed Texas woman more than thirty years his junior.\n\nAt a press conference after the arraignment, Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan District Attorney , pointed out that prosecutors in his office regularly indict people for falsifying business records. What made this case different, Bragg didn't need to add, were the identity of the defendant and the legal strategy Bragg is using to elevate the charges of falsifying business records from misdemeanors to felonies.\n\nIn a sixteen-page indictment, \"The People of the State of New York Against Donald J. Trump,\" Bragg's office accused the former President of \"Falsifying Business Records in the First Degree in violation of Penal Law §175.10\"-a New York statute-thirty-four times between February and December of 2017. The charges all relate to payments Trump made to Michael Cohen , his former personal lawyer, who, just before the election in 2016, had quietly paid off Stormy Daniels , an adult-film actress who claimed to have had an affair with Trump. (Trump denies this latter allegation.) For each of the thirty-four counts, the indictment accused Trump of acting \"with intent to defraud and intent to commit another crime and aid and conceal the commission thereof.\" Under New York law, intent to break another law is necessary to charge falsifying business records as a felony rather than a misdemeanor.\n\nTrump and his supporters have accused Bragg, a Democrat, of concocting a legal theory as part of a political hit. The District Attorney, however, was at pains to stress the complex nature of the alleged crimes and the principles that his office was seeking to uphold. \"At its core, this case today is one with allegations-like so many of our white-collar cases-allegations that someone lied again and again to protect their interests and evade the laws to which we are all held accountable,\" the District Attorney said. \"As this office has done time and time again, we today uphold our solemn responsibility to insure everyone stands equal before the law.\"\n\nThe indictment didn't specify the other crime that Trump was intending to commit when he made the payment to Daniels through Cohen-an omission that surprised some legal commentators who aren't friendly to Trump. Speaking on MSNBC, Andrew Weissmann, a New York University School of Law professor who was one of the senior lawyers in the Mueller investigation, said of the indictment: \"You're left a little bit to wonder what precisely is the crime\" that justifies the felony charges. At Bragg's press conference, reporters pressed him on why the indictment hadn't spelled out the other crime-or crimes-that Trump allegedly intended to commit. \"The indictment doesn't specify them because the law does not so require,\" he said.\n\nThe statement of facts that Bragg's office filed to the court along with the indictment did spell out the prosecution's theory of the case, which is that Trump effectively conspired with others to defraud American voters in 2016 by purchasing and suppressing negative information about himself. \"In order to execute the unlawful scheme, the participants violated election laws and made and caused false entries in the business records of various entities in New York,\" the statement of facts says. \"The participants also took steps that mischaracterized, for tax purposes, the true nature of the payments made in furtherance of the scheme.\"\n\nIn explaining Trump's motive in making the payoffs and falsifying business records, Bragg said at his press conference, \"He did so to cover up crimes relating to the 2016 election.\" Bragg also singled out two of the criminal statutes that he suggested the payoff to Daniels had breached: federal campaign-finance law and a New York election law that makes it a campaign violation for two or more people to conspire to further a political candidacy \"by unlawful means.\"\n\nThis justification for the felony prosecution won't satisfy everybody-on Fox News, Bill Barr, Trump's former Attorney General, called the case \"pathetically weak\"-and Trump's legal team is sure to challenge it in pretrial hearings. But the underlying facts in the case, including the payoffs to Daniels and the reimbursements to Cohen, aren't really in dispute. The indictment indicates that Bragg's office has documentary evidence to back up its charges-invoices, business ledgers, signed checks-and it has been working on its over-all legal strategy since resurrecting a case that his predecessor and federal prosecutors both decided not to take to the courthouse.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, I spoke with Marc Agnifilo, a veteran New York criminal-defense lawyer who has also served as an Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan. Agnifilo said that he wasn't surprised by the Trump indictment. \"I've had a number of these cases filed by the Manhattan D.A.'s office, and they all take the same bare-bones approach,\" Agnifilo said. \"They don't indicate in the charges what that second crime is.\"\n\nAgnifilo did add that the other crime is usually obvious, because the charge of falsifying business records is part of a larger indictment for larceny or fraud. \"Here they don't let on in the indictment what the second crime is, but the statement of facts does kind of tell us what it is,\" Agnifilo explained. \"It's a little bit of a grab bag, whether it's a state-elections crime, a federal-elections crime, a tax offense. Between the two documents, you have an idea of what their over-all theory is.\"\n\nIn such a high-profile case, Bragg arguably should have gone beyond a grab bag. Assuming the case comes to trial, Agnifilo said, the prosecution will likely take the jury through the chronology of the payments and the Presidential campaign. \"You say, 'Look, this guy was running for President, and, lo and behold, all this stuff starts happening for the first time, so you know what his intent was.' If they can put that together really tightly, that would be compelling.\" Trump is likely to counter, Agnifilo added, that he was the victim of extortion. \"He can say, 'Yes, it does coincide with when I ran for President because that is when I was shake-downable.' Someone is going to have the better of that argument. The defense has some decent arguments, the prosecution has some decent arguments, and someone is going to win.\"\n\nWhen is that likely to happen? At Tuesday's arraignment, Judge Juan Merchan set the next in-person hearing in the case for December 4th. There will undoubtedly be some pretrial motions before then, including, almost certainly, a motion to dismiss the case from Trump's side. But, assuming that the judge rejects that motion, the case seems likely to drag on well into 2024 before reaching trial. \"I think a year is looking very optimistic,\" Agnifilo said. \"I did not think this would be adjourned right out of the chute for eight months. I now think we are looking at a year and a half, probably.\"\n\nWith Trump facing the possibility of more serious criminal charges elsewhere, the New York case could turn into a sideshow. In Fulton County, Georgia, the district attorney, Fani Willis, is investigating the efforts of Trump and his associates to overturn the results of the 2020 election in that state. In Washington, D.C., a special counsel is looking into Trump's actions following the 2020 election and into his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office. Whatever happens in those investigations, though, Tuesday's criminal indictment marks a low-for him and for the office of the Presidency. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "America's First Indicted Ex-President Is Very Sorry-for Himself\n\nBy the time Donald Trump marched out from behind a phalanx of American flags and emerged into the gilded Mar-a-Lago ballroom to speak to cheering supporters on Tuesday night, America's first indicted ex-President hardly seemed chastened by his historic day as a defendant in a Manhattan courtroom . He told the crowd that prosecutors investigating him were \"racist\" or \"lunatic.\" He criticized the judge in his case. He criticized the judge's daughter. He lied about matters large and small, and expounded at length on everything from \"Russia, Russia, Russia\" to \"Hunter Biden's laptop from Hell.\" He even attacked the National Archives and Records Administration as a \"radical-left troublemaking organization.\"\n\nIndicted and Arraigned Trump, in other words, turned out to be just like his most recent previous incarnation, Impeached and Defeated Trump: a rambling, unrepentant grievance machine so beloved by his superfans in the Republican Party that he remains the front-runner for the G.O.P. nomination in 2024, even after everything.\n\nSince last Thursday, when the Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg , secured Trump's historic indictment, an unrealistic sense of expectation had built up around Tuesday's arraignment of the former President, as if it were going to be, in and of itself, Trump's long-awaited day of reckoning. But of course it was not. The charges, when finally unveiled, on Tuesday afternoon, were thirty-four felony counts stemming from alleged efforts by Trump to suppress sordid stories before the 2016 election with hush-money payments. But no major new evidence or surprise witnesses were revealed, and the next court appearance in the case won't take place until December. Many legal analysts, including even \"hard-core Democrats,\" as Trump gleefully put it during his nighttime Mar-a-Lago speech, were soon casting doubt on Bragg's decision to pursue a case that other prosecutors had declined to bring. If this was a reckoning, it didn't seem all that much like one for an ex-President who, little more than two years ago, was urging a violent mob of his supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol and stop Congress from certifying his 2020 election defeat.\n\nWhat it seemed like, instead, was the kind of televised spectacle that Trump both craves and excels at creating. The television networks remain more than willing to oblige, broadcasting each step in Trump's return to New York to surrender to the authorities with a tone of breathless incrementalism that made for hours of exhausting but largely uneventful coverage : Trump has entered the building! Trump has left the building! Trump, Trump, Trump! What a long day of minutiae. I watched his motorcade leave Trump Tower, just after 1 P.M. Minutes later, I watched live as his motorcade arrived at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse. As far as I could tell, no breaking news occurred in the course of the short trip downtown from Trump Tower.\n\nThe endless vamping by cable-news anchors was tedious-think rain-delay-at-the-World-Series-level tiresome -but at least it wasn't as hard to take as the obvious trolling of the public by Trump and his team. The former President, according to a \"source familiar\" with Trump's state of mind who was quoted on Twitter by a CBS News reporter, was said to be \"resolute, determined, and fighting for all Americans against injustice, persecution, and weaponization.\" Yeah, right. It's not yet clear whether crying persecution by the prosecution will be good for Trump's legal fortunes, but it is already abundantly clear that the TV drama has been good for his political coffers: Trump's campaign, after bragging that he's already raised more than seven million dollars as a result of Bragg's indictment, began sending out fund-raising e-mails using his \"NOT GUILTY\" plea even before he had entered it. Hours before Trump had retreated back to Florida, you could get a T-shirt emblazoned with a fake mug shot of the former President for a contribution of a mere forty-seven dollars to the campaign.\n\nFor a historic day, it was notably unrevelatory. The big surprise, in fact, was that there was no surprise. Before Bragg's sealed indictment was revealed, it seemed that the case would be centered on the years-old allegations involving hush-money payments made to the former porn performer known as Stormy Daniels , with Trump's disgruntled former fixer Michael Cohen and Daniels as key witnesses. And that is what it turned out to be. Reading the official \" statement of facts \" that Bragg's prosecutors filed along with the indictment was like returning to an old book that you'd read with great interest many years ago, but whose particulars you'd long since forgotten. The tawdry, embarrassing story behind the \"Catch and Kill Scheme to Suppress Negative Information\" in the 2016 election, as the prosecutors' memo described it, was not new. Much of this has been known since 2018, when the Wall Street Journal published the first scoop about the hundred-and-thirty-thousand-dollar payoff to Daniels; many other reports followed, including great work by my colleague Ronan Farrow, who extensively reported on how the National Enquirer tabloid worked its \"catch and kill \" tactics on Trump's behalf . Cohen, who handled payoffs for Trump before renouncing him, eventually even testified about the ex-President's \"dirty deeds\" in a public congressional hearing, in early 2019. The flashy evidence produced that day included a photocopy of a check from Donald J. Trump's personal bank account that, Cohen said, had been used to reimburse him for buying Daniels's silence about her assignations with Trump.\n\nIt felt odd to read about all of this once again, in 2023. The Stormy Daniels affair, after all, was so many Trump scandals ago. Before impeachment No. 1 and Trump's refusal to concede the 2020 election. Before January 6th and impeachment No. 2. In contrast, the fact that Trump slept with a porn star and paid her off to keep quiet about it before an election seems like the kind of old-fashioned political contretemps that might be bad for a politician's image-and marriage-and even quite possibly illegal, but which hardly threatens to shake the foundations of American democracy.\n\nIn a press conference on Tuesday, shown on CNN with a split screen as \"Trump Force One\" taxied for takeoff at LaGuardia Airport, Alvin Bragg piously spoke of his \"solemn responsibility to insure that everyone stands equal before the law.\" Bragg may yet mount a strong legal case for Trump's culpability; it's impossible to tell from the bare-bones listing of charges released yesterday. But one thing is already apparent from Tuesday's proceedings: a courtroom resolution rendering judgment on the former President's guilt or innocence will be many months, if not years, in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, Bragg's filing of the charges has had an electrifying effect on Trump's reëlection campaign, offering the ex-President a new grievance to fuel his comeback bid at just the moment when he needs something to galvanize his effort and distract the Republican Party from the growing concerns about his losing record. The short-term boon is real, if possibly quite temporary: since news of the case broke, polls have shown Trump with his biggest leads in the G.O.P. primary so far, and even Trump-skeptical Republicans, such as Mitt Romney, found themselves leaping to his defense against what they insist is a politically motivated prosecution.\n\nNone of this may matter several months from now. Trump faces far more serious potential prosecutions in cases involving his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his possession at Mar-a-Lago of classified documents from his Presidency. If charges are forthcoming in any of those investigations, Manhattan indictment No. 71543-23 may end up as little more than a footnote to history, the first but not the last time that a prosecutor dared to call a former President a crook in a court of law. But what a footnote it will be. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Outside the Trump Courthouse, Times Are Crazy and People Are Strange\n\nBefore the announcement of the verdict in Donald Trump's hush-money trial, on Thursday afternoon, the scene outside the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse had tended toward the mood of a small, fervent MAGA rally: a sideshow of eager players strutting and fretting in aggressively branded Trumpwear. American-flag clothing (dresses, sneakers) abounded, as did clothing that swore at you (\" FUCK JOE BIDEN AND FUCK YOU FOR VOTING FOR HIM \") and signs insulting the prosecutors bringing the case (a drawing of the Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg , styled like the \"Fat Albert\" cartoon, with the caption \"Fat Alvin and the Commie Kids\"). Some fervor was impassioned-a beefy guy in an anti-Biden shirt screaming to cops that a slight, calm guy in a Met Museum shirt had hit him-and some just seemed performative, like the sporadic group chants of \"We love Trump! We love Trump! We love Trump!\" that broke out among people holding signs including \" JEWS FOR TRUMP \" and \" GAYS FOR TRUMP \" and, simply, \" TRUMP .\" People in MAGA hats said things such as \"Racism is a myth-racism stops when you turn off the TV.\"\n\nAll week, the scene outside the courthouse had reflected the uneasy surreality of the scene inside it. Robert De Niro showed up to stump for Biden, and then an artist showed up to display a painting of Trump knocking De Niro out, \"Raging Bull\" style. One day, I'd sat on a park bench next to a pile of mysteriously abandoned notebooks, one open to a handwritten list that read \"10 Things to Keep Stocked in Case the Bottom Falls Out in NYC.\" Some items involved apps and chargers; two were \"A small stage\" and \"Gumption.\" All week, a haggard man in a customized jacket proclaiming the three greatest Presidents to be Washington, Kennedy, and Trump had made the rounds, holding a big crucifix in one hand and ringing a big handbell in the other, circumnavigating the park like an ice-cream truck.\n\n\"If it wasn't for this collection of jerk-offs, there would be absolutely nothing going on,\" a newswire photographer said to his colleague. \"You can quote me on that.\" A dapper white-haired citizen observer who regaled me with stories about doo-wop versus rockabilly drag racing-he'd been rockabilly-said that the scene reminded him of a joke from the sixties. \"We used to say, 'How many people does it take to have a Vietnam protest? Thirty-two: two hippies, a cop, and twenty-nine journalists.' \" He also said that Trump was \"like opium for what's wrong with this country\" and paraphrased a great American philosopher: \"You may be right / he may be crazy / But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for.\"\n\nIn the late afternoon on Thursday, as news about jury activity came, the vibe grew anticipatory, anxious, a bit physical. I worried that violence might explode. Shortly before the verdict arrived, but before we knew it was imminent, a leathery woman in a Trump hat yelled, \"Liberal asshole!\" at an unadorned guy in a navy-blue T-shirt. \"How do you know I'm a liberal?\" the man asked. \"Because you're walkin' around with a dildo up your ass!\" the woman screamed back. I eased myself away. A helicopter appeared overhead, hovering loudly, and texts started saying there was a verdict. Then, in the crowd by the fence, someone yelled, \"Guilty.\" Signs that said \" GUILTY \" rose up above people's heads. (Many in the crowd had come prepared.) \"Guilty!\" another person yelled. \"Guilty!\" I waited for meltdowns and fights. They didn't happen, though somebody did yell, \"Shawshank!\" People smiled, teared up, stared at the courthouse from afar as if trying to understand it. It felt as if a fever had broken.\n\nA man and his teen-age son took a selfie with the courthouse in the background, with expressions that said \"weary relief during historic national moment.\" They lived nearby. \"We're New Yorkers-we've been dealing with Trump for years,\" the dad said. \"I moved here in '86. I used to see him when I was a waiter at South Street Seaport. He was a fraud then and he's a fraud now.\" He'd been around for the last headline-making trial at the building, the Harvey Weinstein case . \"We used to see Weinstein when I would walk my son to school,\" he said. \"It was nothing like this.\"\n\nA long-haired man in his forties, wearing a Panama hat and a Bob Dylan T-shirt, watched the scene with an expression of wary distaste. \"This is the assassination of free speech,\" he told me. \"It's a really sad day in America.\" He was a Trump supporter. \"I like his honesty,\" he said. I asked what Dylan songs he liked best, and he told me to listen to \"Things Have Changed.\" Later, I did. \"People are crazy and times are strange / I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range / I used to care, but things have changed.\"\n\nAcross the street, banner-holding members of the progressive group Rise and Resist were jubilant. \"Count one: Guilty!\" they sang. \"Count two: Guilty!\" They continued for all thirty-four. A man handed out \"Guilty\" signs with Trump's face on them. An older cop with a bullhorn politely asked protesters to stay on the sidewalk, and a few people with signs of varying messages (pro-Trump, pro-trans, pro-guilty) convened in a crosswalk. Suddenly the sound of a smack cracked in the air and a man started screaming \"Sexually disoriented!\" at a trans woman. An elderly security guard walked away from this scene. \"Trump turned everybody stupid!\" he yelled to the air.\n\nA couple of blocks away, citizens craving refreshment-suit-wearing lawyers, a schoolteacher, a self-described actor/tour guide-bellied up to an al-fresco bar called Jury Duty. People ordered things like the Judge (a burger) and the Defendant (a veggie burger) as a marching band showed up nearby, outside the New York Supreme Court. Sure, why not?

      "text": "Why Does New York's Criminal Investigation of Donald Trump Appear All But Over?\n\nThe criminal prosecution of Donald Trump in his home town appears to be all but officially over, at least for now. In an unexpected reversal of roles, Alvin Bragg, who took over as Manhattan's District Attorney, in January, after campaigning on a promise to hold the former President accountable, instead seems to have all but abandoned the case that was brought by his predecessor Cyrus Vance, Jr. , a prosecutor often criticized for being too timid.\n\nBefore finishing out his third term as Manhattan D.A., Vance's office successfully took its case against Trump to the Supreme Court twice. His office then indicted both Trump's company, the Trump Organization, and his former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, on tax charges. Prosecutors under Vance were reportedly focussing on whether Trump had criminally manipulated sworn statements of his net worth to mislead banks into giving him favorable loans, and government authorities into falsely reducing his taxes.\n\nThe former President has denied the allegations, and accused the Manhattan D.A.'s office of conducting a political witch hunt. But there were signs that investigators were making headway. This month, Mazars U.S.A., the accounting firm that had long handled Trump's business, essentially fired him as a client, saying that it couldn't vouch for the accuracy of nine years' worth of Trump's financial statements. A second grand jury was empanelled last November to hear the prosecutor's developing case against Trump, and its term does not expire until April.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Times reported that the two most prominent prosecutors overseeing the case had unceremoniously quit. Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz submitted their resignations after Bragg signalled that he lacked confidence in the historic case. During his campaign last year, and in the weeks before taking office, Bragg had, in contrast, signalled that he would personally review the probe and expressed gratitude for the work of the two veteran prosecutors. \"This is obviously a consequential case, one that merits the attention of the DA personally,\" he told CNN , in December. \"I can say that you've got two very good lawyers that have been looking at it for a while. I think it would be a disservice to Manhattan to lose them.\"\n\nDunne and Pomerantz, both of whom  had high-profile legal careers in private practice prior to  working on the Manhattan D.A.'s investigation, differed with Bragg and wanted to continue pressing the case, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. They became frustrated, though, with what they regarded as Bragg's lack of support for the probe. The source suggested that career prosecutors in the office's Investigation Division had questioned the strength of the case as well.\n\nIn the past, career prosecutors in the Manhattan D.A.'s office have stood in the way of other risky cases, including the first potential prosecution of Harvey Weinstein on sexual-assault charges. Vance's office eventually convicted Weinstein, but it was years after a victim had filed a police report. An individual with ties to the D.A.'s office, who asked not to be named, said that Bragg's decision raised questions about whether he will prove forceful enough to overcome the institutional inertia in the office. \"These two guys who resigned today are pros,\" the source said, referring to Dunne and Pomerantz. \"I was told that they simply felt that Bragg was not going to engage, and they needed the D.A. to be engaged to be able to proceed toward taking action.\" Bragg, the source added, had given the prosecutors the impression that he was distracted and disengaged, often checking his phone during meetings about the case. (A spokesperson for the D.A. said that both claims are untrue.) The Washington Post , meanwhile, reported that Bragg was slow to meet with Dunne and Pomerantz after taking office. When Bragg did meet the two prosecutors, he didn't seem deeply interested in the probe.\n\nA spokesperson for Bragg told the Times that the investigation would continue without the two prosecutors, and that the D.A. was \"grateful for their service.\" But the source with knowledge of the probe said that, though Bragg might say it is ongoing, activity in the case has stopped. In essence, Bragg reversed a go decision. So far, his reasoning remains opaque.\n\nThe case was always a high-wire act. Unlike the parallel civil case under investigation by New York's attorney general, Letitia James, which only needs to reach a threshold of \"preponderance of the evidence\" to find Trump liable for violating the law, the D.A.'s criminal case would have had to convince a jury \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that Trump had criminal intent to defraud. Real-estate valuations of the kind that Trump was under investigation for manipulating are also often slippery, but Vance's team had hoped to prove that Trump engaged in a decades-long pattern of criminal fraud. Dunne, in particular, spent years on the investigation, and, although he and Pomerantz apparently never thought the case would be easy, they both believed that it had merit.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has denounced the prosecutors investigating him, which includes  both Bragg and James, who are Black, as \"racists.\" He also faces criminal investigations outside of Manhattan, including one in Fulton County, Georgia, where judges approved a request from the local district attorney to convene a grand jury to weigh charges against Trump resulting from his alleged attempt to pressure officials into reversing his loss in the state's 2020 Presidential election. While Manhattan may be pulling the plug on prosecuting Trump's business, the D.A.'s office in suburban Westchester County has opened a separate criminal investigation into his business activities there. As the Times reported , the Westchester district attorney is investigating the finances of the Trump National Golf Club in the county.\n\nMichael Cohen, a former attorney and close confidant of the ex-President who pleaded guilty to violating campaign-finance laws on Trump's behalf, said a decision not to indict would be \"a dereliction of duty to all New Yorkers and the country.\" Cohen added that he had expected to testify against his former boss before the grand jury himself: \"I know the information in the NYDA's possession,\" he said.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHere's how, specifically, to assess whether an investigation is politicized - and how the Trump case measures up.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nDonald Trump and his allies have claimed that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's prosecution of him is a political, politicized mess.\n\nThey're not entirely wrong.\n\nI'm not particularly inclined to defend Donald Trump as a sterling adherent to the rule of law. The investigations into him - special counsel Jack Smith's federal probes into Trump's attempt to overturn Biden's election win and his classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, as well as the Georgia probe into whether Trump tried to steal the election there - seem well-founded. Guess what? If you try to steal the election, you should be rigorously investigated and charged if the evidence and law merit it.\n\nAnd yet the Manhattan DA office's long investigation, culminating in last week's 34-count indictment of Trump for falsifying business records, has not inspired confidence in me that this was an apolitical process and a fair-minded effort to assess whether laws were broken - rather than an attempt to \"get Trump\" for to-be-determined crimes.\n\nI can't read Bragg's mind, but as someone who's been covering investigations into leading political figures for the past decade, I've thought a lot about how to assess politicization of the rule of law .\n\nI've come to think that prosecutions and investigations that can fairly be characterized as politicized tend to share several of the following traits:\n\nHere's what we know.\n\nThe more politicized an investigation is, the more the end purpose seems to be to \"get\" a particular political figure, with the exact crimes at issue being a matter of secondary importance.\n\nMany of these traits were evident in the investigations Trump tried to order into his political opponents during his presidency. Many were also present in investigations into Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which started as the \"Whitewater\" investigation and sprawled outward.\n\nAnd they all arguably fit Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's investigation and prosecution of Donald Trump.\n\nSome former prosecutors and Democratic-aligned legal experts have argued that Bragg's case is righteous and not political at all - that it's basically totally normal and there's nothing to see here.\n\nTrump \"is being treated as any other New Yorker would be with similar evidence against him,\" Karen Friedman Agnifilo and Norman Eisen write . \"The indictment is therefore anything but political. If anything, the more political choice would have been not to indict when there is so much scrutiny.\"\n\nYet in my view, a fuller look at the background of the investigation and the specifics of the charges make Bragg's prosecution look very political indeed. Let's go through the traits I listed above and assess whether they apply.\n\nIs it a fishing expedition? Arguably - it's certainly been a tangled tale . The previous DA, Cyrus Vance Jr., opened the case back in 2019 to focus on hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels. Vance then put that aside and spent years probing the Trump Organization's business practices, specifically regarding real estate valuation.\n\nTo try to make that case, he pressured Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg to flip on Trump by charging him (and the company) with tax fraud related to fringe benefits Weisselberg had received. Then, when Bragg took over as DA last year, he wasn't impressed by the real estate valuation case and put a hold on it, spurring two prosecutors to resign in protest . Bragg then returned to the hush money payments and indicted Trump based on that.\n\nDoes it focus on an obscure or technical matter? Yes. The charges pertain to New York business records law - and specifically about whether the Trump Organization's repayments to Michael Cohen for $130,000 in hush money he'd paid Stormy Daniels were inappropriately logged by the company as legal expenses.\n\nSo the core violation here is, basically, that the Trump Organization logged hush money repayments improperly. The more small-scale charges like this after a long investigation seem, the more they suggest prosecutors landed on them because they tried to make a bigger case that didn't pan out.\n\nDoes it resemble previous prosecutions? In some ways yes, in some ways no. Business records charges are common in the Manhattan district attorney's office. The New York Times called this charge \"the bread and butter\" of the office's white-collar practice, pointing out that during Bragg's tenure of a little over a year, 29 individuals and companies were charged with such offenses before Trump. \"The charge of creating false financial records is constantly brought,\" Agnifilo and Eisen write .\n\nStill, there is some dispute about how the charge is being applied in this case. Fordham law professor Jed Shugerman points out that these false records were just internal company documents, and that Bragg has not yet specifically alleged they were used to deceive anyone. Shugerman asked whether there's ever been a conviction in such a case. Various former prosecutors in the Manhattan DA's office have argued that they can and did file such charges based on internal documents, but it's unclear whether the legality of that theory has been directly tested in court.\n\nDoes it feature novel or contested legal theories? Absolutely. Bragg has charged these business records offenses as felonies rather than misdemeanors. His legal basis for doing this currently resembles a ramshackle contraption held together with spit and bailing wire.\n\nThe felony charges require that these false business records were created with the intent to commit or conceal another crime. Reportedly, Bragg's team has for some time been mulling over exactly what crime they would argue was in play here, because all of the possibilities have some problems. And in the indictment and an accompanying press conference, he punted this issue, mentioning three possibilities - state election law, federal election law, and tax law - but keeping his specific reasoning vague. (He argued in a press conference that he doesn't have to explain his thinking on this yet.)\n\nThe first possibility is a federal election crime, since federal prosecutors previously asserted Cohen's hush payments to Daniels essentially amounted to a campaign donation to Trump, given that it was aimed at helping him win the election, and it should have been disclosed and subject to contribution limits. In itself, that was a somewhat innovative interpretation of campaign finance law without much clear precedent.\n\nOn top of that, though, there's the fact that Bragg is a state prosecutor without authority over federal law. Some have argued that New York's business records statute says a felony occurs when \"another crime\" is invoked and doesn't specify that it has to be another state crime, so he could try that argument with judges. But at the very least it's extremely uncertain whether this will survive court scrutiny, with both state and federal courts potentially set to get involved, as my colleague Ian Millhiser writes.\n\nThe second possibility is a state campaign finance crime. New York state law says it's illegal to \"conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.\" Yet Trump was running for federal office, and it's questionable that state election law could be invoked over a federal campaign.\n\nThe third possibility is a tax crime. The Trump Organization paid Cohen back double, so he could claim the repayment money as income and pay half of it in taxes. Bragg's statement of facts asserts that Trump and Cohen \"took steps that mischaracterized, for tax purposes, the true nature of the payments.\"\n\nOne possible implication here is that the Trump Organization intended to deduct the payments as business expenses, and that's why they characterized it as legal fees. Yet Bragg does not outright allege this - so it's unclear whether he has the evidence to back this up.\n\nAre investigators internally divided on the case's strength? They have been. There has been no sign of dissent from the current team on the strength of the case Bragg brought, but overall this has been an unusually leaky investigation, with acrimony between members of the prosecution team frequently spilling into public view.\n\nAs mentioned, Bragg wasn't impressed by the real estate valuation case that lead prosecutor Mark Pomerantz had been building, and Pomerantz resigned and wrote a book complaining about Bragg. This led others on the team to complain about Pomerantz to Ankush Khardori of New York magazine .\n\nOne regular sticking point is Michael Cohen's usefulness as a witness. Federal prosecutors looked into the hush money, too, as recently as early 2021, and according to CNN legal analyst Elie Honig's recent book Untouchable , they had mixed opinions about the case and ended up taking a pass.\n\nDoes it involve scrutiny and an investment of resources that would not have been put on anyone else? It's hard for me to imagine that this years-long investment of resources into this topic would be brought against anyone other than Trump.\n\nDo those bringing the case have obvious political motives? Bragg is an elected Democrat who, if he runs for another term, would be running in Democratic New York City. When he initially put the brakes on Vance's investigation, he faced intense backlash from progressives who thought he was letting Trump off the hook. So, yes, he has a motive to get back on progressives' good side.\n\nPoliticians shouldn't be above the law - if they commit crimes, and there's evidence to show that, they should be charged. But criminal law shouldn't be weaponized for political reasons against the opposing party's enemies. When that happens in other countries, we generally view it as a sign of dysfunction or corruption.\n\nNow, there is a difference between the politicized cases Trump wanted to bring against his political enemies, and this current situation, which is: Many liberals believe Donald Trump is a grave threat to democracy. (And I think they're correct.)\n\nThe right has long tried to portray Trump as the victim of endless witch hunts from investigators. Of course, Republicans managed to convince themselves Hillary Clinton was tremendously dangerous for American democracy, too (remember the \" Flight 93 election ?\").\n\nBut, again, Trump did go to extraordinary lengths to try to steal the 2020 election, which really should end all talk of him as some kind of unfairly persecuted innocent. A second Trump term, should he win, would probably also be quite dangerous for the rule of law.\n\nMany liberals who have been hoping and arguing for Trump's indictment seem to have this justification in mind, even if few will say it explicitly. In 2021, when it looked like Bragg's predecessor, Vance, might bring charges, he was profiled in the New Yorker , and the former president's niece Mary Trump weighed in. \"It's incredibly urgent that Vance prosecutes Donald now,\" she said, because the Republican Party certainly wasn't going to stop him.\n\nPer this mindset, it would be naive to have academic concerns about politicization of the rule of law, when the nation's continuing existence as a democracy is at stake. Find some crimes, and lock him up!\n\nMaybe it will work - polls show that though most Americans say they think Bragg has political motives, most also think the investigation is significant and should disqualify Trump for office.\n\nOr maybe this prosecution will backfire, spurring Republican voters to rally around him and easing his path to the GOP nomination, making our country's divisions even worse - setting us off on a cycle of retribution .

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHouse Republicans are going after the DA's work on Trump's indictment. Bragg is fighting back.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nOn Monday, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) once again attacked Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg , this time on his home turf in New York City.\n\nRep. Jordan has been criticizing Bragg's leadership for weeks, as the DA pursues charges against former President Donald Trump related to falsifying business records. This week, the lawmaker continued that onslaught by holding a field hearing in New York City about crime in the city and alleging that Bragg wasn't doing enough to curb it. The goal, essentially, was to make Bragg seem to be ineffective at best, and incompetent at worst.\n\nThe hearing featured multiple witnesses Republicans brought in to discuss their experiences with crime in New York, including a person who experienced an antisemitic attack in Times Square and a bodega owner who was charged with murder following his stabbing of an attacker.\n\nDemocrats pushed back on the hearing, arguing that the panel was a \"political stunt.\" A Bragg spokesperson noted that New York City was the \"safest big city in America\" and cited data that found that shootings and homicides had declined in the city in the first quarter of the year. Jordan's hearing comes as his standoff with Bragg has intensified, and as Republicans have sought new ways to defend Trump from any perceptions that the former president has done anything wrong.\n\nBragg has hit back at the GOP, most notably by filing a lawsuit against Jordan in an effort to block Republicans' demands that witnesses from Bragg's office testify before Congress. The suit also hopes to negate the GOP's efforts to obtain documents related to Trump's indictment . Bragg also argues in the lawsuit that federal lawmakers shouldn't be interfering in a local criminal case, and is specifically seeking to block the testimony of former prosecutor Mark Pomerantz, who Jordan has subpoenaed.\n\nJordan responded to that suit by arguing \"the prospect of a politically motivated prosecution of a former President could give rise to issues of substantial federal concern\" and that Congress has a right to investigate such efforts in order to consider legislative responses.\n\nA judge is scheduled to make a decision on the lawsuit on Wednesday. That move could determine to what degree Republicans can continue to use their congressional investigations to distract the public from the 34 counts of falsifying business records that Trump's been indicted on.\n\nHouse Republicans' attacks on Bragg go beyond his spat with Jordan. GOP lawmakers from the speaker to rank-and-file members have aggressively gone after the Manhattan DA as they've mounted a vocal defense of Trump.\n\n\"Alvin Bragg has irreparably damaged our country in an attempt to interfere in our Presidential election,\" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy previously said in a tweet . \"The American people will not tolerate this injustice, and the House of Representatives will hold Alvin Bragg and his unprecedented abuse of power to account.\"\n\nAnother attack that Republicans have used is pointing out that Bragg used federal funds to conduct his investigation. Bragg's office has responded by noting that it's used about $5,000 in federal dollars in order to conduct investigations into Trump and his companies, including litigation over access to his tax returns. These funds come from federal forfeiture funds the DA's office helped collect, and not federal grant programs, Bragg's office said.\n\nJordan's investigation and demands for testimony and documents are a major part of the push to continue going after Bragg. By calling Bragg's motivations and the legitimacy of his case into question, Republicans hope to defuse - or at least distract from - the charges against Trump. In doing so, they're also showing their supporters how hard they're advocating for the former president, who maintains a strong grip on the GOP base, whether or not they actually obtain the testimony and documents they've requested.\n\nAs Kaleigh Rogers has written for FiveThirtyEight , House Republicans' demands for information in an active criminal investigation are unprecedented, and convincing a court to enforce a subpoena regarding an active criminal case is poised to be tough.\n\nStill, the House GOP has made it clear it plans to try. The crime hearing on Monday was only the latest expansion of those actions.\n\nUpdate, April 17, 4:40 pm ET: This story was originally published on April 12 and has been updated to include a hearing on crime held this week.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nNo one knows if Donald Trump can be prosecuted for the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nThere is something painfully anticlimactic about Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's indictment of former President Trump. It concerns not Trump's efforts to overthrow the duly elected government of the United States , but his alleged effort to cover up a possible extramarital affair with a porn star.\n\nAnd there's a very real risk that this indictment will end in an even bigger anticlimax. It is unclear that the felony statute that Trump is accused of violating actually applies to him.\n\nThe indictment charges Trump with 34 separate counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, a felony. A separate document laying out the factual basis for Bragg's allegations against Trump points to a complicated web of arrangements between Trump, his former lawyer Michael Cohen (who is identified as \"Lawyer A\"), and David Pecker, the CEO of American Media, the company that publishes the National Enquirer.\n\nBragg alleges that these three men worked together to identify two women who allegedly had sex with Trump, and to pay them to remain silent. The women are identified as \"Woman 1\" and \"Woman 2\" by Bragg, but the first woman appears to be former Playboy model Karen McDougal , and the second appears to be porn actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nCohen, who pleaded guilty to a federal campaign finance crime arising out of this scheme in 2018, paid $130,000 to Daniels shortly before the 2016 election, in order to secure her silence. According to Bragg, Trump then paid Cohen a total of $420,000 over the course of 2017 , much of which was intended to reimburse Cohen for the payment to Daniels.\n\nThe actual felony counts arise out of allegedly false entries that Trump made in various business records in order to make the payment to Daniels appear to be ordinary legal expenses paid to Cohen.\n\nBut Bragg built his case on an exceedingly uncertain legal theory. Even if Trump did the things he's accused of, it's not clear Bragg can legally charge Trump for them, at least under the felony version of New York's false records law.\n\nAs Mark Pomerantz, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan DA's office who played a significant role in the Trump investigation prior to his resignation in 2022, wrote in a recent book , a key legal question that will determine whether Trump can be charged under the felony version of New York's false records law has never been resolved by any appellate court in the state of New York.\n\nThe felony statute requires Bragg to prove that Trump falsified records to cover up a crime. Bragg has evidence that Trump acted to cover up a federal crime, but it is not clear that Bragg is allowed to point to a federal crime in order to charge Trump under the New York state law.\n\nThe answer to this \"gnarly legal question,\" as Pomerantz put it, is simply unknown. So there is a serious risk that a New York judge will toss out the charges against Trump on technical legal grounds unrelated to the former president's actual conduct.\n\nAnd even if Bragg's legal team convinces New York's own courts that this prosecution may move forward, there is also a very real danger that the Supreme Court of the United States, with its GOP-appointed supermajority, could decide that it needs to weigh in on whether Trump should be shielded from this prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court has long held, under a doctrine known as the \" rule of lenity ,\" that \" fair warning should be given to the world , in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.\" Thus, when the meaning of a criminal statute is unclear, the Constitution sometimes requires that statute to be read narrowly because an unclear criminal law did not give potential defendants \"fair warning\" that their conduct was illegal.\n\nThe current Court is divided about when this rule of lenity should apply, and whether it provides much protection at all to criminal defendants. But, if the current slate of justices decide that they must have the final word on whether Bragg may prosecute Trump, they could easily invoke the rule of lenity to justify asserting the Supreme Court's jurisdiction over the case.\n\nBragg, in other words, has built one of the most controversial and high-profile criminal cases in American history upon the most uncertain of foundations. And that foundation could crumble into dust if the courts reject his legal arguments on a genuinely ambiguous question of law.\n\nIn October 2016, while Trump was at the height of his first presidential campaign, porn actress Stormy Daniels was reportedly preparing to come forward with an allegation that she had sex with Trump in 2006. In an apparent attempt to quash this story, Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 . Trump then reimbursed Cohen for this payment over the course of 2017.\n\nCohen later pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance violations arising out of this scheme. The idea behind that prosecution was that because this money was spent to prevent a damaging story from emerging while Trump was campaigning for federal office, it should have been disclosed as a campaign expense and should have been subject to limits on campaign donations.\n\nTrump, in other words, is not being charged for the payments to Daniels themselves (most of the time, paying someone to keep quiet about something is not a crime). He is not being charged with campaign finance violations, either. (After Trump left office in 2021, federal prosecutors reportedly considered charging Trump with a campaign finance violation , but ultimately decided against it.)\n\nInstead, Trump is accused of violating a state law that makes it a crime to falsify business records with the intent to defraud - and doing so specifically to conceal another crime, the federal legal violations at the heart of Cohen's conviction.\n\nIf that sounds convoluted, well, it is. But this convoluted approach may be necessary if Bragg wants to charge Trump with a felony.\n\nOrdinarily, falsifying business records in this way is only a misdemeanor under New York law, meaning that it is considered to be a minor crime that is only punishable by up to a year in prison.\n\nBut someone accused of falsifying business records may be charged with a felony if their \"intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof .\"\n\nIn a vague statement made after Trump's arraignment, Bragg claims the concealed records scheme \" violated New York election law , which makes it a crime to conspire to promote a candidacy by unlawful means.\" But this legal theory is not mentioned at all in the indictment or the accompanying statement of facts .\n\nThat leaves the federal campaign finance violation that led to Cohen's guilty plea.\n\nBut it is far from clear that a New York state prosecutor may charge Trump with a felony because he tried to cover up a federal, as opposed to a state, crime.\n\nAs Pomerantz writes in his recent book, the felony statute is \"ambiguous\" - though it refers to \"another crime,\" it does not say whether this crime may be a federal criminal act or only an act that violates New York's own criminal law. Worse, Pomerantz writes, \" no appellate court in New York has ever upheld (or rejected) this interpretation of the law .\"\n\nIt's also possible that Bragg will try to link Trump to a second federal crime allegedly committed by Pecker or his company. As Bragg notes, Pecker's company \" entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in connection with AMI's payoff of Woman 1.\" But linking Trump to a second federal crime does not solve the legal problem that could blow up his felony case.\n\nThat doesn't mean that Bragg will lose, but it does mean that he will have to convince New York's courts to adopt the more expansive reading of the felony statute in order to sustain a conviction. If the courts embrace the more narrow reading of the statute, that would mean that Trump can only be charged with a misdemeanor.\n\nThere's also one more twist here. The statute of limitations for the felony version of the false records crime is five years , while the statute of limitations for the misdemeanor version is only two years. Trump's final payment to Cohen occurred in December 2017 , which was more than five years ago.\n\nThat said, New York law sometimes allows the clock to be stopped on these statutes of limitations when the defendant was out of the state , and Trump spent four years living in the White House before relocating to Florida.\n\nAs a general rule, New York's own courts are supposed to have the final word on how to interpret New York's own law . Though the US Supreme Court is the final authority on how to read federal law (including the US Constitution), the highest court in each state is supposed to have the final say on how to interpret that state's own law.\n\nBut this case also presents at least two questions that turn on the proper way to read a federal statute or the US Constitution.\n\nThe first question is whether federal campaign finance law actually criminalizes the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels. Former Attorney General Bill Barr - a lawyer who, admittedly, often bent over backward to protect Trump while he was in office - was a staunch critic of this legal theory . And the question of whether Cohen could lawfully be convicted under campaign finance law was never tested because Cohen pleaded guilty and did not fight his conviction.\n\nBut the question of whether federal law prohibited the payments to Daniels is also at the heart of Bragg's prosecution. If these payments were not a federal crime, then Trump potentially cannot be charged with the felony version of the New York law and the case against him must be dismissed.\n\nThe second federal legal question presented by Bragg's prosecution is whether the rule of lenity requires courts to select the narrower interpretation of the New York falsified business records law. Many justices have argued that this rule of lenity is implicit in the Constitution's guarantee that no one shall be denied liberty without \"due process\" of law. So Trump could ask the Supreme Court to rule that this prosecution is unconstitutional.\n\nWill that argument prevail? It's unclear. The current Court is divided on how broadly to apply this rule of lenity, with Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch arguing for a more expansive approach, while Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh push a more pro-prosecution approach.\n\nFor the moment, Alito and Kavanaugh appear to have the advantage in this fight. The Court said in Ocasio v. United States (2016) that the rule requiring ambiguous criminal statutes to be construed favorably toward the defendant \"applies only when a criminal statute contains a 'grievous ambiguity or uncertainty,' and 'only if, after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,' the Court 'can make no more than a guess as to what [the legislature] intended.'\"\n\nBut it's unclear whether the Court would stick to Ocasio if the alternative were to allow the frontrunner for the Republican Party's presidential nomination to be hauled off to prison.\n\nAll of which is a long way of saying that we may need to wait a very long time before the courts determine once and for all whether Trump may be convicted under the felony statutes he is accused of violating - indeed, if the Supreme Court gets involved in this case, we may not get an answer until well after the 2024 election.\n\nAnd, of course, even if Bragg does convince the courts that Trump was properly charged with a felony, he will still need to prove that case to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nUpdate, 6 pm ET: This story has been updated to include comments Bragg made at a press conference.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nDonald Trump is the first, second, third, and fourth former president to be indicted for a crime.\n\nby Ian Millhiser and Andrew Prokop\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has now been indicted four times , in four separate jurisdictions, for an array of crimes arising out of how he became president, how he attempted to hold on to the office after losing the 2020 election, and how he refused to give up the trappings of office after President Joe Biden was inaugurated.\n\nThe newest indictment was filed on August 14 in Georgia . It alleges that Trump led a massive conspiracy to overturn Biden's victory in the 2020 election. Notably, this Georgia indictment also includes charges against 18 of Trump's alleged co-conspirators. They include high-profile figures like former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former US Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark, as well as some surprising figures like a former publicist for the artist Ye .\n\nThese Georgia charges follow a similar federal indictment: On August 1, prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team charged Trump in the District of Columbia with four counts related to his attempt to stay in power after the 2020 election. The indictment argues that Trump's lies about massive voter fraud and pressure on various elected officials to change the results, among other actions, amounted to a criminal conspiracy. His trial date there has not yet been set.\n\nIn June, Smith's team had separately charged Trump in Florida over his handling of classified documents . That indictment claimed that Trump flouted a subpoena requiring him to surrender classified national security documents he kept in unsecured locations at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida residence. And at the end of July, Smith's team filed a \" superseding indictment \" adding more charges, accusing Trump of trying to have security camera footage deleted rather than providing it to investigators. This trial is scheduled for May 20, 2024.\n\nAnd before any of that, in April, Trump was charged with 34 separate counts by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in connection with the most absurd crime imaginable: allegedly falsifying business records to cover up the hush money payments he paid to an adult film actress , which was itself intended to cover up an extramarital affair Trump allegedly had shortly after his third wife gave birth to their son Barron. This trial is scheduled for March 25, 2024.\n\nWe do not yet know if any of these prosecutions will end in Trump being convicted of a crime or sent to prison.\n\nHere's what we know.\n\nThe classified documents case is arguably the most open-and-shut, but it's before a judge who appears to be highly sympathetic to Trump, and in a district where the jury pool may contain many of his staunch supporters. In the other pending trials, Trump will likely file challenges to prosecutors' legal theories, and higher courts may weigh in.\n\nAnd there's the added wrinkle that, if Trump wins the presidency again in 2024, he could take over the Justice Department and make the federal cases against him go away.\n\nWhen all these investigations are complete and all the potential charges against Trump are resolved, in other words, it is still possible that he will never be convicted of a crime.\n\nNevertheless, Trump is already the first former US president ever to be indicted . And, by the time this entire saga is over, he could potentially be convicted of multiple crimes in four different criminal proceedings.\n\nThe Justice Department's larger investigation into the January 6 attacks has been going on since they happened, focusing first on the people who stormed the Capitol. But initially, there wasn't a consensus in the political world about whether Trump had committed crimes with his web of lies about the election. So an investigation into him does not appear to have begun immediately.\n\nWe now know that a team of prosecutors began more intensely scrutinizing Trump and his associates in the fall of 2021 . Toward the end of that year, this team was \"given the green light by the Justice Department to take a case all the way up to Trump, if the evidence leads them there,\" CNN later reported .\n\nIn January 2022, the Washington Post reported that \"so far the department does not appear to be directly investigating\" Trump. But just a week and a half after that article, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco confirmed an investigation into one aspect of Trump's scheme: fake electors. By May, the investigation had subpoenaed many close Trump aides for documents and was asking specifically for info about lawyers who had tried to help him overturn the election.\n\nAfter Trump's November 2022 announcement that he was running for president again, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith , to take over this investigation, as well as the separate classified documents probe. In the ensuing months, a growing number of Trump aides testified before Washington, DC, grand juries. Legal challenges unfolded behind the scenes as Trump filed suits to try and block testimony of ex-officials like former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Vice President Mike Pence , but these efforts largely failed.\n\nAt long last, the investigation culminated on August 1 with Trump's indictment on four counts: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of an official proceeding, and conspiracy to disenfranchise voters.\n\nThough the indictment acknowledges that Trump had the right to speak freely about the election and even to lie about it, and that he had the right to challenge the results \"through lawful and appropriate means,\" Smith argues that his conduct went far beyond that and amounted to criminal conspiracy.\n\nHe singled out five main aspects of this conspiracy, all of which, he said, relied on Trump's false claims of massive voter fraud:\n\nThe indictment also mentions, but does not name, six specific co-conspirators. It provides enough details to match their descriptions to previously reported information, which makes clear five of the conspirators are Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Sidney Powell, Kenneth Chesebro, and Jeffrey Clark. (The first four are Trump attorneys, and Clark was a Justice Department official in his administration.) They have not yet been charged.\n\nThis is all fairly novel territory, and it's hard to point to a case quite like it. The heart of Trump's defense will likely be an argument that he truly believed the election was stolen and that his conduct was politicking and political speech, not a criminal conspiracy.\n\nBut the former president got some bad news when Judge Tanya Chutkan , who has been known for imposing harsh sentences on January 6 rioters, was assigned to his case. A trial date has not yet been set.\n\nIn contrast to Trump's sprawling effort to stay in power, the parallel case Smith has brought against him in Florida is simpler: The gist is that he took classified documents and he didn't give them back.\n\nBack in January 2021, when Trump was leaving office, he had many government documents sent to Mar-a-Lago. The National Archives - the agency in charge of keeping government records - soon noticed many were missing and asked for them back. A lengthy back-and-forth ensued.\n\nTrump stonewalled and insisted the documents were rightfully his, but eventually, in January 2022, he agreed to return some of them. Archives officials then discovered many of the documents he'd had were classified, and they also suspected he was still holding on to some others. So they referred the matter to the Justice Department.\n\nThe DOJ sent Trump a subpoena demanding he return more. Trump's team did return some more, and told the government in June 2022 that they'd searched the property and there was no more classified material remaining. But investigators believed that to be false and ordered an August 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago, which found more than 100 more classified documents. The search revealed the investigation to the world and made clear Trump was in serious legal jeopardy. Special counsel Smith took over the case in November 2022.\n\nIn June 2023, Smith's team indicted Trump on 37 counts, accusing him of unauthorized retention of defense information, conspiring to obstruct justice, withholding government documents, scheming to conceal information from a grand jury, and causing false statements to be made to the government. They also charged Trump's personal aide Walt Nauta on six counts, accusing him of making false statements to the FBI and conspiring with Trump to conceal information.\n\nThe indictment alleged that, while out of office, Trump deliberately kept many documents involving military, nuclear, and intelligence secrets. It made the case that he knew full well some of that information was classified. It contained a wealth of evidentiary detail attesting to Trump's intense interest in those documents and his deep involvement in discussions about what to return to the government. And it recounted how Trump allegedly schemed to hide certain documents from his own attorneys and from the government.\n\nThen, in late July, Smith filed a superseding indictment accusing Trump and the Mar-a-Lago property manager, Carlos De Oliveira, with attempting to delete surveillance footage of the property that should have been provided to investigators.\n\nThe documents case is generally believed to be strong. Yet Trump may have had a stroke of good fortune when Judge Aileen Cannon was assigned to the case. Appointed by Trump himself, Cannon had previously overseen the former president's lawsuit related to the FBI's Mar-a-Lago search, and she departed from legal precedent in surprising ways to side with Trump's team. Judges in higher courts eventually overturned her rulings, but there are many ways in which a trial judge could put her thumb on the scale in Trump's favor.\n\nCannon has scheduled a trial date for May 20, 2024.\n\nBefore charging Trump in April, the Manhattan DA had already been investigating financial fraud at the Trump Organization for several years. Bragg's office has already secured a couple of convictions against Trump's primary business and one of his close business associates.\n\nLast August, former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg pleaded guilty to allegations that he did not pay taxes on $1.7 million in compensation - including an apartment, two cars, and private school tuition for family members . He also agreed to testify against the Trump Organization, and this allowed prosecutors to convict the Trump Organization of 17 counts of tax fraud and related financial crimes arising from the payments to Weisselberg.\n\nBut Weisselberg did not agree to testify against Trump, and the actual charges against the former president arise out of a separate set of shady transactions: Trump's alleged $130,000 in payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels, which were made to cover up an alleged sexual encounter between Trump and Daniels in 2006 (Trump denies that he had sex with Daniels).\n\nNotably, Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance crimes arising out of these hush money payments to Daniels in 2018.\n\nIn April, Bragg's office unsealed an indictment that charges Trump with 34 separate counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, a felony. A separate document laying out the factual basis for Bragg's allegations against Trump points to a complicated web of arrangements between Trump, Cohen (who is identified as \"Lawyer A\"), and David Pecker, the CEO of American Media, the company that publishes the National Enquirer.\n\nNew York law typically does not make it a crime to pay a former sexual partner to remain silent about an affair. But it is a crime to falsify business records in New York \"with the intent to defraud.\"\n\nSo, if Bragg can prove that Trump mischaracterized his payments to Daniels in the Trump Organization's own documents in order to cover up those payments, that could potentially allow Trump to be convicted.\n\nThere is, however, a catch. Ordinarily, falsifying business records is only a misdemeanor under New York law - meaning that it is a minor crime that is only punishable by up to a year in prison. That said, it is possible to charge a defendant accused of falsifying business records with a felony. To charge Trump with a felony, however, Bragg also has to prove that Trump falsified business records with the \" intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof .\"\n\nIn the statement of facts document, Bragg tries to link Trump to the federal campaign finance crime Cohen pleaded guilty to in 2018 and a broader \"scheme\" with Pecker to suppress damaging stories in the lead-up to the election. But it is far from clear that New York state prosecutors may charge Trump with a felony because he tried to cover up a federal, as opposed to a state, crime.\n\nAs Mark Pomerantz, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan DA's office, wrote in a recent book , the felony statute is \"ambiguous\" - though it refers to \"another crime,\" it does not say whether this crime may be a federal criminal act or only an act that violates New York's criminal law. Worse, Pomerantz writes, \" no appellate court in New York has ever upheld (or rejected) this interpretation of the law .\"\n\nThat means that, unless Bragg eventually links Trump to some other state crime, there is a great deal of uncertainty about whether a felony conviction against Trump can stand.\n\nThere's one more twist here. The statute of limitations for the felony version of the false records crime is five years , while the statute of limitations for the misdemeanor version is only two years. Trump's final payment to Cohen occurred in December 2017 , which was more than five years ago.\n\nThat said, New York law sometimes allows the clock to be stopped on these statutes of limitations when the defendant was out of the state , and Trump spent four years living in the White House before relocating to Florida.\n\nIn any case, there is still a good chunk of time before these issues will be sorted out: this trial will happen in March 2024 , the presiding judge said recently. The start date, for what it's worth, is three weeks after Super Tuesday .\n\nIn early January 2022, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis's office asked a Georgia court to convene a special grand jury \"for the purpose of investigating the facts and circumstances relating directly or indirectly to possible attempts to disrupt the lawful administration of the 2020 elections in the State of Georgia .\"\n\nThis investigation includes both Trump's \" find 11,780 votes \" phone call and the Trump campaign's attempt to create a slate of fake members of the Electoral College who would fraudulently tell Congress that the state's electoral votes were cast for Trump.\n\nThe special grand jury, whose investigation is now complete, heard testimony from several very high-profile Trump allies, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and US Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) .\n\nMany of the facts alleged in the Georgia indictment against Trump and his 18 alleged co-conspirators closely track the allegations in the federal case being heard by Judge Chutkan. The indictment accuses Trump of leading a criminal enterprise that lied to state officials and federal courts, pressured officials in many states to tamper with the results of the 2020 election, and created a slate of fake electors to cast fake Electoral College votes for Trump.\n\nIn total, the Georgia indictment includes 41 different criminal charges against Trump and his co-conspirators - ranging from perjury to forgery to \"solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer\" - although Trump is only personally implicated in 13 of these charges .\n\nNotably, the indictment also charges Trump with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act , a statute that is often used to charge members of the mafia and other criminal enterprises. RICO potentially allows members of a broader criminal enterprise to be convicted, even if they did not personally participate in every criminal act committed by that enterprise, so long as they are implicated in at least one crime committed by the broader criminal organization.\n\nWe do not yet know when the Georgia trial will take place, and it might be a while. Any case involving a sprawling alleged conspiracy, dozens of criminal allegations, and 19 alleged co-conspirators will be quite complicated. And the defendants' lawyers will need an adequate amount of time to prepare a defense.\n\nTrump is also expected to try to move this case from Georgia state court to federal court, under a federal statute that permits state prosecutions against many federal officials to be heard by a federal judge. That means that this case may ultimately wind up being heard by a judge, like Cannon, who was appointed by Trump himself.\n\nUpdate, August 15, 2 pm ET: This story, originally published April 4, has been updated several times, most recently to include information about the Georgia indictment.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWas Trump wrongly convicted? The debate, explained.\n\nby Eric Levitz\n\nDonald Trump became America's most prominent felon on Thursday, when a New York jury convicted him on 34 charges of falsifying business records.\n\nThat verdict has proven predictably controversial. New York's case against Trump has attracted bipartisan criticism ever since Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg indicted the former president last year. Of all the cases brought against Trump, New York's charges have always looked both the least solid and the least serious.\n\nThe criticisms of Bragg's case are worth taking seriously. And reasonable people can believe that Thursday's verdict was wrong.\n\nAnd yet, if New York's case against Trump wasn't a slam dunk, it wasn't implausible either.\n\nThe prosecution's argument rested on untested legal theories, not absurd ones. Contrary to the claims of prominent Republicans , Trump's conviction does not prove that Democrats will stop at nothing to persecute their political adversaries. Rather, it proves that if a man perpetrates a wide variety of frauds over the course of decades - and routinely advertises his contempt for the rule of law - prosecutors may aggressively scrutinize the legality of his business records and get a bit creative in holding him legally accountable.\n\nAnd the verdict also indicates that mounting an utterly incompetent defense can get such a man convicted of felonies, even when the prosecution's case contains significant vulnerabilities.\n\nIt's worth walking through the arguments for and against Bragg's case to separate the reasonable objections from the delusional ones.\n\nOn October 7, 2016, the world heard an audio recording of the Republican nominee bragging about how his star power allowed him to get away with grabbing women \"by the pussy.\" The next day, a representative for the adult film actress Stormy Daniels told the National Enquirer that she was prepared to speak about her own sordid and exploitative sexual encounter with Donald Trump.\n\nTrump enjoyed close ties with the Enquirer, and the tabloid responded to Daniels by trying to broker a hush money agreement between her and Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen. To generate the cash necessary for quieting Daniels - and thus, averting a news story that would keep the Access Hollywood tape and Trump's scummy sexual behavior in the headlines during the campaign's home stretch - Cohen tapped his home equity and then routed the payment through a Delaware shell company. Later, Trump reimbursed Cohen for these payments, but he registered them as mere legal expenses.\n\nIn New York, it is a misdemeanor to falsify business records with \"the intent to defraud.\" And it is a felony to do so for the purpose of concealing another crime.\n\nProsecutors argued that Trump falsified various business documents in order to conceal the nature of his payments to Cohen with the the intention of defrauding others, and for the sake of concealing another offense - namely, a violation of an obscure New York state prohibition on conspiring \"to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.\"\n\nSpecifically, the prosecution argued that Cohen's payment to Daniels was a de facto donation to Trump's campaign, since the intention behind the payment was to abet his election by suppressing politically hazardous information. That payment's size greatly exceeded the legal cap on individual donations to a candidate, and therefore constituted a violation of federal campaign finance law. And Cohen owned up to this crime when he pled guilty to campaign finance violations in 2018. Therefore, according to the district attorney's office, Trump had conspired with Cohen to promote his own election by unlawful means.\n\nCritics of the prosecution took issue with nearly every element of this case. But their most prominent arguments can be summarized as follows:\n\n1) Trump may have falsified business records, but he did not do so with an \"intent to defraud,\" in the legal sense of that term. As the National Review's Andrew McCarthy argues , the Supreme Court recently confirmed that \"intent to defraud\" has a very specific and narrow legal meaning: It describes the intention to deprive someone of money, property, or some other concrete good through deception.\n\nThere is no evidence that Trump falsified business records for the sake of tricking any specific individual into giving him cash. But Bragg's office argued that, under New York state law, \"intent to defraud\" can refer to deliberately misleading the government or voting public.\n\nMcCarthy argues that this is much too broad: If you can commit fraud without actually trying to \"steal something in which people have a concrete interest,\" then \"any untrue statement a candidate makes\" could be prosecutable fraud, since such statements deceive voters.\n\n2) The claim that Trump falsified business records to conceal a separate crime rests on a dubious interpretation of an obscure and arguably inapplicable law. Legal analysts (from across the political spectrum ) have long argued that the shakiest part of the prosecution's case was the claim that Trump's fraudulent paperwork was intended to cover up another crime.\n\nAfter all, there is no law against paying your ex-lover not to speak with a tabloid about your sordid liaison. The prosecution's case rested primarily on the assertion that the payment to Daniels violated federal campaign finance law.\n\nThere are two potential objections to this: First, as David French notes in the New York Times, the Department of Justice chose not to charge Trump with violating campaign finance law by arranging Daniels's payoff, apparently concluding that the case would be difficult to win. Yes, Cohen did plead guilty to a campaign finance violation related to the Daniels payment. But a guilty plea does not have the same weight as a jury verdict, from the standpoint of legal precedent. And in any case, Cohen's plea did not establish Trump's guilt in the alleged scheme.\n\nSecond, Mark Pomerantz, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan DA's office, has observed that it isn't clear that a violation of federal law can qualify as \"unlawful means\" under New York state law. Before this trial, the question had simply never been adjudicated.\n\nTo its credit, Bragg's office anticipated this problem, and argued that Trump not only promoted his own election through federal campaign finance violations, but also through other unlawful means, such as the falsification of separate business records and violations of tax law. But the validity of these supplementary charges is contested.\n\nMore fundamentally, some legal scholars argue that New York's law against promoting a candidate's election through unlawful means is preempted by federal law. \"Federal election law, generally speaking, preempts state election law when it comes to a governing of federal elections, except there are exceptions whereby certain state election laws can come into play,\" Jerry H. Goldfeder, a campaign finance lawyer, told CNN last year .\n\n3) There is little evidence that Trump knew he had violated campaign finance laws, let alone that he knowingly tried to conceal having done so. Donald Trump does not have a reputation for being highly fluent in the details of public policy or the legal niceties of the political system.\n\nAs National Review's McCarthy argues , \"there is not a shred of evidence that Trump was even thinking about FECA (the Federal Election Campaign Act) in 2016-17, much less willfully transgressing it - which, to establish, prosecutors need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump was aware of a legal duty to comply with FECA's contribution limits and reporting requirements, yet intentionally violated them.\"\n\n4) Even if Trump were guilty, the statute of limitations on his offense has already expired. The statute of limitations on misdemeanor business records falsification is two years; for the felony version, it's five years.\n\nTrump committed his alleged offense in 2017. But New York law holds that the clock on its statute of limitations stops when a defendant is \"continuously\" outside of the state. Therefore, it is plausible that the years Trump spent primarily in the White House and Mar-a-Lago do not count against the clock.\n\nStill, even under this interpretation, Syracuse University law professor Gregory Germain argues that two years have certainly passed since Trump allegedly falsified records related to his hush money payment. In Germain's view, it \"is not clear whether the felony can stand when the misdemeanor is time barred\" because the \"felony statute requires showing that the misdemeanor was committed, since the felony is really a penalty enhancement on the misdemeanor.\"\n\n5) The prosecution was blatantly politically motivated, and the judge was politically biased. Finally, the prosecution's skeptics point to all of its case's dubious elements - and then to the surrounding political context - and argue that Trump has been politically persecuted. As former federal prosecutor Elie Honig notes in New York magazine , Alvin Bragg ran for district attorney on a promise to indict Donald Trump. And the judge in Trump's trial, Juan Merchan, donated to \"a pro-Biden, anti-Trump political operation,\" in violation of a rule barring New York judges from contributing to political campaigns, according to Honig.\n\nAnd there is indeed some evidence that Trump's prosecution was highly selective. No state prosecutor has ever cited federal election laws as a predicate state crime. The Manhattan DA hardly ever brings cases in which the sole charge concerns the falsification of business records. And the statute prohibiting conspiracies to promote a person's election through unlawful means has almost never been used: According to an analysis from the Washington Post , since 2000, no judge issued a single legal opinion concerning the statute until Trump's trial began last year.\n\nNone of this necessarily means that the jury made a mistake. Indeed, some of Bragg's harshest critics expected a guilty verdict, largely because Trump's defense was wildly incompetent . As McCarthy wrote this week, \"Team Trump has presented one of the most ill-conceived, self-destructive defenses I have ever seen in decades of trying and analyzing criminal cases.\"\n\nRather than concentrating on refuting the weakest elements of the government's case, Trump's attorneys chose to contest obviously true claims that had no actual bearing on his guilt or innocence. For example, they sought to disprove the prosecution's claims that Trump had engaged in an affair with Daniels and subsequently reimbursed Cohen for buying her silence.\n\nYet neither of those actions are illegal, in and of themselves. And the evidence that Trump did both those things is overwhelming. The likely GOP nominee has stated publicly, multiple times , that he reimbursed Cohen. And the idea that Trump would have agreed to pay $130,000 to bury an affair he didn't have strains credulity.\n\nBy fighting these hopeless battles, Trump's team gave the jury the impression that they were legally relevant - which would only be true if the shakiest parts of the prosecution's case were valid.\n\nPut simply, the former president prioritized brand management and political messaging above legal strategy. In the face of Trump's bizarre and disorganized defense, an unbiased jury could easily have arrived at a guilty verdict - especially since the prosecution's case was not as weak as many of its detractors suggest.\n\nIt is impossible to deny that Bragg's office targeted Trump for investigation. Yet Trump gave New York plenty of reason for scrutinizing the legality of his business practices that have nothing to do with his politics. The mogul has been found civilly liable for fraud multiple times . There is copious public evidence that he committed tax fraud. And of course, he has demonstrated flagrant contempt for the rule of law in myriad contexts. It is not hard to argue that holding Trump accountable for any of his criminal offenses, even the most minor ones, is in the public interest.\n\nThe specific case brought against Trump in New York, meanwhile, is plausible enough.\n\nFirst, although \"intent to defraud\" is construed narrowly under federal law, this is not the case under the laws of New York state. To the contrary, the Empire State's jurisprudence has explicitly held that \"In an indictment for first degree falsification of business records,\" prosecutors are \"not required to establish commercial or property loss.\n\nAs a team of legal analysts at the think tank Just Security note , New York courts have found \"intent to defraud\" in a wide range of false business records cases that did not involve financial damages to any individual, including instances in which defendants \"made covert contributions to a political campaign, covered up an alleged rape, misled the relatives of a patient about the individual's treatment, operated a motor vehicle without a license, obtained credit cards through false documents but with no proof of intention to miss payments, frustrated the regulatory authorities of the New York City Transit Authority, and much more.\"\n\nThere is no denying that the prosecution's attempt to convict Trump on the felony version of business record falsification required a legal theory with little established precedent. But there is a distinction between a theory that is contradicted by existing jurisprudence and one that is simply unprecedented. It is not clear that New York can cite a federal election law violation as a predicate offense in a state crime. But it isn't clear that it can't either. Trump will appeal the jury's verdict, and higher courts will have the opportunity to settle the matter.\n\nSimilarly, it is possible that Trump never considered whether his payment to Daniels violated campaign finance law. But it is hardly inconceivable that this would occur to Cohen, a lawyer who had a personal interest in interrogating the legality of the payment that Trump aimed to arrange. And if it did occur to Cohen, he likely would have relayed this concern to his boss. Certainly, there is little question that both men understood that the payoff was politically motivated. The timing of the payment - coming right on the heels of the Access Hollywood tape and less than a month before Election Day - makes it plain that electoral calculation figured into the deal.\n\nAs for the statute of limitations, Gregory Germain is a legal scholar and I am not. But I have trouble understanding why there would be separate time limits on the misdemeanor and felony versions of business record falsification if the latter becomes unprosecutable once the statute of limitations on the former has expired.\n\nThere is no question that this criminal case was both the weakest and least serious that's been brought against Trump since he exited the White House. One can reasonably argue, even after this week's verdict, that New York's charges against Trump should not have been brought. The same cannot be said, in my estimation, of the charges against Trump for mishandling classified documents , or manipulating state governments to subvert the 2020 election, or his role in the events of January 6 , 2021. Unfortunately, he will not be brought to justice in any of those cases in advance of Election Day.\n\nIf the case against Trump in New York was not open and shut, it was not a world-historic travesty of justice either. And it certainly is not \"evidence that Democrats will stop at nothing to silence dissent and crush their political opponents,\" as House Speaker Mike Johnson has claimed .\n\nState and federal prosecutors have brought myriad charges against Trump not because he is a Republican, but because he is a criminal.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWe're about to learn how imperiled two of Trump's prosecutions are.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nProsecutors in all four of the cases against Donald Trump are racing against time to try to get to trial before Election Day.\n\nBut to do so, they each have to clear a series of legal and procedural hurdles - and soon, we'll get a better idea of which, if any, will make it.\n\nToday, two of those prosecutions will go in the spotlight via high-stakes hearings where we'll get a sense of how seriously judges are taking Trump's efforts to get indictments thrown out.\n\nIn Fulton County, District Attorney Fani Willis's prosecution of Trump for trying to steal Georgia's 2020 election has been sidetracked by allegations about Willis's personal life.\n\nEmbarrassingly, a judge will hear testimony on exactly when Willis's relationship with Nathan Wade, a prosecutor she'd brought on to the case, began. One of Trump's co-defendants has asserted that Willis improperly financially benefited from the prosecution because she's been paying Wade's attorney fees, and he's paid for vacations they took together. Trump wants Willis disqualified from the case.\n\nMeanwhile, in Manhattan, where District Attorney Alvin Bragg has charged Trump with falsifying business records related to hush money paid to Stormy Daniels, a judge will assess whether to move forward with a planned March 25 trial - or throw the charges out entirely.\n\nThe New York case is the least substantively important of the four Trump cases, but it's lately seemed likely to go to trial first because of procedural delays in the federal cases .\n\nBut there have been questions about whether Bragg's rationale for charging Trump with felonies will survive court scrutiny - and on Thursday, we'll get to hear what that case's judge thinks about those arguments.\n\nThursday, in short, could be a make-or-break day for the two state-level prosecutions against the former president.\n\nWhen Willis had Trump and 18 co-defendants indicted last August, her case was widely hailed as the most sweeping effort to hold him and his allies to account for the attempted 2020 election theft. Four of those defendants have already pleaded guilty.\n\nBut another defendant, Michael Roman - a former Trump campaign opposition research specialist - struck back in a filing from his attorney arguing that Willis should be removed from the case.\n\nRoman's attorney asserted that Willis and Wade had a \"clandestine personal relationship,\" and argued that was inappropriate for a few reasons: asserting Wade was unqualified for the job, that Willis overpaid him, and that she benefited financially from his hiring when he paid for vacations they took together.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nIn response, Willis's office claimed there was no impropriety. Wade said in an affidavit that he'd indeed \"developed a personal relationship\" with Willis - but only after he joined the investigation in 2022. (Roman's attorney fired back by saying she had a witness who would testify otherwise.)\n\nOn Monday, Judge Scott McAfee gave some insight into how he'd approach the topic. \"I think it's possible that the facts alleged by the defendant could result in disqualification,\" he said. But, he went on, Wade's qualifications for the job weren't relevant. The key question, in his view, was whether \"a personal relationship resulted in a financial benefit to the district attorney.\"\n\nTo assess that, he said, he wanted to determine when the relationship between Willis and Wade formed and whether it is still ongoing. If McAfee does decide to remove Willis's office from the case, the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia would get to choose her replacement - and the case's future would hinge on whom they choose.\n\nSo the high-minded case about the sanctity of elections may now hinge on tawdry testimony about the district attorney's love life and travel - testimony that will take place Thursday and likely Friday.\n\nManhattan DA Bragg was the first prosecutor to have Trump indicted back in March of last year, but his case was quickly superseded in the public discourse by the election-stealing and classified documents cases, which were more substantively important. Now, though, it may be the case with the best odds of a speedy trial.\n\nTo recap: In October 2016, Trump attorney Michael Cohen paid hush money to Stormy Daniels so she wouldn't come forward alleging a sexual encounter with Trump. Trump later reimbursed Cohen through the Trump Organization, with payments he categorized as legal expenses.\n\nThis, Bragg asserts, violated state law against falsifying business records (because they were hush money payments, not legal fees). Some legal commentators questioned Bragg's rationale for charging these as felony counts rather than misdemeanors. To do so, Bragg had to argue that Trump falsified these records with the intent of committing or concealing another crime.\n\nFor some time, though, it wasn't totally clear even to prosecutors on the case which crime would fit the bill, with some fearing judges could throw out the charges before trial.\n\nSo on Thursday, Judge Juan Merchan is set to finally weigh in on these questions. Most legal commentators expect him to let the charges stand, but we won't know for sure until we hear it from him (and Trump may appeal afterward).\n\nMerchan is also expected to let us know whether he'll stick to the March 25 trial date in the case. If he lets both the charges and the date stand, then unless Trump wins a quick appeal, the former president will face his first criminal trial next month.\n\nWhich means the question of whether Trump will run for office as a convicted felon may hinge on the simultaneously tawdry yet technical matter of whether reimbursements for hush money covering up a sex scandal abided by New York bookkeeping law.\n\nThis story appeared originally in Today, Explained , Vox's flagship daily newsletter.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt's the latest of example of the GOP rallying around the former president.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nFollowing the announcement that former President Donald Trump has officially been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury, Republican lawmakers are finding themselves in an all-too-familiar position: rallying to defend him .\n\nOn Thursday, the grand jury announced that it would indict Trump for charges related to hush money payments made to porn performer Stormy Daniels, making him the first former president to be the subject of a criminal case. Since the news broke of the charges against Trump, congressional Republicans have broadly come to his defense , framing the indictment as an instance of political persecution.\n\nPreviously, House Republicans announced that they'd like to bring in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg - the prosecutor who pursued charges against Trump - for testimony in order to raise questions about the case. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy reiterated those plans Thursday evening, arguing on Twitter that Bragg \"weaponized our sacred system of justice against President Donald Trump\" and promising \"the House of Representatives will hold Alvin Bragg and his unprecedented abuse of power to account.\"\n\nHere's what we know.\n\nArguing that Trump is innocent and being unfairly targeted by Democrats is one of two strategies Republicans routinely employ when Trump is in trouble, the other being to avoid the subject when the former president has done something incredibly difficult to defend. This playbook has been apparent following a federal raid at his residence in Mar-a-Lago , during his impeachment trials , and even during his first presidential campaign . It's also one Trump has used prominently himself , dubbing his second impeachment a \"witch hunt,\" for instance.\n\nFor some Republicans, Trump's indictment raises the question of just how much baggage the party should put up with. As Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis - a likely presidential competitor - noted in remarks responding to the expected indictment earlier this month, there are other candidates who don't have quite so many issues weighing them down. \"I don't know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair,\" DeSantis quipped in a news conference. \"I just, I can't speak to that.\"\n\nRepublicans' willingness to continue shielding Trump amid the indictment drama, however, suggests that a large segment of the party is still very much supportive of the former president.\n\nA review of Republicans' long history of rushing to Trump's defense - or refusing to condemn his actions - suggests this support is unlikely to change anytime soon.\n\nOther instances include GOP responses to everything from his policy decisions, like the implementation of a travel ban, to his personal misconduct, including more than 20 allegations of sexual misconduct:\n\nJanuary 6: Though some Republicans initially criticized Trump for his role in inciting the riot at the Capitol in 2021, in the end, most returned to the president's side, with some even minimizing the insurrection . Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), for instance , said that it \"didn't seem like an armed insurrection to me\" in February 2021. Similarly, most Republicans balked at supporting the January 6 committee in the House, which was tasked with investigating the insurrection and Trump's responsibility in it.\n\nCovid-19: Since the start of the pandemic, Trump has downplayed the severity of the virus and framed public policy responses around masking and testing as oppressive. According to a study from the medical journal The Lancet , 40 percent of the Covid-19 deaths in the US in the first year were avoidable; the researchers blamed Trump's approach for some of those deaths, as well as the US's poor public health infrastructure. Congressional Republicans were slow to break from Trump on the issue, though some eventually did. \"I think he's done a good job, I do,\" Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) told Politico in May 2020 .\n\nUkraine quid pro quo: The first impeachment of Trump centered on his conditioning of aid to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden. Sen. Mitt Romney was the only Republican to vote for his conviction, while Rep. Justin Amash, a Republican turned independent, was the only one to cross party lines in the House. At the time, most in the party argued that Trump's actions were not an impeachable offense and that Democrats were overreaching.\n\nControversial immigration policies, including a travel ban: Multiple Trump immigration policies also split Republicans, with many openly condemning his actions. One proposal was the travel ban , which barred travel by citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nIn this case, a number of top Republicans spoke out against the policies, while a handful of conservative lawmakers aligned themselves with Trump. \" It's very prudent to say, 'Let's be careful about who comes into our country to make sure that they're not terrorists,'\" Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) said of the travel ban in 2017.\n\nRacist comments: There have been numerous instances of Trump making racist remarks, which have prompted muted Republican response. As president, Trump targeted the four women lawmakers of color in \"the Squad\" and said they should \"go back\" to where they're from, prompting attendees at a rally to chat \"send her back\" regarding Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN). In 2020, Trump also made racist comments about Black Lives Matter protesters, calling them \"thugs\" and tweeting, \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\"\n\nThough many Republicans stopped short of supporting Trump's remarks, few expressly condemned them, either. In the case of Trump's tweets about the Squad, for example, the House voted to condemn Trump's statement with only four Republicans supporting the rebuke.\n\nAlleged sexual misconduct: At least 26 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct including forcible kissing, groping, and rape. Trump has denied these allegations, and Republicans have broadly accepted his position. \"All I would say: We live in an environment where people can come forward. That's good. But allegations like this have to be cautiously reviewed,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham told Politico in 2019 in response to rape allegations made by journalist E. Jean Carroll.\n\nUpdate, March 31, 9 am: This story has been updated to reflect that Trump has been indicted and to include updated statements.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt could still happen - but the four prosecutions of Trump have been beset by delays and challenges.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nDemocrats perturbed about Donald Trump 's lead in 2024 polling have long had a comforting hope to fall back on: that Trump, who is facing four criminal prosecutions, will likely become a convicted felon before Election Day - or even be sent to prison.\n\nThat's still possible - but it's not as sure a bet as it once seemed.\n\nDelays have piled up in federal court proceedings in the District of Columbia case about Trump's attempt to steal the 2020 election and the Florida classified documents case against Trump, making it unclear whether either case will go to trial before November. (For the DC case, the hold-up is higher-court appeals ; for Florida, it's a slow-walking judge .)\n\nMeanwhile, the Georgia election case has recently been consumed by scandalous allegations about Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, which throw the future of that prosecution into question. A judge will soon consider whether Willis and her office should be disqualified. He could decide not to do that, but even then, a trial date has not yet been set in the complex case.\n\nThat leaves the New York hush money case as the only trial that still seems on track. It's currently scheduled to begin on March 25 - but first, on February 15, a judge will consider whether the felony charges against Trump there are legal .\n\nThe upshot is that Trump's only trial this year could end up being the New York one - the least substantively significant of the four. The charges are about whether Trump improperly logged Trump Organization payments to his then-attorney Michael Cohen as legal expenses, when they were reimbursements for hush money Cohen paid Stormy Daniels. It's shady behavior, but it's not exactly at the level of stealing an election or jeopardizing national security secrets.\n\nYet there's little that can be done to expedite things at this point. Prosecutors filed their cases last year, but now they're in judges' hands - and judges are not beholden to the election calendar.\n\nIt's not certain that even multiple Trump convictions would be the game-changer in the polls Democrats hoped for. But getting a verdict before November 5 is the only way we'd ever find out. (As to whether Trump might be sentenced to prison, we can't know that until an actual trial takes place.)\n\nSo Election Day could come and go with most of Trump's legal jeopardy unresolved - and, if he wins, some of those delays could become permanent, since he'd almost surely shut down the federal investigations targeting him.\n\nUntil recently, the sweeping racketeering case against Trump and 18 co-defendants filed by Willis's office last August seemed to be notching win after win. The case was lauded by many in the press as the most comprehensive attempt to hold Trump accountable for trying to steal the 2020 election. And though a trial date had not yet been set, four of those co-defendants, including former Trump attorneys Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis , had already pleaded guilty.\n\nBut earlier this month, an attorney for another co-defendant, former Trump campaign aide Mike Roman, made some explosive allegations in a court filing .\n\nThese allegations center on the claim that Willis has been having a \"clandestine personal relationship\" with a special prosecutor she had brought on to the case, Nathan Wade. That alone would not seem to be disqualifying. But Roman's attorney alleges several improprieties about Wade's role, including that he was unqualified for the job (his prosecutorial experience is very thin ), that Willis overpaid him, and that he then paid for vacations they took together.\n\nSome legal experts have said these allegations aren't a big enough deal to warrant her removal. Others are more concerned. \"If her choices to extend or prolong the investigation benefit a romantic partner, who is paying for her meals and vacations, that is an actual conflict,\" Georgia defense attorney Andrew Fleischman writes in the Daily Beast . \"Willis needs to level with the public, and she needs to do it fast,\" former federal prosecutor Ankush Khardori writes in Politico Magazine .\n\nWillis and Wade gave their first response to these claims in a February 2 court filing . In an affidavit, Wade said he'd \"developed a personal relationship\" with Willis after joining the investigation in 2022. But he said he never shared a joint financial account or household expenses with her, adding that, though he did pay for some travel they took together, she paid for other travel.\n\nWillis also disputed that there was anything unusual about Wade's appointment or pay, and asserted there is no conflict. \"One may question whether the intent is to disqualify the prosecutor who has taken on all of the abuse to pursue justice in this case at great personal cost, only to be substituted with someone less committed to do so,\" she wrote.\n\nNext, Judge Scott McAfee will hold a hearing about this topic on February 15. If McAfee decides there is impropriety here, he can disqualify Willis's office from prosecuting the case. If that happens, the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia would get to choose a replacement prosecutor - and the path forward for the case would depend on whom they choose.\n\nBut, needless to say, the prosecutor getting tossed would not be a good sign for getting this case tried before election day.\n\nThe federal prosecution against Trump for trying to steal the 2020 election was brought by special counsel Jack Smith in Washington, DC. And Judge Tanya Chutkan seemed to be moving ahead quickly, initially setting a trial date of March 4.\n\nIn pretrial motions, however, Trump's attorneys put forward a defense: that he couldn't be prosecuted for what he did between November 2020 and January 6, 2021, because he was president - and a sitting president, they claim, should be absolutely immune from prosecution for actions that related to his official conduct while he was in office.\n\nJudge Chutkan rejected that argument in an early December ruling , but Trump's attorneys appealed to the DC Circuit. And, importantly, while the appeal is pending, Chutkan decided (in accordance with the law) to pause pretrial preparations. That stay was issued on December 13 - more than a month and a half ago.\n\nThe first stop in the appeal process is before a three-judge panel of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Arguments before that panel took place on January 9 , but they have not yet issued their ruling. If they side against Trump, as expected, he could ask the full DC Circuit Court to hear the case - and then, inevitably, the Supreme Court .\n\nIn December, Smith tried to move this process along by asking the Supreme Court to consider the immunity question right away - but the justices declined to do so .\n\nThe longer each step in the process takes, the more the date for the trial will slip. And on Friday, the delay had lasted long enough that Judge Chutkan officially canceled the March 4 trial date - saying she'd set a new date once the immunity issue has been decided. How long that will take is anyone's guess.\n\nDelays have also plagued Smith's prosecution of Trump for mishandling classified documents in Florida. Here, the holdup is not higher-court appeals, but the district court judge assigned to handle the case: Aileen Cannon.\n\nCannon, a Trump appointee, has courted controversy on this case since before the former president was even indicted. After the FBI's 2022 searches at Mar-a-Lago, Trump sued to try to block the government from reviewing some seized documents. Cannon heard the suit, and her conduct shocked legal observers , when she contorted the law in various rulings in Trump's favor. A three-judge appeals court panel eventually reined her in , in what the National Law Journal called \"a rebuke.\" (Two of those judges were themselves Trump appointees; the third is a hardline conservative appointed by George W. Bush.)\n\nSo it was of course great news for Trump that, when the special counsel indicted him last June, Cannon got the case. Initially, she didn't seem to be blatantly going out of her way to help Trump - she set a May 20, 2024, trial date. It was, however, widely understood that this date might slip due to the need to settle complex issues about how the classified information at issue was to be handled and shared with Trump's legal team.\n\nThe problem is that since then, Cannon has appeared to be in no hurry whatsoever to resolve these issues. By November, Politico's Josh Gerstein wrote that Cannon was \"slowing down the case,\" saying she \"has postponed key pretrial deadlines, and she has added further slack into the schedule simply by taking her time to resolve some fairly straightforward matters.\" For instance, Cannon moved one hearing about how the classified documents at issue would be redacted from October to February - a four-month delay.\n\nThings haven't improved lately. Two weeks ago, Dennis Aftergut and Laurence Tribe argued in Slate that Cannon was continuing to demonstrate a \"pattern\" of \"laying the groundwork for delaying Trump's trial - until it's too late for a jury to be empaneled and the case tried to verdict before the election.\" No one seems to believe at this point that this trial will actually happen in May, and there are real doubts about whether it will happen this year at all.\n\nWhen Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg indicted Trump for falsifying business records last March, he faced a good deal of skepticism from national legal commentators about both the strength of the case and whether his decision to charge Trump was politicized. It's also the least substantively important of the four prosecutions.\n\nSo naturally, this is the only trial that seems like it will happen anytime soon.\n\nLast year, Judge Juan Merchan set the trial date for March 25, 2024. But he openly acknowledged he might move that date , to let Trump's federal prosecutions get priority to go first. With the delays in those other prosecutions, though, New York seems like the best bet to go first after all.\n\nThere is just one hurdle first: On February 15, Merchan will hold a hearing at which he'll consider Trump's pretrial motions . And in those motions, Trump has raised many of the same doubts that outside legal commentators - and a former top prosecutor in the district attorney's office - had about the charges.\n\nSpecifically, there's been much debate over whether Bragg was on firm ground to charge the 34 falsifying business record counts against Trump as felonies, rather than misdemeanors. (Misdemeanor charges would not come with the possibility of prison time and would not make Trump a convicted felon.)\n\nTo charge felonies, Bragg must assert that Trump falsified business records - specifically, that he categorized reimbursements to Michael Cohen for Stormy Daniels's hush money as legal expenses - with the intent to commit or conceal \"another crime.\"\n\nThe problem is: What crime?\n\nViolating federal campaign finance law seemed like the clearest fit, but it involved federal and not state law, and existing case law was unclear about whether a state prosecutor could use federal law to justify this felony enhancement. Another potential federal crime, dodging taxes, had the same issue. A third possibility was a state law about unlawfully conspiring to promote an election candidate - but does state law apply to a federal presidential election?\n\nThis question bedeviled Mark Pomerantz, who was a lead prosecutor of the district attorney's case before resigning shortly after Bragg took office. Pomerantz wrote about his worries in a book written before the indictment last year, opining that no specific \"other crime\" seemed to be a slam-dunk guaranteed to survive judicial scrutiny. He said he hoped Bragg would charge the case anyway, but, he said, there would be a risk \"that the charge will be reduced to a misdemeanor before a jury even hears it.\"\n\nTrump's pretrial motions cite all these objections (and repeatedly cite Pomerantz's book). \"Even the most ardent and publicly supportive former prosecutor, Mark Pomerantz, to have worked on the case doubted that DANY's legal theory is viable,\" his attorneys wrote . Bragg's team, for their part, claims that they don't need to be specific - that they only need to establish \"general intent\" to commit or conceal a crime. However, they also argue that all of the crimes mentioned above apply.\n\nSo on February 15, these matters will finally be addressed at a hearing from Judge Merchan. If Merchan lets the felony charges stand, Trump could then appeal. But one problem would be that he'd be appealing in New York state court, where few judges are likely to be particularly sympathetic to him. Bragg's charges may well survive. And, flawed as it is, the New York case seems to be the best bet remaining for a Trump conviction before the election.\n\nUpdate, February 2, 4:15 pm ET: This article was originally published on February 1.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt's hard to see how they'd do it legally, but this Court has a history of reading the law creatively.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nOn Sunday, Trump wrote on Truth Social, his personal social media site, that the Supreme Court \"MUST\" intervene after a New York jury found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records. Though Trump's post wasn't written with the precision of a legal brief, he appeared to float two separate theories that could justify tossing out his conviction: that the judge was impermissibly biased and that the prosecutor was out to get Trump.\n\nTrump's rant was echoed by many Republicans, including US House Speaker Mike Johnson, who claimed that he knows many of the justices personally and that \"they are deeply concerned about\" Trump's conviction .\n\nSpeaker Johnson is undoubtedly correct that many of the justices are upset that the leader of their political party was convicted of multiple felony counts, a fact that could lead some voters to favor President Joe Biden over Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nLast March, five of the Court's six Republicans voted to effectively neutralize a provision of the Constitution that prohibits former officials who \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\" against the United States from seeking high office again. (All nine justices voted to reverse a state court decision tossing Trump off the ballot, but only five voted to effectively immunize Trump from accountability under this provision of the Constitution.)\n\nSimilarly, the Supreme Court has for months delayed Trump's federal criminal trial for attempting to overturn Biden's victory in the 2020 election, all but ensuring that it won't take place until after the November election.\n\nGet the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.\n\nBut will the justices step in to nullify the one Trump criminal trial that was tried to conviction before the election? And can the Court's Republican majority intervene fast enough to throw out the conviction before voters cast their ballots this fall?\n\nLet's take these questions in reverse order.\n\nAssume, for just a moment, that a majority of the justices are partisan hacks who are determined to remove the stigma of a felony conviction from the Republican presidential candidate before the election. Could they actually invalidate his conviction before the November election?\n\nThe answer to this question should be \"no.\" Under the rules that apply to criminal defendants who are not named Donald Trump, two state-level appeals courts should review Trump's conviction before the justices could intervene. Both of those courts would ordinarily take months or longer to review a criminal appeal.\n\nTo toss out Trump's conviction before the election, the Court would have to take such extraordinary procedural liberties that this outcome is probably unlikely. But it's also not possible to rule it out entirely. Not that long ago, it seemed unthinkable that the Court would give serious thought to Trump's argument that he is immune from prosecution for his attempt to overthrow the 2020 election. At oral argument in that case, however, most of the justices appeared eager to rule that former presidents have, at least, some immunity from criminal prosecution.\n\nThe Roberts Court also has a history of embracing legal arguments that were widely viewed as risible by the legal community after those arguments were adopted by the Republican Party . So, with a wide range of elected Republicans now calling for Trump's conviction to be tossed out, there is a real risk that the GOP-appointed justices will leap on this bandwagon.\n\nThis Supreme Court also has a history of manipulating its calendar to achieve substantive results. During the Trump administration, for example, when a lower court blocked one of Trump's immigration policies, the Court would often race to reinstate that policy days or weeks after the administration's lawyers asked the justices to do so. After Biden became president, however, the Court started sitting on similar cases for nearly a year, even in cases where the Court ultimately concluded that the lower court was wrong to block one of Biden's policies.\n\nSimilarly, after the Colorado Supreme Court held that Trump must be removed from the 2024 ballot because of his role in the January 6 insurrection, the Supreme Court reversed that decision on an extraordinarily expedited time frame, hearing oral arguments and deciding the case a little more than two months after the Colorado court's decision.\n\nBy contrast, the Court has now delayed Trump's federal election theft trial for nearly six months . And, based on the questions many justices asked during an April oral argument, the Court appears likely to hand down a decision that will force more delay and ensure that Trump is not tried before the November election.\n\nEven so, to bypass the two state-level appeals courts that are supposed to consider Trump's conviction before the Supreme Court weighs in, the justices would have to engage in some truly extraordinary procedural gymnastics. Even Speaker Johnson didn't expect the Supreme Court to move quickly when he predicted that the justices would eventually step in to help Trump: Johnson told Fox News that \" it's going to take a while .\"\n\nTrump's conviction will first appeal to New York's intermediate appeals court (which, somewhat confusingly, is called the \"appellate division\" of the state's \"Supreme Court\"). After the appellate division weighs in, the losing party can then appeal that decision to the highest court in New York, which is known as the \"Court of Appeals.\"\n\nExcept in very rare cases, any appeal of any trial court decision will take months. Trump's lawyers will need time to review the record in the trial and decide which issues they want to appeal, and they will need more time to brief the case. Then, the prosecutors will also need sufficient time to review Trump's briefs and prepare their own responsive brief, which Trump's lawyers will then be given some time to respond to. Once the briefs are ready, they will be distributed to a panel of judges, who ordinarily spend months reviewing the case, conducting oral arguments, and writing an opinion. This process can take even longer if a judge dissents.\n\nThis is just a brief summary of the process that will take place in the appellate division. If Trump plans to bring this case to the US Supreme Court, he will have to repeat this lengthy process in both the New York Court of Appeals and in the Supreme Court itself, and both of those courts have their own time-consuming process to decide which cases they will hear in the first place.\n\nThe Supreme Court does have a process, known as \"certiorari before judgment,\" which can be used to bypass an appellate court and bring a case directly to the justices, but cert before judgment is supposed to be granted only in the most exceptional cases, and it's only supposed to be available to parties challenging a federal (not a state) court decision .\n\nThe Court's rules provide that it \"will be granted only upon a showing that the case is of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal appellate practice and to require immediate determination in this Court.\" (Notably, when the shoe was on the other foot, the Supreme Court denied special counsel Jack Smith's request for cert before judgment in the Trump immunity case.)\n\nIt's hard to see what earth-shattering legal issue could be raised by a state-level prosecution over falsified business records that could justify such a deviation from normal procedures - unless, of course, the justices believe that there is a moral imperative to rescue the Republican candidate from an embarrassing news story.\n\nMeanwhile, some of Trump's allies have suggested that Trump could invoke even more obscure procedures, such as asking the Court to use its \" original jurisdiction \" to free him without going through the ordinary appeals process at all. But there are any number of problems with this approach - among other things, as law professor Lee Kovarsky points out on Twitter, the Supreme Court hasn't granted this kind of relief to someone convicted of a crime since 1925 .\n\nIn any event, even if the justices are inclined to move fast enough to toss out Trump's conviction before the election, Trump's lawyers would need to formally ask them to do so. So the thing to watch right now is whether Trump's legal team takes the audacious step of filing such a request in the Supreme Court.\n\nAs a general rule, each state's highest court has the final word on questions of state law, and the Supreme Court is only supposed to get involved in a case if there is some allegation that the lower courts either violated the Constitution or a federal law. This matters because, while there are some plausible legal arguments Trump could raise on appeal, these arguments largely turn on the proper way to understand New York's laws.\n\nTrump's strongest argument , for example, turns on the question of whether he was properly convicted of violating the felony version of New York's business records law, as opposed to a weaker misdemeanor version. But, while there is genuine uncertainty about how to read this law, the question of how to read a New York criminal statute is a question of state law and thus should be resolved exclusively by New York's state courts.\n\nIn his Truth Social post , Trump does hint, in his own way, at two legal arguments that could be raised under federal law. He claims that the prosecutor was improperly biased (\"Radical Left Soros backed D.A., who ran on a platform of 'I will get Trump'\") and that the judge is also too biased to hear his case (\"appointed by Democrats, who is HIGHLY CONFLICTED\").\n\nYet, while it is theoretically possible to challenge a conviction on the grounds that the judge or the prosecutor was unconstitutional biased, as a practical matter these sorts of cases are almost impossible to win.\n\nBefore we get into that, it's important to note that Trump's allegations against prosecutor Alvin Bragg and Judge Juan Merchan are, to put it mildly, exaggerated. Bragg did not run on an \"I will get Trump\" platform. He did, while he was campaigning for his current job, highlight his previous experience bringing civil lawsuits against Donald Trump , but that's because Bragg's predecessor had already opened a criminal investigation into Trump. So it appears that Bragg was trying to convince voters that he had the experience necessary to take over supervision of this ongoing investigation.\n\nAs a candidate, Bragg also emphasized that he will \"follow the facts\" in that investigation and that \"every case still has to be judged by the facts and I don't know all the facts.\"\n\nSimilarly, it's unclear what could be the basis of a recusal motion against Justice Merchan. The fact that Merchan was \"appointed by Democrats\" is not a valid reason to remove him from the case , any more than Judge Aileen Cannon, the Trump appointee overseeing a different Trump prosecution, can be removed from that case solely because she was appointed by Trump.\n\nSimilarly, some of Merchan's critics have questioned a $35 donation the judge made to a pro-Biden organization. This donation is not ideal, but it also is not a basis for recusal. If judges could be forced off of cases solely because of such a small-dollar political donation, many judges would be forced off of countless cases.\n\nThat's because most judges are either political appointees or elected officials, and people with political ambitions donate to political candidates and organizations all the time. Cannon, for example, gave $100 to Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis . Judge Tanya Chutkan, the judge overseeing the election theft case that the Supreme Court has put on hold, made multiple donations to President Barack Obama , in addition to a 2008 donation to Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.\n\nSo let's walk through what the law actually says about when a prosecutor or judge can be removed from a case because of unconstitutional bias.\n\nFor prosecutors, the leading case is United States v. Armstrong (1996). Armstrong did hold that the Constitution places some limits on \"selective prosecution,\" such as if a criminal defendant were targeted because of their race or religion. Because the First Amendment typically prohibits \" viewpoint discrimination ,\" it follows that a politician could not be targeted because of their political beliefs.\n\nAs a practical matter, however, Armstrong laid out a legal standard that is almost impossible for anyone challenging an allegedly selective prosecution to overcome. \"Our cases delineating the necessary elements to prove a claim of selective prosecution have taken great pains to explain that the standard is a demanding one.\" To prevail, Trump would have to show that \"similarly situated individuals\" who do not share his political views \"were not prosecuted.\"\n\nSelective prosecution claims are so hard to win that several scholars have argued that no court has ruled in favor of a party claiming they were impermissibly prosecuted because of their race since Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886). Admittedly, the most recent paper I was able to find examining these cases was published in 2008 , so it's possible that such a party has prevailed since then. Still, the fact that more than a century passed without such a case succeeding suggests that the bar in these cases is virtually impossible to clear.\n\nThere are good reasons, moreover, why it is so hard to prevail in a selective prosecution case. For starters, prosecutors are supposed to be biased in favor of convicting criminal defendants. It is literally their job to do so. Defendants, moreover, enjoy a wide range of protections, such as the requirement that the prosecution must prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury. So even if a prosecutor does bring a case for unjust reasons, they don't have the power to convict that defendant on their own.\n\nThe constitutional rules governing judicial recusals are a bit more nuanced, but it is still very difficult to remove a judge from a case because of allegations of bias. Just look at Cannon, the Trump appointee who has behaved like she is a member of Trump's defense team in his stolen documents case but who has not yet been forced off the case.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Constitution only requires a judge to be removed from a case when they have a financial stake in the case's outcome or when the judge has an unusual personal stake in the case. In Mayberry v. Pennsylvania (1971), for example, the Court held that a judge who was \"cruelly slandered\" by a criminal defendant should not preside over that defendant's trial for contempt of court because the target of these insults was unlikely to \"maintain that calm detachment necessary for fair adjudication.\"\n\nIn Caperton v. Massey (2009), the Court did hold that, in extreme cases, campaign donations can justify recusal. But, as the Court emphasized in Caperton , that case involved an \"extraordinary situation\" that went well beyond any ordinary case involving a judge who gave or accepted political donations: A wealthy businessman, who had a case pending before the West Virginia Supreme Court, spent $3 million to elect a justice who then ruled in favor of the businessman's company.\n\nThat's a far cry from Merchan's (or Cannon's, or Chutkan's) much smaller donations to political causes.\n\nCaperton , moreover, also emphasized \"States may choose to 'adopt recusal standards more rigorous than due process requires.'\" The Constitution has very little to say about judicial recusals because codes of judicial conduct are the \"principal safeguard\" against unethical judges. But that also means that the US Supreme Court should play virtually no role in policing claims that a state judge is impermissibly biased.\n\nSo it's hard to imagine a legitimate reason why the Supreme Court might get involved in Trump's New York case.\n\nGiven the justices' previous behavior in other cases involving Donald Trump, however, we cannot rule out the possibility that they may get involved anyway.\n\nUpdate, June 5, 10:55 am: This piece was originally published on June 4 and has been updated to clarify the process someone convicted in state court can use to bypass the ordinary appeals process and bring a case directly to the Supreme Court.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nTrump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate his ban on trans military service, after a lower court blocked it.\n\nMany of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools.\n\nThe two Republican justices appeared open to an attack on Obamacare, but ultimately seemed likely to reject it.\n\n﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nThe Oklahoma charter school case is one of two April cases seeking to remake schools in the religious right's image.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHow billionaire George Soros was dragged into the Trump indictment debate - and why many are saying it's antisemitic to have done so.\n\nby Zack Beauchamp\n\nDonald Trump's outraged response to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's indictment of him contained the usual mix of bombast and self-pity, with a predictable dollop of conspiracy-mongering. One line of attack stood out in particular: He accused Bragg of being \"hand-picked and funded by George Soros.\"\n\nTrump wasn't alone. The alleged Bragg-Soros connection has been everywhere in the Republican response to the indictment, including in comments from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis , Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance , and a host of other prominent Republicans and Fox News coverage . It often gets shorthanded into a two-word phrase: \"Soros-backed.\"\n\nSoros, a nonagenarian Holocaust survivor and billionaire financier, is a longstanding hate figure among conservatives. Over the past two decades, elements of the right in both the United States and his native Hungary have engaged in a concerted campaign to turn Soros into a boogeyman - the shadowy power behind transatlantic liberalism.\n\nThough Bragg has never been directly funded by Soros, the accusation of a link isn't entirely out of whole cloth - Bragg's 2021 campaign for district attorney does seem to have indirectly received some of his financial support . But the intensity of the accusation certainly doesn't seem proportionate to the tenuousness of the connection.\n\nTo liberals, the Soros accusation smacks of nothing less than antisemitism. \"Just replace 'Soros-backed' with 'Jewy Jew Jewish Jewy Jew,'\" the popular comedian John Fugelsang tweeted in response to DeSantis's attack on Bragg. Naturally, conservatives have denied the charge and argued that liberals are just trying to suppress reasonable criticism of a prominent Democratic donor.\n\nThere is, of course, nothing wrong with criticizing Soros's philanthropic work, especially his partisan donations to the Democratic Party. But it's difficult to separate the criticisms from the context - and the last two decades of attacks on Soros have turned him into a stand-in for a certain kind of Jewish \"rootless cosmopolitan\" that allows politicians to appeal to antisemitism without having to do so explicitly.\n\nIn the Trump populist era, attacks on so-called \"globalists\" - a term long used on the extreme right as a euphemism for \"Jews\" - have become increasingly common on the mainstream right. The increasing mainstream flirtation with antisemitic stereotypes and rhetoric has made the subtext of the attacks on Soros harder and harder to deny.\n\nTo understand how Soros has become a central figure in the debate over Trump's prosecution, you need to understand a little about Soros himself - and why the right came to hate him.\n\nSoros, who was born in Hungary in 1930, lived under both Nazi occupation and communist dictatorship before fleeing to the United Kingdom. As an adult, he went into finance - first in the UK and then in the US, ultimately making billions through (among other things) currency speculation . He subsequently became a philanthropist, and his interests trended toward political causes - specifically, promoting democracy to prevent others from suffering under totalitarian regimes.\n\nSoros is a liberal, in the philosophical sense of the word. He named his charitable group the Open Society Foundation after philosopher Karl Popper's famous book defending democracy and individual rights, The Open Society and Its Enemies .\n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, he spent millions funding institutions in post-communist societies - most notably his native Hungary - designed to ease the transition away from communism and strengthen democracy's foundations.\n\nDuring the 2004 election cycle, Soros made his first major foray into American politics, donating roughly $27 million to various efforts to defeat President George W. Bush. \"When President Bush says, as he does frequently, that 'freedom' will prevail, in fact he means that America will prevail,\" he said at the time . \"I am rather sensitive to Orwellian doublespeak because I grew up with it in Hungary first under Nazi and later Communist rule.\"\n\nThe anti-Bush campaign is, per his biographer Emily Tamkin , the thing that first turned him into a conservative villain. Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert suggested in an interview at the time that Soros's wealth \" could be drug money \" - a claim that Tamkin traced back to a pamphlet published by acolytes of the conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche.\n\nBut the crucial event, the one that truly popularized Soros demonization, was the election of Barack Obama. By that point, Soros had become a major funder of progressive causes - and Obama's victory had driven the conservative movement off the rails. Conspiracy theories, like the notion that Obama was born in Kenya, became increasingly common in right-wing media.\n\nGlenn Beck's show on Fox News, basically a primetime conspiracy theory hour, focused its fire on Soros. In a 2010 three-part special titled \"Exposing George Soros: The Puppet Master?\" Beck accused Soros of being the secret hand behind a slew of coups and revolutions in the former Eastern Bloc. \"So, what is his target now? Us. America,\" Beck told his viewers.\n\nThis, in case you're wondering, very clearly crossed the line into antisemitism. It's true that Soros supported pro-democracy activists and civil society groups in former communist states - but that doesn't make him the \"puppet master\" secretly getting people out into the streets to demonstrate against dictators. The idea that a Jewish financier is secretly masterminding global events against the interests of rooted local conservatives - it doesn't take a scholar of antisemitism to see what Beck was drawing on here.\n\nAround the same time, the knives were coming out for Soros in Hungary.\n\nA right-wing former prime minister named Viktor Orbán who had just returned to power worked with two American political consultants to find a new enemy - a foil that could be used to justify Orbán's increasingly authoritarian ruling style. They settled on Soros: With his transnational identity and support for liberal causes, he served as an ideal villain to contrast with the culturally conservative Orbán.\n\nThe Hungarian prime minister began talking about Soros in dire terms, positioning him as the head of an international plot to undermine Hungarian independence from within. A 2018 speech was typical: \"We are fighting an enemy that is different from us. Not open but hiding; not straightforward but crafty; not honest but base; not national but international; does not believe in working but speculates with money; does not have its own homeland but feels it owns the whole world.\"\n\nThese were classic antisemitic tropes: The idea of crafty, disloyal Jews using their financial clout to manipulate the world from the shadows is a mainstay of antisemitic conspiracy theories like The Protocols of the Elders of Zion . Attacking Soros in this way allowed Orbán to draw on centuries of European antisemitism while maintaining a (thin) veneer of plausible deniability - a hallmark of his particular style of anti-democratic politics .\n\nTrump's presidential run, characterized by its weak relationship with the truth and populist attacks on the global \"elite,\" was also ideally suited to elevate Soros as a principal villain.\n\nWhen Trump and his allies tried to position the so-called \"migrant caravan\" as a major threat to America before the 2018 midterms, the president told reporters that \" a lot of people say \" Soros was behind it. You heard similar rhetoric from Donald Trump Jr. and Republicans in Congress .\n\nThis was a baseless lie, and an antisemitic one to boot. The idea that Jewish money is bringing in nonwhite immigrants to menace the United States is a staple of far-right rhetoric - one that had been voiced by a shooter who killed 11 Jews at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018.\n\nLast year, Tucker Carlson aired an inflammatory documentary about Soros's role in Hungary - one that drew on all the same antisemitic stereotypes. The head of the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish anti-hate group, wrote , \"It's appalling to see Tucker Carlson & Fox invoke the kind of anti-Semitic tropes typically found in white supremacist media.\"\n\nIt's important to have these examples in mind when we think about the \"Soros-backed\" criticism of Bragg.\n\nSuch rhetoric is falling in a particular context: that there is a very long history of saying things about Soros that draw directly on antisemitic ideas and conspiracy theories, one that has become increasingly popular on the American and international right over time. Invoking Soros in such an atmosphere is not innocent, and it's even worse when you're implying that Bragg is somehow arresting Trump on Soros's marching orders.\n\nThat is not to say that Soros should be above criticism, or that every attack on him is antisemitic.\n\nMany more thoughtful conservatives have argued that Soros is a principal funder of the \"progressive prosecutor\" movement, a nationwide campaign to elect district attorneys who aim to try and tackle problems like mass incarceration by (for example) refusing to prosecute certain low-level crimes. Bragg is one such progressive prosecutor, and seems to be the beneficiary of Soros's funding: Shortly after the group Color of Change pledged roughly $1 million to support Bragg, they received roughly $1 million in funding from Soros.\n\nTherefore, conservatives argue, when people like Trump or DeSantis call Bragg and other progressive prosecutors \"Soros-backed,\" they are merely stating the facts. Here's National Review's Charles C.W. Cooke making the case forcefully :\n\nGeorge Soros is not hiding his involvement in backing the election of the sort of prosecutors whom he prefers - we might call them \"Soros-backed\" prosecutors - and nor should he hide that involvement. This is America. In free countries, free people are allowed to argue for whichever sort of elected officials they prefer. And in return, other free people are permitted to criticize them. There is nothing factually incorrect about Ron DeSantis describing prosecutors who have been backed by Soros as \"Soros-backed\"; there is nothing morally wrong with Ron DeSantis going on to criticize those prosecutors, or the results they yield, or George Soros for having helped them get there; and there is nothing \"antisemitic\" about Jews who hold political opinions being criticized for those political opinions, as would anyone else be.\n\nCooke is right in one sense: Conservative criticisms of Soros's support of \"progressive prosecutors\" are not necessarily antisemitic. If what they were saying was \"progressive prosecutors raise crime rates and it's bad that Soros is supporting them,\" that would be one thing.\n\nBut what they're actually doing is claiming that Trump's prosecution is illegitimate and politically motivated - and that support from Soros is proof of said illegitimacy. The same \"puppet-master\" implication is invoked (remember Trump's words: \"hand-picked\"). And it beggars belief that these conservatives don't know that the Trumpist faithful won't fill in those conspiratorial (and yes, antisemitic) blanks.\n\nSo it's certainly possible to criticize George Soros without being antisemitic in the abstract. But at this point, we know what a dog whistle from Donald Trump and his ilk sounds like, and it's hard to ignore that the chorus of attacks on the Soros-Bragg connection hit those same notes.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

The verdict, handed down following a six-week trial, is historic, as it makes Trump the first former president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nBragg didn't weigh in on whether he will ask the judge for a prison sentence, saying his team will speak instead in court filings. Trump is set to be sentenced July 11 , just four days before the start of the Republican National Convention where he is poised to receive the party's nomination for president .\n\n\"While this defendant may be unlike any other in American history, we arrived at this trial and ultimately today at this verdict in the same manner as every other case that comes through the courtroom doors,\" Bragg said.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Trump authorized a plan to falsify checks and related records in an attempt to keep voters from learning about an alleged sexual encounter with Daniels in 2006. The former president had pleaded not guilty to all counts and told reporters after the verdict was read that the trial was \"rigged\" and the case was a \"disgrace.\"\n\nBragg began his remarks by thanking the 12 jurors and alternates for their service.\n\n\"First and foremost, I want to thank the jury for its service,\" Bragg said. \"Jurors perform a fundamental civic duty. Their service is literally the cornerstone of our judicial system.\"\n\nIn the face of criticism from Trump's supporters, Bragg said the \"only voice that matters is the voice of the jury, and the jury has spoken.\"\n\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

On the prosecution's side, the same section often has an empty seat, reserved for a public official who's mostly chosen to do other work during the trial: Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney.\n\nBragg has attended portions of proceedings here and there, primarily on days when his own staff - including young paralegals - are called to testify as custodial witnesses and then are subject to defense grilling.\n\n\"Bragg is doing it the right way,\" said Domenic Trunfio, a Syracuse University law professor.\n\nTrunfio ran the day-to-day operations of the Onandaga County district attorney's office in Syracuse for nearly two decades, with a jurisdiction of about half-a-million people, one-third the size of Manhattan. He said it's meaningful that Bragg shows up for his staff.\n\n\"It shows support. It says, 'Hey, I'm here. I know you're testifying in a case against the former president of the United States. And I'm here for you,'\" said Trunfio.\n\nThat was the case when paralegal Georgia Longstreet was challenged by Trump attorney Todd Blanche over whether she has independent knowledge of how X (formerly Twitter) or Trump's Truth Social network append timestamps to social media posts - or if she could affirmatively say who Trump was talking about when he posted, \"If you go after me, I'm coming after you!\"\n\n\"I have my assumptions, but, no,\" Longstreet said, sitting some 10 feet from Trump.\n\nAnd he watched as another Trump attorney, Emil Bove, asked paralegal Jaden Jarmel-Schneider if creating phone call log charts was \"tedious\" work.\n\n\"Honestly, I kind of enjoyed it,\" said Jarmel-Schneider, prompting laughter in the courtroom.\n\n\"I hear that. Respect,\" Bove replied.\n\nA spokesperson for Bragg declined comment for this story.\n\nTrump has entered a not guilty plea in the case, in which he's charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The documents were allegedly meant to hide \"hush money\" payments made in 2016 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, who at the time agreed not to speak publicly about a sexual encounter that Trump denies.\n\nBragg has attended parts of about one-third of the trial's 18 days, but even that level of attendance is extraordinarily rare for a Manhattan D.A., according to Diana Florence, who worked for Bragg's two predecessors.\n\n\"In my 25-year career, where I did a lot of high profile cases, the D.A. came to my summations a couple of times and to opening statements a couple of times,\" Florence said. \"But generally speaking, that wasn't really something they would do.\"\n\nFlorence said D.A.s are typically too busy with other aspects of the job to sit in on trials, such as pushing legislation relevant to law enforcement or their office and reviewing other major cases coming before grand juries.\n\nBragg has done both in the last month. Among other things, he championed an update to New York's hate crimes legislation that was included in the state's fiscal year 2025 budget, sent a letter asking YouTube to modify algorithms that he said recommended videos to kids about how to make ghost guns and 3D-printed guns, and he joined a push for a bill that would allow prosecutors to more easily introduce evidence in sex crimes cases that show defendants' prior \"bad acts.\"\n\nThat bill was inspired by an April 25 New York Court of Appeals decision overturning the rape conviction of former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.\n\nHis office has also announced major indictments, including ones related to the murder of a man shoved in front of a subway, sex trafficking, a large-scale retail theft ring and a notorious landlord accused of harassing his tenants.\n\nFlorence and Trunfio said for big cases like those, as well as the Weinstein case and of course, the Trump case, prosecutors need the D.A.'s buy-in. Ultimately, it's his name on the indictment.\n\n\"The elephant in the room here is this is the biggest criminal case that anybody has seen in a century,\" said Trunfio.\n\nGraham Kates is an investigative reporter covering criminal justice, privacy issues and information security for CBS News Digital.

Jim Jordan, wrote Bragg in late May after Trump's conviction in his hush money trial , accusing him of having conducted a \"political prosecution\" and requesting his testimony at a hearing June 13.\n\nIn a reply letter, the Manhattan district attorney's general counsel, Leslie Dubeck, said the prosecutor's office was \"committed to voluntary cooperation.\"\n\nThat cooperation, it added, including making Bragg, a Democrat, available to testify \"at an agreed-upon date.\" But the letter said the date picked by Jordan presented \"presents various scheduling conflicts.\"\n\nIt noted that the Trump prosecution is not yet finished. Trump, who was convicted of falsifying records to cover up hush money paid to a porn actor during the 2016 presidential campaign , is scheduled to be sentenced July 11. Before then, prosecutors will be making recommendations to a judge about what kind of punishment Trump deserves .\n\n\"The trial court and reviewing appellate courts have issued numerous orders for the purpose of protecting the fair administration of justice in People v. Trump, and to participate in a public hearing at this time would be potentially detrimental to those efforts,\" the letter said.\n\nBragg's office asked for an opportunity to discuss an alternative date with the subcommittee and get more information about \"the scope and purpose of the proposed hearing.\"\n\nJordan has also asked for testimony from Matthew Colangelo, one of the lead prosecutors in the Trump case. Bragg's office didn't rule that out, but said in the letter that it would \"evaluate the propriety\" of allowing an assistant district attorney to testify publicly about an active prosecution.\n\nJordan, an Ohio Republican, has proposed withholding federal funding from any entity that attempts to prosecute a former president. He has also railed against what he's described as the \"weaponization of the federal government.\"\n\nHis committee successfully battled before to get a deposition from one former prosecutor who worked on Trump's case, Mark Pomerantz, over Bragg's initial objections. That deposition, however, yielded little, with Pomerantz declining to answer many questions on the grounds that doing so could potentially open him up to a criminal prosecution for disclosing secret grand jury testimony.\n\n© 2024 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Judge rules against Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg, orders former prosecutor to testify before House Judiciary Committee\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  April 19, 2023 / 8:41 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nA federal judge rejected an effort by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to block a Congressional subpoena of a former prosecutor for that office who had worked on an investigation into former President Donald Trump.\n\nJudge Mary Kay Vyskocil ruled that she has no standing to block the subpoena , writing that the House Judiciary Committee has claimed to have legitimate legislative purposes for its inquiry. The committee and its Republican chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, have aggressively confronted Bragg in the weeks since Trump was indicted in Manhattan.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee says it is conducting its investigation in support of possible legislation that would \"insulate current and former Presidents from such politically motivated state and local prosecutions.\"\n\n\"The sole question before the Court at this time is whether Bragg has a legal basis to quash a congressional subpoena that was issued with a valid legislative purpose.  He does not,\" Vyskocil wrote in her decision Wednesday.\n\nBragg, a Democrat, has accused Jordan of pursuing the subpoena to score political points while supporting Trump, a Republican.\n\nVyskocil said the dispute appeared political, but said that did not impact her decision.\n\n\"In our federalist system, elected state and federal actors sometimes engage in political dogfights,\" Vyskocil wrote in her order, noting that Bragg is an elected official. \"Bragg complains of political interference in the local DANY case, but Bragg does not operate outside of the political arena.\"\n\n\"Jordan, in turn, has initiated a political response to what he and some of his constituents view as a manifest abuse of power and nakedly political prosecution, funded (in part) with federal money, that has the potential to interfere with the exercise of presidential duties and with an upcoming federal election,\" Vyskocil wrote.\n\n\"The Court does not endorse either side's agenda.\"\n\nAt the heart of the dispute is whether Mark Pomerantz , a former Manhattan prosecutor who wrote a memoir about his time leading the Trump investigation, gave up his privileges that protect him from divulging information about the investigation. Bragg's lawsuit accuses Jordan and the committee of using a subpoena of Pomerantz to interfere in the prosecution and investigation of Trump.\n\nDuring a hearing earlier Wednesday at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Vyskocil questioned Pomerantz's standing soon after the hearing began.\n\n\"How does this book, which is chock full of what Mr. Pomerantz calls 'insider information,' not\" constitute a waiver of privilege, she asked Theodore Boutrous Jr., an attorney for Bragg.\n\nLater, another attorney for Bragg argued that the district attorney believes Pomerantz had no right to waive the privilege on his own.\n\n\"That privilege belongs to my office, not to Mr. Pomerantz,\" said Leslie Dubeck, adding, \"I think there are things in there that should not have been published and that expose Mr. Pomerantz to potential criminal\" liability.\n\nBragg's office in January referred Pomerantz to New York City's Department of Investigation, which is tasked with looking into whether publishing the memoir violated the law. A spokesperson for Pomerantz declined to comment on the referral after it was made.\n\nAt Wednesday's hearing, each side was given 30 minutes to argue, and they were interrupted frequently by Vyskocil, who peppered them with questions.\n\nBoutrous argued the subpoena raised \"serious federalism issues,\" as well as concerns about separation of powers.\n\n\"It is totally unprecedented for a congressional committee to go after a local district attorney,\" Boutrous said.\n\nVyskocil quickly replied, \"It is also unprecedented for a local district attorney to bring an indictment of a former president.\"\n\nVyskocil, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, also said she she isn't allowed to consider the Committee's motivation in pursuing its inquiry, if there's a legislative purpose.\n\nBoutrous argued the Judiciary Committee's stated purposes, to consider legislation that might protect former presidents from prosecution or move those prosecutions to federal court, are cover for a politically-motivated effort to \"harangue\" Bragg, a Democrat, and his prosecutors.\n\n\"There's politics going on on both sides here,\" Vykosckil said.\n\nAttorneys for Bragg acknowledged that $5,000 in federal funds was used at one point in the investigation, but said the money went toward the prosecution of former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg and two Trump Organization companies on tax fraud charges.\n\nMatthew Berry, an attorney for the committee, said the subpoena is part of an effort to determine how much federal funding was used in the Manhattan probe, and if politics came into play.\n\nHe said the committee is concerned that fear of prosecution after a presidency might affect how a president behaves in office.\n\n\"If they fear that they will face prosecution in a city, will he tailor his policies to be more popular in the city?\" Berry asked.\n\nThe subpoena to Pomerantz demands his appearance before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday. It is unclear if he will appear.\n\nA spokesperson for Bragg said Wednesday, \"We respectfully disagree with the District Court's decision and are seeking a stay pending appeal.\"\n\nVyskocil denied Bragg's request for a stay Wednesday night.\n\nGraham Kates is an investigative reporter covering criminal justice, privacy issues and information security for CBS News Digital.

      "text": "Who is Alvin Bragg? What to know about the Manhattan D.A. weighing charges against Trump\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  March 22, 2023 / 6:55 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nThe district attorney who criminally charged Donald Trump is in the spotlight as a New York grand jury decided Thursday to indict the former president on allegations linked to a business records investigation related to a \"hush money\" payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels .\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg inherited the investigation into Trump from his predecessor in the office. Here's what you need to know about him:\n\nBragg, a Democrat and Manhattan's first Black D.A., was sworn in at the start of 2022. Now 49 years old, he grew up in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood in the 1980s, during a time when the city was grappling with higher crime rates and a crack cocaine epidemic. Bragg said that, as a child, he was held at gunpoint by police. He's said that experience shaped his thoughts on crime.\n\nBragg earned a bachelor's degree from Harvard and later a law degree from Harvard Law School.\n\nHe previously served as an assistant attorney general at the New York State Attorney General's Office and as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. He's spent more than 20 years working within the criminal justice system, according to his official bio .\n\nBragg has faced off with Trump a number of times. During his time with the New York Attorney General's Office, Bragg was involved with civil lawsuits against the Trump Foundation. A 2018 lawsuit accused the foundation of misusing funds for Trump's personal or political benefit. The foundation agreed to close under court supervision, and in 2019, a New York court ordered Trump to personally pay $2 million to settle the suit.\n\nDuring his campaign for Manhattan D.A., Bragg repeatedly touted his experience taking on Trump.\n\n\"I would emphasize that I have the know-how to do it. I've handled tax fraud cases. I've had mortgage fraud cases. I handled public corruption cases, spanning from bribery to government procurement fraud,\" Bragg told CBS News in 2020 . \"I want to emphasize and underscore the significance of the conduct, and my professional ability and experience doing that type of investigation.\"\n\nDuring that interview, he brought up the federal case that led to a guilty plea and prison sentence for Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, which identified the then-president as an alleged \"co-conspirator\" in the \"hush money\" scheme.\n\n\"I presume it could be, you know, accurate and charge ready,\" Bragg said. He noted that federal prosecutors had chosen not to charge Trump and stressed he could not \"prejudge\" any case. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nBragg was repeatedly asked in other interviews if investigations into Trump, begun under his predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr., would continue after he took office as Manhattan D.A. He said they were ongoing, but that they would take time. Bragg noted it was both a high-profile and complex case, but emphasized that he had experience with those types of investigations.\n\n\"These experiences shape my approach and the investigative steps that the team is hard at work on. Prosecutors fulfilling their duties cannot and do not bring only cases that are 'slam dunks,'\" he said in April 2022, several months after he'd been sworn in to the job. \"To the contrary, every case must be brought for the right reason - namely that justice demands it. That's what I've done throughout my career, regardless of how easy or tough a case might be.\"\n\nBragg handled another significant case involving Trump's business that year.\n\nTwo entities of the Trump Organization - the Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corp. - and the company's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, had been charged in a tax fraud case under Bragg's predecessor. They were accused of reducing payroll liability from executive salaries through untaxed bonuses and luxury perks worth millions.\n\nWeisselberg , who pleaded guilty , was sentenced to five months in jail and agreed to testify against the Trump companies. Bragg oversaw the prosecution that resulted in the companies being found guilty on all counts in December. The Trump Corporation was fined $810,000 and the Trump Payroll Corp. was fined $800,000. (Trump was not personally charged in the case and denied any wrongdoing.)\n\n\"These all-count convictions mark the first-ever criminal convictions of former President Trump's companies,\" Bragg said at the time.\n\nBragg represented family members of Eric Garner , who died in 2014 after he was placed in chokehold by a then-police officer.\n\nHe also worked on a New York lawsuit against disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein and the Weinstein Corporation in 2018.\n\nAs D.A., he announced an indictment against Steve Bannon , the former Trump adviser and right-wing operative who is charged with defrauding donors to a fundraising campaign promising to build a wall along the southern border. Prosecutors allege Bannon pocketed some of the money. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nSome, especially in New York City police unions, have slammed Bragg as being soft on crime.\n\nJust days after he was sworn in, Bragg sent out a memo to staff saying his office would not prosecute certain offenses , including marijuana misdemeanors, prostitution and fare evasion.\n\nHe also said prosecutors wouldn't seek prison time in certain types of criminal cases. Bragg said he wanted alternatives to incarceration for first-time offenders and people charged with certain robberies and assaults.\n\n\"Criminals know that @ManhattanDA will bend over backwards to protect them, not law-abiding New Yorkers,\" the Police Benevolent Association tweeted in June of 2022. Detectives' Endowment Association president Paul DiGiacomo described Bragg as \" a pro-criminal politician .\"\n\nBragg also faced backlash from Republican leaders in New York, including the 2022 GOP candidate for governor, former Rep. Lee Zeldin, who called for him to be removed from office .\n\nBragg has pushed back on those calling him soft on crime, telling CBS New York such accusations are \"not accurate.\"\n\n\"Now that we've been in office for a year ... gun prosecution is up 20%. Shootings and homicides are down,\" he said in January. \"Hate crime prosecutions up. We're doing the work. We're doing it thoughtfully, focusing on those who are doing the most harm in Manhattan.\"\n\n-Graham Kates contributed reporting.\n\nAliza Chasan is a Digital Content Producer for \"60 Minutes\" and CBSNews.com.

      "text": "Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg saw case against Trump as potentially \"charge ready\" years ago\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  April 4, 2023 / 6:57 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nIn a November 2020 interview with CBS News, Alvin Bragg , then a Democratic candidate for Manhattan district attorney, said that among the \"staggering\" number of cases \"swirling\" around then-President Donald Trump, a matter involving Trump's former \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen, stood out.\n\n\"You know, we haven't talked about Michael Cohen yet and the campaign finance part,\" Bragg said during the interview, in which he stressed he could not \"prejudge\" any case until he saw the evidence.\n\nA former New York state deputy attorney general who had previously clashed with Trump's company in civil suits, Bragg indicated he had followed media coverage of Cohen's federal case.\n\nCohen entered a guilty plea to federal tax evasion and campaign-finance violations in 2018, in connection with a $130,000 \"hush money\" payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Cohen, who was previously Trump's lawyer, was sentenced to 3 years in prison. He has since said the former president directed him to make the payment to prevent Daniels from speaking publicly about an alleged affair, and cover up the payment - allegations Trump has strenuously denied.\n\nThe charging document in Cohen's case describes him scheming with a person referred to as \"Individual-1,\" an alleged \"co-conspirator\" who was not named but who the document notes became president of the United States in 2017.\n\nBragg noted the \"Individual-1\" moniker in the 2020 interview.\n\n\"If the reporting about it has been accurate and you know, I mean, the Southern District of New York had a charging instrument where apparently the president was Individual-1, right?\" Bragg said, later adding, \"a co-conspirator of someone who pled guilty and, you know, has said that the president was his co-conspirator.\"\n\n\"And so, presumably, the evidence is there. And if it's a matter of, kind of, prosecutorial discretion, I mean, if they've already said it in a charging instrument. So I presume it could be, you know, accurate and charge ready,\" Bragg said.\n\nIt's a case, Bragg noted, that federal prosecutors chose not to pursue against Trump.\n\nAmong the candidates for D.A., Bragg was perhaps the most battle-tested against Trump and his company. At the New York Attorney General's Office, he oversaw multiple aggressive legal battles with Trump entities , including a lawsuit against the Trump Foundation - which accused the president and his children of using the nonprofit as a \"personal checkbook\" - and another against the now-shuttered Trump University, which claimed the school used illegal business practices and made false claims to potential students.\n\nBragg was elected as Manhattan district attorney in November 2021, inheriting the office's Trump investigation from his predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr. Under Vance, the probe , which began in 2018 as an inquiry into the Daniels payment, had grown into a sprawling examination of Trump's finances - an investigation challenged all the way to the Supreme Court by then-President Trump.\n\nEarly in his term, the investigation was thrown into question when the two prosecutors leading the probe resigned . In a resignation letter first reported by The New York Times, former Special Assistant District Attorney Mark Pomerantz wrote that Bragg had \"reached the decision not to go forward with the grand jury presentation and not to seek criminal charges at the present time.\"\n\n\"The investigation has been suspended indefinitely,\" Pomerantz wrote.\n\nBut Bragg's office insisted the probe remained active .\n\nIn August 2022, his office secured a guilty plea from former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg in a tax fraud case stemming from the same investigation - turning Weisselberg into the prosecution's star witness in the trial of two Trump Organization companies.\n\nThe two companies were found guilty on Dec. 6 of 17 criminal counts related to tax fraud and other crimes.\n\nBy then, investigators in Bragg's office had returned to the Daniels payment. In the months since, a stream of former Trump employees and White House staffers were questioned by a grand jury looking into the deal.\n\nAmong those was the prosecution's apparent star witness: Cohen, who met with prosecutors nearly a dozen times this year, and testified before the grand jury for about five hours over two days in mid-March.\n\nCohen and his attorney, Lanny Davis, have described the prosecutors as \"meticulous\" and \"professional,\" while acknowledging they believe he is the key witness against Trump.\n\nCohen has described wiring the money in October 2016 through a newly created limited liability company. Cohen and Daniels have claimed she and Trump agreed to a non-disclosure agreement using the aliases David Dennison and Peggy Peterson.\n\nThe potential case was described by Pomerantz in his recent memoir. Pomerantz said prosecutors in the office believed the Daniels payment was indicative of falsifying business records, a misdemeanor that he says could potentially be charged as a felony under New York law if intended to conceal a second crime: in this case, an alleged illegal campaign contribution.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has repeatedly decried the case and criticized Bragg on his social media platform, calling it a politically motivated \"witch hunt.\" Trump has called for protests if he is charged.\n\n\"There was no crime, period,\" the 2024 Republican presidential candidate wrote on March 19. \"Prosecutorial Misconduct and Interference with an Election.\"\n\nIn late March, the grand jury investigating the Daniels payment voted to indict Trump , making him the first former president in U.S. history to face criminal charges. Trump surrendered to authorities on April 4 for his arraignment in state court to face the charges: 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nGraham Kates is an investigative reporter covering criminal justice, privacy issues and information security for CBS News Digital.

      "text": "Manhattan DA will fight to keep Donald Trump's hush-money case alive - though sentencing could be delayed until 2029\n\nManhattan prosecutors will fight to keep Donald Trump's hush-money case alive, District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a court filing on Tuesday.\n\nThe decision by prosecutors comes six months after Trump's historic felony conviction and means Trump's twice-delayed sentencing will likely now be moved again. The sentencing can happen next month, at the earliest, after a new battle is waged over whether the indictment can survive both a Supreme Court immunity decision and the defendant's new status as president-elect.\n\nOne \"non-dismissal option\" would be to defer the sentencing \"until after the end of Defendant's upcoming presidential term,\" Bragg wrote to the trial judge, who did not immediately set a schedule for how the case will proceed.\n\n\"The People believe that the Court should set a motion schedule for Defendant's forthcoming motion to dismiss, which the People intend to oppose,\" Tuesday's three-page filing , signed by Bragg, says.\n\n\"The People deeply respect the Office of the President, are mindful of the demands and obligations of the presidency, and acknowledge that Defendant's inauguration will raise unprecedented legal questions,\" the filing says.\n\n\"We also deeply respect the fundamental role of the jury in our constitutional system,\" it adds. Attached to Bragg's letter are a series of previous emails and filings in the case, in which defense lawyers stand by their intent to fight for dismissal, and prosecutors ask for time to decide how to proceed.\n\n\"The Presidential Transition Act requires 'all officers of the Government' to 'take appropriate lawful steps to avoid or minimize disruptions that might be occasioned by the transfer of the executive power,'\" Trump attorney Todd Blanche wrote the judge in a November letter included with Tuesday's filing.\n\nA Trump spokesperson responded to the DA's letter by calling it \"a total and definitive victory for President Trump and the American People who elected him in a landslide.\"\n\n\"The Manhattan DA has conceded that this Witch Hunt cannot continue,\" wrote Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung. \"The lawless case is now stayed, and President Trump's legal team is moving to get it dismissed once and for all.\"\n\nSince his decisive victory on Election Day, Trump's November 26 sentencing date had remained on hold indefinitely, with his lawyers arguing that the case must be dismissed in the interest of justice to ensure Trump's constitutionally protected freedom to govern.\n\nTuesday's revelation by Bragg - that he will not throw in the towel on the case - now all but guarantees the sentencing will be pushed back well into next month at the earliest.\n\nBragg's letter asks the judge to require the defense to promptly file a motion to dismiss, to which the prosecution would like to respond on December 9.\n\nIt will be left to the judge, New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan , to then break the impasse, with just weeks remaining until Trump's inauguration.\n\nWhile it is in Merchan's power as judge to insist on keeping the November 26 sentencing date, doing so would leave him vulnerable to appeal, as he would not have allowed time for Trump to prepare a dismissal motion that takes into account the election results.\n\nUntil Tuesday, prosecutors had given scant sign of which way they were leaning.\n\nIn an email to the judge last week, one of the lead prosecutors, Matthew Colangelo, referred to the \"unprecedented circumstances\" of sentencing a president-elect.\n\nThe office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is considering, on the one hand, \"the Office of the President,\" Colangelo wrote.\n\nOn the other hand, he wrote to the judge, is the competing interest of \"a jury verdict of guilt following trial that has the presumption of regularity.\"\n\nUnder New York state case law, \" the presumption of regularity \" presumes that judicial proceedings are conducted properly and sets a high burden for defendants to prove otherwise.\n\nTrump faces anywhere from zero time in jail up to four years in prison on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush-money payment that silenced porn actress Stormy Daniels less than two weeks before the 2016 election.\n\nHowever, a jail sentence is highly unlikely for a 78-year-old defendant who is a first-time offender with a non-violent conviction, former New York City judges have told Business Insider. Any sentence would also be very quickly \"stayed\" -meaning put on ice - for many years as Trump appeals, the judges said.\n\nTrump's sentencing date had already been delayed twice.\n\nThe original July sentencing was canceled to allow the parties time to respond to the US Supreme Court's landmark decision granting presidents broad immunity from prosecution for official acts.\n\nOn that front, the judge is still weighing defense arguments that the case be dismissed because prosecutors improperly relied on official-act evidence now banned by SCOTUS.\n\nTrump's second sentencing date, in September, was abandoned after both sides agreed it was too close to the presidential election .\n\nThis story was updated to include details from Bragg's filing and Trump's response.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Bragg says Trump's crimes and 'history of malicious conduct' are too serious for his hush-money case to be dismissed\n\nIn an 82-page court filing made public Tuesday, Manhattan prosecutors say Donald Trump's \"history of malicious conduct\" is too serious for his hush-money case to be dismissed .\n\nThe filing, signed by DA Alvin Bragg, also fights Trump's claim that he enjoys something called presidential-elect immunity - above and beyond the presidential immunity bestowed on him by the US Supreme Court in June.\n\n\"There are no grounds for such relief now, prior to inauguration,\" Bragg wrote in opposing Trump's 11th-hour motion to dismiss, \"because President-elect immunity does not exist .\"\n\nWith just six weeks left before his January 20 inauguration - and six months after a Manhattan jury convicted him - Trump is again demanding that New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan immediately dismiss his hush-money case. It's his third time trying to void his indictment or his conviction. If successful, Trump would escape altogether his already thrice-delayed sentencing .\n\nThe president elect faces as little as no jail time and a potential maximum of four years prison for falsifying 34 business records throughout his first year of office to retroactively hide a hush-money payment to adult actress Stormy Daniels. (Legal experts have said that it's unlikely Trump would be sentenced to jail time as a 78-year-old first-time offender convicted of low-level felonies, and any jail sentence would be stayed as he appeals.)\n\nTrump paid for Daniels' silence just eleven days before 2016 election, and jurors unanimously found that he thereby conspired to promote his own election by unlawful means, Bragg wrote.\n\nThe evidence presented against Trump was \"overwhelming,\" reads the filing, which is also signed by a lead prosecutor on the case, Christopher Conroy.\n\n\"The crimes that the jury convicted defendant of committing are serious offenses that caused extensive harm to the sanctity of the electoral process and to the integrity of New York's financial marketplace,\" which relies on honest record-keeping, Bragg wrote.\n\nTrump's conduct during his hush-money prosecution also weighs heavily against dismissal, as does his \"long history of threatening, abusing, and attacking participants in other legal proceedings in which he is involved,\" Bragg wrote.\n\nTrump's \"contemptuous\" conduct began even before his hush-money indictment was voted, the prosecutor wrote.\n\n\"He threatened 'death and destruction' if he was indicted and posted a photo of himself wielding a baseball bat at the back of the District Attorney's head,\" Bragg wrote of Trump's actions while the grand jury was still hearing evidence in early 2023.\n\nLater, Trump launched online attacks on Merchan and members of his family .\n\nTrump was found guilty of criminal contempt ten times for his \"extrajudicial speech\" - including social media attacks on witnesses - during his trial this spring, Bragg wrote.\n\nTrump also repeatedly attacked the law clerk and was accused of lying under oath by the judge during last year's civil fraud trial, in which he's been ordered to pay a $454 million judgment.\n\nThat judgment remains on hold pending appeal .\n\nTrump's history of abusing the legal process extends to his other cases, Bragg wrote, including his continued defamations of writer E. Jean Carroll , who last year won more than $80 million in damages after the president-elect repeatedly mocked her and called her a liar.\n\nBragg's filling asked Merchan to either sentence Trump before the inauguration, or put the case on hold until after he serves out his second term.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump plays his last cards to stop his sentencing: Going to the Supreme Court\n\nLawyers for Donald Trump have asked the US Supreme Court to block the president-elect's Manhattan hush-money sentencing , currently set for Friday.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor is assigned to handle emergency applications from New York for the court, and she will get first pass at the application.\n\nSotomayor, nominated by President Barack Obama in 2009, wrote a scathing dissent of the high court's July 1 opinion granting presidents broad immunity from prosecution. The 525-page application filed by Trump on Wednesday morning refers to presidential immunity more than 300 times, and argues that it voids his conviction and indictment.\n\nIf she is unpersuaded by Trump's application, she will refer it to the full panel of justices, where he would need a majority 5/9 vote to prevail.\n\nThere is enough time between now and 9:30 a.m. Friday - the scheduled sentencing time - for a full panel decision, said Michel Paradis, who teaches constitutional law at Columbia Law School. \"If they want to, they can do it,\" Paradis said, adding that the justices can forgo oral arguments and decide on the paperwork alone.\n\nThe wording on a denial, should one come, would be terse, he said: \"The application for a stay having been bought before Justice Sotomayor, and by her referred to the whole court, is denied.\"\n\nIf Trump wins, \"that would be a few more lines, accompanied probably by a briefing schedule on the merits,\" he said, potentially pushing the matter past the January 20 inauguration, after which presidential immunity from prosecution kicks in.\n\nIn that instance, the sentencing could be postponed until after Trump leaves office in 2029, assuming SCOTUS doesn't toss the case on constitutional and immunity grounds.\n\nTrump's 11th-hour bid to avoid sentencing comes one day after a New York appellate judge nixed a similar stay, rejecting arguments by a defense lawyer that presidential immunity from prosecution extends to presidents-elect.\n\nDefense lawyers on Wednesday morning simultaneously filed an application with the state's highest appellate court seeking to block Trump's sentencing. That application was rejected Thursday morning.\n\nProsecutors with the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg filed response papers Thursday morning, as requested by Sotomayor. The response argued that SCOTUS has no jurisdiction over the case until after a final judgment of sentence, and took a swipe at what Bragg called Trump's \"novel invocation of President-elect immunity.\" Such a thing does not exist, the DA argued.\n\nSCOTUS can now decide at any time whether the sentencing happens as scheduled.\n\nTrump is seeking \"to correct the unjust actions by New York courts and stop the unlawful sentencing in the Manhattan D.A.'s Witch Hunt,\" Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said. \"The Supreme Court's historic decision on Immunity, the Constitution, and established legal precedent mandate that this meritless hoax be immediately dismissed.\"\n\nJanuary 9, 2025: This story was updated to reflect ongoing developments in the legal cases.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Arizona won't extradite suspect in SoHo hotel killing to New York, accusing the DA of being soft on crime. The DA says NYC's murder rate is half of Phoenix's.\n\nThe Maricopa County attorney in Arizona cited concerns about New York's lax treatment of criminals in justifying a decision not to extradite a suspect in a murder to the state - but the murder rate in each state's largest city complicates that message.\n\nA 26-year-old man, Raad Almansoori, was arrested this week in Scottsdale, Arizona, and is being charged in two stabbings in the state.\n\nJoe Kenny, the New York City Police Department's chief of detectives, said on Tuesday that after his arrest, Almansoori told the police to \"Google SoHo 54 Hotel.\"\n\nThe police identified him as the suspect in the killing of Denisse Oleas-Arancibia, a 38-year-old woman who was found dead at the SoHo 54 Hotel in Manhattan on February 8.\n\nThe Maricopa County attorney, Rachel Mitchell, told reporters on Wednesday that her office would keep Almansoori in Arizona and would not agree to extradition.\n\n\"Having observed the treatment of violent criminals in the New York area by the Manhattan DA there, Alvin Bragg,\" Mitchell said, \"I think it's safer to keep him here and keep him in custody so that he cannot be out doing this to individuals either in our state, county, or anywhere in the United States.\"\n\nBragg has faced similar criticism since his election in 2021.\n\nBragg, who campaigned on criminal-justice reform, has told prosecutors in his office that they should seek prison time only for the most serious offenses, like murder, sexual assault, and major economic crimes. He also supported bail reform and said he wanted to \"reserve pretrial detention for very serious cases.\"\n\nCritics have accused him of releasing potentially violent suspects. After a group attacked two NYPD officers in Times Square in January, Bragg released some of the suspects without setting bail, saying he wanted to proceed cautiously and ensure the authorities had the right people. The move put him at odds with Gov. Kathy Hochul. NBC New York reported , citing unnamed sources, that some of those suspects were believed to have fled the state.\n\nIn his response to Mitchell, Bragg's office said Phoenix's murder rate was actually higher than New York's. Police data indicates that in 2023, Phoenix, the largest city in Maricopa County, had 198 homicides in a population of about 1.6 million people, while New York City had 391 murders in a population of 8.3 million.\n\n\"It is deeply disturbing that DA Mitchell is playing political games in a murder investigation,\" a representative for Bragg said in a statement, adding: \"New York's murder rate is less than half that of Phoenix, Arizona, because of the hard work of the NYPD and all of our law enforcement partners. It is a slap in the face to them and to the victim in our case to refuse to allow us to seek justice and full accountability for a New Yorker's death.\"\n\nStill, whether Mitchell's concerns about extraditing the suspect to New York are justified, they are likely to strike a chord with Bragg's critics.\n\nJump to"

The judge, New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan, handed down a sentence that included no punishment, as expected.\n\nMerchan, reading from a statement, briefly chastised Trump, saying no ordinary citizen would have received the legal breaks he enjoyed.\n\nHe then sentenced Trump to an unconditional discharge, meaning the president-elect's felony conviction would stand but he'd receive no jail time, probation, fines, or community service.\n\n\"At this time, I impose that sentence to cover all 34 counts,\" Merchan said.\n\n\"Sir,\" the judge said in conclusion, \"I wish you Godspeed as you assume your second term in office.\"\n\nAt the start of the Friday sentencing hearing, the Manhattan prosecutor Joshua Steinglass condemned the former and future president, saying Trump \"engaged in a coordinated campaign to undermine\" the legitimacy of the trial and \"caused enduring damage to public perception of the criminal justice system.\"\n\n\"Far from expressing any kind of remorse for his criminal conduct, the defendant has purposefully bred disdain for our judicial institutions and the rule of law, and he's done this to serve his own ends,\" Steinglass told the court.\n\nThe assistant district attorney, speaking as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg sat behind him, said the court had found Trump in contempt for 10 different violations of extrajudicial speech.\n\nFriday's sentencing brings a delayed capstone to the criminal case just 10 days before Trump is scheduled to be sworn in again as the president of the United States.\n\nTrump appeared by video from his Florida estate, sitting alongside his defense lawyer Todd Blanche with a pair of gold-fringed American flags draped behind them. Emil Bove, another of his attorneys, was the only person sitting at the defense table in Merchan's lower Manhattan courtroom.\n\n\"It's been a political witch hunt,\" Trump said when given the opportunity to speak. \"It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election, and obviously that didn't work.\"\n\nIn May, a Manhattan jury found Trump guilty of all 34 felony counts prosecutors brought against him, finding he falsified business records in order to disguise hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels, a porn star who testified she had a brief affair with him ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBefore Trump was sentenced, the case was thrown into turmoil after the US Supreme Court ruled in July that the president is entitled to sweeping criminal immunity protections.\n\nAlthough Trump was no longer president, and much of the conduct in his case took place before his first term, the Supreme Court ruled the immunity protections were so vast that it even precluded evidence from being admitted in a criminal proceeding.\n\nTrump's attorneys asked Merchan to delay the sentencing indefinitely and throw out the case. The judge ultimately set Friday's date, writing that only a sentencing hearing before Trump's second term would respect the jury verdict - as well as allow Trump to appeal his case like any other ordinary defendant.\n\nJust 14 hours beforehand, a narrow US Supreme Court majority swatted down Trump's last legal efforts to halt the sentencing .\n\nThe Supreme Court's immunity decision gave Trump protections that \"ordinary citizens\" do not receive, but they did not \"reduce the seriousness of the crime or justify its commission in any way,\" Merchan said Friday.\n\n\"The protections are, however, a legal mandate, which pursuant to the rule of law, this court must respect and follow,\" Merchan said. \"However, despite the extraordinary breadth of those protections, one power they do not provide is the power to erase a jury verdict.\"\n\nJump to"

Trump pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe payment, footed by Trump's then-personal attorney, Michael Cohen, silenced Daniels weeks before the 2016 election. But instead of being recorded as a campaign expenditure, it was illegally disguised as a series of legal fees to Cohen, prosecutors say.\n\nIn Monday's filing, the defense further argues that Trump has not incited attacks on witnesses, prospective jurors, and court staff. The judge's verbal warning against doing so, made during Trump's arraignment a year ago, has been sufficient, they argue.\n\nTrump's lawyers sent the judge a separate filing Monday focused on Bragg's request for an anonymous jury. They argue that Trump and his defense team need to know the identities of potential jurors in order to prepare for jury selection effectively.\n\n\"The people do not cite a single public statement by President Trump since May 2023 that addressed, positively or negatively, the potential venire in this case,\" Necheles and Blanche wrote, using the legal term for prospective jurors.\n\n\"The People do not identify a single example where President Trump mentioned - let alone attacked or harassed - any juror by name,\" they add.\n\nMerchan has not said when he will rule on the proposed gag order and on juror anonymity.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "SCOTUS allows Trump hush-money sentencing to proceed on Friday\n\nThe US Supreme Court on Thursday rejected President-elect Donald Trump's last-ditch effort to block his New York hush-money sentencing , which now remains set for 9:30 a.m. on Friday.\n\nThe high court's decision means Trump must attend or face a potential bench warrant for his arrest just 10 days before Inauguration Day.\n\nFour conservative justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito, Neil M. Gorsuch, and Brett M. Kavanaugh - had sided with Trump.\n\nTwo conservatives on the panel - Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett - broke ranks and supported Manhattan prosecutors.\n\nIn their one-page order, the five-judge majority gave two reasons for rejecting Trump's attempt to halt the sentencing. \"First, the alleged evidentiary violations at President-Elect Trump's state-court trial can be addressed in the ordinary course on appeal,\" meaning post-sentencing, they wrote. \"Second, the burden that sentencing will impose on the President-Elect's responsibilities is relatively insubstantial,\" they wrote, given that Trump faces a no-punishment sentence and can attend the hearing virtually.\n\nTrump's lawyers last week asked that he be allowed to attend by video, a request approved by his trial judge, state Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg did not oppose Trump attending virtually and said Thursday that his office would not seek jail, fines, or probation at what will likely be a very brief hearing.\n\nUnder New York sentencing guidelines, Trump had faced as little as zero jail time and as much as four years in prison for his May 30 conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nA Manhattan jury found he altered Trump Organization invoices and other records throughout his first year in office to retroactively hide a $130,000 hush money payment that silenced porn actress Stormy Daniels eleven days before the 2016 election.\n\n\"Every legal scholar stated, unequivocally, that this is a case that should never have been brought,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday night.\n\n\"There was no case against me,\" he added. \"This was nothing other than Weaponization of our Justice System against a Political Opponent. It's called Lawfare, and nothing like this has ever happened in the United States of America, and it should never be allowed to happen again.\"\n\nSpeaking minutes after the SCOTUS order from Mar-a-Lago, Trump promised to appeal his conviction and repeated that the prosecution is an \"attack on a political opponent.\"\n\n\"That's much more important than tomorrow,\" he said of his planned appeal.\n\nTrump had fought hard to avoid sentencing, despite facing little inconvenience or penalty beyond some potential issues with his New Jersey liquor licenses.\n\nOver the past week, his lawyers had argued in four courthouses - in Manhattan, Albany, and Washington, DC - that any invocation of presidential immunity automatically entitles Trump to a stay pending appeal, even before he is sworn in .\n\nIn their opposition filings, Manhattan prosecutors scoffed at the idea that \"president-elect immunity\" exists. The US Supreme Court's landmark July 1 opinion granted presidents broad immunity from prosecution, but made no mention of immunity before swearing in, lawyers for Bragg said.\n\n\"Defendant's novel invocation of President-elect immunity does not warrant his Court's premature intervention\" in an ongoing state criminal case, Bragg told the high court in papers filed Thursday morning.\n\nDefense lawyers have promised to file a post-sentencing appeal of the conviction, with SCOTUS if necessary, given what they say were violations of Trump's constitutional rights before and during the trial.\n\nIn their primary example, they say grand jurors and trial jurors in the hush-money case improperly heard evidence that includes acts Trump took in his official role as president, which prosecutors are now barred from using.\n\nThat official-act evidence, all from 2018, includes tweets Trump sent, a federal form he signed, and a conversation he had in the Oval Office with Hope Hicks, then his communications director.\n\nProsecutors and the trial judge, Merchan, have argued that even if this was official-act evidence, it was a \"harmless error\" to share it with jurors, given the other overwhelming proof of guilt.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump asks federal courts to clear his criminal record. Meanwhile, his NJ liquor licenses remain at risk of revocation.\n\nLawyers for President Donald Trump took the unusual step this week of asking a federal appellate court in Manhattan to take control of the state appeal of his New York hush-money conviction.\n\nTrump's lawyers wrote that the hush-money case was \"extraordinary\" and relied on now exempt official, presidential acts to reach a guilty verdict.\n\nUS law allows such a state-to-federal transfer, but almost only in cases that are pretrial. For judges to approve, a defendant must invoke a federal defense such as presidential immunity and must establish that the alleged criminal conduct arose from official federal acts, his lawyers said in a 40-page brief.\n\n\"This prosecution of President Trump, which never should have been brought, checks both boxes,\" they wrote.\n\nThe brief was filed Monday with the intermediate-level 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. It was signed by the attorney Robert J. Giuffra, Jr.\n\nIn the 10 months since his conviction, Trump has fought hard in no fewer than four courts to clear his criminal record.\n\nSo long as the conviction remains on his record, at least two of Trump's three New Jersey liquor licenses - for his golf courses at the Trump National Golf Club in Colts Neck and the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, remain in jeopardy.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesperson with the New Jersey attorney general's office told Business Insider that revocation hearings on those golf club licenses remained pending, though no date had been set.\n\nNew Jersey law requires revocation if someone who holds or is the primary beneficiary of a liquor license has a felony conviction.\n\nThough the three clubs' liquor licenses are in Donald Trump Jr.'s, name, the elder Trump remains the primary financial beneficiary of the licenses through the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe Colts Neck and Bedminster clubs are selling liquor under provisional licenses; the license for Trump's third New Jersey club, the Trump National Golf Club Philadelphia in Pine Hill, expires in June.\n\nA Manhattan jury in May convicted Trump of 34 felony counts.\n\nThe jury found that throughout 2017, his first year in office, Trump conspired with his top executives to falsify Trump Organization records to retroactively hide a $130,000 hush-money payment that had silenced the porn actor Stormy Daniels 11 days before the 2016 election.\n\nMonday's brief came in response to an older and far more narrow question - whether a federal judge erred in July 2023 when he rejected one of Trump's pre-trial efforts to move the case to federal court.\n\nTrump had argued in that case that the hush-money matter \"involves important federal questions\" because he was president at the time prosecutors say the records were falsified.\n\nUS District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein disagreed, sending it back to state court for trial. Hellerstein found that Trump failed to demonstrate that the conduct he was actually charged with - falsifying business records to hide a hush-money payment - related to any official acts as president.\n\nA spokesperson with the office of District Attorney Alvin Bragg declined to comment. In September his office filed a brief arguing that Trump's efforts to move the case had come too late. In January prosecutors filed notice that they were willing to appear in court and participate in oral arguments before the appellate panel.\n\nThis story was updated Wednesday to include that the Manhattan DA's office declined to comment.\n\nJump to"

In the unredacted sections, defense lawyer Todd Blanche - Trump's pick for deputy attorney general - complained to Merchan about \"extensive and pervasive misconduct\" that \"violated President Trump's rights under the federal Constitution and New York law.\"\n\nDetails of the alleged misconduct, and even whether it concerns a single juror or more than one, are obscured by large black rectangles.\n\nThe letter demands that the supposed misconduct be considered by the judge as evidence in Trump's yet-resolved request that the historic conviction be voided in the interest of justice.\n\nThe defense followed up their December 3 letter to the judge with two more dated December 5 and 9. Both asked that the December 3 letter be made public in redacted form, a request opposed by prosecutors with New York Attorney General Alvin Bragg.\n\nProsecutors responded to the misconduct allegations on December 9, arguing that the claim \"consists entirely of unsworn allegations,\" and is based on \"hearsay and conjecture.\"\n\nAs part of Monday's 41-page denial of Trump's most recent dismissal effort - in which the judge rejected defense presidential immunity claims - Merchan told the parties he would only consider the new juror misconduct claims if they were formalized by the defense into a motion.\n\nMerchan, like prosecutors, noted that the defense misconduct claim \"consists entirely of unsworn allegations.\"\n\n\"Allegations of juror misconduct should be thoroughly investigated,\" he wrote, adding, \"However, this court is prohibited from deciding such claims on the basis of mere hearsay and conjecture.\"\n\nMerchan has not indicated when he might rule on Trump's interest-of-justice dismissal claim or broach the subject of sentencing.

Bragg faces challenges beyond any one big case.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST: Jury selection began today in the so-called hush money trial against former President Trump. Overseeing the prosecution is Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. As a federal and state prosecutor, he focused on white-collar crimes. Colleagues view Bragg's experience as essential in an unprecedented case. NPR's Walter Ray Watson has this look at the Manhattan DA. WALTER RAY WATSON, BYLINE: Alvin Bragg's team of five prosecutors brought a 34-count indictment against Donald Trump last year. The former president pleaded not guilty. Afterwards, Bragg held a news conference. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALVIN BRAGG: Under New York state law, it is a felony to falsify business records with intent to defraud and an intent to conceal another crime. That is exactly what this case is about. WATSON: This is the first-ever criminal indictment against the former U.S. president. The penalty is four years prison if found guilty. In 2022, weeks after entering office, Bragg stopped a previous team of prosecutors from presenting evidence against Trump to a grand jury. Bragg raised doubts. The lead prosecutors quit in protest a month later, and media criticized Bragg's decision. In 2023, Bragg impaneled a new grand jury, which indicted the former president. TERRI GERSTEIN: I know how careful he is as a lawyer. WATSON: Terri Gerstein remembers Bragg as her supervisor in the New York Attorney General's office, where she was labor bureau chief. She says he was thorough. GERSTEIN: He would carefully read all of the pleadings or briefs or memos that we were writing and would look up the cases himself and, like, really, really delve into them. WATSON: Friends and former colleagues tell NPR that Bragg was no micromanager but a deliberate, smart lawyer, a selfless public servant doing the right things for the right reasons. Details, even small ones, are important to Bragg and not just in legal matters. Attorney Anurima Bhargava leads Anthem of Us, a consulting firm. She's a longtime friend. ANURIMA BHARGAVA: This year I had a movie premiere. He was working, but, like, he showed up in the back and made sure I knew that he was in the room. And that's the kind of stuff that, like, even if it's for 10 minutes, means something. WATSON: They met as undergrads at Harvard, where Bragg also earned his law degree. Bhargava says his empathy garnered respect. BHARGAVA: Alvin was always the person who would go and start a conversation. WATSON: Nurtured in a storied section of Harlem called Strivers Row, his parents wanted their only child to be open and experience all kinds of people. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Good morning, Abyssinian friends and family. WATSON: Bragg worships at Abyssinian Baptist Church with his family. He teaches Sunday school. In 2021, then-pastor Calvin Butts III gave Bragg a few moments with the congregation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRAGG: Raised in the village of Harlem, I had a gun pointed at me six times - three by the NYPD during lawless stops and three by people who were not police officers. After the first gunpoint stop by the NYPD, I saw our pastor, Reverend Butts, and he guided me through how to file a civilian complaint. That was the beginning of my advocacy. WATSON: Bragg campaigned and won on his lived experience. He became the first Black person elected Manhattan DA. JELANI COBB: Alvin Bragg is somebody who grew up in Harlem at the time that stop and frisk was just, you know, a part of life. WATSON: Jelani Cobb has covered Bragg for The New Yorker. COBB: For progressive prosecutors in general, I would say him included, their ability to make reform in the system is always counterbalanced by the public's perception of its safety. KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: It really is a time in our history for a person of color to be the district attorney. WATSON: Former prosecutor Karen Friedman Agnifilo served as second in command to the last Manhattan district attorney, Cy Vance, and says Bragg shows he's got the skills to be a great DA. FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: If there were some growing pains in the beginning, you know, that happens, right? It's a tough job. It's a big job. WATSON: Bragg is tested almost daily. Earlier this year, there was an incident where migrants allegedly attacked police officers in Times Square. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PATRICK HENDRY: Why did these four individuals be released on their own recognizance? Why aren't they in jail right now? WATSON: Patrick Hendry, head of the Police Benevolent Association, the city's largest police union, as well as politicians and media, criticized Bragg because suspected migrants were freed without bail. Prosecutors were charged later after a thorough investigation. Bragg defended his office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRAGG: We do not tolerate people assaulting police officers, but in a court of law, our profound obligation is to make sure we have the right people charged with the right crimes. WATSON: Karen Friedman Agnifilo says critics and the public often lack information prosecutors are privy to. She says being a politician is not the main focus for the DA. FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: Although you are an elected official, you really have a higher calling, if you will, or a higher purpose that you have to serve, which is justice. WATSON: You are an officer of the court first, she says. The unprecedented case that Manhattan DA Bragg doubted, delayed and later revived will put him to the test. Jury selection has begun.

TERRI GERSTEIN: I know how careful he is as a lawyer. WATSON: Terri Gerstein remembers Bragg as her supervisor in the New York Attorney General's office, where she was labor bureau chief. She says he was thorough. GERSTEIN: He would carefully read all of the pleadings or briefs or memos that we were writing and would look up the cases himself and, like, really, really delve into them. WATSON: Friends and former colleagues tell NPR that Bragg was no micromanager but a deliberate, smart lawyer, a selfless public servant doing the right things for the right reasons. Details, even small ones, are important to Bragg and not just in legal matters. Attorney Anurima Bhargava leads Anthem of Us, a consulting firm. She's a longtime friend. ANURIMA BHARGAVA: This year I had a movie premiere. He was working, but, like, he showed up in the back and made sure I knew that he was in the room. And that's the kind of stuff that, like, even if it's for 10 minutes, means something. WATSON: They met as undergrads at Harvard, where Bragg also earned his law degree. Bhargava says his empathy garnered respect. BHARGAVA: Alvin was always the person who would go and start a conversation. WATSON: Nurtured in a storied section of Harlem called Strivers Row, his parents wanted their only child to be open and experience all kinds of people. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Good morning, Abyssinian friends and family. WATSON: Bragg worships at Abyssinian Baptist Church with his family. He teaches Sunday school. In 2021, then-pastor Calvin Butts III gave Bragg a few moments with the congregation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRAGG: Raised in the village of Harlem, I had a gun pointed at me six times - three by the NYPD during lawless stops and three by people who were not police officers. After the first gunpoint stop by the NYPD, I saw our pastor, Reverend Butts, and he guided me through how to file a civilian complaint. That was the beginning of my advocacy. WATSON: Bragg campaigned and won on his lived experience. He became the first Black person elected Manhattan DA. JELANI COBB: Alvin Bragg is somebody who grew up in Harlem at the time that stop and frisk was just, you know, a part of life. WATSON: Jelani Cobb has covered Bragg for The New Yorker. COBB: For progressive prosecutors in general, I would say him included, their ability to make reform in the system is always counterbalanced by the public's perception of its safety. KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: It really is a time in our history for a person of color to be the district attorney. WATSON: Former prosecutor Karen Friedman Agnifilo served as second in command to the last Manhattan district attorney, Cy Vance, and says Bragg shows he's got the skills to be a great DA. FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: If there were some growing pains in the beginning, you know, that happens, right? It's a tough job. It's a big job. WATSON: Bragg is tested almost daily. Earlier this year, there was an incident where migrants allegedly attacked police officers in Times Square. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PATRICK HENDRY: Why did these four individuals be released on their own recognizance? Why aren't they in jail right now? WATSON: Patrick Hendry, head of the Police Benevolent Association, the city's largest police union, as well as politicians and media, criticized Bragg because suspected migrants were freed without bail. Prosecutors were charged later after a thorough investigation. Bragg defended his office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRAGG: We do not tolerate people assaulting police officers, but in a court of law, our profound obligation is to make sure we have the right people charged with the right crimes. WATSON: Karen Friedman Agnifilo says critics and the public often lack information prosecutors are privy to. She says being a politician is not the main focus for the DA. FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: Although you are an elected official, you really have a higher calling, if you will, or a higher purpose that you have to serve, which is justice. WATSON: You are an officer of the court first, she says. The unprecedented case that Manhattan DA Bragg doubted, delayed and later revived will put him to the test. Jury selection has begun.

Overseeing the prosecution is Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. As a federal and state prosecutor, he focused on white-collar crimes. Colleagues view Bragg's experience as essential in an unprecedented case. NPR's Walter Ray Watson has this look at the Manhattan DA. WALTER RAY WATSON, BYLINE: Alvin Bragg's team of five prosecutors brought a 34-count indictment against Donald Trump last year. The former president pleaded not guilty. Afterwards, Bragg held a news conference. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALVIN BRAGG: Under New York state law, it is a felony to falsify business records with intent to defraud and an intent to conceal another crime. That is exactly what this case is about. WATSON: This is the first-ever criminal indictment against the former U.S. president. The penalty is four years prison if found guilty. In 2022, weeks after entering office, Bragg stopped a previous team of prosecutors from presenting evidence against Trump to a grand jury. Bragg raised doubts.

After the first gunpoint stop by the NYPD, I saw our pastor, Reverend Butts, and he guided me through how to file a civilian complaint. That was the beginning of my advocacy. WATSON: Bragg campaigned and won on his lived experience. He became the first Black person elected Manhattan DA. JELANI COBB: Alvin Bragg is somebody who grew up in Harlem at the time that stop and frisk was just, you know, a part of life. WATSON: Jelani Cobb has covered Bragg for The New Yorker. COBB: For progressive prosecutors in general, I would say him included, their ability to make reform in the system is always counterbalanced by the public's perception of its safety. KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: It really is a time in our history for a person of color to be the district attorney. WATSON: Former prosecutor Karen Friedman Agnifilo served as second in command to the last Manhattan district attorney, Cy Vance, and says Bragg shows he's got the skills to be a great DA. FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: If there were some growing pains in the beginning, you know, that happens, right? It's a tough job. It's a big job. WATSON: Bragg is tested almost daily. Earlier this year, there was an incident where migrants allegedly attacked police officers in Times Square. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PATRICK HENDRY: Why did these four individuals be released on their own recognizance? Why aren't they in jail right now? WATSON: Patrick Hendry, head of the Police Benevolent Association, the city's largest police union, as well as politicians and media, criticized Bragg because suspected migrants were freed without bail. Prosecutors were charged later after a thorough investigation. Bragg defended his office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRAGG: We do not tolerate people assaulting police officers, but in a court of law, our profound obligation is to make sure we have the right people charged with the right crimes. WATSON: Karen Friedman Agnifilo says critics and the public often lack information prosecutors are privy to. She says being a politician is not the main focus for the DA. FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: Although you are an elected official, you really have a higher calling, if you will, or a higher purpose that you have to serve, which is justice. WATSON: You are an officer of the court first, she says. The unprecedented case that Manhattan DA Bragg doubted, delayed and later revived will put him to the test. Jury selection has begun.

That is exactly what this case is about. WATSON: This is the first-ever criminal indictment against the former U.S. president. The penalty is four years prison if found guilty. In 2022, weeks after entering office, Bragg stopped a previous team of prosecutors from presenting evidence against Trump to a grand jury. Bragg raised doubts. The lead prosecutors quit in protest a month later, and media criticized Bragg's decision. In 2023, Bragg impaneled a new grand jury, which indicted the former president. TERRI GERSTEIN: I know how careful he is as a lawyer. WATSON: Terri Gerstein remembers Bragg as her supervisor in the New York Attorney General's office, where she was labor bureau chief. She says he was thorough. GERSTEIN: He would carefully read all of the pleadings or briefs or memos that we were writing and would look up the cases himself and, like, really, really delve into them. WATSON: Friends and former colleagues tell NPR that Bragg was no micromanager but a deliberate, smart lawyer, a selfless public servant doing the right things for the right reasons. Details, even small ones, are important to Bragg and not just in legal matters. Attorney Anurima Bhargava leads Anthem of Us, a consulting firm. She's a longtime friend. ANURIMA BHARGAVA: This year I had a movie premiere. He was working, but, like, he showed up in the back and made sure I knew that he was in the room. And that's the kind of stuff that, like, even if it's for 10 minutes, means something. WATSON: They met as undergrads at Harvard, where Bragg also earned his law degree. Bhargava says his empathy garnered respect. BHARGAVA: Alvin was always the person who would go and start a conversation. WATSON: Nurtured in a storied section of Harlem called Strivers Row, his parents wanted their only child to be open and experience all kinds of people. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Good morning, Abyssinian friends and family. WATSON: Bragg worships at Abyssinian Baptist Church with his family. He teaches Sunday school.

WATSON: Former prosecutor Karen Friedman Agnifilo served as second in command to the last Manhattan district attorney, Cy Vance, and says Bragg shows he's got the skills to be a great DA. FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: If there were some growing pains in the beginning, you know, that happens, right? It's a tough job. It's a big job. WATSON: Bragg is tested almost daily. Earlier this year, there was an incident where migrants allegedly attacked police officers in Times Square. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PATRICK HENDRY: Why did these four individuals be released on their own recognizance? Why aren't they in jail right now? WATSON: Patrick Hendry, head of the Police Benevolent Association, the city's largest police union, as well as politicians and media, criticized Bragg because suspected migrants were freed without bail. Prosecutors were charged later after a thorough investigation. Bragg defended his office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRAGG: We do not tolerate people assaulting police officers, but in a court of law, our profound obligation is to make sure we have the right people charged with the right crimes. WATSON: Karen Friedman Agnifilo says critics and the public often lack information prosecutors are privy to. She says being a politician is not the main focus for the DA. FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: Although you are an elected official, you really have a higher calling, if you will, or a higher purpose that you have to serve, which is justice. WATSON: You are an officer of the court first, she says. The unprecedented case that Manhattan DA Bragg doubted, delayed and later revived will put him to the test. Jury selection has begun.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Good morning, Abyssinian friends and family. WATSON: Bragg worships at Abyssinian Baptist Church with his family. He teaches Sunday school. In 2021, then-pastor Calvin Butts III gave Bragg a few moments with the congregation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRAGG: Raised in the village of Harlem, I had a gun pointed at me six times - three by the NYPD during lawless stops and three by people who were not police officers. After the first gunpoint stop by the NYPD, I saw our pastor, Reverend Butts, and he guided me through how to file a civilian complaint. That was the beginning of my advocacy. WATSON: Bragg campaigned and won on his lived experience. He became the first Black person elected Manhattan DA. JELANI COBB: Alvin Bragg is somebody who grew up in Harlem at the time that stop and frisk was just, you know, a part of life. WATSON: Jelani Cobb has covered Bragg for The New Yorker. COBB: For progressive prosecutors in general, I would say him included, their ability to make reform in the system is always counterbalanced by the public's perception of its safety. KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: It really is a time in our history for a person of color to be the district attorney. WATSON: Former prosecutor Karen Friedman Agnifilo served as second in command to the last Manhattan district attorney, Cy Vance, and says Bragg shows he's got the skills to be a great DA. FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: If there were some growing pains in the beginning, you know, that happens, right? It's a tough job. It's a big job. WATSON: Bragg is tested almost daily. Earlier this year, there was an incident where migrants allegedly attacked police officers in Times Square. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PATRICK HENDRY: Why did these four individuals be released on their own recognizance? Why aren't they in jail right now? WATSON: Patrick Hendry, head of the Police Benevolent Association, the city's largest police union, as well as politicians and media, criticized Bragg because suspected migrants were freed without bail. Prosecutors were charged later after a thorough investigation. Bragg defended his office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRAGG: We do not tolerate people assaulting police officers, but in a court of law, our profound obligation is to make sure we have the right people charged with the right crimes. WATSON: Karen Friedman Agnifilo says critics and the public often lack information prosecutors are privy to. She says being a politician is not the main focus for the DA. FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: Although you are an elected official, you really have a higher calling, if you will, or a higher purpose that you have to serve, which is justice. WATSON: You are an officer of the court first, she says. The unprecedented case that Manhattan DA Bragg doubted, delayed and later revived will put him to the test. Jury selection has begun.

WATSON: Patrick Hendry, head of the Police Benevolent Association, the city's largest police union, as well as politicians and media, criticized Bragg because suspected migrants were freed without bail. Prosecutors were charged later after a thorough investigation. Bragg defended his office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRAGG: We do not tolerate people assaulting police officers, but in a court of law, our profound obligation is to make sure we have the right people charged with the right crimes. WATSON: Karen Friedman Agnifilo says critics and the public often lack information prosecutors are privy to. She says being a politician is not the main focus for the DA. FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: Although you are an elected official, you really have a higher calling, if you will, or a higher purpose that you have to serve, which is justice. WATSON: You are an officer of the court first, she says. The unprecedented case that Manhattan DA Bragg doubted, delayed and later revived will put him to the test. Jury selection has begun.

After the first gunpoint stop by the NYPD, I saw our pastor, Reverend Butts, and he guided me through how to file a civilian complaint. That was the beginning of my advocacy. WATSON: Bragg campaigned and won on his lived experience. He became the first Black person elected Manhattan DA. JELANI COBB: Alvin Bragg is somebody who grew up in Harlem at the time that stop and frisk was just, you know, a part of life. WATSON: Jelani Cobb has covered Bragg for The New Yorker. COBB: For progressive prosecutors in general, I would say him included, their ability to make reform in the system is always counterbalanced by the public's perception of its safety. KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO: It really is a time in our history for a person of color to be the district attorney. WATSON: Former prosecutor Karen Friedman Agnifilo served as second in command to the last Manhattan district attorney, Cy Vance, and says Bragg shows he's got the skills to be a great DA.

      "text": "Alvin Bragg, Manhattan's district attorney, draws friends close and critics closer\n\nWalter Ray Watson\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg speaks during a press conference following the arraignment of former U.S. President Donald Trump in New York City on April 4, 2023. Jennah Moon/The Washington Post/Getty Images hide caption\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg speaks during a press conference following the arraignment of former U.S. President Donald Trump in New York City on April 4, 2023.\n\nObservers, friends and former colleagues view Alvin Bragg Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, as a smart, deliberate lawyer and a selfless public servant. And people who claim him as their friend say he's a thoughtful one.\n\nThose who spoke to NPR, who know Bragg well or watch him closely, say he is neither moved nor driven by politics. Bragg declined to speak for this story.\n\nAttorney Anurima Bhargava has been friends with Bragg since they were undergrads at Harvard University, where Bragg also earned his law degree.\n\n\"One of the things that is so intensely remarkable,\" she says, \"is that he's had friends, and colleagues, and people he grew up with, and he's stayed close to all of us.\"\n\nBhargava leads Anthem of Us, a consulting firm. She says Bragg finds ways to stay connected.\n\n\"This year, I had a movie premiere,\" she says. \"He was working, but he showed up in the back, and made sure I knew that he was in the room. And that's the kind of stuff that, like, even if it's for 10 minutes, it means something.\"\n\nAttorney Anurima Bhargava has been a friend of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg since they attended Harvard University in the 1990's. She says his presence had always made her feel and supported. José A. Alvarado Jr. for NPR hide caption\n\nAttorney Anurima Bhargava has been a friend of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg since they attended Harvard University in the 1990's. She says his presence had always made her feel and supported.\n\nBragg was featured in Harvard's student newspaper, The Crimson, in a 1995 article. He was described as \"empathetic\" and gregarious.\"\n\n\"Alvin is always the person to go and start a conversation,\" Bhargava says, and adds, he was at the center of difficult campus conversations, and someone who defied stereotypes as an actively listener, even with people he just met. Bhargava says whether at a committee meeting or a party, Bragg was a warm, welcoming presence.\n\n\"If Alvin was in the room, like, I always felt really safe and supported,\" Bhargava says. \"I felt like there was someone in the room who would always have my back.\"\n\nAlvin Bragg is now at the center of the first-ever criminal trial of a former American president.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney now oversees a team of six prosecutors trying the case against Donald Trump. Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.\n\nLast year, the former president was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to all charges. Bragg then held a news conference.\n\n\"Under New York State law, it is a felony to falsify business records with the intent to conceal another crime,\" Bragg said. \"That is exactly what this case is about.\"\n\nJury selection is expected to be complete by the end of the week. Opening arguments could happen as early as Monday. Donald Trump faces a penalty of up to four years in prison.\n\nThe former president has claimed Bragg's prosecution to be politically motivated. Trump's defense attorneys have filed and failed to have the case delayed or dismissed. The presiding judge, Juan Merchan, has denied all those motions.\n\nSome view the case as a distraction, compared to three other criminal cases pending against Trump, where prosecutors allege his actions present far more serious threats to democracy.\n\nTerri Gerstein worked with Alvin Bragg in the New York Attorney General's office. He is smart and a careful lawyer, she says. Gerstein is now a director at the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University. José A.

And look up the cases himself and, like, really, really delve into them,\" she says.\n\nGerstein now is a director at the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at NYU. She remembers working on a couple of wage theft cases where home care aides went unpaid, caring for older patients and people with disabilities.\n\n\"That case really touched a nerve with him,\" she says. \"That people would be doing this kind of work, and that someone would take advantage of them in that way.\"\n\nThe employers pleaded guilty in both cases.\n\nBefore he was elected Manhattan district attorney, Bragg was steeped in prosecuting white collar crime and public corruption cases working for both the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) and the New York Attorney General.\n\nHe grew up as a son of Harlem\n\nAlvin Bragg Jr. attended Trinity, a private K-12 college prep school. He was nurtured in a storied section of Harlem called Strivers' Row. His mother, Sadie, taught high school math and later was vice president at Borough of Manhattan Community College. His father, Alvin Sr., headed the local Urban League for several years. He retired as the city's director of homeless shelters. Bragg's parents wanted their only child to be open and experience all kinds of people.\n\nBragg worshiped at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem as a child, and still does now with his wife and children. He teaches Sunday school there. In 2021, the late pastor Calvin Butts III introduced candidate Bragg during a Sunday service as \"a son of Harlem.\" Rev. Butts gave Bragg a few moments to make his pitch to potential voters.\n\n\"I had a gun pointed at me six times, three by the NYPD during lawless stops, and three by people who were not police officers,\" Bragg told the congregation.\n\n\"After the first gunpoint stop by the NYPD, I saw our pastor, Reverend Butts, and he guided me through how to file a civilian complaint. That was the beginning of my advocacy.\" He was a high school student at the time.\n\nBragg campaigned and won on his lived experience, and became the first black person elected Manhattan district attorney.\n\nJelani Cobb has covered Bragg as a staff writer for The New Yorker.\n\nJelani Cobb, a staff writer for The New Yorker, observes progressive district attorneys like Bragg must balance their ability to make reform in the system with the public's perception of its safety.

Bragg declared prosecuting violent crime his top priority. He has also advocated for alternatives to jail when appropriate, and dropped prosecutions for low-level offenses.\n\nTina Luongo says Bragg has put people in high places of his administration who \"think outside the box\" in terms of reform. Tina Luongo heads criminal defense practice for the Legal Aid Society, the city's primary source for public defenders. They were familiar with Bragg for many years and aware of his reform efforts when he worked in the New York Attorney General's office.\n\nBragg is different from his predecessors, Luongo says.\n\nLegal Aid Chief Attorney Tina Luongo says Alvin Bragg is an attentive listener. \"He may or may not agree with my position, but he hears me out,\" she says.

Friedman says she decided not to run for the office after Vance declined a fourth bid.\n\nShe says \"fresh, new ideas\" are needed to solve recidivism, because \"the old ways\" or patterns of prosecution and incarceration are not working.\n\n\" I've never worked with him, but he's doing a really good job,\" she says.\n\nKaren Friedman Agnifilo was former Chief Assistant District Attorney for Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance. Every new district attorney has missteps in the beginning, she says. José A. Alvarado Jr. for NPR hide caption\n\nKaren Friedman Agnifilo was former Chief Assistant District Attorney for Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance. Every new district attorney has missteps in the beginning, she says.\n\nBragg stumbled early on with the release of the Day One Memo, a document that outlined policy shifts for bail and sentencing, among other changes. It was sent office-wide via email, without any discussion.\n\n\"It didn't go well at all,\" says  Catherine Christian, a veteran Assistant District Attorney who worked for three decades in the office before becoming a law partner in private practice.\n\nCatherine Christian, a former assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney's office and currently in private practice, believes Alvin Bragg is someone who learns from his mistakes. José A. Alvarado Jr. for NPR hide caption\n\nCatherine Christian, a former assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney's office and currently in private practice, believes Alvin Bragg is someone who learns from his mistakes.\n\nChristian, who left seven months into Bragg's term, says he recovered after a long period of chaos and found his footing after about a year. \"I think he's someone who's willing to learn, and learns from mistakes. And listens,\" she says.\n\nOnly a few weeks in office, Bragg had another set of challenges.\n\nBragg reportedly questioned the lead prosecutors, Mark Pomerantz and Carey Dunne, in several meetings. He'd stopped their team from presenting evidence against Donald Trump to a grand jury in a criminal probe into Trump's involvement in fraud for overvaluing his assets. (New York Attorney General Letitia James later successfully pursued a civil lawsuit against the Trump Organization, largely along the same lines of evidence pursued by Mark Pomerantz, and it resulted in a $454 million penalty against Trump.)\n\nBragg had doubts about moving forward, and both Pomerantz and Dunne resigned in protest a month later. In March 2023, Bragg empaneled a new grand jury that voted to indict Trump.\n\n\"I know that there were a few missteps in the beginning, and growing pains,\" Karen Friedman Agnifilo says. \"But I think he's maturing really nicely.\"\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's office is staffed by more than 1,500 people. The work ranges from prosecuting white collar crime to human trafficking to street crime to addressing needs of survivors, exonerating wrongful convictions police misconduct, and returning of stolen antiquities.\n\nIn January 2023, a New York state court ordered the Trump Organization to pay fines totaling 1.6 million in a tax fraud case. D.A. Bragg's office successfully won that prosecution.\n\nBragg may be seen as maturing in his job, but he continues to be tested by cases and critics. Earlier this year, several migrants allegedly attacked police officers in Times Square. At the hearing, prosecutors did not request bail, due to a lack of evidence at the time. The suspected attackers were set free, and Bragg took heat for his handling of the case from politicians and others.\n\n\"Why are these four individuals released on their own recognizance?\" Patrick Hendry asked during a news conference. Hendry is president of the Police Benevolent Association (PBA), the city's largest police union. \"Why aren't they in jail right now?\"\n\nProsecutors did a thorough investigation. Bragg defended his office.\n\n\"We do not tolerate people assaulting police officers,\" Bragg told the press. \"But in a court of law, our profound obligation is to make sure we have the right people charged with the right crimes.\"\n\nProsecutors filed charges after many days and several suspects were held for trial.\n\n\"You're not allowed to talk about details and facts,\" says Karen Friedman Agnifilo. Bragg, like all district attorneys, is confronted by cases where he can't share information with the public, or respond to critics the way politicians do.\n\n\"You're an officer of the court and the highest law enforcement official, first and foremost,\" Agnifilo Friedman says, \"and you're a politician second.\"\n\nThe unprecedented trial of Donald Trump is a case that Alvin Bragg Jr. doubted, delayed and later revived. Now underway, it will put the Manhattan district attorney to the test."

Jim Jordan in relation to Trump case\n\nRyan Lucas\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is suing the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Jim Jordan for what he says are Jordan's attempts to interfere in the Trump prosecution.\n\nJUANA SUMMERS, HOST: It was just last week that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg unveiled criminal charges against former President Donald Trump. And now Bragg is suing the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan, for what he says are Jordan's attempts to interfere in the Trump prosecution. NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas joins us now with the latest. And, Ryan, what can you tell us about this lawsuit? RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Well, Bragg filed this lawsuit in federal court in New York. And in the filing, Bragg says he's taking this step in response to what he calls a, quote, \"brazen and unconstitutional attack by members of Congress on an active New York state prosecution.\" He says that Jordan, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has launched a campaign to try to intimidate and attack Bragg, that Jordan is demanding confidential documents and testimony from Bragg as well as current and former employees of the district attorney. And Bragg says that Jordan is seeking highly sensitive, confidential information that belongs to local prosecutors. And he says basic principles of federalism and common sense, not to mention Supreme Court precedent, bar Congress from demanding this sort of information. SUMMERS: OK. So what exactly is Bragg asking the court to do here? LUCAS: Well, he's asking for a couple of things. He wants the court to invalidate a subpoena that Jordan has issued to a man by the name of Mark Pomerantz. Pomerantz worked as a prosecutor in Bragg's office on Trump issues, but he left late last year after having a difference of opinion on how to proceed with these cases. Pomerantz also wrote a book that was critical of some of the decisions that were made in the DA's office. Bragg says the subpoena for Pomerantz's deposition is invalid and unconstitutional. And Bragg also wants, more broadly, the court to prevent any future subpoena on Bragg or any other current or former employees of the district attorney. SUMMERS: At this point, has there been any response from Congressman Jim Jordan? LUCAS: Jordan has responded. He put out a brief statement on Twitter. I'll quote the statement for you. He says, quote, \"first, they indict a president for no crime. Then they sue to block congressional oversight when we ask questions about the federal funds they say they used to do it.\" That's all Jordan said so far. SUMMERS: OK. You mentioned Bragg's accusation that Jordan has tried to intimidate his office. So just help me understand, how did this all escalate to this point? LUCAS: Well, there's been a lot of back and forth between Jordan and Bragg over the past few weeks. Before Trump was even indicted in New York - so back in mid- to late March - Jordan and two other Republican House committee chairmen sent Bragg a letter demanding communications and documents and testimony related to the investigation into Trump. They called Bragg's investigation politically motivated. They said that it was an abuse of power. And this, of course, was all before Trump had even been indicted. They didn't know whether he would ultimately be indicted. Bragg replied back then with a letter of his own. He defended his office's work. He said everything that they've done has been done consistent with the letter of the law. And he also said that Congress, look, doesn't have oversight of state prosecutors. This isn't something for them to deal with. Bragg also said that the information that Jordan and these others were seeking is privileged. It's confidential, and this is about a pending and ongoing criminal investigation. SUMMERS: And then we get to last week, when Bragg's office took the unprecedented step of charging Trump, a former president, of course. LUCAS: Of course. Yeah, that's right - 34 felony charges in all for falsifying business records. That, of course, all ties back into hush money payments that were made during the 2016 campaign to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Now, two days after Trump was arraigned in state court in Manhattan, Jordan sent a subpoena to Pomerantz, the former prosecutor in Bragg's office, for a deposition. And now here we have Bragg firing back with this lawsuit here. SUMMERS: Ryan, where does this all go from here? LUCAS: Well, this lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan. And the court to take this up - and we'll see how it moves forward. But Jordan already has a move planned on his end. This one is very much not in the courts. His committee has announced that it plans to hold a field hearing in New York City next week featuring people they're calling victims of Bragg's policies. This is something that a spokesperson for Bragg's office called a political stunt. SUMMERS: NPR's Ryan Lucas. Thank you. LUCAS: Thank you. Copyright © 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And the court to take this up - and we'll see how it moves forward. But Jordan already has a move planned on his end. This one is very much not in the courts. His committee has announced that it plans to hold a field hearing in New York City next week featuring people they're calling victims of Bragg's policies. This is something that a spokesperson for Bragg's office called a political stunt. SUMMERS: NPR's Ryan Lucas. Thank you. LUCAS: Thank you. Copyright © 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Well, Bragg filed this lawsuit in federal court in New York. And in the filing, Bragg says he's taking this step in response to what he calls a, quote, \"brazen and unconstitutional attack by members of Congress on an active New York state prosecution.\" He says that Jordan, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has launched a campaign to try to intimidate and attack Bragg, that Jordan is demanding confidential documents and testimony from Bragg as well as current and former employees of the district attorney. And Bragg says that Jordan is seeking highly sensitive, confidential information that belongs to local prosecutors. And he says basic principles of federalism and common sense, not to mention Supreme Court precedent, bar Congress from demanding this sort of information. SUMMERS: OK. So what exactly is Bragg asking the court to do here? LUCAS: Well, he's asking for a couple of things. He wants the court to invalidate a subpoena that Jordan has issued to a man by the name of Mark Pomerantz. Pomerantz worked as a prosecutor in Bragg's office on Trump issues, but he left late last year after having a difference of opinion on how to proceed with these cases. Pomerantz also wrote a book that was critical of some of the decisions that were made in the DA's office. Bragg says the subpoena for Pomerantz's deposition is invalid and unconstitutional. And Bragg also wants, more broadly, the court to prevent any future subpoena on Bragg or any other current or former employees of the district attorney. SUMMERS: At this point, has there been any response from Congressman Jim Jordan? LUCAS: Jordan has responded. He put out a brief statement on Twitter. I'll quote the statement for you. He says, quote, \"first, they indict a president for no crime. Then they sue to block congressional oversight when we ask questions about the federal funds they say they used to do it.\" That's all Jordan said so far. SUMMERS: OK. You mentioned Bragg's accusation that Jordan has tried to intimidate his office. So just help me understand, how did this all escalate to this point? LUCAS: Well, there's been a lot of back and forth between Jordan and Bragg over the past few weeks. Before Trump was even indicted in New York - so back in mid- to late March - Jordan and two other Republican House committee chairmen sent Bragg a letter demanding communications and documents and testimony related to the investigation into Trump. They called Bragg's investigation politically motivated. They said that it was an abuse of power. And this, of course, was all before Trump had even been indicted. They didn't know whether he would ultimately be indicted. Bragg replied back then with a letter of his own. He defended his office's work. He said everything that they've done has been done consistent with the letter of the law. And he also said that Congress, look, doesn't have oversight of state prosecutors. This isn't something for them to deal with. Bragg also said that the information that Jordan and these others were seeking is privileged. It's confidential, and this is about a pending and ongoing criminal investigation. SUMMERS: And then we get to last week, when Bragg's office took the unprecedented step of charging Trump, a former president, of course. LUCAS: Of course. Yeah, that's right - 34 felony charges in all for falsifying business records. That, of course, all ties back into hush money payments that were made during the 2016 campaign to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Now, two days after Trump was arraigned in state court in Manhattan, Jordan sent a subpoena to Pomerantz, the former prosecutor in Bragg's office, for a deposition. And now here we have Bragg firing back with this lawsuit here. SUMMERS: Ryan, where does this all go from here? LUCAS: Well, this lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan.

This isn't something for them to deal with. Bragg also said that the information that Jordan and these others were seeking is privileged. It's confidential, and this is about a pending and ongoing criminal investigation. SUMMERS: And then we get to last week, when Bragg's office took the unprecedented step of charging Trump, a former president, of course. LUCAS: Of course. Yeah, that's right - 34 felony charges in all for falsifying business records. That, of course, all ties back into hush money payments that were made during the 2016 campaign to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Now, two days after Trump was arraigned in state court in Manhattan, Jordan sent a subpoena to Pomerantz, the former prosecutor in Bragg's office, for a deposition. And now here we have Bragg firing back with this lawsuit here. SUMMERS: Ryan, where does this all go from here? LUCAS: Well, this lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan. And the court to take this up - and we'll see how it moves forward. But Jordan already has a move planned on his end. This one is very much not in the courts. His committee has announced that it plans to hold a field hearing in New York City next week featuring people they're calling victims of Bragg's policies. This is something that a spokesperson for Bragg's office called a political stunt. SUMMERS: NPR's Ryan Lucas. Thank you. LUCAS: Thank you. Copyright © 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He says, quote, \"first, they indict a president for no crime. Then they sue to block congressional oversight when we ask questions about the federal funds they say they used to do it.\" That's all Jordan said so far. SUMMERS: OK. You mentioned Bragg's accusation that Jordan has tried to intimidate his office. So just help me understand, how did this all escalate to this point? LUCAS: Well, there's been a lot of back and forth between Jordan and Bragg over the past few weeks. Before Trump was even indicted in New York - so back in mid- to late March - Jordan and two other Republican House committee chairmen sent Bragg a letter demanding communications and documents and testimony related to the investigation into Trump. They called Bragg's investigation politically motivated. They said that it was an abuse of power. And this, of course, was all before Trump had even been indicted. They didn't know whether he would ultimately be indicted. Bragg replied back then with a letter of his own. He defended his office's work. He said everything that they've done has been done consistent with the letter of the law. And he also said that Congress, look, doesn't have oversight of state prosecutors.

In fact, they have opened their own investigation into the investigation (say that five times fast). Here's representative Jim Jordan:\n\nIt's obvious that this is a sham. And something that we want to know: were federal funds involved? Did this stem from - it sure looks like it grew out of the special counsel investigation, because those are the legislative concerns we have as Congress.\n\nAnd NPR correspondent Ilya Marritz says, politics aside, the logistics alone would be a tall order for Bragg:\n\nIf the grand jury does indict Trump, the logistics of bringing him in for fingerprinting for an arraignment will be an enormous test of Bragg's ability to coordinate with the former president, his lawyers, the Secret Service and the police. There are security concerns, including for Bragg and his staff. Trump has always said he is innocent, and he's been lobbing abuse at the DA on social media all weekend.\n\nA spokesperson for Bragg's office told NPR the work won't be affected:\n\nWe will not be intimidated by attempts to undermine the justice process, nor will we let baseless accusations deter us from fairly applying the law ... In every prosecution, we follow the law without fear or favor to uncover the truth. Our skilled, honest and dedicated lawyers remain hard at work.\n\nTrump said on social media that he'll be arrested Tuesday as part of the investigation.

      "text": "A look at Alvin Bragg, who has been the Manhattan DA for 15 months\n\nBy\n\nPatrick Jarenwattananon\n\n,\n\nMary Louise Kelly\n\nIf Donald Trump is to be indicted, Bragg would be the first prosecutor to bring criminal charges against a former U.S. president. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with journalist Erica Orden about him.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: If Donald Trump is to be indicted this week, the prosecutor in charge, the first prosecutor ever to bring criminal charges against a former U.S. president, would be Alvin Bragg. He's the district attorney of Manhattan. He's been in the job just 15 months, which has been plenty of time for President Trump and his allies to call Bragg biased. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELISE STEFANIK: This is a political witch hunt perpetrated by one of the far-left, radical socialist district attorneys, Alvin Bragg. KELLY: That is New York Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik speaking today on Fox News, whereas people who actually know Alvin Bragg describe him as generally not interested in political fights. Journalist Erica Orden found that as she reported on Bragg for a profile for Politico. Erica Orden, welcome. ERICA ORDEN: Thank you very much for having me. KELLY: All right. So Alvin Bragg is 49 years old, lifelong New Yorker, the first Black person to serve as Manhattan DA. Briefly give me a little bit more of his background. What's he done prior to this job? ORDEN: Sure. So his two sort of biggest things on his resume were that he was a assistant U.S. attorney in the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office. He worked largely under Preet Bharara, and he prosecuted a number of cases there. He did a lot of money laundering cases and a variety of other things. And he was - he worked for a number of years in the New York attorney general's office. And ultimately, he became the chief deputy attorney general in that office. KELLY: And among the cases he has prosecuted in the past, he's prosecuted the Trump Business Organization and the Trump Foundation, right? ORDEN: That's right. When he was in the New York attorney general's office, he supervised a lawsuit against the Trump Foundation that resulted in Trump personally paying a $2 million settlement. And earlier this year, while he was in the DA's office, his office won a criminal tax fraud trial against the Trump Organization. KELLY: OK. He is - when you read about him, he's often described as progressive. Some of his more progressive initiatives so far as DA in Manhattan have provided ammunition for Trump and his defenders. What has he done that his opponents have seized upon? ORDEN: Well, he had quite a bumpy start to his career in the district attorney's office. Two days after taking office - so January of last year - he issued a memo that directed assistant district attorneys to largely avoid prosecuting minor offenses. He told them to stop charging many low-level crimes and to avoid seeking jail time for many robbery, assault and gun possession cases in which no other crimes were committed. So there was a big sort of internal backlash to that directive. And there was also vocal criticism from a variety of outside sources, including the police commissioner, police unions and conservative media outlets. KELLY: Well, I want to drill down a little bit more on his politics. It's, of course, impossible to peer into anyone's minds, but you've talked to a lot of people who know him who doubt that he has any political ax to grind here. What did they tell you? ORDEN: Well, most people who have talked to him - you know, clearly he has progressive beliefs, and he has tried to institute those in the office. But most people who know him, who have known him for a long time and have worked for - and have worked with him or for him, believe that he really is not seeking any other higher office. In other words, his ambition is not to have a political career. He is obviously in elected office. And he got there by campaigning and going out on the campaign trail. But. KELLY: Sure. ORDEN: They don't believe that he is a political animal and that he is in pursuit of a political career... KELLY: In the few seconds... ORDEN: ...Other than being district attorney. KELLY: Forgive me. In the few seconds we have left, he will inevitably face attacks, political attacks, if he does bring this case. Do you get a sense that Alvin Bragg cares? ORDEN: Well, people who know him say that he's somewhat immune to the sort of public relations offenses that Donald Trump tends to enjoy bringing against his opponents. And, you know, he's a human being. I would imagine that he - you know, some level of criticism gets to anyone. But... KELLY: Right. ORDEN: In large part, people who know him say he won't be bothered too much by those. KELLY: Erica Orden of Politico. Her profile of Alvin Bragg is out now. Thank you. ORDEN: Thank you.

He worked largely under Preet Bharara, and he prosecuted a number of cases there. He did a lot of money laundering cases and a variety of other things. And he was - he worked for a number of years in the New York attorney general's office. And ultimately, he became the chief deputy attorney general in that office. KELLY: And among the cases he has prosecuted in the past, he's prosecuted the Trump Business Organization and the Trump Foundation, right? ORDEN: That's right. When he was in the New York attorney general's office, he supervised a lawsuit against the Trump Foundation that resulted in Trump personally paying a $2 million settlement. And earlier this year, while he was in the DA's office, his office won a criminal tax fraud trial against the Trump Organization. KELLY: OK. He is - when you read about him, he's often described as progressive. Some of his more progressive initiatives so far as DA in Manhattan have provided ammunition for Trump and his defenders. What has he done that his opponents have seized upon? ORDEN: Well, he had quite a bumpy start to his career in the district attorney's office. Two days after taking office - so January of last year - he issued a memo that directed assistant district attorneys to largely avoid prosecuting minor offenses. He told them to stop charging many low-level crimes and to avoid seeking jail time for many robbery, assault and gun possession cases in which no other crimes were committed. So there was a big sort of internal backlash to that directive. And there was also vocal criticism from a variety of outside sources, including the police commissioner, police unions and conservative media outlets. KELLY: Well, I want to drill down a little bit more on his politics. It's, of course, impossible to peer into anyone's minds, but you've talked to a lot of people who know him who doubt that he has any political ax to grind here. What did they tell you? ORDEN: Well, most people who have talked to him - you know, clearly he has progressive beliefs, and he has tried to institute those in the office. But most people who know him, who have known him for a long time and have worked for - and have worked with him or for him, believe that he really is not seeking any other higher office. In other words, his ambition is not to have a political career. He is obviously in elected office. And he got there by campaigning and going out on the campaign trail. But. KELLY: Sure. ORDEN: They don't believe that he is a political animal and that he is in pursuit of a political career... KELLY: In the few seconds... ORDEN: ...Other than being district attorney. KELLY: Forgive me. In the few seconds we have left, he will inevitably face attacks, political attacks, if he does bring this case. Do you get a sense that Alvin Bragg cares? ORDEN: Well, people who know him say that he's somewhat immune to the sort of public relations offenses that Donald Trump tends to enjoy bringing against his opponents. And, you know, he's a human being. I would imagine that he - you know, some level of criticism gets to anyone. But... KELLY: Right. ORDEN: In large part, people who know him say he won't be bothered too much by those. KELLY: Erica Orden of Politico. Her profile of Alvin Bragg is out now. Thank you. ORDEN: Thank you.

He told them to stop charging many low-level crimes and to avoid seeking jail time for many robbery, assault and gun possession cases in which no other crimes were committed. So there was a big sort of internal backlash to that directive. And there was also vocal criticism from a variety of outside sources, including the police commissioner, police unions and conservative media outlets. KELLY: Well, I want to drill down a little bit more on his politics. It's, of course, impossible to peer into anyone's minds, but you've talked to a lot of people who know him who doubt that he has any political ax to grind here. What did they tell you? ORDEN: Well, most people who have talked to him - you know, clearly he has progressive beliefs, and he has tried to institute those in the office. But most people who know him, who have known him for a long time and have worked for - and have worked with him or for him, believe that he really is not seeking any other higher office. In other words, his ambition is not to have a political career. He is obviously in elected office. And he got there by campaigning and going out on the campaign trail. But. KELLY: Sure. ORDEN: They don't believe that he is a political animal and that he is in pursuit of a political career... KELLY: In the few seconds... ORDEN: ...Other than being district attorney. KELLY: Forgive me. In the few seconds we have left, he will inevitably face attacks, political attacks, if he does bring this case. Do you get a sense that Alvin Bragg cares? ORDEN: Well, people who know him say that he's somewhat immune to the sort of public relations offenses that Donald Trump tends to enjoy bringing against his opponents. And, you know, he's a human being. I would imagine that he - you know, some level of criticism gets to anyone. But... KELLY: Right. ORDEN: In large part, people who know him say he won't be bothered too much by those. KELLY: Erica Orden of Politico. Her profile of Alvin Bragg is out now. Thank you. ORDEN: Thank you.

So his two sort of biggest things on his resume were that he was a assistant U.S. attorney in the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office. He worked largely under Preet Bharara, and he prosecuted a number of cases there. He did a lot of money laundering cases and a variety of other things. And he was - he worked for a number of years in the New York attorney general's office. And ultimately, he became the chief deputy attorney general in that office. KELLY: And among the cases he has prosecuted in the past, he's prosecuted the Trump Business Organization and the Trump Foundation, right? ORDEN: That's right. When he was in the New York attorney general's office, he supervised a lawsuit against the Trump Foundation that resulted in Trump personally paying a $2 million settlement. And earlier this year, while he was in the DA's office, his office won a criminal tax fraud trial against the Trump Organization. KELLY: OK. He is - when you read about him, he's often described as progressive. Some of his more progressive initiatives so far as DA in Manhattan have provided ammunition for Trump and his defenders.

But most people who know him, who have known him for a long time and have worked for - and have worked with him or for him, believe that he really is not seeking any other higher office. In other words, his ambition is not to have a political career. He is obviously in elected office. And he got there by campaigning and going out on the campaign trail. But. KELLY: Sure. ORDEN: They don't believe that he is a political animal and that he is in pursuit of a political career... KELLY: In the few seconds... ORDEN: ...Other than being district attorney. KELLY: Forgive me. In the few seconds we have left, he will inevitably face attacks, political attacks, if he does bring this case. Do you get a sense that Alvin Bragg cares? ORDEN: Well, people who know him say that he's somewhat immune to the sort of public relations offenses that Donald Trump tends to enjoy bringing against his opponents. And, you know, he's a human being. I would imagine that he - you know, some level of criticism gets to anyone. But... KELLY: Right.

      "text": "Alvin Bragg's former colleague explains the D.A.'s working style\n\nBy\n\nLinah Mohammad\n\n,\n\nJonaki Mehta\n\n,\n\nMary Louise Kelly\n\nDonald Trump is the first former president to be criminally indicted. Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg's former colleague Peter Skinner talks with NPR's Mary Louise Kelly about Bragg's working style.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: We are covering former President Donald Trump's arraignment on this program today. And as part of that coverage, we wanted to spend a moment learning about the man behind the indictment. That would be Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. He is an experienced prosecutor, from Harlem, a Democrat, the first Black person to serve as Manhattan DA. What else should we know about him? And what's his style as a prosecutor? Well, Peter Skinner worked with Bragg for several years in the Southern District of New York and spoke with me today before the arraignment began. So let's dive right in. I want to ask about a specific case that you prosecuted with Bragg. This was a money laundering case, and I gather it was complicated. This was back when you were both assistant U.S. attorneys in New York. Give me some detail on how he approached it. PETER SKINNER: Well, so Alvin and I were trial partners in the Southern District of New York where we used to work together. You typically tried cases as teams. You know, in those cases, you're working very closely with someone in a very kind of intense environment for weeks or months. So you get to know them fairly well. KELLY: Yeah. SKINNER: You want someone who's, first and foremost, capable and help you get the job done in the courtroom, but you also want someone who you're going to get along with. And, you know, Alvin checked those boxes. KELLY: I'm told there's a good story from this trial, a moment where the judge had told the jury, look. Go take a long lunch, and then everybody's going to come back and we'll do the charge conference, meaning where you finalize the jury. What happened? SKINNER: That's right. And this was a judge who didn't allow cellphones in the courtroom. So we got back to the conference room. Kind of the first thing everybody always did was look at their phone. My phone had a whole bunch of missed messages and voicemails from my wife that I started to listen to. She was telling me that the roof of our apartment had collapsed. KELLY: Oh, my God. SKINNER: She was home with our two young kids, one of them an infant. And it was torrentially raining out. So rain had somehow collapsed the roof. And, you know, she needed me to come home right away, obviously. And I was kind of looking around in the trial room, you know, panicked because I was the one who was supposed to handle the charge in front of the judge that afternoon. I'd written the charge, and, you know, I was supposed to take the lead on it. And Alvin obviously knew the charge, was familiar with it, but it just wasn't what he was prepared to do. But he didn't hesitate. He was immediately like, you have to go home. You have to be with your family. Take care of this. I will cover the charge. It's not a problem. And he did. You know, he went in alone. He handled the charge. He did it well. And, you know, this was kind of no small thing. I mean, I think a lot of other people in that situation would have said, well, you know, let's get you home as quick as we can after you handle the charge. But, you know, Alvin didn't hesitate. And I think that, you know, it's kind of a good story that describes how he approaches things. You know, he's decisive. He's clear-eyed in a difficult situation. KELLY: Did you all win this money laundering case? SKINNER: We did. We did. We won. We won the trial. KELLY: Congratulations. I wonder how we apply all this to this current moment. Because whatever the outcome, Alvin Bragg is making history; as we keep noting, the first criminal indictment of a former president of the United States. Is this a guy you would have pegged to put himself in the middle of something so big? SKINNER: Certainly not intentionally, but I am happy that he is one there making these decisions. I think that the man that I know would be very careful and deliberate in making these decisions, would do them for the right reasons. KELLY: You have since moved on. You've gone into private practice. So I know it's been a few years since you've worked with him, but have you tracked his career enough to gauge whether things he has gone on to do have prepared him for this moment? I mean, it's an unprecedented situation. So nobody has direct experience. But does he bring the correct background to this? SKINNER: Yeah, I think he does. I mean, he has worked for most of his career in a variety of different prosecutorial positions. He's led multiple different prosecuting offices. He's worked as a defense lawyer earlier in his career, which I think is also an important part of being an effective prosecutor, being able to appreciate the perspective of the defense. So I really think that he does have the necessary background to try and make these important decisions. KELLY: If you were double-teaming this along with him again, any advice you'd give him? SKINNER: Just do the right thing, right? I mean, at the end of the day, all you can really do is show up, be prepared, do the best you can on a daily basis and try to make sure that you're doing the right thing. KELLY: Peter Skinner. He is now at a law firm, Morrison Foerster. He's the former colleague of Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg. Thanks so much. SKINNER: Thanks so much for having me. Copyright © 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I mean, at the end of the day, all you can really do is show up, be prepared, do the best you can on a daily basis and try to make sure that you're doing the right thing. KELLY: Peter Skinner. He is now at a law firm, Morrison Foerster. He's the former colleague of Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg. Thanks so much. SKINNER: Thanks so much for having me. Copyright © 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nWe are covering former President Donald Trump's arraignment on this program today. And as part of that coverage, we wanted to spend a moment learning about the man behind the indictment. That would be Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. He is an experienced prosecutor, from Harlem, a Democrat, the first Black person to serve as Manhattan DA. What else should we know about him? And what's his style as a prosecutor? Well, Peter Skinner worked with Bragg for several years in the Southern District of New York and spoke with me today before the arraignment began. So let's dive right in. I want to ask about a specific case that you prosecuted with Bragg. This was a money laundering case, and I gather it was complicated. This was back when you were both assistant U.S. attorneys in New York. Give me some detail on how he approached it. PETER SKINNER: Well, so Alvin and I were trial partners in the Southern District of New York where we used to work together. You typically tried cases as teams. You know, in those cases, you're working very closely with someone in a very kind of intense environment for weeks or months. So you get to know them fairly well. KELLY: Yeah. SKINNER: You want someone who's, first and foremost, capable and help you get the job done in the courtroom, but you also want someone who you're going to get along with. And, you know, Alvin checked those boxes. KELLY: I'm told there's a good story from this trial, a moment where the judge had told the jury, look. Go take a long lunch, and then everybody's going to come back and we'll do the charge conference, meaning where you finalize the jury. What happened? SKINNER: That's right. And this was a judge who didn't allow cellphones in the courtroom. So we got back to the conference room. Kind of the first thing everybody always did was look at their phone. My phone had a whole bunch of missed messages and voicemails from my wife that I started to listen to. She was telling me that the roof of our apartment had collapsed. KELLY: Oh, my God. SKINNER: She was home with our two young kids, one of them an infant. And it was torrentially raining out. So rain had somehow collapsed the roof. And, you know, she needed me to come home right away, obviously. And I was kind of looking around in the trial room, you know, panicked because I was the one who was supposed to handle the charge in front of the judge that afternoon. I'd written the charge, and, you know, I was supposed to take the lead on it. And Alvin obviously knew the charge, was familiar with it, but it just wasn't what he was prepared to do. But he didn't hesitate. He was immediately like, you have to go home. You have to be with your family. Take care of this. I will cover the charge. It's not a problem. And he did. You know, he went in alone. He handled the charge. He did it well. And, you know, this was kind of no small thing. I mean, I think a lot of other people in that situation would have said, well, you know, let's get you home as quick as we can after you handle the charge. But, you know, Alvin didn't hesitate. And I think that, you know, it's kind of a good story that describes how he approaches things. You know, he's decisive. He's clear-eyed in a difficult situation. KELLY: Did you all win this money laundering case? SKINNER: We did. We did. We won. We won the trial. KELLY: Congratulations. I wonder how we apply all this to this current moment. Because whatever the outcome, Alvin Bragg is making history; as we keep noting, the first criminal indictment of a former president of the United States. Is this a guy you would have pegged to put himself in the middle of something so big? SKINNER: Certainly not intentionally, but I am happy that he is one there making these decisions. I think that the man that I know would be very careful and deliberate in making these decisions, would do them for the right reasons. KELLY: You have since moved on. You've gone into private practice. So I know it's been a few years since you've worked with him, but have you tracked his career enough to gauge whether things he has gone on to do have prepared him for this moment? I mean, it's an unprecedented situation. So nobody has direct experience. But does he bring the correct background to this? SKINNER: Yeah, I think he does. I mean, he has worked for most of his career in a variety of different prosecutorial positions. He's led multiple different prosecuting offices. He's worked as a defense lawyer earlier in his career, which I think is also an important part of being an effective prosecutor, being able to appreciate the perspective of the defense. So I really think that he does have the necessary background to try and make these important decisions. KELLY: If you were double-teaming this along with him again, any advice you'd give him? SKINNER: Just do the right thing, right? I mean, at the end of the day, all you can really do is show up, be prepared, do the best you can on a daily basis and try to make sure that you're doing the right thing. KELLY: Peter Skinner.

You know, he went in alone. He handled the charge. He did it well. And, you know, this was kind of no small thing. I mean, I think a lot of other people in that situation would have said, well, you know, let's get you home as quick as we can after you handle the charge. But, you know, Alvin didn't hesitate. And I think that, you know, it's kind of a good story that describes how he approaches things. You know, he's decisive. He's clear-eyed in a difficult situation. KELLY: Did you all win this money laundering case? SKINNER: We did. We did. We won. We won the trial. KELLY: Congratulations. I wonder how we apply all this to this current moment. Because whatever the outcome, Alvin Bragg is making history; as we keep noting, the first criminal indictment of a former president of the United States. Is this a guy you would have pegged to put himself in the middle of something so big? SKINNER: Certainly not intentionally, but I am happy that he is one there making these decisions. I think that the man that I know would be very careful and deliberate in making these decisions, would do them for the right reasons. KELLY: You have since moved on. You've gone into private practice. So I know it's been a few years since you've worked with him, but have you tracked his career enough to gauge whether things he has gone on to do have prepared him for this moment? I mean, it's an unprecedented situation. So nobody has direct experience. But does he bring the correct background to this? SKINNER: Yeah, I think he does. I mean, he has worked for most of his career in a variety of different prosecutorial positions. He's led multiple different prosecuting offices. He's worked as a defense lawyer earlier in his career, which I think is also an important part of being an effective prosecutor, being able to appreciate the perspective of the defense. So I really think that he does have the necessary background to try and make these important decisions. KELLY: If you were double-teaming this along with him again, any advice you'd give him? SKINNER: Just do the right thing, right? I mean, at the end of the day, all you can really do is show up, be prepared, do the best you can on a daily basis and try to make sure that you're doing the right thing. KELLY: Peter Skinner. He is now at a law firm, Morrison Foerster. He's the former colleague of Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg. Thanks so much. SKINNER: Thanks so much for having me. Copyright © 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

SKINNER: You want someone who's, first and foremost, capable and help you get the job done in the courtroom, but you also want someone who you're going to get along with. And, you know, Alvin checked those boxes. KELLY: I'm told there's a good story from this trial, a moment where the judge had told the jury, look. Go take a long lunch, and then everybody's going to come back and we'll do the charge conference, meaning where you finalize the jury. What happened? SKINNER: That's right. And this was a judge who didn't allow cellphones in the courtroom. So we got back to the conference room. Kind of the first thing everybody always did was look at their phone. My phone had a whole bunch of missed messages and voicemails from my wife that I started to listen to. She was telling me that the roof of our apartment had collapsed. KELLY: Oh, my God. SKINNER: She was home with our two young kids, one of them an infant. And it was torrentially raining out. So rain had somehow collapsed the roof. And, you know, she needed me to come home right away, obviously. And I was kind of looking around in the trial room, you know, panicked because I was the one who was supposed to handle the charge in front of the judge that afternoon. I'd written the charge, and, you know, I was supposed to take the lead on it. And Alvin obviously knew the charge, was familiar with it, but it just wasn't what he was prepared to do.

And I was kind of looking around in the trial room, you know, panicked because I was the one who was supposed to handle the charge in front of the judge that afternoon. I'd written the charge, and, you know, I was supposed to take the lead on it. And Alvin obviously knew the charge, was familiar with it, but it just wasn't what he was prepared to do. But he didn't hesitate. He was immediately like, you have to go home. You have to be with your family. Take care of this. I will cover the charge. It's not a problem. And he did. You know, he went in alone. He handled the charge. He did it well. And, you know, this was kind of no small thing. I mean, I think a lot of other people in that situation would have said, well, you know, let's get you home as quick as we can after you handle the charge. But, you know, Alvin didn't hesitate. And I think that, you know, it's kind of a good story that describes how he approaches things. You know, he's decisive. He's clear-eyed in a difficult situation. KELLY: Did you all win this money laundering case? SKINNER: We did. We did. We won. We won the trial. KELLY: Congratulations. I wonder how we apply all this to this current moment. Because whatever the outcome, Alvin Bragg is making history; as we keep noting, the first criminal indictment of a former president of the United States. Is this a guy you would have pegged to put himself in the middle of something so big? SKINNER: Certainly not intentionally, but I am happy that he is one there making these decisions. I think that the man that I know would be very careful and deliberate in making these decisions, would do them for the right reasons. KELLY: You have since moved on. You've gone into private practice. So I know it's been a few years since you've worked with him, but have you tracked his career enough to gauge whether things he has gone on to do have prepared him for this moment? I mean, it's an unprecedented situation. So nobody has direct experience. But does he bring the correct background to this? SKINNER: Yeah, I think he does. I mean, he has worked for most of his career in a variety of different prosecutorial positions. He's led multiple different prosecuting offices. He's worked as a defense lawyer earlier in his career, which I think is also an important part of being an effective prosecutor, being able to appreciate the perspective of the defense. So I really think that he does have the necessary background to try and make these important decisions. KELLY: If you were double-teaming this along with him again, any advice you'd give him? SKINNER: Just do the right thing, right? I mean, at the end of the day, all you can really do is show up, be prepared, do the best you can on a daily basis and try to make sure that you're doing the right thing. KELLY: Peter Skinner. He is now at a law firm, Morrison Foerster. He's the former colleague of Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg. Thanks so much. SKINNER: Thanks so much for having me. Copyright © 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

So I know it's been a few years since you've worked with him, but have you tracked his career enough to gauge whether things he has gone on to do have prepared him for this moment? I mean, it's an unprecedented situation. So nobody has direct experience. But does he bring the correct background to this? SKINNER: Yeah, I think he does. I mean, he has worked for most of his career in a variety of different prosecutorial positions. He's led multiple different prosecuting offices. He's worked as a defense lawyer earlier in his career, which I think is also an important part of being an effective prosecutor, being able to appreciate the perspective of the defense. So I really think that he does have the necessary background to try and make these important decisions. KELLY: If you were double-teaming this along with him again, any advice you'd give him? SKINNER: Just do the right thing, right? I mean, at the end of the day, all you can really do is show up, be prepared, do the best you can on a daily basis and try to make sure that you're doing the right thing. KELLY: Peter Skinner. He is now at a law firm, Morrison Foerster. He's the former colleague of Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg. Thanks so much. SKINNER: Thanks so much for having me. Copyright © 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It's in his New York criminal trial\n\nXimena Bustillo\n\nA New York judge is set to decide whether President-elect Donald Trump has immunity from prosecution in his criminal trial, after he was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST: President-elect Donald Trump is hoping for one more victory today. It's in his New York criminal trial, where he was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. A judge is set to decide whether Trump is immune from prosecution. NPR's Ximena Bustillo has more. XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Trump made history earlier this year by becoming the first sitting or former president to be convicted in a criminal trial. And Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg thanked the jurors. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALVIN BRAGG: The 12 everyday jurors vowed to make a decision based on the evidence and the law, and the evidence and the law alone. BUSTILLO: But closing the loop on this trial has not been easy. Trump has been rescheduled for a sentencing twice, and then the U.S. Supreme Court decided presidents have immunity from prosecution for official acts taken in office. Now Trump's legal team argues that rule applies to evidence in his New York state trial. Will Thomas, assistant professor of business law at the University of Michigan, says the new ruling suggests some evidence needs to be reconsidered. WILL THOMAS: It's difficult to imagine writing a decision saying that what happened at trial complied with U.S. constitutional law on this issue, in part because the court didn't know what the law was at the time. So how could it possibly comply? BUSTILLO: Trump's legal team is challenging evidence brought into trial from when he was in the White House, such as social media posts and testimony from employees. THOMAS: It's important to understand Trump is still very much in his sort of initial trial and conviction stage. Until he's sentenced, this case is still live. BUSTILLO: New York Judge Juan Merchan is expected to release his decision today that will either open or close the door to a sentencing later this month. Either way, Trump would be unlikely to face prison time. This is his first and a nonviolent criminal offense. Ximena Bustillo, NPR News, New York. Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

WILL THOMAS: It's difficult to imagine writing a decision saying that what happened at trial complied with U.S. constitutional law on this issue, in part because the court didn't know what the law was at the time. So how could it possibly comply? BUSTILLO: Trump's legal team is challenging evidence brought into trial from when he was in the White House, such as social media posts and testimony from employees. THOMAS: It's important to understand Trump is still very much in his sort of initial trial and conviction stage. Until he's sentenced, this case is still live. BUSTILLO: New York Judge Juan Merchan is expected to release his decision today that will either open or close the door to a sentencing later this month. Either way, Trump would be unlikely to face prison time. This is his first and a nonviolent criminal offense. Ximena Bustillo, NPR News, New York. Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

      "text": "New Legal Filing Reveals Startling Details of Possible Fraud by Trump Organization\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nUpdate, Sept. 21, 2022: On Wednesday, New York State Attorney General Letitia James filed a 222-page lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, his business and three of his children, alleging they took part in a scheme that \"grossly inflated\" Trump's personal net worth by billions of dollars by overstating the value of his real estate holdings. A Trump Organization representative and an attorney for Trump said the lawsuit by James, a Democrat, was politically motivated. An attorney for Trump's children could not be immediately reached.\n\nA new legal filing by New York's attorney general this week accused former President Donald Trump's company of misleading lenders about the financial health of its landmark downtown Manhattan skyscraper, 40 Wall Street, while seeking to renew the building's mortgage.\n\nThough the Trump Organization called 40 Wall Street \"one of the great success stories post 2008,\" lender Capital One found the company's estimates of the building's worth so unbelievable that the bank declined to refinance the tower's loan in 2015, the filing alleges.\n\n\"Capital One harbored great skepticism regarding the Trump Organization's valuations,\" says the filing, which was submitted by Attorney General Letitia James in response to Trump's efforts to block her from questioning him and his children as part of an ongoing investigation by her office.\n\nThe new accusations offer startling details about possible financial fraud involving 40 Wall Street - one of the subjects of a 2019 ProPublica story that highlighted conflicting financial documents the Trump Organization had filed for the building.\n\nProPublica's story documented how income, expense and occupancy numbers cited in the eventual refinance for 40 Wall Street and another Manhattan building sometimes didn't match those the company had filed with city tax authorities. A lower valuation for the city would produce a lower tax bill, while a higher valuation for lenders would make it easier to get a new mortgage.\n\nOne expert said it appeared like the Trump Organization was keeping \"two sets of books.\"\n\n\"It feels like a set of books for the tax guy and a set for the lender,\" said Kevin Riordan, a financing expert and real estate professor at Montclair State University, at the time.\n\nIn her filing, James asserts that Trump Organization employees, including Trump's children, took part in a pattern of deception in which they misled lenders, insurers and the Internal Revenue Service by vastly overstating values for 40 Wall Street and a host of other Trump properties, including golf courses in Scotland, Los Angeles and Westchester and his buildings on Fifth and Park avenues.\n\nThe Trump Organization on Thursday lashed out at James, a Democrat, via a statement emailed by a spokesperson, saying, \"The only one misleading the public is Letitia James.\n\n\"She defrauded New Yorkers by basing her entire candidacy on a promise to get Trump at all costs without having seen a shred of evidence and in violation of every conceivable ethical rule,\" the organization's statement said. It asserted that James \"has no case\" and that the \"allegations are baseless and will be vigorously defended.\"\n\nAlan Futerfas, a lawyer for Trump's children Donald Jr. and Ivanka Trump, also criticized James, accusing her of making \"repeated threats to target the Trump family\" and ignoring legal protections for \"the very people she is investigating.\"\n\nJames is seeking to compel testimony and obtain documents from Trump, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, who she said have not cooperated with her investigation.\n\nThe filing says that property valuations formed the heart of statements of financial condition that the Trump Organization used to demonstrate its net worth. The statements, which James said contained inaccuracies, were compiled by an outside accounting agency from a data spreadsheet and backup material provided by the Trump Organization.\n\nTrump's personal guarantees to some banks and insurers required him to certify that his financial statements were correct, according to James' filing. The documents say her office has evidence Trump was \"personally involved in reviewing and approving\" the statements.\n\nIf the company or its employees are found to have deliberately provided misleading valuations, they could face civil or criminal penalties. The company is under investigation by both James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nWith its classic Gothic Revival style and signature green spire, 40 Wall Street gave Trump a presence in the most famous financial district in the world. His company doesn't own it, but rather purchased in 1995 the right to act as the landlord for its office and retail space. Finding tenants for that space, however, particularly in the building's narrow tower, proved a challenge, especially after 9/11, when occupancy sagged and the entire financial district struggled, the ProPublica investigation found.\n\nJames' filing says that as early as 2009, Capital One, which held the mortgage on the property, \"raised substantial concerns about cash flow\" at 40 Wall Street, prompting in-person meetings with Trump, longtime Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and others. Donald Trump Jr. was also involved in the discussions, the filing says.\n\nThe conversations led to a loan modification in 2010, with bank personnel harboring doubts about the Trump Organization's representations of the building's financial standing. During those discussions, the Trump Organization provided the bank with profit numbers for 2010 of $12.3 million, which bank personnel described as \"very optimistic.\"\n\nMore startling were the differences between valuations that appeared on Trump's statements of financial condition and those prepared by appraisers for Capital One. The Trump Organization set the value of the building at $601.8 million in 2010, while the appraisals for Capital One done by Cushman & Wakefield set it at just less than one-third of that, $200 million.\n\nWeisselberg shared one of the company's higher valuations for the building with the bank in early 2015, boasting of \"considerable capital investment\" and \"a much improved cash flow.\" He wanted Capital One to restructure its loan and waive a principal payment of $5 million due in November.\n\nBut Capital One declined to refinance the mortgage, referencing its own internal estimate that the building was only worth $257 million a few months before.\n\nThat year, 40 Wall Street's $160 million mortgage was a thorn in Trump's side, representing his then-largest single debt as he launched his campaign for the presidency.\n\nAfter Capital One's rejection, the Trump Organization turned to Ladder Capital Finance, where Weisselberg's son Jack was a director. Ladder commissioned its own appraisal. Though Ladder used the same Cushman & Wakefield team that had estimated the building was worth $220 million in 2012, the team this time more than doubled the value to $540 million, legal filings said. Ladder approved the refinance.\n\nJames' filing said that evidence her office obtained suggests the 2015 Cushman valuation \"appears to have used demonstrably incorrect facts and aggressive assumptions\" to arrive at the higher estimate, which the document said \"did not reflect a good faith assessment of value.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Cushman & Wakefield defended its practices, saying it took \"great issue with mischaracterizations concerning the work performed and believe they are not supported by the evidence.\n\n\"The referenced Cushman & Wakefield appraisals were undertaken and completed in good faith based upon the material information made available,\" the company said in a statement emailed by a spokesperson. \"We stand behind the appraisers and the referenced appraisals which reflect fair valuations based upon the underlying facts and market dynamics.\"\n\nRead More\n\nIn 2015, the Trump Organization's statement of financial condition listed the value of the building as $735.4 million.\n\nLadder Capital and Capital One did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday. Allen Weisselberg and Jack Weisselberg could not immediately be reached.\n\nProPublica's 2019 story found several instances of the Trump Organization reporting much lower expenses to its lender, Ladder Capital, than to city tax authorities - including 40 Wall Street's insurance costs and ground lease. Jack Weisselberg declined to comment at the time on Ladder's loans or his relationship with the Trump Organization. Executives with Ladder also declined to be quoted for the story then.\n\nIn 2019, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen testified before Congress that the Trump Organization inflated valuations at times to appear more profitable and deflated them to achieve a lower real estate tax bill.\n\nClarification, Jan. 21, 2022: This story was updated to clarify the timing of Capital One's internal estimate of 40 Wall Street's worth.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI cover commercial space companies and the federal agencies that work with and regulate them, like the Federal Aviation Administration and NASA.\n\nI'm interested in hearing from former and current employees of rocket companies like SpaceX and other space-related businesses.

      "text": "Leading Manhattan DA Candidate Has Repeatedly Paid Virtually No Federal Income Taxes\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. The Secret IRS Files is an ongoing reporting project. Sign up to be notified when the next story publishes. Or text \"IRS\" to 917-746-1447 to get the next story texted to you (standard messaging rates apply).\n\nAlso: Do you have expertise in tax law, accounting or wealth management? We'd love to hear from you.\n\nThe leading candidate to take over the investigation relating to former President Donald Trump's taxes paid virtually no federal income taxes in four of six recent years.\n\nTali Farhadian Weinstein, who is married to hedge fund manager Boaz Weinstein, is running for Manhattan district attorney in the Democratic primary, in which early voting has already begun. She and her husband reported income as high as $107 million in 2011, and she recently donated $8.2 million to her campaign - more than her seven Democratic rivals have raised in total.\n\nBut in 2017, according to a trove of tax data obtained by ProPublica, she and her husband paid no federal income tax. In 2015 and 2013, they also paid no federal income tax. In 2014, she and her husband paid $6,584.\n\nFarhadian Weinstein provided a statement in response to questions from ProPublica: \"In 6 of the last 11 years (the years in which we had income), we paid more than 50% of our income in Federal, State and New York City taxes. In the other years, we earned no net income and, as a result, did not pay income tax. We both benefited from many opportunities in this city and country and are glad to pay taxes at among the very highest tax rates in the entire country.\" (The IRS records obtained by ProPublica show that from 2010 to 2018, the couple paid 25.9% overall in federal income tax on the money they made during the seven years when they had positive adjusted gross income, which the IRS defines as earnings minus certain items like alimony. On average, the couple paid 12.6% annually from 2010 to 2018. During that time, the top federal marginal tax rate fluctuated between 35% and 39.6%. These figures don't count state and local taxes, which typically are significantly less than federal taxes.)\n\nIn two of the years in which the Weinsteins paid no federal income taxes, they reported negative income, losses that appear to be driven by the volatile performance of Boaz Weinstein's hedge fund. They also claimed and received a refundable tax credit - a total of $5,000 over those two years - designed to help middle- and lower-income families with the costs of raising children.\n\nIn the other two years in which they paid little or no federal income taxes, they reported adjusted gross income of about a million dollars each year. They were able to reduce their income tax bill in those years by using a variety of deductions.\n\nThere's no indication the Weinsteins did anything illegal.\n\nThe Weinsteins are among thousands of wealthy people whose tax return data ProPublica has obtained. Last week, ProPublica published its first article using the IRS data, which revealed that the 25 richest Americans paid little or no federal income taxes compared to their immense gains in wealth in recent years. This story was not on our initial list of coverage of the IRS data but a ProPublica reporter came across Farhadian Weinstein's information as part of his ongoing research. With the primary election a week away and the outsized spending by Farhadian Weinstein continuing to draw attention , ProPublica concluded the public interest would be served by letting voters and other taxpayers see her tax history.\n\nShe is vying to lead one of the most prestigious prosecutorial offices in the country. If Farhadian Weinstein wins the Democratic primary, she is virtually guaranteed to win the general election later in the year since Democrats dominate the borough. She would take over the office at a pivotal time: Violent crime in New York City is rising , and the office is widely reported to be in the advanced stages of an investigation into the taxes and finances surrounding Trump and his company.\n\nFarhadian Weinstein has made fairness a central principle of her campaign. As she has put it on her campaign website , \"Tali believes in a DA's office that is ethical, fair, and advances equity for all New Yorkers.\" She has presented herself as a centrist in a progressive Democratic field. A former federal prosecutor and general counsel for the Brooklyn DA's office, she has picked up a string of high-profile endorsements, including from former Attorney General Eric Holder, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, the New York Daily News and the New York Post.\n\nFarhadian Weinstein has received hundreds of thousands in donations from wealthy financiers, including contributions from Citadel's Ken Griffin, PointState Capital's Zach Schreiber and Pershing Square founder William Ackman. That has prompted criticism that she will be soft on white-collar crime as the DA in the nation's financial capital. She has said those donations will not influence her.\n\nFarhadian Weinstein has raised $12.8 million in all (including the $8.2 million she contributed herself), towering over the next closest competitors, Alvin Bragg at $2.3 million and Lucy Lang at $1.6 million.\n\nBoaz Weinstein founded Saba Capital Management. The firm reportedly once managed more than $5 billion, but it has performed unevenly in the past decade.\n\nIn two of the years that the Weinsteins paid zero federal income tax, 2017 and 2015, their returns show millions in business losses. In those years, the couple reported a net negative income.\n\nRead More\n\nBut they avoided virtually all federal income taxes even in two of the years in which they made money. In 2014, their adjusted gross income was almost a million dollars. That year, the couple's deduction for investment interest expense skyrocketed to just under a million dollars, essentially wiping out their taxable income for the year. The tax code allows investors to take a deduction for interest paid on money they borrow to invest. That effectively allows their risk-taking to be subsidized by other taxpayers.\n\nIn 2013, the couple reported $1.5 million in adjusted gross income and still paid no federal income tax. That year, the couple reported a deduction of more than $1 million for \"miscellaneous expenses\" - a catchall deduction, since eliminated, that can include expenses for tax and investment advice and some legal expenses. (The tax records obtained by ProPublica did not enumerate the specifics of those expenses, and Farhadian Weinstein declined to answer questions about them.)\n\nIf Farhadian Weinstein ultimately is elected, the status of her most high-profile potential case - the Trump investigation - is unclear. There have been no charges filed, and there may never be. According to The New York Times , investigators have focused on potential financial crimes such as tax and bank fraud, including whether one or more employees of the Trump Organization received certain benefits from the company without paying taxes on them and whether the company possibly lowered the value of properties to pay less in taxes and inflated their value to secure loans.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nAlabama is the only state where people with multiple felony convictions are required to register with law enforcement and carry special ID cards, legal experts say. When felons are caught without them, they can be arrested and fined or jailed.\n\nby Connor Sheets , AL.com\n\nThis article was produced in partnership with AL.com , which was a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network in 2019.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nWhen a sheriff's deputy pulled Emmanuel Pullom over on a suburban street near Birmingham, Alabama, the night of Dec. 1, 2018, he suspected that Pullom had stolen the black Ford pickup he was driving.\n\nThe deputy handcuffed Pullom, searched the truck and then took him to the Jefferson County Jail in downtown Birmingham, according to the incident report.\n\nBut Pullom wasn't charged with stealing the truck, which he says he had recently purchased from a friend. Instead, he was charged with failing to possess a piece of laminated paper that identified him as a felon.\n\n\"The cop said, 'Where's your felon card?'\" Pullom recalled in an interview last month. \"I said, 'What kind of card?' He said, 'If you've got three felonies, you've got to get a felon card.'\"\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nMore than 300 people in Alabama have been charged since 2014 under a little-known, but long-standing state law requiring people with more than two felony convictions to register with their local sheriff's offices and carry cards identifying them as repeat felons, according to arrest data analyzed by AL.com and ProPublica.\n\nViolations carry the threat of jail time and fines. A man in north Alabama served a one-year sentence for failing to register as a felon and obtain a felon registration card.\n\nWhile some other states have felon registration requirements, criminal law professors said they believe Alabama is the only one with a law requiring registration cards.\n\nLegal experts say the law is likely unconstitutional and reminiscent of slavery-era restrictions that required black people in many parts of the South to present identification to white people on demand.\n\n\"The card is reminiscent of the cards Jews were forced to carry in the ghettos,\" John H. Blume, a criminal law professor at Cornell Law School, said via email.\n\n\"It will also give police the ability to stop people they know are felons to see if they have their cards and ... to avoid things like reasonable suspicion and probable cause.\"\n\nThe Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, which arrested Pullom, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMobile County Sheriff Sam Cochran, the top law enforcement official in Alabama's second-largest county, defended the requirement. He said the charge \"gives you a good stepping stone\" for jailing someone suspected of other crimes, when there otherwise isn't enough evidence to make an arrest.\n\n\"This guy's a five-time felon or something,\" Cochran said in an interview. \"And you say, 'Hey, where's your convicted felon thing?' And he says, 'Well, I don't have one.' You say, 'Well, hey, bud, I [didn't] have nothing to arrest you on, but now I do.'\"\n\n\"'So now I'm gonna arrest you, now I'm gonna inventory your car and tow it in. And if I found 5 pounds of pot in your car, then you're gonna be arrested for trafficking marijuana.'\"\n\nRepeat felon Derrick Rhodes has a different take. In 2016, he was arrested in Henry County and charged with failing to possess a felon ID card. Rhodes, 41, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 days of suspended confinement and two years of probation and ordered to pay hundreds of dollars of fees, fines and court costs. He has since obtained a felon registration card that he carries everywhere he goes\n\n\"What's the use of having a card on you when you're a free man?\" he said. \"I'm not their prisoner no more.\"\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, jurisdictions across the U.S. instituted so-called criminal registration laws in response to rising concerns about organized crime and other illegal activity.\n\nIn 1935, Birmingham became an early adopter of such restrictions when it passed a city ordinance requiring that felons register with law enforcement \"upon their arrival in the city,\" The New York Times reported at the time.\n\n\"Police officials hope that the law will give them an accurate check upon the criminal element. ... It also is expected that it will result in an exodus of a great many known criminals.\"\n\nMany such laws and ordinances have since been invalidated or repealed, but the federal government and individual states have instituted a series of increasingly restrictive sex offender registry laws since the 1980s. And many states and localities across the U.S. have approved narrower registration laws that apply to people convicted of specific crimes, such as arson, serious drug crimes and gun violence.\n\nFlorida, Mississippi and Nevada have felon registration requirements, but they do not require felons to have or carry registration cards, sometimes referred to as \"ex-felon cards.\" In fact, Nevada law specifically bars such requirements: \"The sheriff of a county or the chief of police of a city shall not require a convicted person to carry a registration card.\"\n\nIn 1966, a special session of the Alabama Legislature approved the Alabama Felon Registration Act, which instituted the statewide felon registration requirements that remain in place today.\n\nLawmakers passed the legislation \"to aid the law enforcement agencies in detecting and preventing and reducing recidivistic behavior,\" according to an article about the law published in the 1966-67 edition of the Alabama Law Review.\n\nThe law requires that anyone who \"resides\" in Alabama and \"has been convicted more than twice of a felony\" anywhere in the U.S. must \"register within 24 hours after his arrival in the county\" and obtain a registration card from the sheriff's office.\n\n\"It shall be the duty of such person to carry the card with him at all times while he is within the county and to exhibit the same to any officer of a municipality, a county or the state upon request.\"\n\nThe maximum penalty for failing to obey the felon registration law is 30 days in jail and a $50 fine per day spent in violation, which can add up to lengthy and expensive sentences over time.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, there have been 235 arrests in Alabama on state charges of not having a felon ID card and 53 arrests for the separate charge of failure to register with the local sheriff. Police also made nine arrests of felons who failed to notify the local sheriff of a change of address. Individual law enforcement agencies across the state have reported dozens more arrests on the charges in 2019 and this year.\n\nOf those arrested on the charges between 2014 and 2018, about 61% were white and 38% were black, according to the state data. As of July 2019, the U.S. Census estimated that 69% of Alabama residents were white and 27% were black.\n\nSuch arrests are made in large urban counties like Jefferson, Montgomery and Baldwin, as well as in more rural counties like Franklin in Alabama's northwest corner and Henry in the southeast.\n\nPublic records show that some local jurisdictions in Alabama have additional requirements. Arrest reports show that people have been charged in recent years in Alabama towns including Gadsden and Dothan with violating local ordinances requiring felon registration and identification.\n\nA limited number of places outside Alabama, such as Zanesville, Ohio, and the Borough of Berlin, New Jersey, also have felon identification laws or ordinances on their books.\n\nSometimes people serve serious time for failing to carry their felon IDs.\n\nQuincy Tisdale says that at the time of his arrest in August 2014, he was \"the only black man living on Sand Mountain,\" a low ridge in north Alabama. \"So I stuck out like a sore thumb.\" He was also dating a white woman, a fact that he says drew the ire of some white residents of the largely rural area, which has a long history of racial tension.\n\nSo the 38-year-old father of three says he was regularly pulled over and searched by Marshall County sheriff's deputies and local police officers, but they never had cause to arrest him.\n\nOne morning a Marshall County sheriff's deputy stopped Tisdale in his silver Kia sedan as he drove through the small town of Grant and informed him that he had found a reason to lock him up.\n\n\"When he pulled me over, he said, 'Didn't I tell you I was gonna get your black ass one day?'\" Tisdale recalled during a January interview in the living room of the friend's home in Scottsboro, where he is currently staying.\n\n\"He said: 'I know you don't got your felon ID card. Come on, get out of the car.' ... When they arrested me that day, that's the first I heard I had to have a felony card or I'd go to jail.\"\n\nTisdale, who had previous felony convictions for crimes including burglary, theft and assault, was arrested and booked into the Marshall County Jail and charged with failure to register with the sheriff's office and failure to possess an ex-felon card. It is the only time Tisdale has been arrested in the county, according to state court records. His bond was set at $1,500, court records show.\n\nTisdale pleaded guilty to the charges in October 2014 and was sentenced to 365 days in the Marshall County Community Corrections work release program - a residential jail alternative in which inmates earn money to pay down fines, fees and restitution by working for contracted companies. Tisdale says that while he was at the work release, he worked long hours deboning and loading chickens at a poultry processing plant.\n\nIn February 2015, after breaking the rules of the community corrections facility and getting into an argument with an employee, Tisdale was moved to the Marshall County Jail, where he served out the remainder of his sentence, court records show. He says that the punishment upended his life.\n\n\"When you take me away from my family, and I'm supporting my family, you're pushing them out onto the streets,\" he said.\n\nMarshall County Sheriff Phil Sims, who became sheriff in January 2019, said his office does not \"actively\" seek out people violating the state's felon registration and identification law.\n\n\"It's not one of those things where we're going out banging on doors or I've got someone assigned to look for people who haven't registered,\" he said. \"It would generally be a secondary charge where there's some other type of law enforcement contact like a domestic violence call or something.\"\n\nBut he said that the law serves a valuable purpose, \"kind of like the sex offender registry,\" and that he would enforce it if his office were notified that someone in Marshall County had failed to register as a felon or obtain a registration card. Neither Sims' predecessor, J. Scott Walls, who was sheriff at the time of Tisdale's arrest, nor Walls' attorney responded to requests for comment.\n\nTisdale says it's an indignity to be forced to carry a felon ID card for the rest of his life: \"It reminds me I'm a criminal, day in and day out.\"\n\nLike each of the criminal law professors interviewed for this story, Pullom said he never knew that Alabama required people with more than two felony convictions to carry registration cards.\n\nHe said that he only found out about the requirement when he was arrested for violating it, and that he believes the charge was little more than a pretense to apprehend him.\n\n\"Did I have drugs on me? Did I do anything wrong? No,\" said Pullom, who has been convicted of several felonies including shooting a gun into an occupied building, drug possession and theft. \"They were just trying to come up with something to arrest me for.\"\n\nIn fact, the arresting deputy wrote in the incident report that the felon ID card charge would allow the sheriff's office to hold Pullom in jail and \"follow up with a property crimes detective ... on any other charges.\" The felon ID charge was dismissed two months after his arrest and no additional charges were filed.\n\nLynneice Washington, district attorney for Jefferson County's Bessemer Division, said that \"you're marking a person\" by requiring them to carry a felon registration card. She added that she does not recall having ever heard of felon registration or ID charges being brought in her division, which is a subsection of the county that does not include Adamsville, where Pullom was arrested.\n\n\"Just to stop a person because you know them and know their history and to ask them if they have a felon identification card and that's an automatic charge if they don't have it, I don't agree with that,\" she said.\n\nSheriffs regularly release sick and injured inmates to avoid paying their hospital bills. But in Alabama, some defendants charged with violent offenses like murder have been let out. And some have gone on to commit new crimes.\n\nIn the 1957 case Lambert v. California , the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in on the issue of felon registration. A woman named Virginia Lambert had been found guilty of violating a Los Angeles municipal law that made it \"unlawful for 'any convicted person' to be or remain in Los Angeles for a period of more than five days without registering.\" The conviction was upheld on appeal.\n\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the California ruling. The majority wrote that Lambert's constitutional right to due process had been violated because she most likely had no \"actual knowledge\" that not registering as a felon was a crime.\n\n\"So the question would be whether Alabama has done a better job giving notice to someone that they need to register and/or get the ID card,\" Rachel E. Barkow, a law professor and faculty director of the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law at New York University School of Law, said via email.\n\nThe piecemeal enforcement of Alabama's felon registration and identification law also raises concerns, according to Alvin Bragg, a visiting law professor at New York Law School and co-director of the school's Racial Justice Project.\n\nTwo-thirds of the state's 67 counties saw no such charges brought between 2014 and 2018.\n\n\"Ultimately every law has got to be rational and not arbitrary and that's the standard of review,\" Bragg said. \"I think this comes perilously close to being irrational and excessively arbitrary.\"\n\nMichele Deitch, senior lecturer at the University of Texas at Austin's School of Law and Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, said it would be difficult to argue that a year in jail is not a disproportionately harsh punishment for failing to carry a felon ID card.\n\n\"It would be challenged as an 8th Amendment violation,\" she said. \"It's disproportionate to the underlying offense. And cruel and unusual - is there another locality that would sentence you to a year for that? Probably not. So that's pretty unusual.\"\n\nSometimes simply failing to change an address can land a person behind bars.\n\nThat's what happened to Michael Kelsay, who has been on law enforcement's radar in Baldwin County for years. The father of three says that he sold his pickup this winter because he was tired of being pulled over nearly every time he left his trailer park.\n\nA self-described former drug addict and petty criminal, he has a rap sheet spanning two decades, during which time he has been convicted of crimes including drug possession, negotiating a worthless instrument and receiving stolen property. The 39-year-old has also been arrested on two separate occasions for crimes related to felon registration.\n\nThe first arrest took place one morning in August 2014, when Baldwin County sheriff's deputies banged on the door at Kelsay's mother's house looking for him. When he came to the door, he says they informed him they had heard he was the last person seen with a criminal suspect they were trying to find.\n\nAfter searching the area and determining the suspect was not there, Kelsay says one of the deputies ran his name through an electronic system, saw he was a repeat felon and asked him for his felon identification card.\n\n\"I show it to him. I'm like, 'Boom, got it.' They're just grasping at straws, I feel like. Like, I'm good now,\" Kelsay said during an interview in his kitchen last month.\n\n\"And then he hit me with, 'Well, you don't live at this address anymore,' because I told him I was staying at my mom's. I didn't see the trap coming.\"\n\nKelsay was arrested and charged with failing \"to register, within 24 hours, his/her change of address or place of residence with the sheriff of Baldwin County,\" according to court records. He says he was temporarily living at his mother's house, 3 miles down the same road in Bay Minette from the address listed on his felon ID card.\n\nKelsay posted $5,000 bond and was released from jail three days after the arrest.\n\nHe was arrested a second time a month later and charged with failing to possess a felon registration card - he said the sheriff's office had seized his card at the time of the first arrest because the address was incorrect and he had not replaced it - and again failing to notify the sheriff's office that he had changed addresses. He pleaded guilty to the three charges that resulted from the two arrests and was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 30 days in jail and ordered to pay three $50 fines.\n\nAnthony Lowery, chief deputy of the Baldwin County Sheriff's Office, defended the arrests.\n\n\"He was knowingly, willingly violating the law,\" he said. \"Obviously anytime you have a known convicted felon - like in this case Mr. Kelsay has been convicted multiple times of different crimes - [felon registration] does help. It's a tool to protect the public.\"\n\nLowery added that the Baldwin County Sheriff's Office pursues people who break the state's felon registration law:\n\n\"If you're asking if we're just going out searching for these people, on occasion yes. ... We're charged with enforcing the law and if you're a felon and you're required to register and you're violating the law then we're going to enforce that.\"\n\nWhat sticks with Kelsay to this day is the idea that he was arrested because the law forever puts him in a separate category.\n\n\"I was flabbergasted by it. I couldn't believe they took me to jail for that,\" he said. \"That's what really bothers me about it is I feel like they charged me with that because they wanted me to go to jail.\"\n\nAgnel Philip contributed data reporting.\n\nAre you from Alabama?

      "text": "Alvin Bragg Did What He Had to Do in Indicting Trump\n\nA former U.S. president was indicted for the first time in history, and they chose to charge him with paying hush money to a porn star?\n\nYes. Only there is no \"they.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged former President Donald Trump, apparently for falsifying business records in 2016 to conceal a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who reportedly threatened to go public with allegations that she and Trump had engaged in an extramarital affair. The Wall Street Journal called it \"the weakest of charges.\" Columnist Peggy Noonan wrote that the indictment was \"below us\" -\"tacky lowlifes doing tacky lowlife things.\" Instead of charging Trump in Manhattan, she wrote, \"\"Save the handcuffs for Georgia.\"\n\nBut criminal charges are not an either/or proposition. Falsifying business records may pale in comparison with the other crimes for which Trump is under investigation, but defendants don't get a pass on other crimes just because they committed a more serious one in another jurisdiction. Murderers are not legally immune from being charged with other, less serious crimes. Trump is not, either.\n\nEven more importantly, it is wrong to think of prosecutors as a single entity. Bragg in Manhattan is independent of District Attorney Fani Willis in Fulton County, Ga., and Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed to lead the federal investigations into the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and the highly sensitive government documents found at Trump's Mar-a-Lago home last summer. Each prosecutor is sworn to investigate crimes and make charging decisions, regardless of whether some other prosecutor in some other jurisdiction is investigating the same person. Certainly, prosecutors exercise discretion. They don't charge every violation of law that comes across their desk, only those where they believe that prosecution is in the best interests of justice. If, based on his careful review of the facts and law, Bragg believes that falsifying business records is an appropriate charge in this case, then it would be inappropriate to decline seeking an indictment just because Trump might also be charged at some later date with a more serious crime in some other jurisdiction.\n\nFraming prosecutors as a monolith is a divide-and-conquer disinformation tactic. On his Truth Social social media platform, Trump recently posted a photo of Bragg with the words, \"the radical left, Biden Democrats seem desperate to derail by any means Donald Trump from becoming president again.\" In another , he criticized Bragg for planning to \"indict an innocent man,\" and suggested that Bragg is part of one unified effort to take down Trump: \"They spied on my campaign, Rigged the Election, falsely impeached, cheated and lied. They are HUMAN SCUM!\" Bragg, of course, had nothing to do with investigating the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, the 2020 presidential election or Trump's two impeachments. But Trump lumps all rivals together into one demonic force. When the world is limited to only two factions, then if Trump can persuade the members of the public that his rivals are so bad as to be an untenable choice, then their only option left is to support him.\n\nWhile reasonable minds may disagree as to whether the charge in Manhattan was one that should have been brought, there is nothing improper about it. A grand jury found probable cause that the crime was committed, and now Trump will receive all of the due process rights any defendant receives in a criminal case. The strength of the indictment will be tested in court, where Bragg will be required to prove guilt to an unanimous jury of 12 citizens beyond a reasonable doubt. The procedural safeguards afforded to defendants in a criminal case incentivize prosecutors to bring only charges they believe they can prove.\n\nOne of the worst harms caused by the hyper-partisanship of recent years is the false notion that prosecutors make charging decisions for political reasons. During my 20 years as a federal prosecutor handling hundreds of cases, politics merited zero consideration. Prosecutors are ethically prohibited from basing charging decisions on political factors. Selective prosecution-charging a person for a discriminatory or otherwise arbitrary reason-can result in a dismissal of the case for violating the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. But a selective prosecution claim requires a defendant to show that other people who are similarly situated have not been prosecuted for the similar crimes. Here, Trump will be unable to make that showing. District Attorney's offices in New York have charged numerous other individuals for falsifying business records in recent years. Trump is not a victim of selective prosecution. What Trump really seems to want is special treatment-a pass, simply because he is a former president. That kind of treatment that would violate the rule of law, the idea that all of us are subject to the same rules.\n\nIn the coming weeks or months, we may see other prosecutors file charges against the former president, as well. But none of those decisions will be dependent on the other.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Trump's Criminal Trials Likely to Start With the One Some Take Least Seriously\n\nW hen Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg indicted Donald Trump last April, the first criminal indictment of a former President in history, the case drew some derision. Prosecuting a former President over hush-money payments to a porn star seemed trivial and relied on a legal technicality to bump the charges up to felonies, some said. Given that three other cases were targeting Trump for trying to overthrow the 2020 election and refusing to return national security secrets, Bragg's case seemed like weak sauce.\n\nTen months later, the New York case has become less of an afterthought. In fact, it might end up being the main show. As the other three cases find themselves facing various legal roadblocks, Bragg may be the best positioned to hand Donald Trump a felony conviction before the November election.\n\nBragg is gearing up to bring Trump to trial in late March, according to a person familiar with the case, hopscotching over a federal case focused on the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol that had been previously seen as likely to be the first of Trump's four criminal trials. While Trump's inner circle says it would prefer none of the criminal trials happen before Election Day, some see a trial on the New York case as the next best outcome for the former President. \"It is the goofiest of all cases,\" says a Republican strategist close to the Trump campaign. \"If Trump beats this case, it sets the tone and feeds into his narrative that all of these cases are a witch hunt.\"\n\nThe Bragg case hinges on the timing of Trump's efforts to cover up a sex scandal-weeks before the 2016 election. Trump is charged with 34 counts of faking business records to hide payments to actress Stormy Daniels intended to stop her from publicly describing a sexual encounter. Bragg has argued that the charges should be bumped up to felonies from misdemeanors because the payments were covering up a federal crime: election interference.\n\nThe core of the case \"is not money for sex,\" Bragg said in a Dec. 22 interview on WNYC New York Public Radio. \"We would say it's about conspiring to corrupt a presidential election and then lying in New York business records to cover it up,\" Bragg said.\n\nBragg's office is watching closely for New York state judge Juan Merchan to rule as early as next week on an effort by Trump to get the case tossed out, according to a person familiar with the case. Trump has argued the indictment should be thrown out on grounds that state laws don't affect federal elections and that the case was politically motivated. Bragg and his staff see signs that point to Merchan rejecting that argument, further bolstering their legal theory that charging Trump with felonies because of how the hush-money payments impacted the presidential election is valid.\n\nMerchan's ruling will follow one in July from Judge Alvin Hellerstein in the Southern District of New York, who kept the case in state court and affirmed the prosecution's assertion that \"Trump can be convicted of a felony even if he did not commit any crime beyond the falsification, so long as he intended to do so or to conceal such a crime.\"\n\nWithin Bragg's office, staff are operating under the assumption that the case will move to jury selection on March 25. The prosecution believes it could present its case in 3 to 4 weeks, which could pave the way for a verdict by the summer, well before the November election. If convicted, Trump could face a sentence up to four years in prison.\n\nBragg's recently bulked up the team handling the case by adding one of the city's most experienced trial attorneys, Joshua Steinglass, who has tried high-profile gruesome homicides in front of New York juries. He also worked on the white collar case that convicted the Trump Organization of tax fraud last year. Steinglass joins the chief of the investigative division, Susan Hoffinger, Chris Conroy, who has been in the district attorney's office for two decades, and former senior Justice Department official Matthew Colangelo.\n\n\"Which is the most viable, which is the one that could actually go?\" says the person familiar with Bragg's preparations on the case. \"All signs are pointing to\" Bragg's case, the person says.\n\nThe New York case comes as the other three criminal cases against Trump-two in federal court and one out of Georgia-hit delays and potential roadblocks.\n\nIf Trump wins the election, he could stop the Justice Department from pursuing the federal cases against him, as well as try to pardon himself from federal charges. As the Georgia and New York cases deal with state crimes, a President's pardoning power would not apply.\n\nBragg has said that he won't stand in the way if one of the other cases is ready to move first. \"We're not going to stand on ceremony. There's other dockets here, broader justice may warrant another case going first, but we stand at the ready,\" Bragg said during a Jan. 8 interview with NY1. At this point, the New York case seems best positioned to go to trial first.\n\nTrump's camp thinks his legal woes won't cripple his election chances, despite polls that suggest he could lose significant support if convicted of a felony. \"Even with a conviction in any of these cases, President Trump is still neck and neck with Joe Biden,\" says a source close to Trump. \"That should scare the hell out of the Democrats.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

Merchan delivered the ruling after rejecting arguments from Trump's lawyers to delay the trial over the late release of more than 100,000 pages of potential evidence that federal prosecutors turned over. \"Defendant has been given a reasonable amount of time,\" the judge said, as Trump sat in the courtroom.\n\nThe Manhattan trial, which concerns charges of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal with adult-film actress Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 election, was originally scheduled to begin on Monday but was postponed until mid-April after federal prosecutors handed over the new documents. Merchan ruled that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office \"is not at fault for the late production of documents from the U.S. Attorney's office\" and that the case could proceed to trial next month-setting a court date well before voters head to the polls for the November election.\n\nTrump called the case \"a witch hunt\" and \"a hoax\" as he walked into the courtroom on Monday, and later said that he plans to appeal the judge's decision to start the trial in April. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal payments made by his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who is expected to be the key witness against Trump in the trial.\n\n\"This case should have been brought three and a half years ago, they decided to wait now just during the election, so that I won't be able to campaign,\" Trump said. \"I will be appealing.\"\n\nThe Manhattan trial is one of four criminal cases that Trump faces as he seeks a return to the White House, but it's the only one with a trial date already set. Some legal experts believe the hush money case could be the most likely of Trump's four criminal cases to result in a felony conviction before the November election.\n\nWrite to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com"

      "text": "Trump's First Criminal Trial Set to Begin on March 25 in New York\n\nA New York judge has cleared the way for Donald Trump to stand trial in late March for allegations he violated election laws by covering up hush money payments to improve his chances in the 2016 election.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan set jury selection to start on March 25, setting up the first criminal trial of a former President in U.S. history and another moment in which Trump will test the limits of the American judicial system. If convicted, Trump could face up to four years in prison.\n\nMerchan rejected motions from Trump's defense team that the case should be thrown out for allegedly being politically motivated and based on faulty legal grounds. The judge also rebuffed efforts by Trump's team to delay the proceedings because of the workload demands of other criminal charges Trump faces and Trump's campaign schedule.\n\n\"We are pleased that the Court denied the defense's motion to dismiss. We look forward to presenting our case in court,\" said Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in a statement.\n\nBragg's case hinges on the timing of Trump's efforts to cover up a sex scandal weeks before the 2016 election. Trump is charged with 34 counts of faking business records to hide payments to actress Stormy Daniels intended to stop her from publicly describing a sexual encounter. Bragg has argued that the charges should be bumped up to felonies from misdemeanors because the payments were covering up a federal crime: election interference\n\nThe core of the case \"is not money for sex,\" Bragg said in a Dec. 22 interview on WNYC New York Public Radio. \"We would say it's about conspiring to corrupt a presidential election and then lying in New York business records to cover it up,\" he said.\n\nEven before the hearing, Bragg's office was operating under the assumption that the case would move to jury selection on March 25. The prosecution believes it could present its case in three to four weeks. Merchan said on Thursday that the trial could last for six weeks, setting up a possible verdict in May.\n\nTrump is facing charges in four separate trials around the country, and is pushing to delay all of them beyond November's election. As the New York case moved forward, the other three criminal cases-two in federal court and one out of Georgia-have hit delays and potential roadblocks.\n\nTrump's legal team on Thursday pointed out that having jury selection in the New York case start in late March would mean Trump would be on trial during a crush of Republican primary contests expected to cement his bid to be the party's nominee for President.\n\nTrump has repeatedly chosen to attend court proceedings he wasn't required to attend, often holding press conferences with reporters outside the courtrooms.  He's used those appearances to amplify both his campaign messages and his allegation that all of the charges he faces are politically motivated.\n\nAfter Thursday's hearing, Trump told reporters in the courthouse hallway that he wants the trials delayed to free him up to travel for his campaign. \"We want delays. Obviously I'm running for election. How can you run for election if you're sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day long?\" Trump said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nWhile Trump was attending the New York hearing, a judge in Atlanta heard arguments on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be removed from the case charging Trump with trying to overturn Georgia's election results. Willis faces allegations that she had an inappropriate personal relationship with a prosecutor on the case. That case, which was slated to begin in August, could end up getting pushed off past the November election as the court decides how to proceed.\n\nTrump's also facing federal charges for encouraging a violent mob to pressure Congress to reverse Joe Biden's electoral victory on Jan. 6, 2021. That case, led by Special Prosecutor Jack Smith, was scheduled to go to trial on March 4, but has been delayed as Trump presses the Supreme Court to back his argument that, as a former President, he should be immune from prosecution for actions he took while in office.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "What Happens Next Now That Trump Has Been Convicted? Your Questions, Answered\n\nD onald Trump has been convicted by a Manhattan jury on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal ahead of the 2016 presidential election, making him the first former President ever convicted of a crime.\n\nThe presiding judge, Juan Merchan , now faces the unprecedented task of sentencing Trump, who turns 78 in June and faces three other prosecutions. His sentencing is scheduled for July 11, just days before Republicans are set to select him as their 2024 presidential nominee.\n\nThe historic verdict, which could threaten his bid to return to the White House, is expected to raise a series of legal and political questions in the coming months. Trump is all but certain to appeal, and the process could be further complicated if he wins a second presidential term.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg had charged the former President with 34 felony counts over allegations that he falsified business records to conceal a $130,000 hush-money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\n\nProsecutors proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely, but that he did so with the intent to commit or conceal another crime related to violating election laws, which is what elevated the crimes to felonies.\n\nTrump has already laid the groundwork for his response and is poised to leverage the outcome to advance his narrative of victimhood and political persecution. \"This was a rigged trial. It was a disgrace,\" Trump said after he was found guilty. \"The real verdict is going to be on November 5th by the people.\" But campaigning under the shadow of a criminal conviction is uncharted territory for presidential politics, and the legal issues only become more acute if he wins the presidency in November.\n\nHere's what happens now that Trump has been convicted in the New York case.\n\nYes. A felony conviction will not disqualify Trump from continuing his presidential campaign, even if he were jailed.\n\nThat's because under the Constitution, all natural born citizens who are at least 35 years old and have been a resident of the U.S. for 14 years can run for President. \"There is no constitutional bar on a felon running for office,\" Richard Hasen, an election law professor at UCLA Law School, told TIME after Trump's first indictment. \"And given that the U.S. Constitution sets presidential qualifications, it is not clear that states could add to them, such as by barring felons from running for office.\"\n\nAt least two candidates with criminal convictions have run for President in the past, albeit unsuccessfully. About 100 years ago, Eugene Debs ran for President while in a federal prison in Atlanta as the nominee of the Socialist Party, and got close to a million votes without ever hitting the campaign trail. Another convicted presidential candidate, Lyndon LaRouche, ran for President in every election between 1976 and 2004-including one campaign from prison in which he got over 26,000 votes.\n\nTrump could potentially face imprisonment, though most first-time offenders in non-violent cases are sentenced to probation and fines instead. The decision ultimately lies with Judge Merchan, who is not required to imprison Trump even though he has been convicted.\n\nThe 34 charges Trump was found guilty of are all considered class E felonies in New York, the lowest tier of felony charges in the state, which carry a maximum sentence of four years each. It's expected that the judge would impose a concurrent sentence so that Trump would serve all prison time simultaneously-four years maximum-if he goes that route. For now, Trump remains free.\n\nBut given Trump's age, lack of a prior conviction, the fact that he's the first former President to ever be criminally tried, and that he may become President again, legal experts say there's no guarantee that a conviction would result in jail time. Instead, it's more likely that Trump is sentenced to pay a fine and serve a form of supervision time, perhaps reporting regularly to a civil servant at the city's Probation Department. Under a probation sentence, he could be jailed immediately for committing any additional crimes.\n\nConvicted felons sentenced for less than a year are generally sent to New York City's Rikers Island, where Trump's former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg is currently serving his sentence for crimes related to his work for Trump. Sentences beyond a year would generally be served in one of New York's 44 state prisons.\n\nUnlike his other criminal cases, Trump would not be able to try to pardon himself of his felony conviction if he's elected President again. Falsifying business records is a state crime and only the New York governor, a Democrat, could pardon him. (Even in the federal cases, it's an untested legal question whether he could pardon himself .)\n\nTrump will almost certainly appeal the guilty verdict-a process that could take months or longer to play out, says Duncan Levin, a former Manhattan prosecutor. He would likely first take the case to the Appellate Division in Manhattan, and ultimately seek review from the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals in Albany, which has already ruled against Trump's multiple requests to delay the trial.\n\nThe lengthy appeals process would be unlikely to wrap up before Election Day.\n\nTo be determined.\n\nFor Trump to lose his voting rights, he would need to be incarcerated at the time of the November election, a scenario that is technically possible but unlikely given his anticipated appeal of the guilty verdict.\n\nWhile the Constitution does not explicitly address whether convicted felons have the right to vote, several states impose limitations on felons' voting privileges. In Florida, where Trump lives and has voted since 2020, a felon's eligibility to vote depends on the laws of the state where the conviction occurred-in this instance, New York, which only revokes a felon's voting rights while they are incarcerated.\n\nTherefore, if Trump receives a probationary sentence and resides in the community, he would maintain his eligibility to vote. Likewise, if his appeal of a jail sentence were to extend beyond the election, he would be able to vote.\n\nWhile the conviction in the hush-money trial does not directly impact Trump's other criminal cases, it could influence his strategy and alter the public perception of him and his legal troubles.\n\nFor instance, the guilty verdict could bolster the prosecution's case in the eyes of the public and legal observers, potentially influencing jury perceptions and trial dynamics in the remaining cases. The conviction in the hush-money case also could impact Trump's willingness to negotiate plea deals or settlement agreements in his other criminal cases.\n\nProsecutors may also try to use a conviction to undermine Trump's credibility in future trials, and the judges may take the conviction into consideration when determining sentencing.\n\nIn addition to the hush-money case, Trump is facing 40 felony counts in Florida for allegedly hoarding classified documents and obstructing the government's efforts to retrieve them, four counts in Washington related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and 13 felony counts in Georgia in connection to his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election result in that state.\n\nWrite to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com"

      "text": "What to Know About the Key Figures Surrounding Donald Trump's Indictment\n\nF ormer President Donald Trump was indicted Thursday evening by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office; a highly anticipated move built on grand jury testimonies and legal efforts from numerous people connected to the case.\n\nAlthough the indictment, which was filed under seal, hasn't been revealed yet, it relates to a 2016 exchange of money between adult film star Stormy Daniels and Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen for an alleged hush money payment organized just before Trump's presidential win. The allegations have been circulating for years, but new names have continued to join the case.\n\nFrom defense attorneys to potential testifiers, to the prosecutor who made the indictment happen, here's who to know surrounding Trump's indictment.\n\nStephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, is an adult film actor who since 2018 has publicly alleged that she had sex with Trump in 2006, a claim which Trump has denied, accusing her of extortion.\n\nIn 2016, just weeks before the election, Daniels' lawyer approached the National Enquirer saying that she was willing to go on the record about the affair. Leaders at the Enquirer-who later said they had a deal with Trump to keep coverage of him positive-put Daniels' lawyer in touch with Trump's then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, rather than buying her story.\n\nIn October 2016, Daniels received $130,000 in a lump sum payment from Cohen, which federal investigators verified in 2018. Daniels and Cohen have both said that the payout was approved by Trump in exchange for Daniels' silence about their sexual encounter. Daniels signed a nondisclosure agreement at the time, which she asked the court to nullify in 2018 once the secret about the payment was out and she began speaking about the affair with the press.\n\n\"Thank you to everyone for your support and love! I have so many messages coming in that I can't respond...also don't want to spill my champagne,\" Daniels tweeted Thursday after the indictment.\n\nOver the years and reinvigorated since the indictment, Daniels has received threats and online hate from zealous Trump supporters. Daniels' lawyer told the media this week that she wasn't surprised about the indictment.\n\n\"Trump is no longer untouchable,\" Daniels told the Times on Friday. \"He's done so much worse that he should have been taken down [for] before. I am fully aware of the insanity of it being a porn star. But it's also poetic; this p*ssy grabbed back.\"\n\n\"Signing the NDA and taking the hush money was actually the greatest gift that I gave. Because it's what made it illegal, which made it possible to actually go after him,\" Daniels added.\n\nOnce Trump's former trusted confidante, Michael Cohen was his personal attorney and fixer for over 10 years. The two worked incredibly closely, with Cohen going so far as to proclaim that he would take a bullet for Trump. From 2017 and 2018 while Trump was in office, investigators looked into Cohen's finances, finding mounting concerns and prompting Cohen to flip his loyalty to cooperate with investigators.\n\nIn January 2018, the Wall Street Journal first reported that Cohen had organized the $130,000 payment to Daniels. Coming under scrutiny, Cohen originally said that Trump wasn't involved, but later testified in front of a grand jury that Trump had instructed him to pay off Daniels and another woman, Karen McDougal, to avoid a scandal before the election.\n\nRecords showed that after the deal with Daniels, Trump paid Cohen the equivalent $130,000, although Trump defended the money as legal fees. Investigators refute that there were no such legal services at the time.\n\nThe attorney opened up about other fraudulent activity and was sentenced to three years in prison in December 2018 for numerous crimes, which included campaign finance violations, evading taxes and lying to Congress. Cohen also cooperated in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into the Trump campaign colluding with Russia.\n\nOver the years, Cohen's staunch loyalty to Trump has dissipated and he's admitted that he knew the things he was doing for the president were wrong; Cohen has called Trump out for racism and fraud.\n\n\"One of the things that Donald is going to do is he's going to try to muck up the water for this investigation. He's going to attack everyone. And we're already beginning to see that,\" Cohen told NPR on Friday. In statements to the press this week, Cohen confirmed that he's been asked to stand by as a rebuttal witness in the case.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is a former white-collar prosecutor and civil rights attorney. Bragg became the first Black district attorney for Manhattan in 2022, campaigning on a platform to reform systemic issues in New York's criminal justice system, such as eliminating cash bail and providing more survivor resources.\n\nUpon becoming DA, Bragg took over the investigation into Trump's role in the 2016 alleged hush money payment from Cohen to Daniels. Bragg initially worried that the case wouldn't be strong enough to hold up in court and slowed the office's investigation, prompting the two prosecutors leading it to resign out of protest.\n\nFacing backlash over his decision, Bragg asserted that the investigation wasn't over. \"Unless y'all are great poker players,\" Bragg told the New York Times in April 2022, \"you don't know what we're doing.\"\n\nIn January, after facing success in a different case prosecuting the Trump Organization for fraud and other financial crimes, Bragg bolstered efforts to revisit the hush money investigation. He convened a new grand jury that gathered testimonies and evidence to see if there was enough cause to indict Trump.\n\nAs House Republicans angered by the indictment attempted to intervene on Trump's behalf, the DA's office countered that they lacked jurisdiction. \"Like any other defendant, Mr. Trump is entitled to challenge these charges in court and avail himself,\" Bragg's office wrote in a letter to Congress Friday. \"What neither Mr. Trump nor Congress may do is interfere with the ordinary course of proceedings in New York State.\"\n\nThe public face of Trump's defense, Joe Tacopina, is a New York-based attorney who has had numerous famous clients, including rappers Meek Mill and Jay-Z. Tacopina is a former Brooklyn prosecutor who now heads a civil and criminal defense firm. He's known for his chatty interviews, frequently appearing in tabloids while speaking on behalf of his celebrity clients. Tacopina was first recruited in January to represent Trump in a defamation case against former Manhattan prosecutor, Mark Pomerantz, who wrote a book about his experience investigating Trump, \"People vs. Donald Trump: An Inside Account.\"\n\nTacopina began making press appearances shortly after Thursday's indictment was announced, stressing that so far Trump's defense doesn't know what exactly the indictment contains and which or how many charges he could face. Tacopina told Fox News Thursday night that he was \"shocked\" by the indictment, but that Trump is \"ready to fight.\"\n\n\"You don't bring a case like this on a former president on a petty allegation, on a completely legal civil transaction with attorneys unless you have the goods,\" he added, mentioning potential problems with the statute of limitations and selective prosecution in Trump's case.\n\nTacopina appeared on ABC's Good Morning America Friday, saying that although Trump will not be taken in handcuffs at the upcoming arraignment, he can't rule out a mugshot or a perp walk. \"I'm sure they will try to get every ounce of publicity they can out of this thing,\" he said.\n\nUnhappy with her lawyer at the time, Daniels reached out to Clark Brewster in early 2019 to represent her in her heated legal battles against Trump. Brewster is a partner at his firm in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and according to his website , he focuses on complex litigation.\n\nIn a statement after the indictment was announced, Brewster said he places a great deal of respect in the grand jury and that he hoped the justice system will recognize that \"no man is above the law.\"\n\nFollowing the indictment this week, Brewster told Tulsa World that he's here to advocate for his client, not play a part in political partisanship. Brewster estimated that he spent thousands of hours working to represent Daniels, receiving waves of backlash and threats over it.\n\n\"I think if Donald Trump at some point in time would have stepped up and fully accepted responsibility and explained the basis for the nondisclosure agreement and all the circumstances, I don't think there would be a charge,\" Brewster told Tulsa World.\n\nFormer Playboy model Karen McDougal said she had a nearly year-long affair with Trump in 2006, which Trump denies. McDougal has said that Trump offered her money after their first sexual encounter, but that she was not interested in taking it.\n\nIn 2016, around the same time that Daniels tried to sell her story about her relationship with Trump, McDougal was searching for similar opportunities. McDougal sold the exclusive rights of her story to the Enquirer's parent company for $150,000. The story never ran and in 2018, in a deal with the federal prosecutors, the company admitted that its reason for purchasing the story was to suppress McDougal's allegations.\n\nIn a 2020 interview with Law & Crime Network , McDougal said that she knew the affair was wrong, but that she had \"repented\" and had been \"forgiven by Jesus.\" When asked if she thought Trump had also come to that realization, McDougal said, \"I can't say what he has and hasn't done with his wife and his family, but I doubt it.\"\n\nMcDougal said she wishes she'd rejected the money and told her story to ABC like she originally planned to. \"I just wish I had come clean in the beginning,\" she added.\n\nAccording to ABC , CBS and other outlets, the DA's office is now investigating Trump's role in the payment to McDougal in conjunction with the Daniels case. CBS reported that according to sources familiar with the matter, prosecutors have asked grand jury witnesses questions about the McDougal matter too.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Trump's Hush-Money Trial Kicks Off With a Defiant Defendant, a Strict Schedule, and Supporters Outside\n\nD onald Trump was defiant and frustrated as he walked out of his first day on trial in New York. It was also the first day any former President had ever been on trial in 246 years of American history. But Trump didn't dwell on the historic significance of the moment.\n\nInstead he launched a litany of complaints and excuses. He called the hush-money case a \"scam\" and a \"witch hunt\" and lit into Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the trial, and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the charges.\n\nTrump faces 34 counts of fraudulently entering business transactions in order to cover up payments he made to a porn star to buy her silence in the weeks leading up to the 2016 presidential election. Trump says he didn't have an affair with the adult film actress Stormy Daniels and pleaded not guilty in the case.\n\n\"We've got a real problem with this judge,\" Trump said after court adjourned on Monday, wearing his iconic wide red tie and an American flag pin stuck in his jacket lapel. \"We've got a real problem with a lot of things having to do with this trial including the DA, because you go right outside and people are being mugged and killed all day long and he's sitting here all day long with about 10 or 12 prosecutors over nothing, over nothing.\"\n\nA week before, Judge Merchan had expanded a gag order on Trump, saying he couldn't criticize the judge's family or jurors or court officials. But Merchan and Bragg were still fair game for Trump's critiques. And, on day one at trial, Trump took advantage.\n\nAs jury selection began, Trump took issue with the strict schedule of being a criminal defendant that's going to keep him in a courthouse in Manhattan, away from the campaign trail and other commitments, likely for more than a month. Trump complained that Merchan would not agree to let him skip the proceedings next week during the Supreme Court's oral arguments about whether presidential immunity protects him from federal charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith, in one of the three other criminal cases proceeding against him. Trump said he would miss his son Barron's high school graduation if Merchan didn't give him permission to be absent in the coming weeks.\n\nBut that wasn't all. Trump also said that being in court for the next few weeks would keep him off the campaign trail and out of key states he needs to win in November's presidential election. \"I can't go to my son's graduation, and I can't go to the United States Supreme Court, or I'm not in Georgia, or Florida or North Carolina campaigning, like I should be, it's perfect for the radical left Democrats. That's what they want-it's about election interference, that's what it's about,\" Trump said. He didn't take any questions from reporters and turned around and walked down the hall with his entourage.\n\nTrump had sat for most of the day inside the stuffy courtroom, as his lawyers sparred with prosecutors over how the trial should run, and the makeup of jurors on the panel that will decide Trump's fate. Some of the initial decisions on Monday didn't go Trump's way. Not only did Merchan say Trump can't go to the Supreme Court next week and deny Trump's request that he recuse himself, the judge also decided Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also claims to have had an affair with Trump, can testify in the case and that the prosecution can introduce as evidence National Enquirer articles from 2016 critical of Trump's opponents, as a way to show a pattern of how the publication had been allegedly helping Trump by buying rights to negative stories and squelching them.\n\nOne ruling that went in Trump's favor was when the judge decided that prosecutors can't play the footage from the Access Hollywood tape of Trump describing grabbing women's genitals. But prosecutors can tell jurors what Trump said.\n\nOutside the courthouse, a crowd of about 100 people milled around under the thin tree canopy of Collect Pond Park. One man had been playing the flute on a bench since early morning. A few people were there to cheer on Trump's prosecution. Others came by to soak in the historic moment. But most were there to show their support for Trump. One man wore a black T-shirt printed with Trump's scowling mug shot that read, \"Never Surrender!\" Overhead flew a flag that read, \"Keep America Trump 2028.\"\n\nAriel Kohane, 53, wanted to be at the courthouse on Monday to show \"my unwavering love and support for President Trump.\" Kohane, who wore a \"Jews for Trump\" T-shirt, predicted that Trump's prosecutions would gin up more support for him and \"backfire on the Democrats.\"\n\nStanding nearby, Lou Valentino, 27, thinks Trump is being unfairly tried and has been targeted because he's running for President. \"A lot of the people you see out here are frustrated people, or people that have been supporting Trump for a long time, or people like me that just started supporting him not too long ago,\" Valentino says.\n\nA few had come to show they welcomed Trump being put on trial. Nadine Seiler, 58, traveled 250 miles from Waldorf, Maryland to protest against Trump. She arrived outside the courthouse at 6:30 am, expecting to see throngs of people supporting his indictment and was surprised to find the crowd of anti-Trump protestors swell to just over a dozen by the afternoon.\n\nSieler says she's disappointed by what she perceives as a general lack of concern over Trump and his potential return to office. She thinks people have become more apathetic in recent years. \"When democracy goes away and we are not able to protest, we're going to be like, 'How did this happen?'\" she says. \"I feel that the reason why Trump is allowed to get away with what he does is because people are not participating in the process.\"\n\nWhether Trump likes it or not, he'll have to participate in his trial for many more weeks to come.\n\nWrite to Simmone Shah at simmone.shah@time.com"

      "text": "Trump's Using Court Filings to Get Around His Gag Order\n\nW ith his first criminal trial set to start next week , Donald Trump on April 5 launched a fresh attack on the judge presiding over the case, one that also tests the boundaries of a gag order issued by the judge against him.\n\nTrump's presidential campaign publicized a motion filed on April 3 demanding Judge Juan Merchan recuse himself from the New York hush money case \"in light of appearances of impropriety\" stemming from his daughter's work with a company that does political marketing for Democratic campaigns.\n\nTrump's 35-page motion -and its 119 pages of exhibits-comes after Merchan expanded the existing gag order on Trump to include banning him from making public comments about Merchan's family or that of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's, after the former President had repeatedly made comments arguing that the work of Merchan's daughter meant he couldn't preside over the jury trial impartially. The order does not prevent Trump from criticizing the judge and the district attorney directly.\n\nTrump seems to be testing a way around the gag order by putting his public criticism of the daughter of the judge into the public court filings themselves, and then promoting the filings.\n\nThe filing says that Loren Merchan has held leadership positions at a political marketing company called Authentic that was paid to develop ads in 2019 for Kamala Harris's presidential primary campaign and has since produced ads for the campaigns of Democratic members of congress, including Rep. Adam Schiff and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nIn demanding that Merchan recuse himself, Trump's legal team argues that the work of Merchan's daughter for Democratic political campaigns creates \"appearances of impropriety\" and should be grounds for the judge's recusal. Trump's filing also said Merchan's gag order \"improperly restricts\" Trump's \"constitutionally protected campaign speech\".\n\nBragg's office called Trump's claims a \"daisy chain of innuendos\" that are a \"far cry from evidence.\" Anticipating Trump's motion, prosecutors in the case told Merchan in a letter on April 2 that the court and an advisory committee on judicial ethics have already determined that the political activities of a relative are not a basis to question a judge's impartiality. There is a longstanding practice in American courts that a person's views are not defined by those of their family members.\n\nBragg's office went further in a court filing made public on Monday, telling the judge to reject Trump's effort to get him to recuse himself and describing the maneuver as a \"last-ditch attempt\" to delay the trial set to start in one week. In Monday's filing, Bragg said Judge Merchan should not recuse himself, saying Merchan already denied Trump's request for his recusal last year, and Trump hasn't met the standards for that to be reconsidered.\n\nBragg described Trump's motion as \"an effort to end-run the order restricting extrajudicial speech\" and \"pollute the court file with ad hominem\" attacks against the judge and his daughter.\n\nBragg is bringing Trump to trial to face charges he faked business records to cover up a sex scandal involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 election. The trial is set to start on April 15, but would be delayed if Mercan were to agree to Trump's request to recuse himself.\n\nTrump is facing charges in three other criminal cases, including felony charges for trying to reverse his 2020 election loss in Georgia, engineering a violent effort to overturn the election results on Jan. 6, 2021, and refusing to return classified documents after leaving office.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Donald Trump Convicted in Historic New York Hush-Money Trial\n\nF or six weeks, the former most powerful man in the world sat like an ordinary citizen in a drab courtroom, a criminal defendant being judged by a jury of his peers.\n\nDonald Trump glowered, complained, bloviated, and snoozed during a trial both historic and tawdry over whether he falsified business records to cover up hush money paid to a porn star on the eve of the 2016 election. On May 30, the 12 jurors delivered their unanimous verdict: guilty on all 34 counts. To all his norm-shattering iterations-flashy businessman, name-brand showman, novice President-Trump has added a new title: felon.\n\nThe trial that led to the first-ever criminal conviction of a former U.S. President was often marked by its unseemliness. A motley cast of characters-the former porn star, the tabloid publisher, the crying press aide, the disgraced former fixer-recounted episodes of spankings, clandestine meetings, and payoffs, all intended to establish that Trump had criminally conspired to hide information about his behavior that could have affected voters' choices. But while the crimes may feel insubstantial, the stakes for American democracy are far weightier. Trump once again threatens to upend the precepts of the U.S. political system and test the foundations of the country's rule of law.\n\nTrump will hardly be humbled by this outcome; he's already called the trial a scam and vowed to appeal, a process that could take months or longer. \"This was a rigged trial. It was a disgrace,\" Trump said after he was found guilty. \"The real verdict is going to be on November 5th by the people.\" As Trump runs against President Joe Biden in a tight race this fall, voters will have to grapple with questions both political and constitutional. The election is heading into uncharted territory .\n\nBuy TIME's Donald Trump verdict cover here\n\nFor now, the system has held: this was an orderly trial with a careful judge and a patient jury that listened to the evidence and rendered a verdict without falling prey to intimidation from-most notably-a famous defendant who repeatedly violated his gag order. \"It really is a demonstration of an evolved system of justice that applies to all people,\" says Harry Litman, a former U.S. attorney.\n\nAnd yet the hush-money trial is widely viewed as the least serious of Trump's criminal cases. Judge Juan Merchan may not even give him any jail time at the sentencing set for July 11. Trump is still facing three other criminal prosecutions-two over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and one over allegations that he mishandled classified documents. Trials focused on the former President as a threat to democracy and national security would strike more directly at what many view as the central issues of this election. But it's unlikely any of those cases will get to trial before Election Day. Now that the New York jurors have made their decision, it's up to the rest of the nation's citizens to define the true stakes of the Manhattan verdict. Because it's perfectly legal for a felon to run for President-even from behind bars-Trump's defense team always had an eye on a bigger audience outside the courtroom. \"They [tried] this case for the public and not for the jury,\" says Duncan Levin, a former Manhattan prosecutor.\n\nCome November, voters will need to decide what it might mean to elect a convicted criminal to the highest office in the country-and how much power they're comfortable with that man wielding over the judicial system that has just held him to account.\n\nFrom the moment Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced charges against Trump more than one year ago, people doubted his unconventional strategy.\n\n\"It cheapens the term election interference to call this election interference,\" says Richard Hasen, a professor of law at UCLA. Jed Shugerman, a law professor at Boston University, called the case \"an embarrassment\" that pushed the boundaries of prosecutorial ethics.\n\nIt is not illegal to pay someone \"hush money.\" On its face, Bragg's evidence pointed to 34 misdemeanor counts of falsifying business records, for all of which the statute of limitations had passed. Bragg's novel approach bumped each of those misdemeanors up to first-degree felony charges by alleging they were all committed to bolster another crime related to violating election laws, but Bragg didn't have to prove that second crime. He argued that Trump was intent on keeping Stormy Daniels' story about an old sexual liaison out of public view before the election to help his campaign.\n\nMaking such a nuanced case was bound to be challenging. Yet the reviews from legal experts of Bragg's team's performance heading into closing arguments were largely positive. Prosecutors were \"successful at reframing this as essentially a disinformation operation on the 2016 election, not just the coverup of an affair,\" says Asha Rangappa, a lawyer and former FBI agent who is now a senior lecturer at Yale University's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs.\n\nTrump's lawyers, on the other hand, drew plenty of second-guessing for a legal strategy that revolved around denying not only the crime, but that Trump ever had an affair with Daniels. But when Daniels herself was called to the witness stand, she was convincing as she recalled meeting Trump during a celebrity golf tournament on the shores of Lake Tahoe in 2006, the initial encounter that set the events of the case in motion. She was 27 years old at the time and attended the event to promote a porn studio. Trump invited her to his hotel room where they discussed her appearing on his reality TV show The Apprentice , she said.\n\nOrder your copy of the Trump verdict issue here\n\nSpeaking quickly, Daniels described vivid details from her evening with Trump, including the Old Spice she spotted in his toiletry kit and the underwear he was wearing when she emerged from the bathroom and saw him on the bed. She recalled feeling as if Trump had the upper hand. \"I did note there was a bodyguard right outside the door. There was an imbalance of power for sure,\" she said. \"But I mean I was not threatened verbally or physically.\" She said she blacked out and the next thing she remembers, she was on her back on the bed. Daniels told the jury the sexual intercourse was brief, and Trump did not wear a condom, which concerned her.\n\nWhile Daniels' account was embarrassing for Trump, to make their case, prosecutors needed to convince the jury that his decision years later to pay for her silence was intended to help his presidential campaign. Trump's longtime friend David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer , bolstered the prosecution's thesis when he described an August 2015 meeting in Trump Tower in which he agreed to be Trump's \"eyes and ears\" to help bury stories that might damage his White House aspirations.\n\nThe testimony from Pecker was crucial in showing that Trump intended to have stories about him bought and kept from public view, says Norman Eisen, a senior fellow in governance studies at The Brookings Institution and former counsel to the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee during Trump's first impeachment. \"Pecker established that they intended to make these payoffs to benefit that campaign from the time of the Trump Tower meeting in August 2015,\" Eisen says.\n\nAt the heart of the case was whether Trump himself had paid for Daniels to remain silent and obscured that payment as legal fees to his lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen , a star witness in the trial. Prosecutors showed the jury a handwritten note written by a former Trump Organization executive outlining payments to Cohen. The note included a reimbursement for $130,000, the amount Cohen paid Daniels. It was a \"smoking gun document,\" Eisen says.\n\nBut Cohen's credibility was always one of the biggest vulnerabilities to the prosecution's case. In 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple crimes involving the hush-money scheme including lying to Congress and federal investigators. That's why one of the most damning moments for Trump may have actually come from Hope Hicks, Trump's former White House press aide who , unlike Cohen, has never spoken out against her former boss. The prosecution asked Hicks about a conversation she had with then-President Trump in February 2018, as news stories began to emerge that Daniels had been paid to stay silent about the 2006 sexual encounter. Hicks described Trump asking her how the news stories about his rendezvous with Daniels were playing in the press. Trump seemed relieved that the story had not come out earlier, Hicks testified. \"He wanted to know how it was playing, and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story-a different kind of story before the campaign, had Michael not made that payment,\" Hicks said. \"And I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.\" With that, the prosecutor said, \"No further questions.\" A few moments later, Hicks began to cry.\n\nEven before the verdict had been delivered, Trump and his team were looking ahead to the next major judgment to be cast on him: the 2024 election. His legion of running mate contenders and congressional allies showed up to support him at the trial, in lockstep and seemingly in uniform, with many wearing matching red ties. When they were all in a courthouse holding room on May 16, ahead of Cohen's first day of cross examination, an aide brought Trump a stack of polls showing him leading Biden in several swing states. \"Look at these numbers,\" Trump said. \"These are great.\"\n\nNow that he's been found guilty, Trump intends to cast the conviction as proof that the trial was nothing more than a political hit job, sources familiar with the matter tell TIME. \"Mother Teresa could not beat the charges,\" Trump griped as jury deliberations began. The campaign is expected to craft a messaging strategy that depicts the verdict as a foregone conclusion engineered by Democrats who fear Trump's return to the White House and tailor fundraising pitches around his continued legal peril.\n\nTrump is all but certain to emphasize his appeal, though that process is expected to stretch far past November. He would likely first take the case to the Appellate Division in Manhattan, and ultimately seek review from the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals in Albany, which already ruled against his multiple requests to delay the trial.\n\nIt's not clear how voters will respond. Polling suggests Trump could lose nearly 10% of his supporters if convicted of a crime, which could prove decisive in what's shaping up to be an incredibly close race. By the end of May, Trump was leading Biden in an average of national polls by FiveThirtyEight by a slim 41.3% to 39.9%. A set of polls released the same month by The New York Times , Siena College, and The Philadelphia Inquirer showed Trump leading Biden in five key swing states-four of those by 10 percentage points or less. While surveys have found Americans are most concerned about the economy, immigration, and abortion, Democrats are hoping Trump's status as a felon will repel the swing voters most likely to decide the election. As the trial wrapped up, Biden campaign officials were discussing internally how much to amplify a potential Trump conviction in their messaging and whether to run ads using the phrase \"convicted criminal\" to describe him. The campaign communications director Michael Tyler made a statement outside the courthouse the day of closing arguments, calling Trump an \"unhinged, power hungry, self-centered man\" and a \"unique and growing threat\" to democracy.\n\nPrivately, Trump's team recognizes they can't replicate the same strategy that propelled him in the primary, when Trump used his avalanche of legal woes to consolidate the Republican Party, raise millions of dollars, and undermine his rivals. But they're betting the New York case won't tip the scales too far in the opposite direction, either. \"His alleged affair with Stormy Daniels is something that Americans have known for years,\" says a Trump operative. \"It's nothing new.\" The proceedings also weren't televised-New York state bans cameras in court-limiting the case's ability to reach voters not already tuned in. \"It wasn't actually interesting television,\" the source says. \"You're just hearing talking heads recap what they saw in a courtroom.\"\n\nThere may be at least one way Trump's trial has already helped the campaign. April, when the trial began, was the first month Trump outraised Biden, surpassing the incumbent by more than $25 million. While Biden still has $100,000,000 more cash on hand, the swing in fundraising momentum was a warning sign to Democrats. Trump sources attribute the profusion of donations to Trump's plight in court and the syncing of the Republican National Committee with the campaign. That dynamic may continue as Trump's three other criminal prosecutions and his appeal process in New York are likely to remain in various states of limbo through Election Day.\n\nNo one is sure how the ruling announced in a Manhattan courtroom will influence the world outside of it. If the conviction \"doesn't detract from his political success and he wins reelection, I can imagine this will not stand as a huge chapter in the book about Donald Trump,\" says Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University. \"It's one of those cases where the outcome itself might not be as significant as what happens after the outcome in terms of his political future.\"\n\nThere will be a relentless effort by both Democrats and Republicans to capitalize on the conviction, with each side knowing full well their designs center on a man with a history of defying political gravity. It was hard for most to imagine Trump could win the 2016 election after the Access Hollywood tape came out showing him bragging about groping women. It was even harder to fathom he would mount a political comeback after being impeached twice in his first term, leaving office with an approval rating of around 30%, and unleashing a mob of his supporters to violently attack the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nFor any other American politician, the New York verdict would mark the end of a career. For Trump, there's no telling what comes next. \"The passion this guy stirs on both sides is unparalleled and will never be matched again,\" says a source close to Trump. \"There's nobody like Donald Trump.\"\n\n-With reporting by Nik Popli/Washington and Simmone Shah/New York\n\nWrite to Tessa Berenson Rogers at tessa.Rogers@time.com"

      "text": "Alvin Bragg: The Manhattan district attorney investigating Donald Trump\n\nAlvin Bragg made history in 2021 as the first black man elected New York County district attorney. His spotlight is about to grow a lot brighter.\n\nAs he left his office last night, Mr Bragg, 49, was saying nothing, knowing he'd guaranteed himself a place in the history books as the first ever prosecutor - at the federal, state or local level - to bring criminal charges against a former American president.\n\nHis office has been investigating an alleged hush money settlement between Donald Trump and an adult film star.\n\nThe case stems from a $130,000 (£106,000) payment made by his then-personal attorney Michael Cohen to pornographic actress Stormy Daniels at the height of the 2016 presidential election, allegedly in exchange for her silence over an affair with Mr Trump.\n\nThe Republican ex-president vehemently denies wrongdoing. He took to his own social media platform to say that he does not expect to have a fair trial in New York.\n\n\"They only brought this Fake, Corrupt, and Disgraceful Charge against me because I stand with the American People, and they know that I cannot get a fair trial in New York!\" he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney is a veteran prosecutor who took office at the start of 2022 on a two-part platform: investing in alternatives to incarceration while ramping up white collar and public corruption prosecutions.\n\nHis campaign for DA focused heavily on his personal biography and the desire for prosecutorial reform it had kindled. Born and raised in New York's Harlem neighbourhood during the 1980s crack cocaine epidemic, he has spoken of having police officers hold him up at gunpoint; of encountering homicide victims at his doorstep; and of having a brother-in-law live with him after a period of incarceration.\n\nThe Harvard-educated attorney specialised in white collar fraud and civil rights issues, including representing the family of Eric Garner, a black man who died at the hands of New York police in 2014.\n\nHe has claimed he helped sue the Trump administration more than 100 times in its four-year term. He also led New York's lawsuit against disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein.\n\nMr Bragg has experience with prosecutions at every level of government. He previously served as an assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York, a deputy attorney general of New York and a chief litigator for the New York City Council.\n\nDays after taking office, DA Bragg detailed new charging, bail, plea and sentencing policies for the Manhattan borough. He said his office would no longer prosecute certain low-level offences such as public transport fare evasion and cannabis-related misdemeanours.\n\nAn outcry from local law enforcement and business leaders amid rising violence in New York City prompted DA Bragg to apologise and revise the policy.\n\nHe has since pointed to statistics showing major crimes have fallen under his leadership, but critics - including Mr Trump and his allies - assail him as a \"radical\" liberal who is lenient with criminals.\n\nMr Bragg inherited the Trump probe from his predecessor Cyrus Vance Jr, who opened the case nearly five years ago while Mr Trump was still in the White House.\n\nEarly in his term, two prosecutors from his office quit, with one claiming that the investigation had been \"suspended indefinitely\" by a \"misguided\" DA who did not want to prosecute Mr Trump.\n\nThe DA's office responded that the case was ongoing and it was \"exploring evidence not previously explored\".\n\nLast December, two of Mr Trump's companies were convicted of tax violations at a criminal trial brought by Mr Bragg. Mr Trump himself was not charged, but The Trump Organization's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, is currently serving a five-month prison sentence.\n\nThis January, Mr Bragg convened a grand jury to evaluate evidence in the hush money probe.\n\nIn the wake of these historic charges against Mr Trump, the stakes are enormous. With his third bid for the White House under way, many say the indictment could supercharge his supporters and put him back in the Oval Office once again.\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nThousands have gathered in Rome to pay their respects to the late pontiff.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Here's what we learned:\n\nWe're closing our live page coverage on the case for now. Thank you for joining us.\n\nYou can catch up with the latest below:\n\nWhile Trump's legal drama continues to play out in New York, the president-elect is attending a SpaceX launch in Texas on Tuesday.\n\nTrump has become close allies with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk in the weeks leading up to the election, nominating him and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a Department of Government Efficiency - an advisory body on governmental cost-cutting.\n\nMusk and Trump have been repeatedly photographed by each other's sides since Trump won the presidential election earlier this month, including at a UFC fight in Madison Square Garden in Manhattan on Saturday.\n\nKayla Epstein reporting from New York\n\nAs we previously wrote, Trump has nominated members of his criminal and appellate defence team - Todd Blanche, Emil Bove, and D John Sauer - for high-ranking roles at the US Department of Justice in the president-elect's second term. Legal experts say that the three men's prior experience makes sense \nfor these roles.\n\nTheir potential boss, however, is raising eyebrows with some of his other justice department picks.\n\nTrump wants former congressman Matt Gaetz, a\n conservative firebrand who has been an unflinching supporter of the \npresident-elect, as his US attorney general, despite the US House ethics committee investigating some of his conduct.\n\n\"It's\n quite a clear signal that he's taking the justice department in a \ndirection of loyalty to him rather than independence, which has been the\n tradition up until now,\" said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York \nLaw School.\n\nYou can read more about the nominations here.\n\nMadeline Halpert Reporting from New York\n\nAs Trumpâs sentencing over his Manhattan conviction remains in limbo, Judge Merchan continues to find himself navigating uncharted waters.\n\nMerchan faced a difficult decision even before Trump was elected to become the next president, weighing whether to sentence the first former president ever convicted of a felony to time in jail. He has so far decided to push back Trump's sentencing, with the latest date scheduled for next week.\n\nMerchan is no stranger to high-profile cases. He oversaw a tax fraud trial against Trumpâs company before the hush-money trial.\n\nBut there are few other legal cases for him to turn to for guidance when it comes to making these rulings.\n\n\"This is very much a make-your-own-adventure novel, which [Merchan] started working on pre-election,\" former Manhattan prosecutor Diana Florence says. \"Now that he's won the election, we're in wholly uncharted territory, and what you have to do is find analogous situations.\"\n\nKayla Epstein reporting from New York\n\nDeep in the second page of the Manhattan district attorney's filing from Tuesday is a remarkable concession: that one option for Judge Juan Merchan would be to delay Trump's criminal proceedings until after his presidency ends - in 2029.\n\nThey asked the judge to consider \"non-dismissal options\" that could \ninclude \"deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the\n end of Defendant's upcoming presidential term\".\n\nTo one former prosecutor, that sentence is the whole ballgame.\n\n\"The DA is saying that the court should put off sentencing until after\nTrump leaves the White House. That's the headline,\" said New York attorney Mitchell Epner. \"Don't drop the conviction - but don't do anything until after Trump\nleaves office.\"\n\nMerchan still has to rule, but the prosecutors appear to have presented what they believe is their best-case-scenario in a truly unprecedented case.\n\nNada Tawfik Reporting from New York\n\nProsecutors have now outlined what they believe are the appropriate next steps in this case now that Donald Trump - a convicted felon - will be the next occupant of the White House.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney said no current law establishes that a presidentâs temporary immunity requires dismissal of this case.\n\nThey said the court must balance competing constitutional interests - and preserve the independence of the presidency and the integrity of the criminal justice system.\n\nIn that regard, they suggested one remedy: instead of an outright dismissal of the case, it could be frozen - including Trumpâs sentencing - until the end of his upcoming presidency.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Trump said this was a victory for the president-elect. The defence is eagerly seeking to have the case dismissed - which they said would avoid unconstitutional impediments to his ability to govern.\n\nThe judge still needs to weigh in.\n\nMadeline Halpert Reporting from New York\n\nWe don't have an exact timeline for when Judge Juan Merchan will respond to the prosecution's latest filings. It is up to the judge to determine what happens next with the case.\n\nBut former Manhattan prosecutor Diana Florence tells me Merchan is likely to take the prosecutors up on their suggestion - which is to set new dates on the calendar to address Trump's expected motion to dismiss the case entirely.\n\nThis means the president-elect's sentencing date would likely be pushed back again.\n\n\"I think there's less than half a percent chance that heâd be sentenced next week,\" Florence says, referring to the court's current schedule which has Trump's sentencing marked for 26 November.\n\nFlorence says we should hear from the judge soon.\n\nDonald Trump's communication director Steven Cheung has just issued a statement on the New York criminal case.\n\nHe calls it a \"witch hunt\", which is the same wording Trump uses when talking about the criminal cases against him.\n\n\"This is a total and definitive victory for President Trump and the American People who elected him in a landslide,\" Cheung says.\n\nHowever, the judge has not made a ruling on Trump's sentencing yet. What happened today was the prosecution informing the judge that they will oppose Trump's motion to dismiss the criminal case, and that they do not oppose pausing sentencing.\n\nAt this stage, Trump has still been found guilty of 34 felony counts and is awaiting sentencing.\n\nCheung also says President-elect Trumpâs legal team is \"moving to get it dismissed once\n  and for allâ.\n\nMadeline Halpert Reporting from New York\n\nIn this new filing from Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney lays out the complex context that the judge now has to take into consideration when weighing whether to go forward with the sentencing of Donald Trump for his business fraud felony conviction, postpone the sentencing, or dismiss the case entirely.\n\nIn the filing, he suggests that Trump's sentencing may need to be delayed \"until after the end\" of his next presidential term.\n\nGiven the need to balance competing constitutional interests, consideration must be given to various non-dismissal options that may address any concerns raised by the pendency of a post-trial criminal proceeding during the presidency, such as deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of Defendant's upcoming presidential term.\n\nAlvin Bragg, Manhattan district attorney\n\nKayla Epstein reporting from New York\n\nIn their filing today, the Manhattan district attorney's office laid out their objections to Trump's argument that his conviction should be thrown out on the grounds of presidential immunity.\n\nEssentially, they don't think presidential immunity applies, because the events at the centre of their case did not have to do with official presidential duties, and the trial and conviction occurred before the US Supreme Court decided this summer that presidents had broad protection from criminal prosecution.\n\nBut prosecutors said they would be open to a delay of the sentencing as Trump's team continues to litigate their case.\n\nMadeline Halpert Reporting from New York\n\nThis new filing from prosecutors does not yet change what's happening with this case - we still need a ruling from Judge Juan Merchan to decide that.\n\nBut for now, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is telling the judge that he intends to oppose Trump's motion to dismiss his criminal case, but does not object to pausing Trump's sentencing - which was originally scheduled for next week - until Trump's request is ruled on.\n\n\"The People believe that further proceedings before this Court should be adjourned to permit litigation,\" Bragg wrote in the new filing.\n\nBragg has asked for a deadline of Monday 9 December for Trump's legal team to respond to the matter.\n\nKayla Epstein reporting from New York\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's office has written to Justice Juan Merchan that they intend to oppose Donald Trump's attempt to have his business fraud conviction thrown out.\n\nThey asked to extend the deadlines for both parties to file motions on the matter until 9 December.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan now has to rule based on filings from both parties. But if he agrees with the prosecutors, it would mean that Trump's sentencing, currently scheduled for next Tuesday, would be delayed yet again.\n\nKayla Epstein reporting from New York\n\nTrump's New York hush-money case has an interesting intersection with the president-elect's plans for his next administration.\n\nTrump has nominated Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, his lead defence lawyers on his New York criminal case, for top roles at the US Department of Justice next year.\n\nBlanche, who represented Trump in three out of four of his criminal cases, will be \nnominated for the second-most powerful post at the Justice Department - deputy attorney general. That official is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation and executing the vision of his boss, the US attorney general.\n\nBove will will take on a high-ranking post in the \ndepartment, principal associate deputy attorney general. He will also act in Blanche's stead during the Senate confirmation process.\n\nIn addition, D John Sauer, who won Trump's historic presidential immunity case in the\n US Supreme Court this year, will be his nominee for US solicitor \ngeneral.\n\nFani Willis, Fulton County District Attorney\n\nWhile we're waiting for the latest on Trump's sentencing in New York, let's check on another case involving the president-elect.\n\nIn Georgia, the state's election interference case against Trump is now delayed indefinitely after an appeals court cancelled oral arguments that were scheduled for 5 December.The ruling came in a one-line order without further explanation.\n\nThe case has been stuck in limbo since Trump and his team sought to appeal a ruling that allowed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to stay on the case despite a romantic relationship she had with one of the prosecutors.\n\nWillis has pledged to press on despite Trump's return to the White House. This and the other federal cases the president-elect faces are likely to be put to a halt until his term in office ends.\n\nTrump and 18 others were indicted by a Georgia grand jury in August 2023 for allegedly working to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia.\n\nFour of the defendants pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors, but the president-elect and the others maintained their innocence.\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that US presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for \"official actions\" they take while in office.\n\nThe court added that presidents do not have immunity for non-official actions.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts said âtestimony or private records of the president or his advisersâ are not admissible in court. But contact with private citizens will have to be considered by the courts as to whether they are unofficial actions.\n\nâIn every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law,â Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in her opinion disagreeing with the courtâs ruling.\n\nTrump's conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records was based in part on evidence of meetings and communications that occurred while he was president.\n\nNow Justice Juan Merchan will need to weigh up if the Supreme Courtâs ruling is relevant to the evidence heard in his New York court room, where Trump was found guilty by a jury.\n\nMadeline Halpert Reporting from New York\n\nMuch has changed since Trump found himself sitting inside a chilly Manhattan courthouse for weeks on end in May.\n\nIt was a historic trial - the first time a former president has ever faced a jury of his peers over criminal charges.\n\nMy colleague Kayla Epstein and I were there to witness the drama every day, as former Trump allies testified in the case and as the former president's ex-fixer, Michael Cohen, accused him of committing fraud on the witness stand.\n\nTensions were high as jurors were sent away to deliberate over the former president's fate.  Just days later, they came back with a verdict: guilty on 34 felony counts of falsified business records.\n\nTrump has scored many legal wins since then. This summer, the Supreme Court ruled he had immunity from prosecution over official acts.\n\nAnd just this month, he helped completely erase his legal issues when he comfortably won the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWhile his federal cases could now go away, his conviction here in New York is now in limbo. With Judge Juan Merchan's expected ruling today, we will have our answer soon.\n\nDonald Trump has described the judge who oversaw his hush-money trial - where he was found guilty on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records - as a \"certified Trump-hater\".\n\nOthers say New York County Supreme Court Justice Juan Manuel Merchan is a tough and no-nonsense but fair jurist.\n\nBefore, during and since the trial ended, Trump relentlessly slammed Justice Merchan, both in public remarks and on social media.\n\nJustice Merchan has served 17 years on the bench. He is also no stranger to Trump's contact with the justice system.\n\nIn 2022, Justice Merchan presided over the tax-fraud trial that led to the conviction of the Trump Organization's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg.\n\nA president can only issue pardons in federal cases.\n\nThe 34 felony convictions in New York are a state case, so Trump would not be able to pardon himself.\n\nTrump is also facing state charges in Georgia, over allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election results there.\n\nBut there are two federal cases against the president-elect.\n\nFor those cases, in theory, he could pardon himself. A president has never pardoned himself before, so the move would be unprecedented.\n\nThe prosecution's key witness was ex-lawyer Michael Cohen, who testified that his former boss knew about the elaborate scheme to disguise the payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nIn days of heated cross-examination, Trump's lawyers sought to undermine Cohen and paint him as an unreliable witness and convicted liar.\n\nThe jurors deliberated over two days before finding the former president guilty of all 34 counts of fraud under campaign finance laws.\n\nTrump has called the case politically motivated. His lawyers are requesting the conviction be overturned, citing the Supreme Court immunity ruling.\n\nThe trial earlier this year revolved around a payment made to the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election.\n\nDaniels was paid $130,000 (Â£103,000) to keep quiet about her claim that she had sex with Trump, which he denies.\n\nProviding so-called hush-money is not illegal. Instead, this case was more technical and centred on how Trump's former lawyer, who paid Daniels, had his reimbursement recorded as legal fees in Trump's accounts.\n\nCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trump New York hush-money trial is far from a slam dunk\n\nAn adult film star. Alleged secret payments. A turncoat lawyer. And a candidate for president of the United States.\n\nDonald Trump's very first criminal trial - and the first of a former US president - involves charges of white-collar crime, but it features some of the most eye-catching details in any of the four criminal cases against him.\n\nThe case revolves around a $130,000 (£104,000) hush-money payment from Mr Trump's lawyer to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, who claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006.\n\nBut that payment was not actually illegal. Instead, the blockbuster case bringing 34 felony charges is based on allegations the former president falsified business records to cover up the payment - made just before the 2016 election - to avoid an embarrassing sex scandal which he denies.\n\nThe trial, which began in New York on 15 April, has legal experts divided on the strength of the case. Some debate whether Manhattan's District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, should have even brought the case and whether it is strong enough.\n\nAmbrosio Rodriguez, a former prosecutor who says he is no fan of the former president, believes the case legitimises Mr Trump's ongoing argument that he is being prosecuted unfairly because of who he is.\n\nMr Rodriguez argues that the case relies on old allegations, noting that federal prosecutors had investigated and declined to bring charges.\n\n\"This is a waste of time and a bad idea, and not good for the country,\" he told the BBC. \"This seems just a political need and want to get Trump no matter what the costs are.\"\n\nOthers disagree. Nick Akerman, who worked on the Watergate prosecution, says it's a serious case.\n\n\"This is about an effort to defraud the American voters in 2016 to keep them from learning material information that would have affected their vote,\" he told the BBC, referring to Mr Trump's alleged efforts to hide payments reimbursing his then lawyer, Michael Cohen.\n\nThe case also has come under scrutiny because it's seemingly built on an untested legal theory.\n\nMr Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. New York prosecutors say Mr Cohen paid off Ms Daniels, and accuse Mr Trump of trying to disguise the money he paid him back as legal fees.\n\nOrdinarily, falsifying business records is considered a misdemeanour - or low-level offence - in New York. But when it is done to conceal a crime, it can be elevated to a more serious felony charge.\n\nIt is not unusual for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to do that, but Mr Bragg's approach is a particularly novel one.\n\nHe says Trump Organization records were falsified to conceal or aid criminal activity. But even though the trial begins on Monday, he has not specified the exact crime allegedly hidden.\n\nHe has however given clues. In court filings and interviews, Mr Bragg has said Mr Trump violated both state and federal election laws, and state tax laws.\n\n\"The District Attorney's office is not precluded from presenting to the jury a variety of alternative theories on sort of why the records were falsified,\" says Shane T. Stansbury, a former assistant United States Attorney in New York's southern district.\n\nBut he adds that it is unclear if a state prosecutor can invoke a federal election crime, as it appears Mr Bragg intends to do.\n\n\"We could have appellate courts and even the US Supreme Court weighing in on some of the federal questions that are part of this theory, so I think we're a long way from having resolution on this case,\" he says.\n\nA former prosecutor in the New York federal office, Mark Pomerantz, said federal prosecutors went back and forth on charging Mr Trump so often that the investigation was nicknamed \"the zombie case\".\n\nBut due to the seriousness of charging a former president, some legal experts say that Mr Bragg had to bring the strongest possible case against Mr Trump, which is why he went for felony charges.\n\n\"Given who the defendant is in this case,\" said Anna Cominsky, a professor at the New York Law School, \"Just a misdemeanour may not rise to the level of criminality that perhaps one would expect someone in Trump's position to be charged with.\"\n\nOne of the biggest wildcards in this case is the prosecution's star witness: Michael Cohen.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal campaign violations as part of the alleged cover-up, which he said was directed by Mr Trump.\n\nSince his release, he has become one of Mr Trump's harshest critics, consistently attacking him in the press and on his podcast. He has also admitted in the past to lying to Congress under oath. That history makes him a \"compromised witness,\" said Mr Stansbury.\n\nBut as the man at the centre of the alleged scheme, he is almost guaranteed to testify against his former boss.\n\n\"His credibility is a huge issue for the prosecution, and definitely something the defence is going to attack,\" said Ms Cominsky.\n\nMr Bragg will try to bolster Mr Cohen's testimony by presenting proof of the payments to the jury.\n\nThe former president is sticking with a strategy that amounts to attack-and-delay. He frequently calls the case a \"hoax\" and a \"witch-hunt.\"\n\nHe has slammed Judge Merchan and District Attorney Bragg and attacked their family members on social media - to the extent that a partial gag order has now been imposed that prevents him from attacking court staff and their families.\n\nHis lawyers have tried to argue that the payments were made to keep the embarrassing information from Mr Trump's family, rather than to hide anything from voters.\n\nMr Akerman believes that argument, if used by the former president's lawyers in court, would fall flat with the 12-person jury ultimately deciding Mr Trump's fate.\n\n\"First of all, all of this was done right before the election, it had nothing to do with his family,\" he told the BBC.\n\nShould a jury vote to convict him, Mr Trump would enter the final stretch before November's presidential election as a convicted felon.\n\nBut his legal team only needs to persuade one juror that he is not guilty of the crimes alleged for him to walk free.\n\n\"To me, the only defence that they have is to try and pick a jury and try and identify somebody who might actually hang the jury,\" Mr Akerman said. \"Try and find someone who is a little bit eccentric, somebody who might be more sympathetic to Donald Trump.\"\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nGiuffre alleged she was trafficked to the Duke of York when she was 17, which he has strenuously denied.\n\nGhayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election.\n\nHe was approaching the runway \"for a normal landing\" when the crash happened, NTSB's lead investigator said.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Given how solid\nTrumpâs support has been over the past eight years, however, responses to\nhypothetical convictions may not accurately reflect reality.\n\nIf this race ends up as close as is expected, however, even a slight\ndrop in support could swing the race to the Democrats. The guilty verdict could\nremind some Americans, including educated and suburban voters, what they have\nsaid they donât like about the former president.\n\nItâs still May, however, and thereâs a long way to go in this\npresidential race. By the time November rolls around, voters could be focused\non more traditional concerns, such as the economy, immigration and abortion.\n\nUltimately, the verdict by American voters will go a long way towards\ndetermining how Trumpâs conviction is remembered in the history books.\n\nYou can read more here .\n\nDonald Trump's has left court after his guilty verdict and headed straight into the infamous New York city rush hour.\n\nHis convoy of black SUVs have a police escort, but Manhattan traffic has other ideas.\n\nCaitlin Wilson US Reporter\n\nYes, Trump is still eligible to run for the White House, even after these guilty verdicts.\n\nThe US Constitution sets out relatively few eligibility requirements for presidential candidates: they must be at least 35, be a ânatural bornâ US citizen and have lived in the US for at least 14 years.\n\nThere are no rules blocking candidates with criminal records - a person could even be in prison and still run for president.\n\nNada Tawfik Reporting from New York\n\nThis is a defining moment in American politics. Never before has a\nformer president and a convicted felon been one and the same.\n\nDonald Trump continues to shatter the norms of the nationâs highest\noffice. Months out from a tight election where he is a major leading candidate,\nthe country must now wade through unprecedented legal and political\nterrain.\n\nThe presumptive Republican nominee will be able to continue his race for\nthe White House, no matter his sentence. He will no doubt choose to appeal this\nverdict, so itâs probably not the final word on this case. But that\nprocess would be lengthy, and unlikely to wrap up before election day in November.\n\nFor Trumpâs critics, this outcome is justice served.\n\nTo his supporters,\nthis verdict makes him a martyr.\n\nBut what about those in the middle? This\nelection will be decided by just tens of thousands of voters in a few\nbattleground states, and polling shows some of them are uncomfortable with\nsending a convicted felon to run the country.\n\nIt's likely, though, that nothing about this experience will change Donald Trump. In fact, it will only embolden him.\n\nMadeline Halpert Reporting from court\n\nItâs quite a scene outside the New York courthouse.\n\nA helicopter is circling overhead.\n\nMasses of media are out to report on the news, and hundreds of spectators have come to watch them mark the historic event.\n\nWeâve never seen so many people here.\n\nDonald Trump has left the Manhattan courthouse along with his security.\n\nThere are multiple black SUVs blocking the street as his motorcade snakes out into rush hour traffic.\n\nA police escort leads the way.

There is still only one way\n    to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted\n    felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president.\"\n\nWithin a few minutes of being convicted, Donald Trump's Truth\nSocial account was posting fundraising requests.\n\n\"I AM A POLITICAL PRISONER,\" the post says, repeating\na common accusation from Trump.\n\nHis campaign has also sent out an email, which asks \"Is this the end of America?\"\n\n\"I\nwas just convicted in a RIGGED political Witch Hunt trial: I DID NOTHING WRONG!\"\n\nThe email also asks for campaign donations: \"But with your\nsupport at this moment in history, WE WILL WIN BACK THE WHITE HOUSE AND MAKE\nAMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nKayla Epstein Reporting from court\n\nAfter several minutes of almost unbearable silence, the court officerâs voice rang out loud and clear though the courtroom.\n\nShe asked the jury to read the verdict. And in a steady, even tone, the foreman began.\n\nAs the wave of guilty verdicts washed over Donald Trump, he sat motionless at the defence table.\n\nAt each âguilty,â he did not flinch or react physically.\n\nFor those watching on, it felt like the air had turned to stone.\n\nGary O'Donoghue Senior North America correspondent\n\nWhatever Donald Trump says, this is a devastating outcome for the former\npresident.\n\nIt's one thing being controversial and provocative, it's quite another\nbeing a convicted criminal.\n\nThere are of course upsides to this outcome; it\nwill further invigorate his supporters and make them even more angry than they\nalready are; it will also, if the past is a prologue, help the former president\nraise money, not just for his mounting legal fees but also for his campaign for\npresident.\n\nThe downside is that in some of those key swing states in the\nMidwest and the Sun Belt, there are voters who will be unhappy about supporting\na candidate with a criminal record and it doesn't take many of them to affect\nthe outcome in some very tight contests.\n\nTrump says he will \"keep fighting until the end\".\n\nThe former president also lashes out at the court process, claiming he was unfairly treated.\n\n\"This is far from over,\" he says, before walking away without answering any questions.\n\nCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trump hush-money trial: Key players at the centre of the former president's case\n\nAs Donald Trump sat at the defence table in the wood-panelled Manhattan courtroom over the past several weeks, he was joined by a cast of characters who featured in a type of Hollywood blockbuster.\n\nThere were a slate of intriguing potential witnesses, including an adult film actress, a fixer-turned-star-witness, a loyal money-man convicted of tax fraud and others.\n\nA white-collar defence lawyer who bet his career on defending Mr Trump was leading the former president's defence team. Meanwhile, Manhattan's first black district attorney assembled a crack team of Manhattan prosecutors who were very familiar with Mr Trump and his organisation.\n\nAnd the entire case was overseen by a seasoned New York Supreme Court judge who was well aware of Mr Trump's courtroom troubles and behaviour.\n\nMr Trump faces 34 charges of falsifying business records to disguise a hush-money payment to a woman with whom he allegedly had an affair. He has pleaded not guilty and denies having the affair. Below are the central players to know in the historic case.\n\nStormy Daniels - the adult film star - says she met Mr Trump in 2006 at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. Ms Daniels - real name Stephanie Clifford - was 27 at the time, and a rising star in the adult film industry. She claims that Mr Trump propositioned her, and the two had sex soon after their introduction.\n\nMr Trump denies the encounter happened, but Ms Daniels alleges that a $130,000 (£105,000) hush-money payment she received from Michael Cohen - a lawyer for the Trump Organization - just before the 2016 election was to keep her silent about the encounter.\n\nSince her allegations became public, she has become a frequent target of Mr Trump and his allies, but she remained committed to testifying against the former president.\n\nShe took the stand for two days, sharing a host of lurid details about the alleged sexual encounter, providing context leading up to the hush-money payment.\n\nMichael Cohen - the fixer - started working as Mr Trump's personal lawyer in 2006. He pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance crimes in 2018 over making the hush-money payment to Ms Daniels, but he maintains that he sent the money at Mr Trump's direction.\n\nHe told the court that the former president aimed to conceal the scheme and avoid scandal by reimbursing him via a series of payments that were recorded as legal income. Mr Trump has called his former confidant a liar, and his legal team attempted to attack Cohen's credibility during cross-examination.\n\nAt one time, Cohen said he would take a bullet for the former president. But he later became a key witness in investigations of Mr Trump - including Robert Mueller's probe into allegations of the Trump campaign colluding with the Kremlin.\n\nDavid Pecker - the tabloid publisher - is former CEO of American Media Inc (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer. When he led that tabloid, he pursued a practice known as \"catch-and-kill\" to support Mr Trump's 2016 presidential run. He did this by buying the rights to stories that cast Mr Trump in a bad light, he told the court. He would then decline to publish them, which effectively suppressed the damaging information. He was the trial's first witness.\n\nKaren McDougal - the Playboy model - claims to have had an illicit affair with Mr Trump in 2006 and 2007, which the former president also denies. She says she was paid $150,000 by American Media Inc, the parent company of the National Enquirer, for her story. It forced her to keep quiet about the purported tryst.\n\nHope Hicks - the former White House aide - shed tears during her time on the stand, detailing the behind-the-scenes fallout of the hush-money payment scandal. A former press secretary for Mr Trump's 2016 campaign, Ms Hicks helped corroborate testimony from other witnesses as one of Mr Trump's former close confidantes.\n\nMs Hicks also was privy to the details of the hush-money payment to Ms McDougal.\n\nDino Sajudin - the former Trump Tower doorman - did not end up taking the stand. But Mr Trump's team allegedly paid him hush-money as well, after he tried to sell a story to the National Enquirer about an unsubstantiated rumour that Mr Trump once fathered a child out of wedlock.\n\nJustice Juan Merchan - the seasoned New York jurist - has previously spent time with Mr Trump in a Manhattan courtroom. He presided over the Trump Organization's tax fraud case that resulted in a hefty fine and jail time for the company's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg.\n\nThat means the judge is well acquainted with Mr Trump's orbit and his courtroom tactics to delay, deny and deflect. That behaviour likely will draw Justice Merchan's ire. While he may be soft-spoken, he has earned the reputation of being a no-nonsense jurist.\n\nHe has issued several warnings to Mr Trump over his behaviour and threatened to kick a Trump ally and witness off the stand for giving him \"side-eye\".\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump has claimed on social media that \"there has virtually never been a more conflicted judge than this one\", and has attacked Justice Merchan's daughter - who is employed by a firm that works with Democrats. Mr Trump was then been barred from speaking about the judge's family.\n\nAlvin Bragg - the Manhattan district attorney - became the first black man to lead the Manhattan District Attorney's office when he was elected in November 2021. He took over the investigation into Mr Trump and announced that his office would bring felony charges against the former president last April.\n\nMr Bragg has adopted a novel legal theory that will turn a misdemeanour - falsifying business records - into a felony. He alleged that Mr Trump changed the business records to cover up a second crime - the violation of election and tax laws. His office alleges that the Trump campaign sought to hide the affair from voters ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nLegal experts have mixed views about whether the gambit will work, but Mr Bragg pulled together an experienced team of prosecutors who are very familiar with Mr Trump to make the case.\n\nJoshua Steinglass helped lead the prosecution of the Trump Organization, which led to a conviction, and was then added to this team. Mr Steinglass, who directed the prosecutors' efforts at trial, has previously tried high-profile murder and manslaughter cases and other violent crimes.\n\nThe prosecution team also includes Susan Hoffinger , the chief of the office's investigations division who previously worked on the Trump Organization tax case; Christopher Conroy, who has worked on the investigations of Mr Trump the longest; and Rebecca Mangold, a prosecutor who specialises in economic crimes.\n\nTodd Blanche - Trump's top trial lawyer - was a former federal prosecutor, registered Democrat and a New York City resident, but he tossed that all aside. Mr Blanche left a lucrative position as a partner at a Wall Street law firm, became a Republican and moved to Florida to take on the biggest client of his career - Mr Trump.\n\nOnce a colleague of Alvin Bragg, the lawyer prosecuting the former president, Mr Blanche sat on the other side of the courtroom from him. It was only the second time. He has served as a defence attorney in only one other criminal case that went to trial.\n\nSusan Necheles - Trump lawyer - has represented Mr Trump in cases since 2021, but she has a long history of defending troubled politicians, real-estate developers  and organised-crime figures - such as Venero Mangano, an underboss of the Genovese crime family with the nickname Benny Eggs. She represented the Trump Organization when it was convicted of criminal tax fraud and given a $1.6 million fine in December 2022.\n\nGedalia Stern , a partner in Ms Necheles law firm, and Emil Bove , a former federal prosecutor, are also on Mr Trump's defence team.\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThousands have gathered in Rome to pay their respects to the late pontiff.\n\nThere may be opportunities for impromptu diplomacy at one of the largest gatherings of world leaders in years.\n\nThe US president's envoy meets Vladimir Putin in Moscow, while Ukraine calls for more pressure on Russia.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Hereâs a quick explanation of some terms youâll see a lot in our upcoming coverage.\n\nIndictment â A formal written accusation that a person has committed a crime. It typically involves felony charges, though not always. In Trumpâs case, it does. The indictment is used to inform an accused person about the charges against them. Unlike regular charges brought forth by a prosecutor, an indictment is the result of a grand jury proceeding.\n\nGrand jury â A group of citizens that hear evidence from a prosecutor ahead of a trial. Witnesses may be called to testify in front of them and evidence is shown. The grand jury listens and then votes in secret about whether they believe there is enough evidence to charge the person with a crime. A separate criminal trial with another jury awaits the indicted. Read more about a grand jury here .\n\nHush money â Hush money is money paid to someone in exchange for them keeping information secret, also known as a bribe. In this case, the hush money was allegedly paid to ex-film star Stormy Daniels by the former president. Hush money payments arenât illegal but prosecutors are trying to prove that Trump falsified business records to pay them, which constitutes as a misdemeanour in New York. Prosecutors are also assessing whether or not Trump violated campaign finance laws, as the payments were made just before the 2016 presidential election, which would be a class E felony.\n\nWe are now bringing you more reaction from the former president, who has just released a long statement.\n\nTrump is calling his indictment \"political persecution\" and \"election interference at the highest level of history\".\n\n\"The Democrats have lied, cheated and stolen in their obsession with trying to 'get trump', but now they've done the unthinkable - indicting a completely innocent person in an act of blatant election interference,\" he said.\n\n\"Never before in our nation's history has this been done,\" he added.\n\nHe also called Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg a \"disgrace\" and claimed he was \"doing Joe Biden's dirty work\".\n\nDonald Trump has just spoken to ABC News by phone, the US network reports.\n\nThe former president told the network the indictment was \"an attack on our country\" and a \"political persecution\".\n\n\"They are trying to impact an election,\" he said.\n\nTrump is running for president again in the 2024 race.\n\nIn a statement, the ex-president's lawyers Susan Necheles and Joseph Tacopina said: \"President Trump has been indicted.  He did not commit any crime.  We will vigorously fight this this political prosecution in court.\"\n\nOn Twitter, Stormy Daniel's lawyer Clark Brewster has said that the indictment of Donald Trump is \"no cause for joy\".\n\n\"The hard work and conscientiousness of the grand jurors must be respected,\" he added. \"Now let truth and justice prevail. No one is above the law.\"\n\nStormy Daniels exiting court in 2018\n\nChelsea Bailey BBC News, Washington\n\nMichael Cohen, Donald Trump's former lawyer, who was a key witness in the hush money case, reacted to the indictment in an interview on MSNBC.\n\nâToday's indictment is not the end of the chapter, it's rather the beginning. And now that the charges have been filed itâs better to let the indictment speak for itself.\n\n\"This is an important day for America and itâs a very important day for justice and also for accountability. I always believed that this day was going to come ... And at the end of the day [Donald Trump] is going to understand that no one is above the law.\"\n\nIn 2018, Michael Cohen pleaded guilty and went to federal prison for tax evasion and campaign finance violations related to the hush money payments.\n\nMichael Cohen is Donald Trump's former lawyer\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers were quick to comment on the news of Trumpâs indictment, arguing the former president is finally facing accountability for his conduct.\n\n\"The indictment and arrest of a former president is unique throughout all of American history. But so too is the unlawful conduct for which Trump has been charged,â said Democratic Rep Adam Schiff of California.\n\nFellow Republicans and relatives of the former president rushed to Trumpâs defence.\n\nThe former presidentâs son, Eric Trump, called the charges âthird world prosecutorial misconductâ.\n\nâIt is the opportunistic targeting of a political opponent in a campaign year,â he said in a tweet , external .\n\nEric Trump tweeted criticism of the indictment\n\nAnthony Zurcher BBC North America correspondent\n\nDonald Trump has made history again. Never, in the 235 year history of the United States, has a former president faced a criminal indictment.\n\nThe exact details of the charges have yet to be disclosed â and may not be fully revealed for days. But they will almost certainly revolve around the payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep her from talking about an alleged affair with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe evidence behind the charges â whether prosecutors can connect Trump directly to those payments and prove that the connection constituted a crime â will be key to the seriousness of Trumpâs legal predicament.\n\nAfter a rush of attention following Trumpâs speculation more than a week ago that he was on the verge of being charged, the furor had died down somewhat.\n\nThe New York Cityâs district attorneyâs office suggested the grand jury was on the verge of an extended break and was not considering the Trump investigation in recent days.\n\nThat all may have been a calculated misdirection to help calm the waters before dropping a legal and political bombshell.\n\nWeâve just gotten word that former President Donald Trump is to be indicted in connection to alleged hush money payments made via lawyer to former adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe issue has been brewing since allegations the two had an affair came to light before the 2016 election. The former president denies he had sexual relations with Daniels.\n\nFollow along as we bring you the latest news and reaction.\n\nCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.

      "text": "What are 34 felony charges against Trump, and what do they reveal?\n\nLast week, we learned Donald Trump had been charged with a crime. Now we know the former US president faces 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nAlthough falsifying records are usually treated as lesser misdemeanours, Mr Trump is accused of committing felony offences. That denotes a more serious crime, which could include prison time if a maximum sentence is given.\n\n\"At its core, this case today is one with allegations like so many of our white-collar cases,\" New York City District Attorney Alvin Bragg said of the charges his office has brought against the former president. \"Allegations that someone lied, again and again, to protect their interests and evade the laws to which we are all held accountable.\"\n\nMr Trump - who pleaded not guilty to all the charges - insisted after leaving the courthouse that there was no case to answer. \"There was nothing done illegally!\" he posted on his social media website.\n\nThat, however, will be for a jury to decide. In the meantime, here are the details of the historic first-ever criminal indictment of a former president.\n\nDonald Trump faces 34 felony charges of falsifying business records in the first degree .\n\nThe charges all relate to a $130,000 hush-money payment by lawyer Michael Cohen to adult film star Stormy Daniels just before 2016 election in order to prevent her from talking about her allegations that she had an affair with Mr Trump in 2007.\n\nIn the court documents, Cohen is referred to as Lawyer A and Stormy Daniels as Woman 2.\n\nThe first line of the Statement of Facts, a document that accompanied the indictment, spells out the prosecution case: The defendant DONALD J. TRUMP repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nNew York's case against Mr Trump hinges on how Cohen was compensated for those hush-money payments.\n\nIn 2017, after becoming president, Mr Trump met with Cohen in the White House. Shortly thereafter - and over the course of 10 months - Mr Trump began sending cheques from a trust handling his assets, and later from his own bank account, to Cohen.\n\nThose cheques were registered as \"legal fees,\" but Cohen says they were, in fact, reimbursements for the hush-money payment.\n\nThe prosecution case states: The payment records, kept and maintained by the Trump Organization, were false New York business records. In truth, there was no retainer agreement, and Lawyer A was not being paid for legal services rendered in 2017. The Defendant caused his entities' business records to be falsified to disguise his and others' criminal conduct.\n\nMr Bragg alleges that Mr Trump falsified the true nature of the payments because those payments were made in support of a crime. While hush-money payments are not by themselves illegal, spending money to help a presidential campaign but not disclosing it violates federal campaign finance law.\n\nCohen was convicted of just such a violation for not disclosing his payment to Ms Daniels. By reimbursing Cohen for that payment, Mr Bragg asserts, Mr Trump is tied to that criminal act - and it makes his falsification of business record a more serious offence.\n\nMr Trump's defenders argue that is a legal stretch, and that this is a politically-motivated prosecution.\n\nMr Bragg cites two other examples of hush-money payments by Mr Trump's campaign. These payments, he says, support the prosecution case that Mr Trump knew his payments to Cohen were part of an illegal attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"The defendant orchestrated a scheme with others to influence the 2016 presidential election by identifying and purchasing negative information about him to suppress its publication and benefit the defendant's electoral prospects,\" the indictment's Statement of Facts asserts. \"In order to execute the unlawful scheme, the participants violated election laws and made and caused false entries in the business records of various entities in New York.\"\n\nIn one case, a doorman who said he knew Mr Trump had a child out of wedlock received $30,000. In another, a second woman who claimed she had an an affair with Mr Trump received $150,000. Mr Trump has denied the affair.\n\nThese payments came from the tabloid National Enquirer magazine and its then-publisher, David Pecker, who Mr Bragg says co-ordinated with Mr Trump to suppress potentially damaging information from seeing the light of day. As a reward, the indictment notes, Mr Pecker received an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration.\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nThousands have gathered in Rome to pay their respects to the late pontiff.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg's ties to billionaire George Soros are not as close as Republicans claim\n\nAs Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg inches closer to a possible indictment against former President Donald Trump , Republicans have launched a barrage of attacks against the Democratic district attorney and his alleged ties to billionaire George Soros .\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican and the party's fourth-ranking leader in the House, tweeted Monday that Bragg \"took one million dollars from George Soros.\" Sen. J.D. Vance, an Ohio Republican whose 2022 campaign received millions of dollars in support from GOP megadonor and investor Peter Thiel, said in a tweet that \"Alvin Bragg is bought by George Soros.\"\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, is talking to allies about using his panel to scrutinize Bragg's links to Soros as Trump targets Bragg ahead of a likely indictment, according to a GOP strategist close to Jordan. It fits into a larger GOP strategy to discredit the Manhattan probe: Jordan co-signed a letter calling on Bragg to testify before Congress, and questioned whether the Manhattan DA's investigation into Trump used federal funds.\n\nAs Bragg prepares the expected first-ever indictment of a former president, Trump's allies have launched a barrage of attacks against the Democratic district attorney. They have found a familiar target in Soros, whose hundreds of millions of dollars in donations to back Democratic political campaigns and scathing criticism of Trump have made him a boogeyman in Republican circles for well over a decade. Democrats and outside experts have frequently described the attacks on Soros, who is Jewish, as antisemitic.\n\nBut the reality of Bragg's links to Soros does not entirely match the picture painted by Republican lawmakers who aim to use ties between the men to discredit the probe, according to records and people familiar with both men.\n\nRepresentatives for Bragg and Jordan did not return requests for comment.\n\nSoros' connection to Bragg - and possible influence on his investigation into Trump - are not as clear as Republicans leaders would make them sound. There's no proof Bragg is \"bought by Soros,\" as Vance puts it.\n\nA Soros advisor, who declined to be named to speak openly about private matters, said the billionaire \"has never met or spoken to Alvin Bragg.\"\n\nMost of the criticism of Bragg appears to stem from support, and later political pressure, he received from the racial justice group Color of Change, which tries to influence government and corporate policy around the country. Soros donated $1 million to the Color of Change PAC in 2021. The Soros-funded Open Society Policy Center also piled $7 million into the group's separate 501(c)(4) arm that year.\n\nYet, those familiar with the contributions said that the money the billionaire and his organization gave to Color of Change was not earmarked to back Bragg's campaign, or intended to be used in an effort to pressure the DA.\n\nSoros' $1 million check to the Color of Change PAC, the largest individual donation it received in the 2022 election cycle, came days after it endorsed Bragg for district attorney and pledged more than $1 million in spending to support his candidacy, according to records.\n\nA Color of Change official, who declined to be named to speak openly about private matters, told CNBC that the group ended up spending around $500,000 to back Bragg.\n\nThere is also no indication the Open Society Policy Center's donation was directed toward an eventual Color of Change campaign to influence Bragg. In 2022, a year after the Color of Change received the $7 million sum from the Soros-funded group, a nonprofit arm of the organization helped to pressure Bragg not to prosecute Tracy McCarter , who was charged with murdering her estranged husband.\n\nAs part of the campaign, Color of Change twice printed open letters in The New York Times calling for Bragg to drop the charges, according to a judge who pushed back on the Manhattan DA's decision not to prosecute. The group also ran digital ads on Facebook, according to the platform's ad archive. One features people outlining the arguments of McCarter's supporters for dropping the charges: that she acted in self-defense against domestic violence.\n\nThe funding from Soros' nonprofit was not targeted toward the campaign to support McCarter, the Color of Change official told CNBC. Open Society's website says the group's donation was intended \"to support [Color of Change]'s social welfare activities\" over the course of five years.\n\nRashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, did not return requests for an interview before publication of this story. Robinson has tweeted in recent days in an apparent response to Republican attacks against Color of Change and its funding from Soros.\n\n\"Make no mistake, over the next couple of days as more news about potential consequences for Trump circulates, we will see a flood of anti-Black and antisemitic attacks from the former President and his supporters and enablers,\" Robinson said. \"They will attack those of us doing the work like @ColorOfChange n allies & those funding it.\"\n\nColor of Change has focused its campaigns largely on policies that affect Black Americans.\n\nWhile Soros' involvement with Bragg appears to have come through his Color of Change donations, two of his family members have a more direct link to the Manhattan DA. Months before Bragg won a 2021 Democratic primary on his way to becoming Manhattan DA, George Soros' son, Jonathan, and his wife, combined to donate $20,000 to Bragg's campaign, state records show.\n\nJonathan Soros did not return requests for comment.\n\nFollow our live coverage of the New York grand jury's indictment of former President Donald Trump .\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Manhattan DA blasts Trump for trying to delay hush money trial over publicity he's 'actively seeking'\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg urged a judge to reject an eleventh-hour bid by Donald Trump to delay his upcoming criminal hush money trial due to biased media coverage.\n\nBragg, who accuses Trump of falsifying business records in a scheme to conceal a payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, said in a court filing shared Wednesday that the former president himself is to blame for the rabid press.\n\nLatest Trump trial update: Verdict watch in hush money case\n\nTrump's \"own incessant rhetoric is generating significant publicity, and it would be perverse to reward [him] with an adjournment based on media attention he is actively seeking,\" Bragg told New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan.\n\nTrump \"simply cannot have it both ways: complaining about the prejudicial effect of pretrial publicity, while seeking to pollute the jury pool himself by making baseless and inflammatory accusations about this trial, specific witnesses, individual prosecutors, and the Court itself,\" Bragg wrote.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is also wrong to claim that the deluge of publicity means he can't get a fair jury, the D.A. wrote.\n\nAn \"indefinite adjournment\" is also unwarranted, Bragg added, because the media's focus on the case is unlikely to recede.\n\nTrump last month asked for a \"significant\" delay of the trial - which is set to begin jury selection on April 15 - until the publicity surrounding it \"subsides.\"\n\nThat request marked Trump's eighth attempt to push back the start of the trial, Bragg noted in his filing Wednesday.\n\nThe D.A. argued that Trump has failed to show either that the press coverage of the case has been prejudicial to him, or that the jury pool has been tainted.\n\nAnd since the publicity is likely to increase, the solution \"is thus to hold this trial sooner rather than later,\" Bragg wrote.\n\nTrump's attorneys argued that the pool of potential jurors has been exposed to \"huge amounts of biased and unfair media coverage,\" and that many of them \"already wrongfully believe that President Trump is guilty.\"\n\nAfter that delay request was filed, Merchan imposed a gag order barring Trump from public remarks about likely witnesses and jurors, and from making certain statements about other figures involved in the case and their family members.\n\nTrump responded with a social media tirade against the judge and the case, while also targeting the judge's adult daughter over her work for a Democratic political firm. At least one of Trump's posts on Truth Social included the daughter's full name and picture.\n\nBragg on Monday urged Merchan to expand the gag order, calling Trump's rhetoric \"dangerous, violent, and reprehensible.\"\n\nMerchan did so Monday night, explicitly prohibiting Trump from attacking family members of the court and the district attorney.\n\n\"The average observer must now, after hearing Defendant's recent attacks, draw the conclusion that if they become involved in these proceedings, even tangentially, they should worry not only for themselves, but for their loved ones as well,\" Merchan wrote in that order.\n\n\"Such concerns will undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitutes a direct attack on the Rule of Law itself.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers now are once again trying to get the judge removed from the case by pointing to his daughter's work for Authentic Campaigns, which lists among its clients Trump's Democratic rival, President Joe Biden.\n\nMerchan had already rejected a prior attempt for his recusal, which similarly argued that the daughter's political career created an appearance of bias.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Bragg pushes back after House Republicans escalate oversight into Trump hush money case\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has dismissed another letter by three House Republican chairmen seeking more information related to the hush money probe that could lead to an indictment of former President Donald Trump .\n\nIn a letter to Bragg on Saturday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer and Administration Committee Chairman Bryan Steil argued that Congress should be privy to documents and testimony in the ongoing investigation into a $130,000 payment made during Trump's 2016 campaign to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\n\"Contrary to the central argument set forth in your letter, this matter does not simply involve local or state interests,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Rather, the potential criminal indictment of a former President of the United States by an elected local prosecutor of the opposing political party (and who will face the prospect of re-election) implicates substantial federal interests, particularly in a jurisdiction where trial-level judges also are popularly elected.\"\n\nRead more from NBC News: Trump lawyer calls post attacking Bragg 'ill-advised' Trump rallies in Waco and vows to 'destroy the deep state' Trump's base splinters on Ron DeSantis\n\nBragg, who had fired back last week at the Republicans for requesting his testimony before Congress about the investigation, pushed back again in a statement shared on Twitter Saturday evening\n\n\"We evaluate cases in our jurisdiction based on the facts, the law, and the evidence. It is not appropriate for Congress to interfere with pending local investigations,\" Bragg wrote. \"The unprecedented inquiry by federal elected officials into an ongoing matter serves only to hinder, disrupt and undermine the legitimate work of our dedicated prosecutors.\"\n\nThe three Republican chairs had requested Bragg's testimony in a letter last week. \"You are reportedly about to engage in an unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority: the indictment of a former president of the United States and current declared candidate for that office,\" they wrote Monday.\n\nTheir request came after Trump falsely predicted last weekend in a post to his social media platform Truth Social that he would be arrested Tuesday. A decision is still pending in the Manhattan grand jury probe.\n\nThe move marked the first investigatory action from the committees after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., vowed to scrutinize the people who have been investigating Trump.\n\nThe Manhattan DA's office then slammed the Republicans on Thursday, arguing they had overstepped with their request. Leslie Dubeck, general counsel for the Manhattan DA's office, called their request for Bragg's testimony \"an unprecedented inquiry into a pending local prosecution,\" which \"only came after Donald Trump created a false expectation that he would be arrested the next day and his lawyers reportedly urged you to intervene.\"\n\nSince then, Trump has escalated his attacks against Bragg and the probe, warning of \"potential death and destruction\" if the DA indicts him in a Truth Social post early Friday.\n\nLater that day, two law enforcement sources told NBC News that the FBI and New York Police Department were investigating a letter containing a death threat and white powder mailed to Bragg's office.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump is about to face trial on criminal hush money charges. Here's what to know\n\nDonald Trump has used every legal tool at his disposal to try to dismiss, diminish or delay the four active criminal cases against him.\n\nBut on Monday, barring a last-minute court intervention, Trump will become the first former president ever to be tried on felony charges .\n\nLatest Trump trial update: Verdict watch in hush money case\n\nThe trial in New York Supreme Court centers on allegations that Trump falsified business records as part of a scheme to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment in 2016 to porn star Stormy Daniels, who says she had an extramarital affair with Trump years earlier.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg accuses Trump of using a \"catch and kill\" tactic to hide damaging information from voters ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThis case may be the only one of Trump's 88 criminal charges across four separate cases to make it to trial before the Nov. 5 presidential election.\n\nIf he is convicted in this case, the 77-year-old ex-president could be sentenced to serve time at New York's notorious Rikers Island jail complex or in a state prison.\n\nHere is what to know about the historic trial:\n\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.\n\nUnder New York law , a person is guilty of that crime when their records are falsified with the intent to commit or conceal another crime.\n\nThe DA alleges Trump and others violated election laws to carry out an illegal scheme to influence the 2016 election, by buying and suppressing negative information about him.\n\nCentral to Bragg's case is Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney. In 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance charges related to hush money payments made to two women before the 2016 election.\n\nCohen is expected to be a key witness in the trial, where he will say Trump directed him to make those payments.\n\nTo pay Daniels covertly, the DA alleges, Cohen opened a bank account for a shell company he had created specifically to facilitate the payment. He then transferred $131,000 into that account from a home equity line of credit. On Oct. 27, less than two weeks before the 2016 election, Cohen wired $130,000 to Daniels' lawyer in exchange for her silence about the alleged tryst with Trump.\n\nAfter the election, Bragg says, Trump reimbursed Cohen for the payment through a series of monthly checks, processed by the Trump Organization, which recorded them as payments for legal services rendered in 2017 through a retainer agreement.\n\nThose records were false, the DA alleges.\n\nTrump and Cohen were also allegedly involved in a 2016 hush money payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who received $150,000 from the then-publisher of the National Enquirer to keep quiet about her own alleged affair with Trump.\n\nBragg also cites a $30,000 payment by that publisher, American Media Inc., to a former Trump Tower doorman for the rights to a story about Trump fathering a child out of wedlock. After determining that the story was untrue, the publisher's CEO David Pecker wanted to end the deal - but he held off until after the 2016 election at Cohen's instruction, the DA alleges.\n\nThe trial was originally scheduled to start March 25, but it was delayed until Monday to give Trump's team time to look at some recently acquired documents.\n\nThe trial will begin with the process of selecting 12 jurors, plus alternates.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan has said he expects the trial will last about six weeks.\n\nYes, Trump will be there. New York law requires defendants to attend their trials, with few exceptions.\n\nTrump has voluntarily attended numerous hearings in the hush money case and his other criminal cases, generating waves of mainstream media attention that his regular campaign events no longer muster.\n\nTrump's attorney, Will Scharf, said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that, depending on the trial's progress, Trump and the trial team will decide whether or not to take the stand.\n\n\"I would say that, I think if he does take the stand President Trump will be a compelling witness. He did nothing wrong here,\" he said. \"The truth is absolutely on his side, so that's a decision that's going to have to be made down the road.\"\n\nTrump had also been scheduled to sit for a deposition Monday in a separate lawsuit related to the public merger of his media company, Trump Media & Technology Group , but that appearance was reportedly postponed.\n\nFalsifying business records in the first degree is a Class E felony that carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison. But the sentence a defendant ultimately receives is often far below the maximum, and Trump's age and lack of a prior conviction could also play in his favor in any potential sentencing decision.\n\nHis antagonism toward presiding Judge Merchan and others related to the case - including the judge's daughter - may work against him, however.\n\n\"I think there is a substantial risk that he will be convicted and that he will face a sentence of incarceration,\" said Norm Eisen, a legal analyst who aided House Democrats during Trump's first impeachment, in a press briefing Thursday previewing the hush money trial.\n\n\"When you have the falsification of business records that is intended to aid, conceal or commit serious crimes, that receives sentences of jail time regularly,\" Eisen said.\n\nTrump can continue to run for office even if he is convicted and jailed.\n\nCohen and Daniels are expected to take the stand in the trial. But prosecutors have compiled a list of roughly a dozen other potential witnesses, including McDougal and Pecker, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told NBC News.\n\nThat same source told NBC that the potential defense witness list could include Trump himself.\n\nTrump has not yet said if he plans to testify in his defense. When he took the stand in November in his New York civil business fraud case, Trump angrily lashed out at the judge, the state's attorney general and many other \"haters.\"\n\nBradley Smith, a former commissioner with the Federal Election Commission, is another potential defense witness, NBC reported.\n\nTrump's attorneys have thrown the kitchen sink at the trial in hopes of a delay. They have made more than 10 attempts to push it later, three of which came in last-minute appeals filed in the final week before jury selection.\n\nTrump, as he has done in his other legal battles, has wielded his public following as a weapon against the case.\n\nIn regular social media diatribes and interviews, he has railed against the judge, the DA, key witnesses and various others, while claiming that all of his criminal charges are part of a Biden administration conspiracy to damage his presidential bid.\n\nMerchan imposed a gag order on Trump and then expanded it after the former president repeatedly criticized the judge's daughter over her work for a Democratic political consultant. Trump's legal team has repeatedly demanded that Merchan recuse himself due to his daughter's political activities. Merchan declined to do so last year.\n\nIn a video posted to Truth Social on Thursday, Trump decried the gag order, falsely claiming, \"it only happens to me,\" and asserting, \"there's never been a judge more conflicted than this one.\"\n\nScharf, Trump's attorney, said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that the gag order was \"wildly unconstitutional.\" It \"just goes to show how outrageous this whole process has been,\" he added.\n\n- CNBC's Melina Khan contributed to this report.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

Those materials were sent to Trump by last June, the DA said.\n\nTrump \"raised no concerns\" about whether those efforts were sufficient until last week, Bragg said.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement that Bragg agreed to a delay \"after conceding serious discovery violations.\"\n\n\"President Trump and his counsel have been consistent and steadfast that this case has no basis in law or fact, and should be dismissed,\" Cheung said.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in the case, which is one of four criminal prosecutions he faces while also preparing to run against President Joe Biden in November's presidential election.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

After filing the formal notice, his lawyers now have six months to submit a brief laying out their arguments in greater detail.\n\nThe case stemmed from a $130,000 payment Trump's former personal lawyer made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says she had some years earlier with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump, a Republican businessman-turned-politician, was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up the payment. Trump argued that the case, brought by Democratic Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg , was an effort to harm his 2024 presidential election campaign .\n\n\"The misuse of the criminal law by the Manhattan DA to target President Trump sets a dangerous precedent, and we look forward to the case being dismissed on appeal,\" Robert Giuffra, a lawyer who will be handling Trump's appeal, said in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Bragg's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

      "text": "Bragg lays out alternatives to dismissing Trump's hush money conviction\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's (D) office opposes dismissing President-elect Trump's hush money charges but would accept halting the proceedings while he is in office, according to court documents made public Tuesday.\n\nBragg previously signaled he would oppose Trump's effort to outright toss the case , and the new filing provides prosecutors' most extensive arguments yet about how Trump's return to the White House should impact the first criminal prosecution of a former president.\n\nThe 82-page brief does not plainly spell out the state's preference for what should happen, instead walking through several options. Prosecutors left the door open to sentencing Trump before his inauguration but acknowledged Trump's vows to stop it.\n\n\"The extreme remedy of dismissing the indictment and vacating the jury verdict is not warranted in light of multiple alternative accommodations that would fully address the concerns raised by presidential immunity,\" Assistant District Attorney Christopher Conroy wrote.\n\nNo further briefs are expected from either side. Next, New York Judge Juan Merchan, who oversaw the trial, will issue a ruling on the future of the case, a decision that could come at any time.\n\nProsecutors insisted Trump's immunity as a sitting president does not kick in until his inauguration, rejecting Trump's argument that he already has the protections as president-elect and the case must immediately end.\n\nBut the district attorney's office did not dispute that once Trump returns to the White House, the judge would be justified in halting the case or taking additional other steps.\n\nThat would leave open the possibility that Trump could still proceed to sentencing in 2029, after he leaves office.\n\nAlternatively, state prosecutors said the judge could terminate the case without tossing Trump's conviction, noting a jury verdict removed the presumption of innocence, he was never sentenced and his conviction was \"neither affirmed nor reversed\" on appeal because of presidential immunity.\n\nThis spring, a New York jury found Trump guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records stemming from a hush money payment to a porn actor.\n\n\"On the one hand, this remedy would prevent defendant from being burdened during his presidency by an ongoing criminal proceeding,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\n\"On the other hand, this remedy would not precipitously discard aspects of this criminal proceeding that predated defendant's presidency, including the meaningful fact that defendant was indicted and found guilty by a jury of his peers, while also acknowledging that the proceedings were not subject to appellate review before defendant's immunity arose,\" the brief continued.\n\nTrump was scheduled to be sentenced last month, but Merchan indefinitely adjourned the hearing after delaying the date several times, making it unlikely the former president will face any punishment before returning to the White House - if at all.\n\nTrump's lawyers have argued his status as president-elect requires Merchan to immediately toss the entirety of the prosecution, warning they will appeal in federal court if he tries to move along toward sentencing.\n\n\"Wrongly continuing proceedings in this failed lawfare case disrupts President Trump's transition efforts and his preparations to wield the full Article II executive power authorized by the Constitution pursuant to the overwhelming national mandate granted to him by the American people on November 5, 2024,\" Trump's attorneys wrote last week.\n\nProsecutors pushed back in their new filing, noting the trial court proceedings are still pending because of Trump's own request for delay.\n\n\"Having filed those motions to dismiss and then sought repeated adjournments of sentencing to permit their determination by this Court, it is particularly brazen for defendant to argue that the Supremacy Clause bars the Court from taking any action on the motions defendant himself filed,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nTrump's other criminal cases have similarly faltered in the wake of his election victory. Special counsel Jack Smith dismissed all charges in Trump's federal criminal cases, and the president-elect has similarly moved to dismiss his Georgia case, which already remains frozen on a pretrial appeal.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

      "text": "Trump team rejects Bragg's 'Dark Dream Scenario' for hush money case\n\nPresident-elect Trump's attorneys condemned Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's (D) suggested alternatives to dismissing Trump's hush money criminal conviction, going as far to call one of them \"unhinged\" and \"absurd\" Friday.\n\nIt remains unclear if New York Judge Juan Merchan will consider the new filing , as he previously wrote he would only accept one written brief from each side. It is currently up to the judge to determine how to proceed in the case.\n\nWith his return to the White House imminent, Trump has argued the court is compelled to wipe the jury's verdict finding him guilty of 34 felonies and dismiss the case in its entirety.  Bragg pushed back in a filing earlier this week, instead suggesting the judge could freeze the case or make other accommodations that would keep the jury's guilty verdict intact.\n\n\"DA Bragg's interest in maintaining the jury's verdicts as a notch in whatever belt he plans to wear to campaign events in 2025 is not a basis for interfering with the Executive Branch,\" Trump attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove replied Friday, referencing that Bragg is up for reelection next year.\n\nThe attorneys, whom Trump has nominated to senior Justice Department roles in his next administration, in particular condemned Bragg's alternative suggestion that the judge could treat the case as if Trump had died.\n\nIn that scenario, the court would terminate the proceedings after updating the case file to note the verdict removed the presumption of innocence, Trump was never sentenced and that his conviction was neither affirmed nor reversed on appeal.\n\nBlanche and Bove called the district attorney's office's (DANY) proposal \"unhinged,\" \"absurd\" and a \"Dark Dream Scenario.\"\n\n\"As a further illustration of DA Bragg's desperation to avoid legally mandated dismissal, DANY proposes that the Court pretend as if one of the assassination attempts against President Trump had been successful,\" they wrote.\n\nTrump's lawyers also invoked Sen. John Fetterman's (D-Pa.) suggestion this week that Trump deserves a pardon and that the case was \"weaponizing the judiciary,\" saying the Democratic senator's summary \"is apt.\"\n\nThe New York jury convicted Trump this spring on 34 counts of falsifying business records stemming from a 2016 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to stay quiet about an alleged affair with Trump - who denies the affair and any wrongdoing related to the payment - during his campaign. Prosecutors accused Trump of illegally concealing the payment with the intent to unlawfully influence that year's election.\n\nFollowing last month's election, Trump's legal team has looked to toss the case and his three other criminal indictments that hadn't reached trial, insisting his status as president-elect provides him the same protections as a sitting president against criminal prosecution.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith agreed to dismiss his two federal indictments of Trump on election interference and documents charges, and Trump has meanwhile asked courts in Georgia to do the same in his state election interference case.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

      "text": "Who is Alvin Bragg? District attorney who prosecuted Trump says he was just doing his job\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - When Alvin Bragg took office as Manhattan district attorney in 2022, he stunned the public and his own staff by pausing an investigation into former President Donald Trump that appeared to be hurtling toward an indictment.\n\nTwo top prosecutors were so upset with the decision, they quit. One called Bragg's hesitation to bring a case against Trump \"a grave failure of justice.\"\n\nNow, Bragg has cemented his place in history as the first prosecutor to win a criminal conviction of a former U.S. president.\n\nSpeaking after the verdict Thursday, Bragg summed up his role by saying, simply, \"I did my job.\"\n\n\"Our job is to follow the facts and the law without fear or favor, and that's exactly what we did here,\" he told reporters.\n\nTrump and his supporters insist Bragg, a Democrat, had a vendetta against the former president and presumptive Republican nominee. He has relentlessly accused Bragg of manufacturing a baseless case for political reasons.\n\nHere's a look at Bragg's background, his time in office and his history regarding Trump.\n\nBragg, 50, grew up in Harlem when New York City struggled with high crime. He once had a knife held to his throat and has talked about being held at gunpoint six times while growing up, including three times by police officers.\n\nWhen he was 15, one officer stuck a gun in his face and wrongly accused him of being a drug dealer as the teen walked to buy groceries for his father. Bragg filed a complaint over the incident.\n\nBragg went on to graduate from Harvard Law School. He began his career as a criminal defense and civil rights lawyer, went on to the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan and then worked at the New York attorney general's office, where he had his first legal tussles with Trump.\n\nBragg was a senior lawyer in the state attorney general's office in 2018, when it was engaged in multiple battles with Trump, related both to his White House policies and his stewardship of his private charitable foundation. Bragg directly oversaw a lawsuit against the foundation. Trump settled, agreeing to the foundation's dissolution, and a judge fined him $2 million.\n\nBragg left the attorney general's office in late 2018 and became a professor at New York Law School.\n\nBragg ran for Manhattan district attorney in 2021, campaigning on a platform of \"justice and public safety\" in a crowded Democratic primary.\n\nIn some ways, he was the perfect candidate for predominantly Democratic Manhattan a year after the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd had started a national reckoning with how the criminal justice system has treated Black people and others of color. Bragg, who is Black, had worked as a prosecutor but had personal experience with over-policing of the city's Black community.\n\nHe was also, he suggested at the time, well positioned to take over the criminal investigation into Trump and his company from Cyrus Vance Jr., the outgoing DA.\n\nDuring the race, Bragg was asked repeatedly how he would handle the probe. His standard answer was to cite his work on Trump-related lawsuits while he was in the attorney general's office, and his willingness to hold powerful figures accountable.\n\n\"I don't know where this investigation will go. I don't want to prejudge it. But, these types of investigations - white-collar investigations - I've been involved with for years, both doing them myself and also supervising them,\" Bragg told The Associated Press at the time.\n\nVance's investigation was focused then on whether Trump had committed fraud by lying about the value of his assets on financial statements given to banks and others.\n\nAfter winning the primary, Bragg cruised to victory in the general election.\n\nBragg became Manhattan's first Black district attorney in January of 2022. He was challenged over his approach to the job nearly from the start.\n\nOne of his first steps was a memo that, among other things, instructed prosecutors not to seek jail time for some low-level offenses, such as minor marijuana possession and sale (the state later legalized such possession) and to charge some armed robberies in commercial settings as misdemeanor petit larcenies.\n\nPolice leaders, conservative media and some centrist Democrats accused him of being soft on criminals during a pandemic-era crime spike. Bragg's staff said the memo had been mischaracterized, but his office later walked back portions of the directive.\n\nDuring the 2022 governor's race, Republican candidate Lee Zeldin promised that, if elected, he would try to remove Bragg from office.\n\nBragg faced criticism again this year when he declined to seek pretrial detention for some men accused of brawling with police officers in Times Square.\n\nThe decision drew criticism from Gov. Kathy Hochul, a fellow Democrat. Bragg defended himself, telling reporters, \"the only thing worse than failing to bring perpetrators to justice would be to ensnare innocent people in the criminal justice system.\"\n\nHis investigators later determined that several men initially arrested played only a minor role in the fight or weren't even there.\n\nBragg's most surprising early move as district attorney was to halt the investigation into whether Trump had lied on financial statements.\n\nThe lead prosecutor on that probe, Mark Pomerantz, resigned in anger.\n\nBut the investigation wasn't over. It was just changing.\n\nIn 2022, Bragg's office persuaded the Trump Organization's longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, to plead guilty to evading taxes on fringe benefits, including a luxury car and rent-free apartment. Later that year, the DA's office won a conviction of Trump's company on similar tax charges.\n\nEmboldened by those victories, Bragg convened another grand jury, which indicted Trump in April of 2023 on charges that he falsified records at his company to conceal a scheme to pay hush money to keep a sex scandal from damaging his run for president in 2016. Trump denied any wrongdoing.\n\nA jury convicted Trump on those charges Thursday.\n\nTrump and his allies have slammed Bragg as a partisan in the guise of a prosecutor, claiming he brought the case solely to damage Trump's chances of regaining the White House.\n\nTrump has called Bragg an \"animal\" and a \"degenerate psychopath,\" once made a social media post of himself holding a baseball bat next to a picture of Bragg, and described him Friday as \"a failed D.A.\"\n\nHe has shrugged off Trump's accusations.\n\n\"Many voices out there,\" Bragg said Thursday. \"The only voice that matters is the voice of the jury. And the jury has spoken.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Why Alvin Bragg's 'Jackson Pollock' prosecution is more likely to produce a hung jury\n\nAbstract artist Jackson Pollock once said that his paintings have no objective meaning, so the best way for people to enjoy them is to stop looking for it.\n\nFor many of us, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has created a new school of abstract law where there is no need for objective meaning. The jury is simply supposed to enjoy it for what it is: a chance to convict Donald Trump.\n\nPollock was famous for his painting drips on large canvases. Bragg has achieved the same effect by regenerating a dead misdemeanor on falsifying business records as 34 felony counts. To achieve that extraordinary goal, he has alleged that the document violations (which expired long ago under the statute of limitations) were committed to hide some other crime.\n\nOriginally, Bragg vaguely referenced four crimes and there have been months of confusion was to what he was specifically alleging as his criminal theories. Even legal analysts on CNN and MSNBC have continued to question the specific allegations against Trump as we head into closing arguments.\n\nAs it stands, there are three crimes that have been referenced by prosecutors: state and federal election violations and taxation violations.\n\nBragg's legal vision for non-objective indictments was greatly advanced by Judge Juan Merchan, who will allow the jury to reach different rulings on what crime is actually evident in Bragg's paint splatters.\n\nMerchan has even ruled that the jurors can disagree on what actually occurred in terms of the second crime. This means there could be three groups of four jurors, with one believing that there was a conspiracy to conceal a state election violation, another believing there was a federal election violation (which Bragg cannot enforce), and a third believing there was a tax violation, respectively. Nonetheless, Merchan will treat that as a unanimous verdict.\n\nIn other words, they could look at the indictment and see vastly different shapes, but still send Trump to prison on their interpretations.\n\nMoreover, Michael Cohen is the sole witness even to address the elements of any of these crimes. Cohen is a convicted serial perjurer and disbarred attorney who appears to have lied again during the trial. Even if they consider his testimony, there is no direct corroboration in evidence on Trump's intent or knowledge. As a result, the prosecutors will rely on circumstantial evidence to support whichever interpretation the jurors will buy.\n\nFaced with charges that can mean different things to different jurors, Trump's team will have to focus on the spaces between the paint drips; the canvas itself.\n\nAll of this case is based on the payment for a non-disclosure agreement that is perfectly legal and indeed common in business and politics. The Trump team needs to stop dancing around the NDA.\n\nThe jury likely believes that Trump knew of the NDA and supported it. The defense has to emphasize the testimony of David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Inquirer, that he killed stories for a variety of celebrities and politicians, including Rahm Emmanuel and Arnold Schwarzenegger. He also said that he killed stories for Trump for years before he even thought of running for president.\n\nThey need to emphasize the testimony of multiple witnesses that Trump seemed to want to avoid embarrassment to his family. He was also the host of a popular television show and an international businessman. The payment of a couple hundred thousand to kill stories is considered a cost of doing business for most celebrities, particularly those who have television contracts with provisions allowing cancellation for scandals.\n\nIn the instructions, the court will tell the jurors that payments cannot be campaign contributions if they would have been made anyway regardless of the campaign.\n\nThey also need to point out other gaps. It was not Trump who listed payments as legal expenses or retainer payments. Witnesses said that payments to lawyers are routinely recorded as legal expenses.  Indeed, it is not clear how the money should have been denominated but the decision was being made by others in the Trump organization and by Cohen himself.\n\nMoreover, on the characterization of payments as part of a \"retainer,\" the other party to that characterization was former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. He is currently in prison in New York , but was not called by the prosecution. The prosecutors elected to rely entirely on Michael Cohen with various witnesses, including Cohen, referencing Weisselberg's decision on how to pay the money.\n\nThat made the canvas itself largely Michael Cohen. All of this is held together by a witness who admitted that he has lied to banks, Congress, prosecutors, business associates, and virtually every creature that has ever walked or crawled on the face of the Earth. He also lied in front of the jury about the critical call where he said that he told Trump about the NDA payment.\n\nThe defense showed that that 96-second-long call was to Trump's bodyguard, Keith Schiller, in late October 2016. It was preceded and followed by text messages that indicated that their conversation was actually about a teenager harassing Cohen.\n\nMoreover, Cohen admitted to making millions by bashing Trump, and that he has a personal interest in his conviction.\n\nYou can throw paint on Cohen all day, but it will not cover up the fact that he is a pathological liar and grifter.\n\nThat is why I still believe that a hung jury might even be the most likely possibility. That may change when we see Judge Merchan's final instructions. However, the only thing worse in New York than being a Trump supporter is being a chump. To rely solely on Cohen and not even call someone like Weisselberg is to play these jurors as chumps.\n\nPollock was doing more than just throwing paint at a canvas. As Pablo Picasso said, \"there is no abstract art. You must always start with something. Afterward you can remove all traces of reality.\" Bragg started with nothing and sold it as a legal abstraction.\n\nJonathan Turley is the J.B. and Maurice C.

      "text": "Alvin Bragg agrees to appear before House Judiciary following Trump sentencing\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) has agreed to appear before the House Judiciary Committee on July 12, the day after former President Trump's sentencing following his conviction in New York.\n\nOne of the top prosecutors in the case, Matthew Colangelo, will also appear before the panel.\n\nThe hearing will be a major moment for the House GOP's Oversight of those responsible for bringing charges against Trump.\n\nBragg's appearance following the hush money trial makes him the first such prosecutor to appear before the panel after others who have filed charges against Trump have largely rebuffed demands from Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), saying the invitations amount to inappropriate efforts to interfere in their ongoing investigations.\n\nBragg agreed to the invitation only after the conclusion of Trump's trial, delaying his appearance by about a month as he said it would be improper to speak publicly on the case outside of a courtroom before a judge has fully weighed punishment for the former president.\n\n\"The Manhattan D.A.'s Office is proud to play a crucial role in upholding and enforcing the rule of law for the people of New York. It undermines the rule of law to spread dangerous misinformation, baseless claims, and conspiracy theories following the jury's return of a full-count felony conviction in People v. Trump,\" Bragg's office said in a statement.\n\n\"Nonetheless, we respect our government institutions and plan to appear voluntarily before the subcommittee after sentencing.\"\n\nColangelo's appearance is also notable, as the House Judiciary Committee has demanded information about him from multiple entities, including the Justice Department. Colangelo, who worked as a prosecutor in New York, including on cases involving the Trump family, worked at the Justice Department before returning to New York to work for Bragg's team. Colangelo gave the opening arguments during Trump's trial.\n\nJordan plans to still hold a hearing on the case Thursday - the original date he asked for Bragg to appear - and it will include testimony from those not involved in the trial, such as Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey (R).\n\nThe agreement for Bragg and Colangelo's July testimony comes hours after the Justice Department told the committee it had done a \"comprehensive\" search of their records, failing to find any communications between the department and Bragg's office.\n\nThe letter obtained by The Hill seeks to quash what Attorney General Merrick Garland has called a conspiracy theory floated by Republican lawmakers that federal prosecutors were in any way involved with Bragg's decision to bring charges against Trump.\n\n\"We found none,\" Carlos Uriarte, the head of legislative affairs for the Justice Department, wrote of what resulted from their search.\n\n\"This is unsurprising. The District Attorney's office is a separate entity from the Department. The Department does not supervise the work of the District Attorney's office, does not approve its charging decisions, and does not try its cases. The Department has no control over the District Attorney, just as the District Attorney has no control over the Department. The Committee knows this.\"\n\n\"Our extraordinary efforts to respond to your speculation should put it to rest,\" he added later.\n\nWhile Trump allies have complained both about the prosecutor and judge involved in his trial, it was a jury agreed to by both prosecutors and Trump's legal team that found him guilty on every single one of the 34 counts brought by Bragg.\n\nJurors agreed Trump falsified business records by concealing hush money payments made to an adult film star ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nUpdated at 1:17 p.m.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

He called it a \"frightening, well-planned, targeted murder.\"\n\nThompson was killed outside the Hilton Midtown hotel before the company's annual investor meeting. The suspect fled, and a days-long manhunt ensued.\n\nMangione, 26, has been in custody since last week and is being held in a Pennsylvania prison after he was spotted in a McDonald's.\n\nPolice say a ghost gun, silencer and writings expressing ill will were found on Mangione and link him to the crime.\n\nMangione is set to appear in court Thursday for firearm charges in Pennsylvania.\n\nProsecutors in New York are looking to extradite him back to Manhattan to face the murder charges outlined Tuesday. Bragg said there are \"indications\" that he may waive his extradition hearing.\n\nMangione has seen a flood of online sympathy and support, with many people expressing grievances with the U.S. health care system.\n\nProsecutors argued in the press conference Tuesday that concerning signs of support for killing CEOs have emerged since Thompson's death.\n\nNew York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch highlighted the concern, calling the threats \"lawless\" and \"violent.\"\n\n\"Let me say this plainly, there is no heroism in what Mangione did,\" she said. \"This was a senseless act of violence.

      "text": "Alvin Bragg's prosecution of Trump was novel - and correct\n\nIn the wake of the sweeping jury verdict declaring Donald Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to the first degree, some highly respected commentators have maintained that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg should not have brought the case in the first place.\n\nJonah Goldberg of The Dispatch wrote , \"Except for the misdemeanor of false records, none of these things are proven crimes and some of them are not crimes at all.\" CNN's Elie Honig called the case an \"ill-conceived, unjustified mess,\" with charges that are \"bespoke, seemingly crafted individually for the former president and nobody else.\" They have a point, and Trump himself embraced this comforting view of the charges against him. After the trial adjourned each day, while clutching a stack of papers and reciting snippets of legal critiques, he complained to reporters that, \"Every legal scholar says, 'They don't have a case.'\"\n\nThe jury has now spoken and a successful appeal is vanishingly slim. The argument that paying off a sex partner to hide an affair from voters is perfectly legal - something that Trump attorney Todd Blanche said is \" called democracy \" - was always Trump's strongest defense . But it may be hyperbole to suggest that the crimes for which Trump was convicted are not even crimes.\n\nBy now, the guts of the case are familiar: Trump was charged with falsifying business records with an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission of another crime. The 34 counts match 34 business records, which include a series of invoices from and $35,000 checks to Michael Cohen over a nine-month period. The payments were falsely recorded in the general ledger for the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust as legal fees instead of repayments to Cohen, who secured a nondisclosure agreement from Stormy Daniels in exchange for $130,000 to keep the story of her affair with Trump quiet in the days preceding the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThese records were all internal - they were not used to defraud the IRS around tax obligations, for example, or to cook financial statements for purposes of obtaining bank loans (which a New York judge found Trump did at the conclusion of a civil fraud trial in February). But falsification of business records is a well-established crime under New York's penal code. Legal analyst Norman Eisen wrote in the New York Times that he has examined \"almost 10,000 prosecutions for falsifying business records in New York since 2015,\" and found that \"in the most serious of these cases, about 10 percent of the total, incarceration was imposed\" - including for first-time offenders.\n\nAccording to critics, the bigger flaw in the Bragg indictment is what turned the misdemeanor charges into felonies: election law offenses that the jury concluded were tied to the false business records. The government argued that Trump falsified the records to keep the Daniels affair from the voting public, aiding his chances of a presidential win. Section 17-152 of New York's election code makes it a misdemeanor for two or more people to \"conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.\" During the trial , Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass explained to the judge: \"There is conspiracy language in the statute. The entire case is predicated on the idea that there was a conspiracy to influence the election in 2016.\"\n\nThe law has been used before , including against Aron Wieder, who in 2011 as vice president of the school board in East Ramapo, N.Y., assisted voters who had been told they could not bring baby strollers inside the polling site. The same year, Clement Campana, a former city council president in Troy, N.Y., was also charged with a felony count of falsifying business records and a misdemeanor count of election conspiracy under Section 17-152 in connection with a mayoral bid. Both cases were later dropped.\n\nAlthough Trump wasn't separately charged with a violation of Section 17-152, the falsification of business records statute doesn't require a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the underlying crime - it applies merely \"when his intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof.\" The arguments against Bragg's indictment may therefore be more about the letter of the law than anything else.\n\nThe fact that prosecutors don't use a statute very often is not a reason for nullifying it. Nor is the novelty of a legal theory grounds for rejecting it out-of-hand. That's how the law evolves - lawyers bring creative thinking to new scenarios and judges decide if those theories hold water.\n\nConsider that two of the four federal criminal counts brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump over his involvement in attempting to overturn the election derive from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, enacted in 2002 in the wake of the Enron corporate accounting scandal. The government has used its language relating to obstruction of an official proceeding to prosecute hundreds of Jan. 6 rioters, one of whom has successfully appealed to the Supreme Court; the court will decide in Fischer v. United States whether the government overreached in applying that law to the unprecedented events of the Capitol insurrection.\n\nAlthough prosecutors have tremendous power, and misconduct is a serious concern - particularly for low-income defendants who lack the vast resources and political power of a former president - Smith's decision to apply untested legal theories to bring legal accountability to the horrors of Jan. 6 is hardly prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nTo shy away from applying old law to new facts can produce travesties of justice - it's not always the other way around. Bragg's case is no different.\n\nKimberly Wehle is author of \"How to Read the Constitution - and Why.\" Her forthcoming book, \"Pardon Power: How the Pardon System Works - and Why,\" is out in September.

      "text": "Manhattan DA Urges Judge to Reject Trump's Motion to Dismiss Business Records Case\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office is seeking to maintain the verdicts and indictment of President-elect Donald Trump's falsified business records case.\n\nBragg filed the request to New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan on Dec. 9 after Trump submitted a motion to dismiss last week.\n\nTrump had argued that both the verdicts and the indictment should be immediately dismissed in the interests of justice. His attorneys cited concerns about presidential immunity and the process of Trump's transition to assuming power in the White House.\n\n\"At most, [the] defendant should receive temporary accommodations during his presidency to prevent this criminal case from meaningfully interfering with his official decision-making,\" the filing read.\n\n\"But multiple accommodations well short of dismissal and vacatur would satisfy that objective, including a stay of proceedings during his term in office if judgment has not been entered before presidential immunity attaches.\"\n\nBragg's office maintained that throwing out the indictment and verdicts would undermine confidence in the justice system.\n\nIt also leveled multiple arguments about presidential immunity, which Trump cited heavily in his motion.\n\n\"There are no grounds for relief now, prior to defendant's inauguration, because President-elect immunity does not exist,\" his office said.\n\nTrump's other criminal cases either came to a close or seemed headed in a similar direction. Last week, Trump told the Georgia Court of Appeals that it should direct a lower court to dismiss prosecutor Fani Willis's case against him in the state.\n\nTrump's two federal criminal cases ended after the election and following requests from special counsel Jack Smith, who had cited longstanding Department of Justice (DOJ) policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. A DOJ memo from 2000 states that doing so violates the Constitution.\n\nBragg said the federal cases differed from the one in New York.\n\n\"Given the nascent stage of those prosecutions, dismissal without prejudice was minimally disruptive, particularly because doing so did not require the court to vacate a jury verdict,\" his office said.\n\n\"Here, by contrast, the criminal proceeding is significantly more advanced, and dismissal would unwind completed phases of the criminal proceeding that the public has an interest in preserving.\"\n\n\"Wrongly continuing proceedings in this failed lawfare case disrupts President Trump's transition efforts and his preparations to wield the full Article II executive power authorized by the Constitution pursuant to the overwhelming national mandate granted to him by the American people on November 5, 2024,\" his motion reads.\n\nThe motion followed Merchan's adjourning sentencing previously scheduled for Nov. 26.\n\nIn May, a jury found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts, raising the prospect that he could face prison.\n\nBragg's office told Merchan that \"the President-elect ... does not perform any Article II functions under the Constitution, and therefore there are no Article II functions that would be burdened by ordinary criminal process involving the President-elect.\"\n\nIt also noted that the conduct in question-regarding a payment to an associate-was unofficial conduct and cited a district court opinion on this issue."

Both sides had requested a temporary stay.\n\n\"This is a total and definitive victory for President Trump and the American People who elected him in a landslide,\" Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung told The Epoch Times via email. \"The Manhattan DA has conceded that this Witch Hunt cannot continue.\"\n\nCheung said Trump's legal team is working to get the case dismissed.\n\nTrump has asked the court to throw out the verdict and indictment based on presidential immunity. A decision on that request was initially expected earlier this month.\n\nThe letter from Bragg's office did not acquiesce to Trump's arguments to dismiss the case over the immunity issue, nor his request to move the case to federal court.\n\n\"We believe these arguments are incorrect,\" the letter said. \"The People deeply respect the Office of the President, are mindful of the demands and obligations of the presidency, and acknowledge that Defendant's inauguration will raise unprecedented legal questions.\"\n\nTrump's attorneys argued that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Trump v. United States, which granted different levels of criminal immunity for presidents' official conduct, barred the use of certain evidence and witness testimony.\n\nIn his July response to the request to dismiss the indictment, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg argued that Trump had waited too long to raise some of his arguments about immunity. He also said a federal judge had deemed the conduct in question-an alleged payment to Stephanie Clifford-outside of a president's official duties.\n\nOn Nov. 19, Bragg's office argued that \"no current law establishes that a president's temporary immunity from prosecution requires dismissal of a post-trial criminal proceeding.\""

      "text": "Who Is Alvin Bragg? What You Need to Know About the Manhattan DA Who Indicted Trump\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg convened a New York grand jury earlier this year, which voted on Thursday to indict former President Donald Trump for allegations linked to a business records investigation related to a \"hush money\" payment to adult entertainment actress Stormy Daniels in 2016.\n\nTrump is the first-ever U.S. president to face criminal charges.\n\nThe former president is accused of making a $130,000 payment to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, in exchange for her silence on an alleged sexual encounter with her. Trump has consistently denied having any extramarital relationship with the woman.\n\nHe is the fourth elected Manhattan DA in the last 80 years. He was preceded by DA Cyrus Vance Jr., who retired at the end of 2021 after 12 years.\n\nBragg has spent more than two decades working in the criminal justice system.\n\nBefore becoming DA, Bragg served as an Assistant Attorney General for the state of New York and as an assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nDuring his campaign, Bragg made promises to indict Trump, and when he took office, he inherited a yearslong grand jury investigation of the alleged payment to Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump was implicated by his former attorney Michael Cohen as part of a plea deal. In 2018, Cohen was sentenced to prison and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine after pleading guilty to eight counts, including criminal tax evasion and campaign finance violations. Under Vance, the case stalled. The Federal Election Commission also looked into the matter but dropped its investigation.\n\nBut after taking office, Bragg had concerns about the strength of the case against Trump, leading to the resignation of two lead investigators.\n\nSince becoming DA, he announced an indictment against Trump's former strategist Steve Bannon who is accused of defrauding donors in a fundraising scheme to build the wall along the southern border.\n\nHe was also involved in two cases against the Trump Organization.\n\nAllen Weisselberg, chief financial officer for the Trump Organization and the Trump Payroll Corp., was charged under Vance, Bragg's predecessor. The companies were charged with tax fraud and accused of reducing payroll liability from executive salaries through untaxed bonuses and millions in luxury perks.\n\nWeisselberg pleaded guilty to the charges. He was sentenced to five months in jail and agreed to testify against the Trump companies.\n\nBragg oversaw the case against the Trump Organization, which was found guilty late last year. The Trump Organization and Trump Payroll Corp. were fined $810,000 and $800,000, respectively. Trump, who denied involvement, was not personally charged in the case.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron Desantis called out Bragg as being \"Soros-backed\" in response to Bragg's announcement of the indictment against Trump. Many Republicans, including Trump, have concurred with DeSantis.\n\n\"Florida will not assist in an extradition request given the questionable circumstances at issue with this Soros-backed Manhattan prosecutor and his political agenda.\"\n\nWhen Soros was asked about his connection to Bragg, he denied contributing to the prosecutor's campaign, adding that he did not know him.\n\nNew York City police unions have accused him of being soft on crime."

      "text": "Rep. Jordan Demands DA Bragg Testimony After Trump Conviction\n\nThe House Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government announced on May 31 that it will demand Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and his senior counsel, Matthew Colangelo, testify on June 13 following the historic conviction of former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe hearing, according to the letters, \"will examine actions by state and local prosecutors to engage politically-motivated prosecutions of federal officials, in particular the recent political prosecution of President Donald Trump by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.\"\n\nThe Epoch Times has reached out to Doug Cohen, the press secretary for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, to ask if Mr. Bragg and Mr. Colangelo will appear before the subcommittee.\n\nOn May 30, a jury found President Trump guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment made to Stephanie Clifford, better known as adult performer Stormy Daniels, ahead of the 2016 election. He is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11, four days before the Republican National Convention. He faces a maximum penalty of four years in prison for each charge.\n\nDuring a press conference following the verdict, Mr. Bragg said that \"the jury has spoken.\"\n\n\"While this defendant may be unlike any other in American history, we arrived at this trial and ultimately today at this verdict in the same manner as every other case that comes through the courtroom doors,\" he said.\n\nThis is not the first time Congress has asked Mr. Bragg to testify before Congress.\n\nMr. Jordan has sent letters to Mr. Bragg demanding testimony and documents, claiming his office is subject to congressional scrutiny because it gets federal grants. Mr. Jordan also subpoenaed a former prosecutor, Mark Pomerantz, who previously oversaw the Trump investigation. Mr. Bragg then sued Mr. Jordan, calling the probe into Mr. Bragg's prosecution of President Trump a \"transparent campaign to intimidate\" him.\n\nMr. Pomerantz said in court papers that the subpoena leaves him in an \"impossible position\" and, if enforced, will require him to violate his ethical obligations or risk being held in contempt of Congress if he refuses. A federal judge scheduled an initial hearing for Wednesday.\n\nHowever, a federal judge ruled last year that Mr. Jordan can subpoena Mr. Pomerantz.\n\n\"It is not the role of the federal judiciary to dictate what legislation Congress may consider or how it should conduct its deliberations in that connection,\" wrote District Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil in her ruling. \"Mr. Pomerantz must appear for the congressional deposition.\"\n\n\"No one is above the law.\"\n\nMr. Jordan's probe into Mr. Bragg's prosecution of President Trump began two days after the former president announced, on March 18, 2023, that he would be arrested. Mr. Jordan asked Mr. Bragg to provide documents about his 'politically motivated prosecution' of the former president.\n\nMr. Pomerantz pushed for an indictment against President Trump in 2021 after leading a probe into the former president's finances. He left the Manhattan district attorney's office in February 2022 because Mr. Bragg initially decided not to pursue a criminal case against President Trump. Mr. Pomerantz later released a memoir about the case."

      "text": "Alvin Bragg's Office Deleted Phone Call Records of Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels' Lawyer\n\nA paralegal from Manhattan Attorney General Alvin Bragg's office testified on Friday during former President Donald Trump's \"hush money\" trial that some phone call records between Michael Cohen and Stephanie Clifford's (a.k.a. Stormy Daniels) lawyer were deleted, raising questions about evidentiary integrity.\n\nIn a bid to challenge some of the evidence being put forward in President Trump's business records falsification trial in Manhattan, Trump attorney Emil Bove asked paralegal Jaden Jarmel-Schneider in court on May 10 about roughly three pages worth of records that the attorney claimed Mr. Bragg's office had deleted.\n\nMr. Jarmel-Schneider confirmed some deletions. He acknowledged that some phone call records from 2018 between Mr. Cohen and Keith Davidson (Ms. Clifford's lawyer) had been deleted, along with some records of conversations between Ms. Clifford's manager Gina Rodriguez and then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard about Ms. Clifford's claim that she had an affair with President Trump.\n\nThe Trump attorney alleged that the deletions were \"significant,\" prompting Mr. Jarmel-Schneider to dispute that characterization, though he acknowledged that some of the records had indeed been deleted.\n\nProsecutors have submitted the call records into evidence in a bid to bolster their case that the alleged affair-which President Trump has denied-took place and that the former president falsified business records to conceal payments allegedly made to Ms. Clifford to stay silent.\n\nPresident Trump has denied any wrongdoing and maintains the case is a politically motivated bid to undermine his 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nThe fact that prosecutors submitted the call records into evidence but didn't tell the Trump defense team that some of them had been deleted raises questions about the integrity of the proceedings, according to Trump attorneys, and others.\n\nMr. Trump Jr. was presumably referring to the fact that evidence tampering is a class E felony in the state of New York.\n\nMr. Bragg's office did not respond to a request for comment on the deleted records.\n\nThe development comes at the tail end of an intense week that saw President Trump subjected to gag order sanctions, two failed attempts by the defense team to have a mistrial declared, and Ms. Clifford taking the stand.\n\nJurors will soon have to decide whether prosecutors have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump was involved in falsifying business records as part of a scheme to influence the 2016 election.\n\nMr. Cohen, who is set to testify next week, made the original claims that led to the case. Specifically, the allegation of falsified business records pertains to 11 checks Mr. Cohen received and their corresponding invoices and vouchers.\n\nThe defense team says that Mr. Cohen was paid attorney's fees, while prosecutors allege that the legal expense categorization of the payments was fraudulent in order to cover up that they were meant to buy Ms. Clifford's silence about the alleged affair.\n\nMs. Clifford testified over the course of two days, with attorneys and the judge expressing some frustration that she frequently responded to questions with commentary that did not directly answer the question.\n\nDefense attorneys moved for a mistrial, arguing that her statements were \"extremely prejudicial\" and would improperly influence the jury.\n\nThe judge denied that motion."

In 1999, he became deputy assistant attorney general in Nassau County. He went on to serve in the same position in Suffolk County. In 2006, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appointed Merchan as a Bronx County family court judge. Merchan currently presides over criminal cases as a justice at the New York County Supreme Court, where he has served since 2009.\n\nIn 2022, Merchan presided over the tax fraud trial that led to the conviction of the Trump Organization's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. Merchan also is overseeing a criminal case against Steve Bannon, the former Trump aide accused of fraud and money laundering through an organization called We Build The Wall, which promised to help build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Bannon, who was pardoned by Trump before he left office, has pleaded not guilty.\n\nAccording to the FEC , Merchan made three donations totaling $35 through ActBlue-the liberal fundraising PAC powerhouse described as \"the home of small-dollar donation\"-within two days in July 2020. Of the $35, $15 went to presidential candidate Joe Biden's campaign on July 26, 2020. The Progressive Turnout Project received $10, as did its subsidiary, Stop Republicans. The mission of the Progressive Turnout Project is to \"rally Democrats to vote.\" Stop Republicans is \"dedicated to resisting the Republican Party and Donald Trump's radical right-wing legacy.\"\n\nAs a graduate of Fordham University School of Law, Conroy began his legal career in the DA's Trial Bureau in 1996.

He later served as the deputy of the Labor Racketeering Unit.\n\nIn 1995, Pope was appointed inspector general for the New York City School Construction Authority, where he investigated waste and corruption.\n\nIn 2006, Pope became New York State's director of policy after Spitzer's successful gubernatorial run.\n\nAfter spending a few years in private practice, Pope returned to the New York AG's office to serve as the Investor Protection Bureau chief before retiring in 2021. He came out of retirement after Bragg was elected DA to serve in his new role of investigating and prosecuting gun-related offenses, including gun traffickers and illegal sales.\n\nBefore that, Colangelo served as chief counsel for federal initiatives and executive deputy attorney general for social justice in the New York Attorney General's Office, where he worked dozens of cases, including an investigation into the Trump Foundation. He also served as a deputy assistant to President Barack Obama and deputy director of the National Economic Council.\n\nBefore that, he served as chief of staff to Department of Labor Secretary Tom Perez for three years and as deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights at the Department of Justice.\n\nColangelo returned to the department in 2020 to oversee its Antitrust Division, Civil Division, Civil Rights Division, Environment and Natural Resources Division, and Tax Division.\n\nJordan noted that Bragg hired Colangelo in 2022 \"to 'jump-start' his office's investigation of President Trump\" because of his \"history of taking on Donald J.

      "text": "For seven years, the progressive resistance has fantasized about Donald Trump's indictment, conviction, and incarceration.\n\nFirst, there was his alleged collusion with Russia, which dominated the better part of 2017 and 2018, and tapered off in early 2019.\n\nThen, just as Russiagate was winding down, along came all the talk about his obstruction of the investigation into that alleged collusion, followed by his phone call with Ukraine's president, during which Trump asked Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into Hunter Biden. This became grist for his first impeachment in late 2019.\n\nThat didn't work: the Senate acquitted Trump in February 2020. So the resistance needed to find something else. That would be the theory that Trump was sabotaging the U.S. postal service to hinder mail-in voting during the 2020 election.\n\nIf he had hindered mail-in voting-a charge for which no evidence ever materialized-he did a poor job of it. Trump lost the election. Then he falsely claimed it was stolen, and his supporters rioted on January 6, 2021, at the Capitol. That was grist for his second impeachment . Again, the Senate did not convict him.\n\nBut the beat went on.\n\nNext came the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago on account of the classified documents Trump mishandled. Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general, went on television and warned of prison time. But so far, that hasn't borne much fruit. If anything, it's embarrassed President Biden, who, we've learned, has his own mishandled classified documents problem .\n\nAll of these narratives have placed Democrats, progressive lawyers, MSNBC pundits, and the retired wine moms who can't get enough in a cycle of perpetual anticipation and inevitable frustration. Every promising scandal has fizzled.\n\nThis is not to say that Trump was innocent in all of these cases: His complicity in the events of January 6 is apparent and shameful.\n\nThe point is that the longed-for final scene in the Trump drama, where the bad guy gets what's coming, has never come. None of these investigations or allegations has resulted in a mug shot of Trump in handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit. Not even getting kicked off Facebook and Twitter seems to have done much good: less than two years after that happened, both accounts were restored. Nothing stuck with Teflon Don!\n\nUntil now.\n\nToday, the resistance will get what it's been craving. Today, the 45th president will appear in a Manhattan courtroom for his arraignment, and the borough's progressive district attorney, Alvin Bragg, will unseal his criminal indictment.\n\nIf that indictment is what has been widely reported , then it will be hard to persuade anyone outside of the progressive bubble that it was worth upending 230 years of American norms and customs to charge-for the first time-a former president with a felony.\n\nThe indictment will revolve around hush money payments paid at the end of the 2016 election cycle to adult entertainer and Trump fling Stormy Daniels and, possibly, a former Playboy Playmate, Karen McDougal. Bragg revived what was known inside the Manhattan District Attorney's office as the \"zombie investigation\" into the hush money payments. Bragg's predecessor, Cyrus Vance, declined to seek an indictment on this matter.\n\nThe theory of the case goes as follows. Trump made the hush money payments through his fixer, Michael Cohen, and reported the expense as \"legal fees.\" In fact, Bragg will allege, these were in-kind donations from Trump to his own presidential campaign. This distinction is important because New York state law deems the falsification of business records to be a misdemeanor unless that falsification is meant to conceal another crime. In this case, the documented fraud was perpetrated to conceal a violation of campaign finance law.\n\nIf this is, in fact, Bragg's case against Trump, then it's paper-thin. Many campaign finance law experts say it's unclear whether hush money would be an in-kind contribution to a political campaign, since Trump himself has said he made the payments to spare his family from embarrassment-not to win the 2016 election.\n\nWhat's more, President Biden's own Justice Department, which would be the appropriate venue to prosecute this case, has declined to do so-presumably, because there's not much there there.\n\nFinally, reporting violations of campaign finance law are almost never prosecuted as felonies. Recall that last year, the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign were fined for a similar violation. They had obscured the reporting of payments to a former British spy for his work on a dossier that falsely alleged Trump had colluded with Russia. Instead of reporting the expense as dirt-digging or scandal-mongering, the campaign claimed the fees were for \"legal services\" and \"legal and compliance consulting.\"\n\nOne possible explanation for Bragg's decision to bring this case is he was embarrassed early in the year when a former prosecutor from his office published a book alleging the new district attorney had shut down an investigation into Trump's inflating the value of his properties in loan applications to banks.\n\nAnother explanation is Bragg grasps that, even if he loses his case against Trump, there will always be a lot of voters, activists, and other professional Democrats who don't care what crime Trump is alleged to have committed, so long as he is indicted for something- anything . This is the series finale the Trump resistance has dreamed of since 2017. What does it matter if the actual case resembles a Rube Goldberg contraption and is predicated on a novel legal theory?\n\nIn other words, Bragg will still win politically even if he loses in court.\n\nAnd that is the biggest problem with today's arraignment. The district attorney's political interests do not align with those of the republic. He wants to satisfy the most extreme partisans on his own side. It's a similar problem that elected officials from Republican states face. So don't be surprised when an ambitious Republican prosecutor from, say, Texas or South Carolina indicts Hunter Biden on a similarly thin legal pretext. Bragg has set a new precedent in American politics, and we should expect Republicans to take advantage of the new standards he's just created. Indeed, Republicans who do not take advantage of the new rules will be accused of being weak.\n\nAll of this raises a question-not just for Bragg, but for the Democratic Party, the online resistance, and the media ecosystem that seems to exist simply to stoke outrage about Donald Trump for its overstimulated, progressive base: Is it worth it? Is the catharsis of seeing Trump indicted worth the damage a politicized prosecution of the former president will do? Because indicting Trump in this way, at this time, is an in-kind donation to his own presidential primary campaign. If the latest polling is correct, then Trump's approval ratings have ticked up since the announcement of his indictment.\n\nMany of Trump's supporters have for years thought that he's the victim of a series of witch hunts and this prosecution is just the latest in a series of injustices. That is not entirely true. The District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia, for example, is conducting a serious investigation into Trump's strong-arming of state officials in 2020 and 2021 to find him votes in the election that he lost. Good luck convincing Republicans and independents that the results of that investigation are legitimate after today.\n\nTrump justifies his own flouting of rules because he says the system is rigged against him.

      "text": "For seven years, the progressive resistance has fantasized about Donald Trump's indictment, conviction, and incarceration.\n\nFirst, there was his alleged collusion with Russia, which dominated the better part of 2017 and 2018, and tapered off in early 2019.\n\nThen, just as Russiagate was winding down, along came all the talk about his obstruction of the investigation into that alleged collusion, followed by his phone call with Ukraine's president, during which Trump asked Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into Hunter Biden. This became grist for his first impeachment in late 2019.\n\nThat didn't work: the Senate acquitted Trump in February 2020. So the resistance needed to find something else. That would be the theory that Trump was sabotaging the U.S. postal service to hinder mail-in voting during the 2020 election.\n\nIf he had hindered mail-in voting-a charge for which no evidence ever materialized-he did a poor job of it. Trump lost the election. Then he falsely claimed it was stolen, and his supporters rioted on January 6, 2021, at the Capitol. That was grist for his second impeachment . Again, the Senate did not convict him.\n\nBut the beat went on.\n\nNext came the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago on account of the classified documents Trump mishandled. Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general, went on television and warned of prison time. But so far, that hasn't borne much fruit. If anything, it's embarrassed President Biden, who, we've learned, has his own mishandled classified documents problem .\n\nAll of these narratives have placed Democrats, progressive lawyers, MSNBC pundits, and the retired wine moms who can't get enough in a cycle of perpetual anticipation and inevitable frustration. Every promising scandal has fizzled.\n\nThis is not to say that Trump was innocent in all of these cases: His complicity in the events of January 6 is apparent and shameful.\n\nThe point is that the longed-for final scene in the Trump drama, where the bad guy gets what's coming, has never come. None of these investigations or allegations has resulted in a mug shot of Trump in handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit. Not even getting kicked off Facebook and Twitter seems to have done much good: less than two years after that happened, both accounts were restored.

      "text": "It's Tuesday, December 10. This is The Front Page , your daily window into the world of The Free Press -and our take on the world at large. Coming up: Assad's fall exposes Washington's delusions, Norway's crippling assault on free enterprise, the disaster that is \"multilevel classrooms,\" and more.\n\nBut first: Daniel Penny walked out of court a free man. But why was he ever prosecuted?\n\nIt's been 19 months since Daniel Penny entered a New York City subway car as a college student and exited as a homicide suspect. But yesterday, a Manhattan jury acquitted him.\n\nThe Free Press has been covering the story since the very beginning. Our video team compiled a detailed play-by-play of exactly what happened between Penny and Jordan Neely on that fateful day on the F train. Olivia Reingold has reported from Penny's hometown , on the police's initial interrogation , and from the courtroom throughout his trial .\n\nOlivia was in the courtroom when the verdict was announced. The words \" not guilty ,\" she says, were followed by applause from Penny's sympathizers. Penny walked out with a \"smile on his face-the look of relief,\" Olivia notes . Meanwhile, a black woman shouted \"racist motherfucker\" and was escorted out of the courtroom by a police officer. Outside the court just after the verdict , Hawk Newsome, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter Greater New York, said: \"We need some black vigilantes. People wanna jump up and choke us and kill us for being loud? How about we do the same?\"\n\nIt's a good thing that justice was delivered to Daniel Penny. But a just verdict does not erase this cynical, wrongheaded, and unwarranted prosecution.\n\nIn an editorial this morning, we argue that the case should never have gone to trial, and we take a close look at the man who brought it, Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nBragg's approach to enforcing the law-or rather, not enforcing it-has been a disaster, as has been true of every city that voted in a so-called progressive prosecutor. As of November 2024, according to the New York Post , there were 27,122 reported felonies, up 16.9 percent from before Bragg took office. Meanwhile, rape has jumped 7.4 percent across Manhattan, robbery 8.9 percent, felony assault 16.8 percent, and grand larceny 29.8 percent. These are crimes that overwhelmingly affect the poorest New Yorkers.\n\nThe DA's decision to prosecute Daniel Penny was no anomaly. Bragg's tenure has been marked by priorities that don't serve the public-like the decision to go after Trump on spurious charges of falsifying business records-and a nonchalant attitude toward actual criminals. This has had a predictable outcome: rising crime rates and an enormous amount of cynicism among New Yorkers.\n\n\"Next year, the Manhattan DA will be up for reelection, with the Democratic primary in June. He deserves a serious challenger,\" we argue. \"So does New York.\"\n\nRead our editorial, \" Daniel Penny's Innocence-and the Shame of Alvin Bragg .\"\n\nAssad's Fall Has Humiliated Iran-and Washington\n\nOn Sunday, Joe Biden tried to take credit for the recent dramatic events in the Middle East. Assad's biggest backers-Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia-\"are far weaker today than they were when I took office,\" he argued.\n\n\"Try not to laugh,\" writes Eli Lake in his column today. \"Syria has toppled its tyrant in spite of the Biden administration, not because of it.\" And the fall of Assad, Eli says, is only the latest instance of foreign policy conventional wisdom in Washington being exploded by events.\n\nRead Eli Lake on what really toppled Assad-and why it has nothing to do with the Biden administration.\n\nWhy I Left Norway\n\nWhy are so many entrepreneurs fleeing Norway? The simple answer: They are being taxed on money they don't have.\n\nToday in The Free Press , Fredrik Haga, the co-founder of a successful Norwegian company, Dune, tells the story of trying to build it in his native land, but ultimately having to leave Norway because of its \"unrealized gains tax.\" Unable to pay the tax, Haga left friends and family behind for Switzerland.\n\nIn one way Haga was lucky. He got out before the government imposed an onerous \"exit tax\" on entrepreneurs who try to take their companies elsewhere. \"After shooting itself in one foot, the government is now aiming a bazooka at the other one,\" warns Haga. Read his piece on the self-defeating logic of \"tax the rich\" ideology.\n\nMy School Experimented with 'Education Equity.' It Failed.\n\nIn the fall of 2021, Newton public schools in Newton, Massachusetts, introduced \"multilevel classrooms\"-combining students of all abilities in one class with a single teacher. The initiative was designed to help struggling students and in particular black, Latino, and low-income students, who were disproportionately represented in lower-level classes.\n\nSo, how did it turn out? Not well. Ryan Normandin , the Faculty Council chair at a Newton high school, writes that teachers and students alike view the experiment as a failure.\n\n\"Students-at all levels of performance, but especially our students who need the most support and for whom this model was intended to help most-aren't having their needs met,\" he explains. One teacher recounted finding a colleague crying in the closet over the multilevel approach. \"The Faculty Council met with department heads all the way up to the superintendent, and what we found was shocking,\" writes Normandin.\n\nRead his full account of the failed experiment.\n\nAs some of you noticed, there was a faulty link in our plug for our upcoming live event about Jerusalem in yesterday's Front Page . Our apologies. It's now fixed! And this is going to be a fantastic conversation.\n\nTo reserve tickets to the event with Simon Sebag Montefiore and Bari on Wednesday, January 22, at the Streicker Center in New York City, click again here . Get them now before we sell out!\n\nWho is Abu Mohammad al-Jolani? Or, to use his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa-the Syrian rebel who led the insurgency that toppled the Assad regime . On the one hand, he has been designated a terrorist by the U.S. government, has links to al-Qaeda stretching back to 2003, and has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. But on the other hand, he defied ISIS and broke with al-Qaeda in 2016. And he told PBS in 2021 that his insurgent group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, doesn't want to fight with the West and intends to tolerate religious minorities . We'll see soon enough.\n\nPolice identified a top suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson as an Ivy-educated former data engineer named Luigi Mangione. Authorities nabbed 26-year-old Mangione yesterday at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, with a ghost gun and a silencer as well as a handwritten manifesto and four fake IDs. Mangione was allegedly upset with the healthcare industry because of its treatment of his sick relative, according to the New York Post . Meanwhile, in January, he posted a book review of the Unabomber's manifesto on a now-private Goodreads account, praising him as a \"political revolutionary.\"\n\nOn Sunday, South Korean prosecutors announced they would investigate the country's president, Yoon Suk Yeol, for possible treason and abuse of power . The probe comes after Yoon's use of martial law last week, which he declared after accusing the opposition liberal Democratic Party of attempting \"to overthrow the free democracy.\" Lawmakers voted unanimously against the measure, which was revoked in a matter of hours. On Saturday the disgraced leader survived an impeachment effort after his party boycotted the vote. The country's justice department has banned him from leaving the country while the investigation is ongoing.\n\nJapan's fertility rate reached a record low last year, at 1.2 births per woman. This week, in an effort to encourage parents to have more children, Tokyo announced that, starting in April, it will institute a four-day workweek for city employees. \"We'll keep reviewing our work styles flexibly so that nobody has to give up their careers due to life events such as childbirth and childcare,\" said Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike. In a previous attempt at boosting procreation, Tokyo launched a state-sponsored dating app .\n\nJoe Biden has 40 days left as president, and he's keeping a very low profile with the press, as Politico has noticed . Over a period of two weeks following Trump's victory, Biden spoke a total of seven words to the media. (Alas, Politico doesn't report what those seven words were.) One former White House official described Biden's hands-off approach as \"cavalier and selfish.\" Another senior Democrat told Politico \"There is no leadership coming from the White House. There is a total vacuum.\" In Washington, he continued, \"It feels like Trump is president already.\"\n\nTaylor Swift's economic powerhouse of a tour came to a close on Sunday in Vancouver. Her Eras Tour lasted almost two years and is estimated to have made over $2 billion, making it (of course) the highest grossing tour of all time. The three-hour-long, culturally defining show was seen by over 10 million Swifties in 21 different countries. Read Agnes Callard 's piece \" A Terrorist Plot Canceled the Show. But We Swifties Found Each Other on Cornelia Street \" for a Free Press dispatch from Swift's tour.\n\nMadeleine Kearns is an associate editor at The Free Press. Read her recent piece \" Should a Government Help People Die? ,\" and follow her on X @madeleinekearns .\n\nthe \"Free Press\" seems to be pretty much Fox News lite. Like we get it, I think woke is broke too, but put a sock in it already. 16 years ago if it existed we'd be reading nothing but Obama walks on water articles. kinda comes off as intellectual trendiness\n\nno one is ever found innocent in a criminal trial. right of center white people are really liking this a bit too much. not saying it was criminal, but 3 on 1 against an unarmed guy and the guy dies\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "When Donald Trump was indicted last year by Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, I was skeptical . The indictment alleged that the 45th president had falsified payments to his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, by classifying them as legal fees when in fact it was reimbursement for hush money to the porn star known as Stormy Daniels.\n\nAs the trial has unfolded over the past two months, Daniels has testified that Trump had sex with her at Lake Tahoe in 2006 and didn't wear a condom or display much sexual endurance. Cohen testified that he dutifully made the payments to Daniels on Trump's behalf because he was \"knee-deep in the cult of Trump.\" Former senior Trump aide Hope Hicks has testified to the lengths the 2016 campaign and Trump White House went to suppress stories of the former president's past sexual scandals.\n\nThe resistance commentariat insists that Trump is going down. Republican Never Trump lawyer George Conway writes in The Atlantic that Bragg's case is \"kind of perfect.\" MSNBC host and former Republican operative Nicole Wallace assures viewers that Trump's lawyers \"bombed\" their cross-examination of Cohen. Former Justice Department official Andrew Weissman praises Bragg's \"crackerjack team of experienced attorneys\" for building an airtight case.\n\nBut missing from this wall-to-wall coverage is any mention of the underlying crime that Trump falsified business records to advance his campaign. And that is a fatal flaw in the case, because New York law stipulates that falsifying business records can only be charged as felonies (as Bragg has done) if it's done to further another crime. Trump has not been charged with another crime, though Bragg has floated the theory that the business records were falsified to deprive 2016 voters of information about his tryst with Daniels.\n\nThere are other flaws as well. Robert Costello, one of the lawyers who worked closely with Cohen at the U.S. Attorney's Office at the Southern District of New York, testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that his old office declined to prosecute the hush money case against Trump because Cohen was \"totally unworthy of belief.\"\n\nCohen is Bragg's star witness. And according to Costello, Cohen told the U.S. attorney's office in 2018 that the \"payment to Daniels was his own idea, designed to try and get him back into the inner circle of Trump people in Washington.\"\n\nThat is damning testimony from a far more credible source than Cohen, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to lying to Congress and served two and a half years in prison.\n\nIt's still quite possible that the Manhattan jury will convict Trump on the 34 felony charges Bragg has brought. But there is no chance the conviction will withstand appeal, particularly given that it relies so heavily on Cohen's testimony.\n\nAt best the anti-Trump \"resistance\" will win a Pyrrhic victory. They may get their headline: \"Trump Convicted in Hush Money Trial.\" But the charge will not stick.\n\nIn the meantime, Alvin Bragg has thrown the 2024 election into chaos by dragging the presumptive Republican presidential nominee into court to defend himself against an untested legal theory premised on the testimony of a convicted liar.\n\nTrump already has proven that he will not recognize the results of elections that he doesn't win. Bragg's prosecution gives Trump and his supporters a ready-made excuse not to accept the results of the 2024 election should President Joe Biden prevail.\n\nThe hush money trial also gives permission and incentive to ambitious Republican prosecutors to repay Democrats in kind. Our legal system will soon be dominated by the whims of those in power as opposed to the rule of law.\n\nCostello on Wednesday summed up the dangers of Bragg's folly. \"In the Trump case, they are seeking a conviction by any means necessary,\" he said. \"They do not care if it is overturned on appeal because that will likely not happen until after the election. In the meantime, they will have effectively interfered with the 2024 presidential election and perhaps influenced some voters because of an ill-gotten conviction.\"\n\nIn other words, Alvin Bragg is destroying our democratic system in order to save it.\n\nEli Lake is a Free Press columnist. Follow him on Twitter at @EliLake and read his piece \" Trump Probably Broke the Law. But That Law Shouldn't Exist .\"\n\nBecome a Free Press subscriber today:\n\nIt's Chicken Little given voice.\n\nHitler had vowed in court, in September 1930, to destroy democracy through the democratic process. The judge asked, \"So, only through constitutional means?\" Hitler replied crisply, \"Jawohl.\" That's why the cultural communists in the US can be found in the US government, congress and the White House. They are openly destroying the democratic processes that underpin our republic from within using constitutional means. Obama taught Constitutional law at the U. of Chicago before he was elected to the senate. Let that sink in for a minute.\n\nThere is no better way to destroy a democratic republic than by using the democratic process, and that process is contained in the US constitution and in the constitutions of every country that calls itself a democracy. The tyrant can either ignore the constitution or have it changed, and they've been wanting to change it for a long time.\n\nThey are following Lenin's advice to the letter: \"We can and must write in a language which sows among the masses hate, revulsion, and scorn toward those who disagree with us.\"\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "Today in Manhattan the resistance will get what it's been craving for years. Is it worth it? Eli Lake weighs in.\n\nProgressives stopped caring about things like facts and truth a long time ago.  They are not helpful to their whims and jihads.\n\nI don't see it that way. I think Democrats are purposely raising Trump's profile so that he becomes the nominee in 2024 so that he may lose again to Biden. Recall that DeSantis was leading Trump in the last poll prior to his indictment.\n\nAs a life-long fiscal conservative I supported Trump, but no longer do. Our party doesn't need his divisiveness and his continuing confrontational style. It's likely that if re-elected he probably wouldn't do something harmful to the country! However, \"probably\" isn't good enough. A new term for Trump would not be in the best interest of our country. I support Nikki Haley.\n\nThat said, Eli Lake is absolutely correct. Trump has been attacked falsely since even before the 2016 election. When the primary objective becomes, \"get Trump, at any cost,\" it is the anthesis of what we claim America stands for. Trump is not \"above\" the law, but he is also entitled to equal treatment under the law! And, in many instanances he hasn't received that. Prosecutor Bragg has politicized the process!\n\nDennis Prager's column this past week is chilling: https://dennisprager.com/column/could-it-happen-here-it-is-happening-here/\n\nBased on undeniable evidence, everyone is now talking freely about the legal system a la Bragg, FBI CIA, Justice Department, IRS having been weaponized for political purposes by the DNC/Soros and a complete lack of control over the integrity of voting procedures as if this is some political cycle that will fade away one day. Unless the vast majority takes an active stand and utterly discredits this Far Left Movement instead of simply looking the other way or just chatting about this scary revolution that is happening in real time before the 2024 election, we will lose our Republic. Sure, it sounds good to have equality of results in our lives, but this is not sustainable or achievable without Marxism.\n\nits too bad we couldnt get this far with biden (hunter case) and hillary clinton oh but wait they are protected as dems. Agree with Raziel - team doesn't matter RNC/DNC. the political environment country is sadly an embarrassment. I have more respect for overt corruption in say africa or s america here its dirty and hidden\n\nHis lawyers will work it down to a misdemeanor or less and they will have wasted a lot of time and tax dollars for nothing but political posturing.\n\nI'm sorry Eli; it is yet to be proven that the 2020 election WAS NOT stolen.  I'm old; and I have worked a lot of local elections in 2 states.  It's disingenuous to suggest with certainty that Trump 'falsely' claimed the election was stolen.  Pennsylvania, particularly Philadelphia, made election fraud an art form before most of us were born.\n\nTrump wasn't my first choice in 2016; but the chaos and persecution that followed his 2016 election is a national disgrace.\n\nThank you!\n\nThe article by Eli Lake you published about Alvin Bragg's shameful attempt to smear Trump with NO CRIME and NO CASE during a presidential showed an obvious lack of integrity on the part of The Free Press. You also referred readers to another hit piece on Trump by Harry Litman in the LA Times that concludes Trump \"has nothing but contempt for the rule of law.\" This is truly rich when polls show that the majority of Americans believe the Justice system has been weaponized by the DNC and Soros. Now that the indictment has finally been unsealed, perhaps The Free Press can take another shot at nonpartisan journalism. The only crime revealed in the indictment was a state level misdemeanor wherein the statute of limitations expired long ago and the time frame was 2017 when Trump was president - NOT during the campaign as alleged by the indictment. Eli Lake uses misleading and empty language like a novice or hack when he states \"Trump's complicity in the events of January 6 is APPARENT and shameful\" and \"...the DOCUMENTED fraud was perpetrated to conceal a violation of campaign law\" and \"Trump justifies his own FLOUTING OF RULES because he says the system is rigged  against him.\" The Free Press is better than this.\n\nUnfortunately, it isn't better than this.\n\nIf everyone's lying, then, why bother. Let's just go to a cave, cover our heads and completely disengage.\n\nNo one is above the law on the left or right.\n\nEli, no one knows what the future holds but yesterday was a good indication the elites are nervous and they should be.\n\nOther presidents have paid \"hush money\". Public knowledge. I'm pretty sure  CLINTON did. So why wasn't he brought up on felony ch? Because this is the disgraceful filthy dirty political game that Democrats play. I don't care if you don't like Trump, but this hypocrisy is just pathetic and wrong. I hope it blows up in Bragg's face. I'm sick of this. And I personally do not believe Trump was \"complicit\" in the January 6th incident. It was a bunch of rogue people amongst thousands of peaceful people who were there AND the Capital Police are definitely complicit in what occurred.\n\nTo us the favorite phrase of wokeness, \"Is the juice worth the squeeze\"?\n\nHelp out us election skeptics who think Trump was robbed: Tell us why corporate IP is even a smidgen of consideration in audits of voting machines & software.\n\nTell us why the here was proprietary software on voting machines in the first place.\n\nAnd with mail-in voting why do we have 24/7 unsupervised drop boxes?\n\n\"Many of Trump's supporters have for years thought that he's the victim of a series of witch hunts and this prosecution is just the latest in a series of injustices. That is not entirely true.\"\n\nReally? These pricks have been screwing with DJT since he announced his 2016 run. That's about eight years. So, please, stop trying to straddle the fence, Eli."

      "text": "Hunter Biden's trial starts today. He is charged with lying on a federal firearms application because he said he was not using drugs when in fact he was in the throes of a serious addiction. He had the gun for two weeks. It was never used in a crime. He is not taking drugs anymore. As this New York Times story notes, this crime is almost never prosecuted for a first-time offender, especially without an underlying, more serious crime. It's a nothingburger. As even Republican senator Lindsey Graham acknowledged to HuffPost , \"I don't think the average American would have been charged with the gun thing.\"\n\nThe Hunter Biden trial is the flip side of the Trump trial-both prosecutions are based on weak charges, and both were brought almost entirely because of the defendant's prominence. Republicans, who have been claiming Trump's guilty verdict is proof the Biden administration has \" weaponized the justice system \" to damage his opponent in the upcoming election, are more than happy to see Hunter Biden prosecuted on the flimsiest of charges.\n\nBut even putting aside the fact the Trump case was brought by Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney-who has no connection to the federal Justice Department-weaponization was not a factor. Just like the attorneys prosecuting Hunter Biden, Bragg and his team were prosecuting Trump simply because that's what they do.\n\nHad the district attorney's office been trying to find something on Trump? You bet it had. That's what prosecutors do as well-all the time. They read stories about possible financial fraud, and they start digging. There was a ton of published material about potential wrongdoing by Trump. And once they start digging, they don't like to stop until they find something or come up with a theory that makes an ugly but seemingly benign action suddenly a crime. For instance, to put Michael Milken away, then-U.S. attorney Rudy Giuliani had to stretch securities laws significantly. (He also threatened to indict Milken's father.) Bragg did the exact same thing with Trump.\n\nIn New York magazine, Elie Honig, a former prosecutor, said that Bragg had \" contorted the law \" to make his case. Probably true. But he also wrote, \"Plenty of prosecutors have won plenty of convictions in cases that shouldn't have been brought in the first place.\" Definitely true. That's not weaponization; that's how the system works .\n\nIt's just that most of the time we never learn about the people who have to defend themselves against flimsy charges because a prosecutor wants a scalp. I know a guy going through this in New Jersey right now, where prosecutors are trying to put him in prison because his company's stock rose momentarily when he tried to obtain some Covid-19 tests to help his hospital customers. (He has been charged with securities fraud.) I spent a year with this guy when I was writing my book The Big Fail . I know he didn't do anything wrong. The charges are transparently bogus. The first time he was tried, it was a hung jury. But the prosecutors won't give up-they are determined to get a guilty verdict no matter how much they have to distort the facts. My source is spending millions of dollars to defend himself in a case every bit as flimsy as the one against Donald Trump or Hunter Biden. But because he's not Hunter Biden or Donald Trump, nobody cares.\n\nI admit politics played a part in both high-profile cases. At first, prosecutors worked out a plea deal with Hunter Biden. But Republicans objected, and after it drew unusual scrutiny from a Trump-appointed judge, the deal fell apart. I suppose the prosecutors could have then dropped the charges. But that's not what prosecutors do. Their instinct, always, is to prosecute, to collect scalps. They measure success by how many guilty verdicts they garner. Which is the fundamental reason we now have the president's son on trial-and the possibility that a jury will find him guilty.\n\nThe criminal justice system would of course be better if prosecutors cared more about seeking genuine justice than collecting scalps. But it's not likely to change. Weaponization is not the issue. It's that prosecutors are going to prosecute. Get used to it.\n\nJoe Nocera is a columnist for The Free Press. Read his piece \" The Humiliating Cross-Examination of SBF ,\" and follow him on X @opinion_joe .\n\nBecome a Free Press subscriber today:\n\nSo is the big problem here the DA and they have no one to answer to ?  They can go after anyone with BS and send them to jail or bankrupt them with legal fees ?  So what is missing here is a review of what the DA is doing ?  It seems the author here is implying that we the voter created these monsters somehow ?  Or that this is how the law is just accept it ?  Total BS !  This needs to be fixed for anyone caught is this convict by any means idea , this is not law, this is not justice .  If we were to accept this that makes all laws a joke and us complicit in the joke.\n\nYou forgot to mention that Bragg ran for office based on the premise that he was going to get Trump.  That the judge in the Trump case had donated to the Democrats and that his daughter actually worked for the Democrats.  You also forgot to mention how Biden disposed of his illegally gotten gun.  Aside from that, I don't find it trivial that a drug addict had an illegal firearm and how it was disposed.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "The furore around the case underlines how vague the concept of \"election interference\" is.\n\nThe former President Donald Trump says Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's hush money case against him is election interference. Prosecutors say the same about the hush money payments themselves.\n\nThe question then becomes: What is election interference?\n\n\"This case is about a criminal conspiracy,\" said Bragg deputy Matthew Colangelo. \"Trump orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election.\"\n\n\"The prosecution detailed allegations of a sensational tabloid scheme to 'catch and kill' stories that could prove damaging to Trump, a plan, the DA's office said, that was elicited with Trump's blessing and that he was directly implicated in,\" writes NBC News' Katherine Doyle.\n\nOne of the legacies of the Trump-Russia affair is the persistence of imprecisely defined \"election interference.\" In that case, the phrase was used to describe unmistakable crimes like hacking and stealing emails, but also generally hamfisted Russian attempts to swing American public opinion.\n\nMany Democrats believe , or at least told pollsters they believed, that Russia altered the vote totals to get Trump elected. This was not backed by any evidence, but it is a perfectly reasonable way to interpret the term \"election interference.\"\n\nMuch of what was described as interference had to do with the publication of unflattering information about Hillary Clinton through WikiLeaks dumps of her emails. (Forever memorialized in the segments of the press that attribute her 2016 loss to a trivial matter of \"her emails!\")\n\n\"The Russians-in my opinion and based on the intel and the counterintel people I've talked to-could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided,\" Clinton later said when she laid out her own theory of Trump-Russia collusion. \"Guided by Americans and guided by people who had polling and data information.\"\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's investigation never found any evidence of such collusion or coordination, just indications that the Trump camp liked the anti-Clinton info getting out there.\n\nThe most damaging revelation might have been the Democratic National Committee's attempts to tip the scales in favor of Clinton during the primaries. This news led to some Bernie Sanders supporters staying home, voting for third-party candidates like the Green Party's Jill Stein, or even pulling the lever for Trump. This in turn helped Trump penetrate the \"blue wall\" in the Rust Belt.\n\nYou could argue that the information was overblown. Clinton would have likely won the nomination without the DNC's favoritism-Richard Nixon would have still won a 49-state landslide in 1972 without Watergate-and that these were mild interventions by an entity that is primarily tasked with electing Democrats. Bernie had never really run for anything as a Democrat before those primaries, even though he caucuses with them in the Senate, and was sincerely viewed by most party professionals as a weaker general election candidate.\n\nBut the information was also true and of public interest. All the talk of Russian interference never really grappled with how to reconcile the public's need to know pertinent if politically inconvenient facts with the understandable desire to not have our elections influenced by hostile-or even friendly-foreign powers.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) just recently suggested Israeli voters should replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Voters here replacing the Squad would undoubtedly be welcomed in Israel.\n\nAllegations of interference in the Iranian hostage crisis bedeviled Ronald Reagan's campaign, with the New Republic declaring the science settled on the matter last year. Nixon has similarly been painted with the collusion brush for interference in Lyndon Johnson's Vietnam peace talks, a story given legs in Trumpian fashion by LBJ-ordered surveillance .\n\nBut in the hush-money case there is no foreign government involved. The placement of favorable stories and the attempted killing of negative ones is pretty central to how modern political campaigns do business. Partisans have been trading accusations of \"dirty tricks\" for virtually all of the country's history.\n\nIf we're going to begin to criminally prosecute people for the seedier side of politics, we are probably going to have to develop a better working definition of election interference than \"attempting to swing public opinion in a way that will benefit a candidate I don't like.\"\n\nIt's probably too much to ask that the election-year Bragg case against a leading presidential candidate get us there, but hope springs eternal.\n\nW.

A spokesman for Bragg's office says the prosecutor and his team haven't notified Trump of a pending indictment, though the New York Times reports Bragg's office asked Trump to testify before a grand jury.\n\nThe charges are related to alleged payments Trump made to lawyer Michael Cohen in 2017 that the lawyer later directed to porn star Stormy Daniels. The supposed crime is a felony falsification of business records, which N.Y. 175.10 defines as falsifying records with the \"intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof.\" The crime is typically a misdemeanor under New York law, with a two year statute of limitations for continuous state residents, and only becomes a felony when the records are falsified to further another criminal purpose, which extends the statute of limitations to five years.\n\nThe supposedly criminal element of Trump's behavior was not his having paid hush money to a porn star-that is legal in these United States of America-but that the payment to Michael Cohen later sent to Daniels was incorrectly reported as \"legal expenses.\"\n\nA prosecutor with any respect for the law or concern for the future of his country would not perp-walk, handcuff, and book a former president of the United States on a tortured legal theory that even the biggest anti-Trump partisan would acknowledge would not be brought against anyone else. It would be a transparently political prosecution by a Democratic partisan meant to kneecap the Democratic president's chief rival in advance of an upcoming election.\n\nIt is also an example of what reporter Aaron Sibarium calls \"progressive carceralism,\" that is, the practice of punishing disfavored offenders and classes of offenses with an Old Testament fervor while categorically refusing to enforce the law against favored offenders. Bragg, even as he seeks to indict the former president for a business-records violation, has declined to enforce laws against resisting arrest, sought to depopulate the city's prisons, and recommended his deputies bring lesser charges against certain armed robbers.\n\nDefense attorney Scott Greenfield summarized it this way : \"The same people who are anti-incarceration for some defendants will support life plus cancer for others.\"\n\nJohn Hirschauer was assistant editor of The American Conservative .

It doesn't matter how flimsy the case George Soros funded Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who made getting Trump a key part of his campaign, brings against the former president. Trump's hypothetical arrest and conviction means much more than a few mislabeled payments to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen-who made payments to a porn star, who claims to have had an affair with the former president almost 20 years ago-as \"legal expenses,\" (even though it appears the choice to categorize those payments as representation-related was Cohen's idea).\n\nThough he will not have been found guilty yet, the mere images of the orange man facing the real possibility of a matching jumpsuit will justify all their other narratives to get Trump-from the Russia hoax, to Ukraine-centered impeachment N.o 1, to the \"insurrection\" of January 6-not merely as a matter of strategy but a matter of substance.\n\nThe left will start to work backwards from Trump's arrest. They'll say Trump was always a ruthless criminal. Since he's guilty of falsifying records to cover up payments to a porn star, he probably did collude with Russia. Who knows, the pee tapes might even be real too! The only reason he wasn't arrested until now, they'll argue, is not because these prior scandals were complete fabrications, but because Trump (whose presidential agenda, might I remind you, was stymied by a ruling-class cohort of lawyers, judges, intelligence agencies, and sometimes even members of his own administration) was able to totally bend the government and justice system to his will.\n\nIt'll be maddening to watch, but don't let it consume you.

He said something that's really stuck with me: if what we conservatives say is true about the complete breakdown of the rule of law, we ought to start thinking of ourselves increasingly as second-class citizens. The weaponization of the federal government and justice system, whether against J6ers or parents at school board meetings, has made this abundantly clear.\n\nAnd don't waste your time crying about double standards or hypocrisy. Yes, the left can decry \"lock her up\" chants and then attempt to put the sitting Democratic president's foremost political opponent behind bars less than a decade later. Yes, the left can riot and loot and burn down cities with little to no consequences while you hardly have the right to speak your mind, in the public square or online. It's not hypocrisy, it's hierarchy.\n\nYou have no margin for error. Now is the time for copious amounts of discipline and careful strategizing. Willfully throwing yourself to Merrick Garland and his wolves today does not make you a martyr. It makes you a moron.\n\nBradley Devlin is the former political editor for The American Conservative .

      "text": "State of the Union: Alvin Bragg is reportedly charging Daniel Penny with two felony counts.\n\nDaniel Penny was indicted last week in New York for his involvement in the death of Jordan Neely. The indictment hasn't been unsealed, but the New York Post reports that New York County prosecutor Alvin Bragg filed second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide charges against Penny, who will reportedly be arraigned later this month in Manhattan Superior Court.\n\nSecond-degree manslaughter carries a more substantial sentence in New York than criminally negligent homicide. Second-degree manslaughter, which occurs when a person \"recklessly causes the death of another person,\" is a Class C felony, and carries a 15-year maximum sentence. Under New York law, a person acts \"recklessly\" when he is aware that his conduct poses \"a substantial and unjustifiable risk\" of causing a proscribed result (in this case, another person's death), and that his taking the risk \"constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.\"\n\nCriminally negligent homicide, by contrast, is a Class E felony, and carries a 4-year maximum sentence. It is defined as causing another person's death \"with criminal negligence,\" that is, when the person who caused another's death \"fail[ed] to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk\" that their conduct would do so.\n\nThe two charges differ only in their assessment of the offender's mental state at the time he committed the crime. Second-degree manslaughter applies to an offender who is aware of his conduct's recklessness, while criminally negligent homicide applies to an offender who is culpably ignorant of the same.\n\nNeither charge should apply in Penny's case because, in restraining a mentally ill man with multiple felony convictions who made death threats against other passengers, the risk he took was neither \"unjustifiable\" nor \"a gross deviation from the standard of conduct a reasonable person would observe\" if confronted with the same situation. That most \"reasonable people\" these days would decline to intervene says more about the average person's timidity than Penny's criminal liability.\n\nWhy did Alvin Bragg reportedly include both charges on the indictment? Former New York prosecutor Andrew McCarthy suspects Bragg is trying to induce a jury to settle on criminally negligent homicide as a compromise verdict:\n\nI suspect that Bragg is engaged in strategic charging here. In light of Neely's menacing behavior on the subway car before Penny intervened, the prosecutor grasps that a jury could easily conclude that Penny was justifiably acting in self-defense (which legally extends to the defense of other people as well). If Bragg had charged just one count, the issue would come down to \"guilty or not guilty?\" - and the jury could find that not guilty was the fairer result.\n\nIf Penny wants to avoid creating the incentive for a compromise verdict, he could seek to strike the criminally negligent homicide charge by arguing it is being applied to the same underlying conduct as the manslaughter charge. If he does that, though, he'd risk setting himself up for north of a decade in prison if the jury feels the need to convict:\n\nFor his part, then, Penny faces a tough choice. He could argue that the negligence count is just a subset of the recklessness count - i.e., that Bragg has taken what is really one offense and multiplied it into two to increase the chances of getting a conviction. But the remedy for that would be to eliminate the less-serious negligence charge - meaning, if he weren't acquitted, he'd be looking at a harsher sentence.\n\nOnce again, apparently, New York is facing Daniel Penny with an impossible decision.\n\nJohn Hirschauer was assistant editor of The American Conservative .

President Trump is fighting to save our nation and November 5th is the day Americans will deliver the real verdict.\"\n\nOn Thursday, jurors found the former president guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records after two days of deliberation. Although sentencing is not set to take place until July 11, just four days before the start of the Republican National Convention, the verdict appears to have energized Trump's supporters in an unprecedented manner.\n\nKenneth Vogel, a journalist for the New York Times , wrote on X , \" Wow.

      "text": "Trump has assembled a Republican coalition that, if maintained, can usher in a period of generational strength.\n\nStories of historic comebacks are usually reserved for works of fiction; rarely in life, especially in politics, do we see a near-mythical resurrection. In living memory, only Richard Nixon managed such a feat at a national level, staging a political comeback in 1968, winning a 49-state landslide re-election, only to have his legacy lost to the Watergate scandal and his resignation.\n\nWhile Trump still has four more years to craft his legacy, hopefully avoiding a Nixonian obituary, the 47th and 37th presidents share a commonality: Their comebacks were each forged by a new Republican Party. In the same way that Nixon brought formerly Democratic Southerners, ethnic whites, Evangelicals, and neoconservatives into the Republican Party in 1968, Trump added young men, a multiracial working-class, and urban centers in the GOP's big tent.\n\nNixon's 1968 election gave Republicans a blueprint that delivered them the White House in five out of six elections from the late 1960s to the late 1980s. So what has Donald Trump's 2024 election offered? A governing majority, if they can keep it. Here's how he did it.\n\nDonald Trump is set to enter the White House for the second time with the highest favorability numbers he's ever had. The Emerson College poll found that 54 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the 45th and 47th president. The YouGov poll has his favorables at 50 percent, the first time he's been above unfavorables in his political career.\n\nIt may be difficult to remember in the afterglow of such a large election victory that Trump was at his most vulnerable position 20 months ago. In the aftermath of the 2022 midterm elections that saw disappointing results for Republicans and a series of Trump-backed candidates, including Kari Lake, Doug Mastriano, Tudor Dixon, and Herschel Walker, go down in defeat, a number of Republicans were ready to move on from The Donald and all the baggage he brought with him.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, Trump found himself polling behind Ron DeSantis in New Hampshire and Florida, and he had just a small plurality in South Carolina, where former Gov. Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott managed to split enough votes to keep him in the lead. Nationally, polls found him leading with Republican voters by just single digits for the first time since 2016.\n\nAmericans overall, and a sizable population of Republicans, didn't want to renew the Trump show for a seventh season. According to the Quinnipiac poll from February 2023, Trump's favorability was -20 points nationally, he was losing a head-to-head matchup against Joe Biden, and about one-in-five Republicans had soured on him.\n\nTrump was not out, but definitely down. After losing the 2020 election, January 6, and losses in the midterms, he needed to regain his image as the ultimate winner, the boss from The Apprentice, the tycoon who would risk it all to Make America Great Again.\n\nHis numbers slowly began ticking up in the Republican primary as he warred with his GOP opponents; his army of social media influencers and television surrogates denounced DeSantis and Haley as being weak and too liberal. Yet it was Trump's vulnerability in the next few months that changed the state of the race permanently.\n\nIn late March, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's decision to indict Trump over payments made to Stormy Daniels through his lawyer galvanized his campaign in a way Democrats hadn't foreseen. The indictment which seemed so overtly political in nature caused a massive rally-around-the-king effect. The RealClearPolitics polling average showed Trump's overall lead in the GOP primary went from Trump +15 to Trump +30 in a matter of two weeks.\n\n\"If they can do that to him, they can do it to me,\" was a sentiment I heard from more than one voter. What voters were really saying was, they've done this to me and now they're doing this to him. Republicans had seen the double standards in law enforcement for some time. Why hadn't Hillary Clinton ever received the same treatment over the email server she destroyed or Joe Biden over the classified documents he kept in his house or any of the experts responsible for poor decisions that led to the Iraq War, the 2008 financial crisis, or the COVID-lockdowns that ruined countless lives? Trump being held to a different standard made him more relatable by people who felt the government was never on their side.\n\nMore charges followed in Georgia, Washington, D.C., and South Florida, all creating the same response from Republicans. For a population with deep distrust of Washington and politicians, there was no better endorsement of Trump than Alvin Bragg and Fanny Willis bringing these charges. Voters had a collective eye roll that the powers-that-be would do anything, say anything, and bring any charges possible to stop this man which made them trust him more.\n\nBy the time voting began in the primary, Trump had regained a commanding lead against both his primary opponents and Joe Biden.\n\nAccording to the New York Times /Siena poll from December 2023, Trump had the support of 63 percent of all Republicans, including three-quarters of white Republicans without a college degree. For the first time, Americans had a higher favorable opinion of him than Joe Biden. Trump's -12 favorability was substantially better than his successor's -18 approval rating.\n\nRather than believing the left's narrative that Trump was wildly corrupt, voters were overall split on whether the charges brought against him were political in nature, but Republicans were resolute that this was all done to stop him from running for president. More than 80 percent of GOP primary voters said it was a political hitjob, to just 14 percent who said the charges were serious.\n\nIt is extremely difficult for public figures with near universal name ID to change their public perception, oftentimes taking years of carefully constructed media appearances to slowly improve someone's image. Donald Trump managed to do it in a matter of months with the help of Democrats. He went from being an internet bully-in-chief to a martyr whose only crime in the eyes of his voters was standing up against the forces that be.\n\nHe had his base back and, by March 6, had won the nomination. The party was firmly his.\n\nWhen an assassin attempted to kill Trump on July 13, it only cemented the idea in voters' minds that Trump's detractors would do anything to stop him from becoming president. The fact that he survived because he happened to move his head just seconds before meant there was a divine providence protecting his life.\n\nAn old political trope is that a politician is never more popular than the day after they leave office. In a 2023 Gallup survey, every former president since 1960 with the exception of Bill Clinton is more popular than their last day in the White House.\n\nAnd it's true despite political partisanship. A majority of Democrats approve of the way Reagan, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush handled their job as president. Nearly 40 percent of Republicans say the same of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton did a good job as president. John Kennedy has the overall highest approval rating of 90 percent, despite being president for only 1,036 days and having a scandal-ridden White House that nearly launched the United States into a nuclear war.\n\nPeople look back at retired politicians and don't remember them so much as they remember themselves in that time or the picture that's been painted for them by the media and historians. A 60-year-old may look back at the Carter years and think less about the oil crisis and days of malaise and remember more their youth and the simplicity of the time, creating a fonder image of the president with that memory. It's like hearing someone say of their childhood, \"We were poor but we were happy.\"\n\nTrump's legacy enjoyed the same reflection from the rearview mirror, especially in comparison to his successor's handling of immigration, inflation, wages, crime, high interest rates, the wars in Ukraine and Israel and the retreat from Afghanistan. Americans collectively looked back on the Trump administration and remembered less turbulence across the globe, a robust economy, and controlled borders. Any memory of January 6 and COVID had been relegated to MSNBC's viewership and #Resist libs' social media.\n\nIt only helped Trump that the Biden administration and its media allies' response to any criticism from voters was that they inherited the problem from Trump, it was worse under Trump, or that voters shouldn't trust their feelings on the subject. Any voice dissenting from this narrative was considered blasphemous because they were helping a man they labeled as a threat against democracy.\n\nThe media's increasingly unhinged narratives about Trump became more difficult to justify at a time when voters struggled to put food on the table or buy a home. At the same time, they were insistent that the Biden's administration's inability to get a handle on the border and rampant illegal criminality was not happening, or that it was actually a good thing that it was happening. (Think of all the new Uber Eats drivers coming from south of the border!)\n\nIt also helped that Trump wasn't on social media outside Truth Social, where only his most loyal followers spent time. The media said Trump was unhinged, unwell, or in a mental decline, but voters saw none of it. This wasn't 2016, when his tweets were breaking news; people weren't inundated with the media's opinion of daily Trump's tweets and had anyway grown exhausted of how the media portrayed his \"scandals\" ranging from how many scoops of ice cream he ate to how chummy he was with foreign dictators. None of it mattered if they were struggling to buy eggs or felt unsafe in their community.\n\nBy April 2023, a CNN poll found that 55 percent of Americans viewed Trump's presidency as a success, up 14 points since he left the White House. On the other hand, Biden's presidency was thought of as a failure by over 60 percent of the country.\n\nA Marquette University poll in May found that voters trust Trump more than Biden on the economy, immigration and the border, Israel, and foreign policy.\n\nThe Donald Trump who lived in people's memory and the prosperity he brought during his first term was part of the person they were voting for, while the ailing and aging Joe Biden and the media that lied to defend him was who they were voting against.\n\n\"He is far beyond cogent, in fact I think he's better than he's ever been,\" MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said on March 6 about Joe Biden when questions of his mental fitness came up in the media. \"I'm about to tell you the truth, and 'f' you if you can't handle the truth. This version of Biden intellectually, analytically is the best Biden ever. Not a close second.\"\n\nAbout 10 weeks later, a bewildered-looking Biden stood before the entire country during the presidential debate and announced, \"We finally beat Medicare.\" These are probably the most consequential four words ever uttered during a presidential debate.\n\nFor millions of Americans, it was an indictment of the media as much as it was of Biden himself. The public knew what was so obvious for so long: There was something wrong with our president, and everyone from the vice president to the media had lied to the country about it. Everyone who had publicly questioned the White House narrative was called a conspiracy theorist or a right-wing stooge helping Trump. Those four words permanently sowed a level of distrust in the media's narrative about this election that could never be undone.\n\nWithin weeks, the whole house of cards came crumbling down. Trump was beating Biden by 5 to 6 points in the national popular vote according to polls from CBS News, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and CNN. This election was on course to be a rout. Private polling had Trump winning Virginia, Minnesota, New Mexico, Maine, New Hampshire, and even New Jersey. Knowing how close the election actually was against Harris, it's not inconceivable that Trump would have won all those states and put places like New York and Illinois into play.\n\nFor the first time ever, a Democrat knew what it felt like to be a Republican as the entire media, donor class, and political establishment pressed Joe Biden with wall-to-wall negative coverage and pressure to drop out of the race.\n\nBiden did, Harris became the nominee, and overnight the woman who for four years had been compared to the bumbling, narcissistic Vice President Selina Meyer on the show Veep was being sold as the ultimate girl boss.\n\nDonald Trump has been famous longer than the average American has been alive. For decades he was one of the most famous men in America and someone celebrities wanted to be photographed with until he descended on the golden escalator in 2016. Yet for the last decade, to be associated with Trump was to be considered a social pariah. You could be \"cancelled\" for wearing a MAGA hat or relegated to D-list celebrity status. That all changed during this election.\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint an exact moment, but there were a few signs, as when rapper 50 Cent posted a picture of Trump's face on his hit album cover, Trump's series of appearances at UFC fights with Dana White, the YouTube influencer and boxer Jake Paul's endorsement, Joe Rogan's interview, or the TikTok dances.\n\nFor the first time, it was socially acceptable and even cool to be a Trump supporter.\n\nNow, obviously Trump didn't have the A-list celebrity endorsements that Harris had; there was no Beyonce, Taylor Swift, or Oprah Winfrey to join him at a rally. He didn't need them, though. He needed Americans who were on the fence and needed it to be okay to support Trump, especially women and minorities. So when the model Amber Rose spoke at the RNC, the rapper Kodak Black lent Trump his endorsement, or the wife of the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes came out supporting Trump on Instagram, it didn't influence voters minds but just made it less fringe to support him either publicly or privately.\n\nThe UFC and podcasting played a major part in this evolution of the Trump brand. Trump entering UFC fights became a type of event in and of itself, as celebrities like Joe Burrow and Nick Bosa took selfies with him. Who sat next to Trump became an area of interest, as well as noting which fighters saluted him before or after the match. The stigma of being seen with this man was gone.\n\nPodcasting added another layer to Trump's appeal with young voters, especially young men. Want to hear Trump talk about UFOs, the assassination attempt, his favorite insults for political opponents, cocaine, football, Jeffrey Epstein, reviving the economy, and which celebrities he knew? Well, there was a podcast appearance about that. Trump spoke to any of these major podcasters about basically anything they're interested in for hours at a time.\n\nThis was an important strategy not only for reaching out to the young college-aged male but also the young minority male vote. Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Andrew Schultz, Barstool Sports, and the rest have massive audiences of minority men, and this is supplemented for traditional campaign coalition teams. You don't have to do \"[insert ethnicity] for Trump\" when you're reaching out to a cross-section of podcast listeners.\n\nA senior member of Team Trump said that the campaign benefited from having people of diverse ages on the campaign who could advocate for which podcasts to appear on and think outside of the box.\n\nBeing affiliated with Trump was just no longer radioactive. Podcastsers, social media influencers, and the UFC made Trump more relatable-while Oprah, Taylor Swift, and Beyonce made Harris more distant.\n\nLabeling J.D. Vance \"weird\" always seemed, well, weird to me. Perhaps because I've known him for a few years and worked on a Super PAC supporting his 2022 Senate election, I knew he was as normal as anyone could be given his intelligence and incredible success. How many people serve in the military, become a best-selling author, literary celebrity, venture capitalist, senator, and vice presidential candidate by the time they're 40? That is weird, I suppose.\n\nDemocrats worked overtime to paint him as the worst possible pick for vice president. Minnesota's Gov. Tim Walz took pleasure in calling him \"weird,\" a phrase that was repeated on the campaign stump and on social media countless times.\n\nVance was largely left out to dry during his initial rollout. He certainly had many detractors within the GOP who didn't want him on the ticket. This came from both figures at the center of the party, who felt he was too unorthodox and wanted someone that more closely resembled Mike Pence, and those on the more conservative side who wanted an older pick, someone who couldn't be a natural successor to Trump and would retire in 2028 when he did. The negative onslaught against Vance, who had already spent nearly a decade since the release of Hillbilly Elegy in the media spotlight, reached a fever pitch once Trump announced him.\n\nTo his credit, Vance didn't shy away from tough interviews; he met the challenge, sometimes appearing on three or four Sunday shows. He was taking on more combative interviews on any given weekend than Harris and Walz did during the entire campaign.\n\nWalz's inexperience doing interviews-especially in comparison to Vance, who did nearly one a day-proved a serious weakness in the vice-presidential debate. The two standing side-by-side lent itself to comparisons of the Nixon-Kennedy debates in 1960. Walz looked sweaty, stuttering, and incredibly nervous, like Fred Mertz during a scene from I Love Lucy ; Vance was calm, collected, and threw TV-canny side-eyes at the moderators and his political adversary.\n\nThe debate was remarkably substantive, hearkening back to a different time in politics, one that the general public missed. Vance breathed a new level of intelligence to Trumpism-less flashy, more relatable, while being able to note the complexity of public policy.\n\nHis post-debate appearances also focused on the podcast circuit more, with comedians like Theo Von, Tim Dillon, and Joe Rogan. While they received less media attention than Trump's, they destroyed any notion that he was weird. The majority of the top comments on the Theo Von podcast all had the same take, \"This guy is supposed to be weird? He's the most normal, down-to-earth guy.\"\n\nWhen the New York Times interviewed 13 young voters, three, two of whom were women, said they cast their ballots for Trump because Vance was on the ticket.\n\n\"I can't believe it, but I did end up voting for Donald Trump. I made that decision when I saw J.D. Vance's interview with the New York Times . He is the future of the Republican Party. I'm more voting for Vance than I am for Trump,\" said Abigail, a 23-year-old graduate assistant who voted for Biden in 2020.\n\n\"I shocked myself and voted for Trump. No one tell my family. I was so impressed by JD Vance, the way he carried himself and how normal he appeared,\" said McLane, a 25-year-old resident of Washington D.C. who wrote in Mitt Romney's name in 2020.\n\nPerhaps Vance's family life, as a doting husband to a very successful lawyer and active father, helped appeal with young women who were on the fence and weren't seeing the misogynist who defamed \"cat ladies\" that the media were talking about.\n\nDespite promoting an image of a girlboss running a flawless campaign based on joy, Harris was always in trouble. To the public, the difference between her and Joe Biden was skin-deep; she could never fully explain how she would chart her own path for the country. Her campaign strategy seemed to be dodging interviews, palling around with celebrities, and laughing like a hyena in front of the cameras.\n\nAlmost every media narrative on her campaign was based on \"vibes,\" not facts. Reporters and television pundits proudly proclaimed that this election was going to show the biggest gender divide in American political history, but polls never showed that. Among aggregated public polls, Kamala was never doing better among women than Biden or Hillary Clinton. There were countless comparisons to Barack Obama, but they were never sincere. Whether you hate or love Obama, his defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary was meteoric, and the campaign had a genuine groundswell of support that defined the era.\n\nDuring a series of softball interviews, Harris wasn't able to answer the most basic question of how she differed with Biden on voters' top issues, particularly immigration and the economy. It became a running joke how often she would say, \"I grew up in a middle-class family.\"\n\nThis was most evident on The View , where the most openly racist person on television, Sunny Hostin, asked Harris whether she would have done anything different than Biden.\n\n\"There is not a thing that comes to mind,\" Harris responded. \"And I've been part of most of the decisions that have had impact.\"\n\nAt a time when governing political parties across the globe were losing elections, this answer isn't going to cut it.\n\nAlso hurting Harris were the radical positions she took in 2020 during the \"Great Awokening,\" when she championed Black Lives Matter activists' calls to defund the police, open-border activists' calls for amnesty and destroying ICE, and trans activists' demands for taxpayer-funded sex-change surgeries. She allowed herself to make decisions based upon the whims of the most mentally ill leftists on Twitter and in Democratic think tanks, which proved to be nightmarish when she became the party's nominee.\n\nTrump's closing ad-\"he's for you and she's for 'they/them,'\" in which he discussed Harris's support for taxpayer funded transgeneder surgeries for illegal aliens-was especially brilliant because it played to two of her weakest points. Post-election, many politicians, including on the left, focused on how she was too supportive of the trans movement but her inability to come out for real enforcement on illegal immigration was also a big part of it.\n\nIn the postmortem of her election, Democratic strategists are finger pointing at Biden, Merrick Garland for not indicting Trump, and voters for refusing to see what they saw.\n\nUltimately, however, the party was suffering from a bad economy that it refused even to acknowledge and from candidates who were too far to the left for the country. They believed that Harris's identity as a woman of color who supported abortion and \"democracy\" would be enough to win over voters when it ended up pushing them away.\n\nAsking who is to blame for Harris's failure to secure 270 electoral votes, Democrats need to only look in the mirror and reflect on the utter madness they have espoused over the last four years. \"We have met the enemy, and he is us.\"\n\nDonald Trump's victory defied all expectations: he won every swing state, the popular vote, and put states like New Jersey, Minnesota, and New Hampshire into play. His last term in office will begin much like his first term, with a Republican majority in the Senate and a small one in the House. But as divided as the party seemed when he first put his hand on the Bible and gave his \"American carnage\" speech, it is now more united than it has been in decades. Today, it is the MAGA party; Trump built it on his sheer ability to connect with people and defy decades of political orthodoxy that no longer served the public.\n\nTrump is a unique politician; we'll never see someone like him again. The coalition he built was equally as special. According to AP VoteCast, Trump's path to victory brought together a majority of Baby Boomers and Gen-Xers, 47 percent of millennials, who made up the base of Obama's coalition, and a shocking 47 percent of Gen-Zers, who get their news on TikTok, X, and Instagram.\n\nThe base of his party is the working-class white men and women, especially ethnic whites, who delivered Appalachia, the South, and the Rust Belt; one in four black men, who helped him win in Georgia and North Carolina; and nearly half of all Hispanic and Asian men, who made a big difference in the Southwest and counties in big blue states like Nassau, New York; Passaic, New Jersey; Riverside, California; and precincts across Massachusetts, Illinois, and Virginia.\n\nThere's also the women's vote, which Trump only lost by single digits-the most narrow of all three of his elections.\n\nSo why did this coalition come together for him?\n\nIn part, because voters had become exhausted by the narrative that he was an existential threat to the nation. Liberal hyperbole about Trump's tenure was unfounded to the lived experience of his first term. We never got the world war they promised. That's the problem with the man chanting \"the end is near\"; eventually it has to come. For the Trump panickers, it never did.\n\nSecond, was the dishonesty of the media in refusing to acknowledge basic truths most Americans felt. The economy isn't in great shape, illegal alien gangs were operating in cities and municipalities where they'd never before been present, and crime had increased in large parts of the country. Their refusal to acknowledge what people were going through made this election in part a referendum on the media which so heavily was tipping the scales for Kamala after spending three years lying about Joe Biden's health.\n\nIdeologically, Trump also ran as a moderate, but not in the sense most politicos understand it. When the average person thinks of a moderate, they may immediately think of someone like Susan Collins or Joe Manchin, when in fact moderates hold far-left and far-right positions on various issues that make them seem moderate when you average them out.\n\nA University of California, Berkeley study from 2014 found that the average moderate voters tended to hold left-wing positions on Social Security, Medicare, and marijuana while having right-wing positions on immigration, the environment, and unions. That's basically where Trump's rhetoric lay, along with other conservative positions on Israel, crime, and taxes. While Harris's team insisted that she had backed away from more radical positions from her past, she never backed away from them publicly. In fact, when she was asked how she voted on a California amendment to raise the punishments for certain drug and theft crimes, she wouldn't state her position. She felt that her answer could be too divisive, splintering her far-left base. The amendment passed with nearly 69 percent of the vote.\n\nThat essentially tells the story of the modern Democratic Party, ignoring the overwhelming majority to chase the most fringe segments of their base on issues like crime, immigration, and the economy. According to the Fox News exit survey , voters trust Trump more than Harris on all those issues.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, was able to moderate on issues like abortion, chasing moderate voters and correctly believing that the overwhelming majority of pro-life voters wouldn't abandon him. So when 63 percent of Americans said in exit polls that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, Trump won a third of their vote, while holding on to 83 percent of pro-lifers.\n\nIt should come as no surprise then that the Fox News survey showed that 52 percent of respondents believed Donald Trump had the right policy ideas for the country compared, to 47 percent for Kamala Harris.\n\nPart of this majority coalition is unique to Trump, certainly many minority voters who cast a ballot for a Republican for the first time backed Democrats running in the House and Senate. Yet that doesn't have to be forever. Just as Nixon created the coalition that put Republicans in the White House in five out of six presidential elections, Trump may have created such a winning coalition for the long term.\n\nTrump was these voters' first foray into voting Republican, but as so long as the party is able to a more working-class party and more trusted on the issues of crime, immigration, and the economy, and as long as Democrats continue to surrender to the most radical segments of their base, they'll have a path to the majority.\n\nAs we close the book on Trump being a candidate for office, it's worth reconsidering the words of Abraham Lincoln: \"The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise-with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.\"\n\nDonald Trump disentangled the Republican Party from the dogmas of neoconservatism, moving past the bygone days of Reagan and Bush and reaching out to voters who were always within reach but never felt a political party spoke to them. Some say he conducted a hostile takeover of the Republican Party, but in fact all he did was see a million-dollar bill on the ground and pick it up. Democrats and the corporate media cannot help but push against him-they have too much at stake in the current political system-but if the GOP can continue to build itself up as a working-class party that advocates for the forgotten man, it will keep Trump's governing majority.\n\nThis article appears in the January/February 2025 issue\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "State of the Union: They really did it.\n\nThey're indicting him.\n\nAfter more than a week of speculation, we learned yesterday that a New York grand jury voted to indict former President Donald Trump, likely on felony business records violation charges related to payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels. The New York Times reports that Trump will be fingerprinted, booked in a Manhattan jail, and might even be handcuffed.\n\nTheoretically-and there's little reason to believe the facts matter at all here-for Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg to secure a felony conviction under New York's records falsification statute, he'll have to prove that Trump's having misclassified the hush money payments was done in furtherance of some other criminal activity. In this case, the only conceivable criminal activity resulting from the misclassified payments-it is not a crime to pay hush money to a porn star, at least not yet-is a campaign finance violation. Even that is tenuous, as we saw when the Obama Justice Department tried , and failed, to secure a campaign finance conviction against John Edwards on a similar theory.\n\nWe're in banana republic territory. A local prosecutor indicting a former president and the current president's chief political rival is the sort of thing you expect in Venezuela or some African dictatorship, not the United States. But under this administration, which has weaponized the Justice Department against its political opponents, it's not all that unbelievable.\n\nNancy Pelosi tweeted that \"everyone has the right to a trial to prove innocence.\" That's pretty right wing, but it's not how the American justice system is supposed to operate.

      "text": "Media conniptions notwithstanding, the Trump indictment is a boring story.\n\nIf you have access to media of any kind, or speak to other human beings, you have heard by now that the Manhattan district attorney's office has indicted Donald Trump. While the actual indictment document remains sealed for the time being, a few basic facts are publicly available. The charges stem from a 2016 incident dramatically referred to as Trump's \" scheme to pay hush money \" to a porn actress over an alleged affair. From a lawyer's perspective, what we know so far and what we are likely to discover when the indictment is unsealed is no bombshell. It's not even very interesting.\n\nThe facts are still somewhat obscure, but the gist is that Trump was accused of having an affair with a porn actress known as Stormy Daniels. A deal was reached where money was to be paid to this woman in exchange for her silence about the alleged affair. For reasons we will get to shortly, this ordinarily would not be news, nor a crime, nor anything worth writing about. But apparently the payments were made through Michael Cohen, Trump's lawyer, via a shell company. A Trump organization reimbursed Cohen for \"legal expenses.\"\n\nThe Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg appears to be pursuing business fraud charges over the manner in which the payments were made. But that is only a misdemeanor. The D.A. (who has seemingly made it a priority to downgrade criminal felonies in New York City to misdemeanors) is intent on charging Trump with a felony, by trying to tie the business fraud charge to a campaign finance violation.\n\nIf this seems convoluted, it is. To get a felony charge, Bragg will essentially have to prove that Trump falsified business records with the intent to commit a crime, in this case the campaign finance violation of aiding his campaign by paying to cover up the affair. Again, the indictment is not public, so we have not yet seen the extent of the charges or the evidence presented to the grand jury. But let's step back, because we are missing the fact that, even if the worst version of this unlikely tale is true, it is rather unimportant and legally quite boring.\n\nLet us first dispense with the supposed political implications. Criminal charges cannot disqualify Trump from being elected president in 2024. Yes, under Article II of the Constitution, a president can be impeached for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. But impeachment is a post-hoc process applied against a sitting president, not a disqualification from office. The Constitution provides three, and only three, qualifications for someone to be sworn in as president: The person must be a natural born citizen, at least 35 years old, and at least 14 years a resident of the United States. That is it. Trump is a natural born citizen, well over 35 years old, and a life-long U.S. resident. He remains qualified to be president if he is indicted and convicted of these offenses, or even if he is standing trial or sitting in jail on election night.\n\nIt should be mentioned in passing that early poll numbers suggest that this indictment will only increase Trump's popularity among primary voters. It is too early to discuss the potential political ramifications of a misdemeanor business fraud charge for a presidential candidate, but it doesn't seem likely that this episode will be the demise of the Teflon Don.\n\nBack to the realities of the legal situation. As a recovering private practice attorney who spent a couple years in civil litigation, it is worth explaining some basic concepts to those following the Trump situation. Wealthy people get sued. A lot. While the legitimacy and frequency obviously vary with the facts and circumstances, this is a well-known reality. And most civil disputes do not go to trial : In fact, in recent years the percentage of civil litigation matters that are resolved before trial (by settlement or a pre-trial disposition of some kind) is generally well over 90 percent. There is a reason for this. Lawsuits are expensive, and they often involve airing unpleasant dirty laundry in public. Therefore, it is quite common to settle a lawsuit without going to court.\n\nWhen a civil settlement occurs, the settlement agreement will involve a payment, and will almost always include some kind of non-disclosure agreement. One party agrees to take a certain amount of money, and in exchange agrees to drop his lawsuit and not to speak publicly about the incident or the terms of the settlement. Frequently, a civil defendant will pay for a settlement even if he maintains that the accusations are false, because it is cheaper and less stressful to pay a settlement in exchange for silence and an end to litigation. Call it \"hush money\" if you like, but this is not a dark exchange reserved for mobsters. This is how civil lawsuits are settled.\n\nSo while I hate to disappoint those looking for the next big piece of drama in the endless quest to take down Trump, this indictment is not a bombshell. It is not the big scandal that will finally sink him. This is actually quite boring. We have known about the alleged Stormy Daniels affair for years, so that part is not news. This indictment will tell us nothing that makes it more likely that the affair actually occurred, or that Trump engaged in some insidious criminal activity. It tells us only that Trump was sued, that he decided it was better to make a payment and settle the case quietly, and that perhaps the manner in which the settlement money was delivered was not quite by the books. But even that is unlikely to reveal anything exciting.\n\nTrump could have any number of reasons for wanting to settle a civil lawsuit. Perhaps he wanted to save his family the embarrassment and hassle of a public trial. Perhaps he was busy with a presidential campaign and just wanted this out of his life. Whatever his motive, Trump is rich. He could afford this six-figure payment. If there was an attempt to cover up the nature of this payment through lawyers and shell corporations, it was likely not because he was intending to violate campaign finance law. Trump was a very public figure who was legitimately trying to keep the settlement private; is it surprising that he might fear that, if he wrote a settlement check in his own name, nosy political operatives and journalists might dig it up? When we think of campaign finance law violations, we think fraud, theft of political funds for personal use, bribery. This is not that.\n\nThere is just no way around the fact that this is not a compelling story. This is simply not important. Activist Democrat politicians and the corporate media could really occupy us with something much more interesting than a story about a rich, public political figure settling a civil lawsuit. But they can't help it, because the subject is Trump. This is dull, run of the mill legal procedure. No matter what the indictment and possible show trial might reveal, there is really nothing to see here.\n\nFrank DeVito is an attorney currently serving as counsel at the Napa Legal Institute.

      "text": "Alvin Bragg drops assault charges against man who fought back when vagrant attacked him with nail-studded chunk of wood\n\n'I woke up every day thinking that I would spend years in jail when I never committed a crime.'\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) dropped assault charges against a Chinatown landlord who fought back when a vagrant attacked him with a nail-studded chunk of wood in late August, the New York Post reported .\n\nBragg's office initially charged Brian Chin - a 32-year-old Harvard graduate student - with felony assault after the incident, the paper said.\n\n'Instead of doing the right thing, [Bragg] used his office to pursue a case against me for nearly five months. It leads me to ask the question: How many other innocent people has he incarcerated?'\n\nChin spotted the vagrant lying on the ground outside the subway station at Chrystie and Grand Streets in Manhattan around 8:30 p.m. Aug. 24, the Post said. Chin allegedly kicked the male three times, the paper said, citing a criminal complaint.\n\nChin told the Post he approached the male because he recognized him as a local panhandler and wanted to make sure he was OK: \"We have so many drug overdoses and deaths and pretty much every conceivable horror that you can imagine. Immediately, he woke up after that and just started screaming.\"\n\nThe paper said the pair initially went their separate ways after the encounter - but both came back a few minutes later.\n\nChin said he returned because he was haunted by the slaying of his renter, Christina Yuna Lee , two years ago, the Post said. Chin blasted Bragg over Lee's 2022 killing , insisting it could have been prevented since the suspect in her killing had a lengthy criminal history.\n\n\"Especially after the murder, if someone is acting violent, I just like to stand by the front door, just to make sure that no one gets followed in, all my tenants are safe,'' Chin noted to the paper.\n\nMore from the Post:\n\nChin told the paper he tried to calm him down but feared for his life during the fight: \"I just wanted to get home to my wife and kids.\" Chin also told the Post that in the aftermath he felt \"awful. I never want anyone to get hurt.\"\n\nThe paper said the assault charges against Chin could have landed him in jail for up to seven years - until Bragg decided not to pursue them.\n\n\"It's our job to thoroughly investigate and prosecute violent conduct, including incidents of alleged assault,\" a representative for the Manhattan DA's office said Sunday, according to the Post. \"This case has been dismissed and, as a result, sealed by the court.\"­\n\nChin told the paper he's annoyed that the charges had been hanging over his head since the summer: \"I am more angry than relieved because this is something that never should have happened.\"\n\nHe added to the Post that he \"was treated like a violent perpetrator in the eyes of the law, and it has been five months of an unending, waking nightmare. ... I woke up every day thinking that I would spend years in jail when I never committed a crime.\"\n\nChin also told the paper that he had to resign from his teaching position because he no longer could pass a background check: \"What was this for? It upended my life, everything I spent decades working for.\"\n\nHe also noted to the Post that the homeless man later was charged with menacing and that it's \"personally abhorrent that this case was ever brought.\"\n\n\"With such an abundance of evidence from the very start, it was clear that I was not a perpetrator but a victim,\" Chin told the paper. \"Instead of doing the right thing, [Bragg] used his office to pursue a case against me for nearly five months. It leads me to ask the question: How many other innocent people has he incarcerated? How many were not so fortunate as to have been attacked on their own property and to have access to surveillance footage showing their innocence?\"\n\nThe Post said Chin compared himself to Jose Alba - the New York City deli worker Bragg charged with murder after Alba stabbed an attacker to death in 2022. After public outrage over what many saw as self-defense, Bragg dropped all charges against Alba .\n\n\"How many more victims - how many more Jose Albas, how many more cases such as myself - will need to be at his hands before the politicians who have continually shielded him wake up to the fact that this is not how justice is conducted in this country? It's not what New Yorkers deserve,\" Chin told the paper.\n\nChin's attorney Kenneth Gilbert told the Post that Bragg saved face by dropping his client's charges: \"If it had gone to trial, it would have been an embarrassment for the prosecutor's office.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

Hush money is unseemly, but it is legal,\" Shugerman wrote.\n\nHe continued:\n\nAccording to Shugerman, there are \"three red flags raising concerns about selective prosecution\" in the case, all three of which concern the novel legal theory prosecutors are using against Trump for which there is no precedent.\n\n\"Eight years after the alleged crime itself, it is reasonable to ask if this is more about Manhattan politics than New York law,\" Shugerman wrote. \"This case should serve as a cautionary tale about broader prosecutorial abuses in America.\"\n\nHe added, \"This case is still an embarrassment of prosecutorial ethics and apparent selective prosecution.\"\n\nStill, Shugerman said the legal process should play itself out - but predicted Trump may ultimately win.\n\n\"If Monday's opening is a preview of exaggerated allegations, imprecise legal theories, and persistently unaddressed problems, the prosecutors might not win a conviction at all,\" he said.\n\nGeorge Washington Law School professor Jonathan Turley holds similar views about the case.\n\nOn Monday, Turley said he is left in \"utter disbelief\" that Bragg chose to prosecute the case, which he described as \"an embarrassment.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

Some have referred to this effort to deny voters a choice and thereby decide the election by undemocratic means as \" lawfare .\"\n\nMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey (R) revealed Thursday that such attacks will not go unanswered.\n\nBailey noted on X that he would be \"filing suit against the State of New York for their direct attack on our democratic process through unconstitutional lawfare against President Trump. It's time to restore the rule of law.\"\n\nAccording to the Republican, the efforts of \"rogue prosecutor\" New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg to \"take a presidential candidate off the campaign trail ... sabotages Missourians' right to a free and fair election.\"\n\nLast week, Bailey testified before the House Judiciary Committee. He noted in his written statement that the \"left has prioritized its hatred of President Trump above the rule of law.\"\n\n'The prosecution was politically motivated and replete with legal error.'\n\n\"Government officials at the federal and state levels have censored President Trump, filed civil suits in order to sanction him, illegally removed him from the ballot , and perverted the law in order to prosecute him,\" wrote Bailey.\n\nThe Missouri AG indicated further that Bragg's prosecution of Trump, in particular, \"represents one of the most morally abhorrent volleys in the left's on-going barrage of lawfare. The prosecution was politically motivated and replete with legal error.\"\n\nAmong the issues Bailey highlighted with Trump's prosecution in New York - which are likely to be raised in his forthcoming lawsuit - were:\n\nBailey further highlighted in his testimony the apparent \"collusion\" between the Biden Department of Justice and the New York District Attorney's Office regarding the initiative to take Trump off the board.\n\nBailey's office expects that lawsuit will go straight to the U.S. Supreme Court and will be titled \"Missouri vs. New York,\" reported Fox News Digital.\n\nExtra to announcing that Missouri would be suing New York Thursday, Bailey filed an amicus brief with 23 other red states urging the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, which is overseeing Trump's classified documents case, to reject Special Prosecutor Jack Smith's request for an \"unconstitutional gag order\" on Trump.\n\nSmith asked Judge Aileen Cannon that the conditions permitting Trump to await trial outside of jail should be updated to include a gag order, prohibiting him from commenting about details of his case, particularly about the raid on his Mar-a-Lago residence.\n\nTrump's attorneys said in a filing last week, \"Like Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Smith seeks to restrict President Trump's campaign speech as the first presidential debate approaches at the end of this month,\" reported CNN.\n\nThe amicus brief filed by Bailey and other Republican attorneys general, stressed that fair and free elections \"depend on candidates' ability to speak about important issues of the day.\"\n\n\"When agents of one candidate seek a court order to muzzle discussion on matters relating to important electoral issues, that restraint raises even more fundamental First Amendment concerns,\" continued the brief.\n\nLike Blaze News?

His sentencing, which was originally slated for July, has been postponed multiple times.\n\n'A pathetic attempt to salvage the remains of an unconstitutional and politically motivated hoax.'\n\nFollowing Trump's presidential victory in November, Merchan agreed to allow the defense to file a motion to dismiss the case.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, argued that the November election result was \"a mandate that supersedes the political motivations of DANY's 'People,'\" referring to Bragg.\n\nHe further contended that moving forward with the case would be \"uniquely destabilizing\" for the country.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bragg's office rejected Blanche's request to dismiss and argued that the case should be put on hold until the conclusion of Trump's presidency.\n\nThe prosecution wrote, \"President-elect immunity does not exist. And even after the inauguration, defendant's temporary immunity as the sitting President will still not justify the extreme remedy of discarding the jury's unanimous guilty verdict and wiping out the already-completed phases of this criminal proceeding.\"\n\n\"No principle of immunity precludes further proceedings before defendant's inauguration. And even if judgment has not been entered at the time of defendant's inauguration, there is no legal barrier to deferring sentencing until after defendant's term of office concludes,\" the prosecution's filing continued.\n\nBragg's office argued that issuing a stay in the case and waiting to sentence Trump in 2029 would exempt the president-elect \"from any immediate obligations in this case during his time in office, while at the same time respecting the public interest in upholding the rule of law and preserving the meaningful aspects of the criminal process that have already taken place.\"\n\nSteven Chueng, Trump's spokesperson, told Fox News Digital on Tuesday that the prosecution's filing was \"a pathetic attempt to salvage the remains of an unconstitutional and politically motivated hoax.\"\n\n\"This lawless case should have never been brought, and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed, as President Trump must be allowed to continue the presidential transition process and execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this, or any other, witch hunt,\" Chueng continued. \"The sooner these cases end, the sooner our country can unite behind President Trump for the betterment of all Americans.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Daniel Penny was a hero - Alvin Bragg turned him into a villain\n\nWe cannot allow corrupt institutions to punish those who act to protect life and liberty.\n\nAmerica no longer has a single, shared understanding of justice. Two Americas now exist, each applying justice differently depending on who you are and where you live. One America, ruled by common sense and individual courage, praises heroes who stand up to protect others. The other, driven by political agendas and corrupted institutions, punishes those same heroes for daring to act.\n\nThis stark division couldn't be clearer than in the case of Daniel Penny, the Marine whose trial in New York City this week drew strong reactions from both sides across the divided line of justice.\n\nIf we let this slide, we accept a world in which heroes are treated as criminals and the law is a weapon for ideological warfare.\n\nPenny was on a subway train last year when Jordan Neely - a man suffering from severe mental illness and reportedly high on drugs - began threatening passengers, saying, \"I'm going to kill you all.\" The fear on that subway car was palpable, but nobody moved. Nobody, that is, until Penny did what needed to be done. He took action to protect innocent lives.\n\nIn the America many of us used to believe in, Penny's response would be heralded as heroic. His actions mirrored the courage of Todd Beamer on Flight 93, who, on September 11, 2001, rallied others with the words, \"Let's roll,\" to prevent further tragedy. But in New York, courage doesn't seem to count anymore. There, the system turns heroes into villains.\n\nPenny subdued Neely using a chokehold, intending only to restrain him, not kill him. Tragically, Neely died. Penny, filled with remorse, told the police he never meant to hurt anyone. Yet, instead of being recognized for protecting others from a clear and present threat, Penny stood trial for criminally negligent homicide.\n\nIn Alvin Bragg's New York, justice bends to ideology. The Manhattan district attorney has made a career of weaponizing the law, selectively prosecuting those who don't fit his narrative. He's the same prosecutor who twisted legal precedent to go after Donald Trump on business charges no one had ever faced before. Then, he turned his sights on Daniel Penny.\n\nA jury may have acquitted Penny, but what happened in New York City this week isn't justice. When the rule of law changes depending on the defendant's identity or the prosecutor's political motives, we're no longer living in a free country. We're living in a state where justice is a game, and ordinary Americans are the pawns.\n\nIt's worth asking: Where were activists like Alvin Bragg when Neely was suffering on the streets? Jordan Neely was a tragic figure - a man with a long history of mental illness and over 40 arrests, including violent assaults. The system failed him long before he stepped onto that subway train. Yet rather than confront that uncomfortable truth, Bragg's office decided to target the man who stepped in to prevent a tragedy.\n\nThis isn't about justice. It's about power. It's about advancing a narrative where race and identity matter more than truth and common sense.\n\nThe Daniel Penny case - and others like it - is a wake-up call. We cannot allow corrupt institutions to punish those who act to protect life and liberty. Americans must demand an end to politically driven prosecutions, hold DAs like Alvin Bragg accountable, and stand up for the principle that true justice is blind, consistent, and fair.\n\nIf we let this slide, we accept a world in which heroes are treated as criminals and the law is a weapon for ideological warfare. It's time to choose which America we want to live in.\n\nWant more from Glenn Beck ?

His attorney Todd Blanche explained that they had expected the guilty verdict.\n\n\"We didn't think we were gonna get a fair shake in Manhattan, and we didn't,\" Blanche stated.\n\nBragg's prosecution team recently requested to have the gag order against Trump extended, citing 61 alleged threats made by others against Bragg, his family, or employees.\n\nThe new filing, signed by Assistant District Attorney Matthew Colangelo, stated that nothing stops Trump from \"broadly criticizing the verdict, the criminal proceeding, the District Attorney, this court and more - and indeed, defendant has engaged in a flood of such criticisms both during the trial and after the guilty verdict.\"\n\nProsecutors accused Trump of making \"categorically false accusations,\" including that Bragg and his team are attempting to \"restrict the defendant's speech at an upcoming presidential debate.\" The filing stated that Trump's claim has \"no factual basis\" and is \"a lie,\" NBC News reported.\n\n\"These knowing falsehoods are just the latest examples of defendant's patent disrespect for the rule of law and the impartial administration of justice,\" Bragg's team wrote. \"As defendant's continued conduct makes clear, the need to protect participants in this criminal proceeding and the integrity of the criminal justice process from defendant's attacks remains critically important.\"\n\nColangelo previously held a senior role at the Biden administration's Department of Justice before he effectively took a demotion to join Bragg's office in December 2022.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland a couple of months ago stating that Colangelo's appointment to Bragg's office has \"given the perception that the Justice Department is assisting in\" the DA's \"politicized prosecution\" of Trump.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Trump presses SCOTUS for 11th-hour intervention ahead of criminal sentencing in New York hush-money case\n\nThe high court hinted it might act before Trump's sentencing on Friday.\n\nAttorneys for President-elect Donald Trump filed an emergency application with the U.S. Supreme Court late Tuesday in hopes of blocking the Republican's sentencing by Biden donor Judge Juan M. Merchan in the case New York v. Trump .\n\nThe emergency application requested that the justices order a stay of the criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court of New York pending the final resolution of the Republican's appeal concerning questions of presidential immunity. Five justices must be onboard to grant a stay.\n\nThe application, which the New York Times noted came after a New York appeals court rejected a nearly identical request Tuesday, also asked that the justices consider whether \"the trial court's admission and use of evidence of President Trump's official acts in a state-court jury trial on criminal charges violated the doctrine of Presidential immunity recognized in Trump v. United States ,\" and whether a sitting president's immunity from criminal prosecution during his term extends to the president-elect between the time of his election and his inauguration.\n\nBlaze News previously reported that a panel of 12 jurors in the predominantly Democratic state found Trump guilty in May on all 34 counts of falsifying business records, which were filed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in 2023. The prosecution accused the then-Republican presidential candidate of marking payments made to his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, as legal expenses in an effort to hide a $130,000 settlement payment Cohen made to porn actress Stormy Daniels to keep mum about an alleged affair with the president.\n\nWhen delivering jury instructions, the Democratic judge told the panel they did not have to agree on the \"unlawful means\" in order to render a unanimous guilty verdict against Trump.\n\nLegal expert Jonathan Turley explained in a post on X at the time, \"Merchan just delivered the coup de grace instruction. He said that there is no need to agree on what occurred. They can disagree on what the crime was among the three choices. Thus, this means that they could split 4-4-4, and he will still treat them as unanimous.\"\n\nTrump's sentencing was initially scheduled for July 11, 2024, but the Associated Press noted it was postponed twice at the defense's request. The sentencing was delayed again after Trump's landslide electoral victory in November so that the prosecution could contemplate the future of the case.\n\nMerchan finally announced on Friday that Trump would be sentenced on Jan. 10, signaling that he would issue an \"unconditional discharge,\" meaning the case would be closed without prison time, a fine, or probation.\n\nTrump responded to Merchan's announcement with a series of posts on Truth Social, noting in one, \"I never falsified business records. It is a fake, made up charge by a corrupt judge who is just doing the work of the Biden/Harris Injustice Department, an attack on their political opponent, ME! He created a case where there was none.\"\n\n\"I was hiding nothing, everything was out in the open for all to see. Every legal scholar of note said there IS NO CASE AGAINST ME. The judge should be disbarred! This is why people, and companies, are FLEEING New York - A corrupt court system,\" continued Trump.\n\nRepublicans on the House Committee on the Judiciary said of Merchan's announcement, \"Absolutely preposterous lawfare. Judge Merchan is a disgrace to the bench.\"\n\nTrump's emergency application filed Tuesday said the Supreme Court \"should enter an immediate stay of further proceedings in the New York trial court to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the Presidency and the operations of the federal government.\"\n\n\"This appeal will ultimately result in the dismissal of the District Attorney's politically motivated prosecution that was  flawed from the very beginning, centered around the wrongful actions and false claims of a disgraced, disbarred serial-liar former attorney, violated President Trump's due process rights, and had no merit,\" continued the filing. \"In the meantime, the New York trial court lacks authority to impose sentence and judgment on President Trump - or conduct any further criminal proceedings against him - until the resolution of his underlying appeal raising substantial claims of Presidential immunity, including by review in this Court if necessary.\"\n\nAccording to the Times, the Supreme Court directed prosecutors to respond to the emergency application by Thursday morning - a possible sign the high court may take action prior to Merchan's planned sentencing on Friday.\n\nShould the Supreme Court grant a stay of Trump's sentencing, Merchan will be precluded from sentencing Trump for the next four years.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Democratic DA Alvin Bragg sues House Judiciary Committee and Rep. Jim Jordan to keep anti-Trump critic from testifying\n\nManhattan's Democratic District Attorney Alvin Bragg filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the House Judiciary Committee and its chair, Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), claiming that their apparent efforts to shed a light on possible improprieties or partisan malice on his part amount to an \"unprecedently [sic] brazen and unconstitutional attack.\"\n\nThe committee announced Monday that it would hold a field hearing in Manhattan on April 17, near Bragg's office, to examine , in part, how Bragg's \"pro-crime, anti-victim policies have led to an increase in violent crime and a dangerous community for New York City residents.\"\n\nAccording to the New York Post , the committee will address how Bragg, who boosted misdemeanor charges to felonies in his criminal case against former President Donald Trump, had conversely downgraded 52% of felony cases to misdemeanors since taking office in 2022.\n\nIn addition to reviewing the federal funding Bragg's office has received, the committee also wants former Special Assistant District Attorney Mark Pomerantz to testify in a deposition on April 20, having subpoenaed him to that end.\n\nWhile defensive about his approach to crime in New York City, Bragg appears especially desperate to prevent Pomerantz from testifying.\n\nThe Soros-linked attorney's lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that \"Jordan's demands, including his subpoena to Mr. Pomerantz, seek highly sensitive and confidential local prosecutorial information that belongs to the Office of the District Attorney and the People of New York. Basic principles of federalism and common sense, as well as binding Supreme Court precedent, forbid Congress from demanding it.\"\n\nThe suit further alleges that Pomerantz's compelled testimony \"could prejudice Mr. Trump's right to a fair trial and prompt due process concerns.\"\n\nIn addition to rejecting Republican claims that his indictment of former President Donald Trump was political in nature and that he used federal funds in the process, Bragg underscored that \"Congress lacks any enumerated power entitling it to 'conduct oversight' into a single state prosecution in which a local grand jury has voted to bring criminal charges.\"\n\n\"Rather than allowing the criminal process to proceed in the ordinary course, Chairman Jordan and the Committee are participating in a campaign of intimidation, retaliation, and obstruction.\"\n\nJordan appeared Tuesday evening on Fox News, saying, \"They are obstructing our investigation, Brett. We have a constitutional duty to get to the facts, particularly when you have a district attorney interfering with the most important election we have, which is the election of the commander in chief, the president of the United States.\"\n\nContrary to Bragg's suggestion that this is not a matter of concern for federal lawmakers and Congress, Jordan said, \"Alvin Bragg used federal funds to indict a former president for no crime and then when we ask questions about it, when we want to investigate, he takes us to court.\"\n\nJordan reiterated on Twitter: \"First, they indict a president for no crime. Then, they sue to block congressional oversight when we ask questions about the federal funds they say they used to do it.\"\n\nThe House Judiciary tweeted , \"Why's Alvin Bragg scared of congressional oversight? Really makes you wonder..\"\n\nThe Hill reported that U.S District Court Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil responded swiftly to Bragg's suit, declining to immediately block Jordan's subpoena, but requiring the committee to respond in court by April 17.\n\nLike Blaze News?

Late last month, a panel of 12 Manhattan jurors found the former president guilty on all counts.\n\n'If they're not willing to come voluntarily, we will subpoena them.'\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) requested that Bragg testify at a June 13 session regarding the DA's case against Trump.\n\nAccording to a letter from Bragg's general counsel, Leslie Dubeck, the DA is \"committed to voluntary cooperation\" with the committee regarding its investigation into the New York trial. However, Dubeck claimed that Bragg would be unable to attend the upcoming session due to \"scheduling conflicts.\"\n\n\"That cooperation includes making the District Attorney available to provide testimony on behalf of the Office at an agreed-upon date, and evaluating the propriety of allowing an Assistant District Attorney to testify publicly about an active prosecution to which he is assigned,\" Dubeck wrote to Jordan. \"However, the proposed date that the Subcommittee selected without consulting the Office presents various scheduling conflicts.\"\n\nAdditionally, Dubeck claimed that the committee failed to make \"clear the scope of the proposed testimony.\" The letter further stated that Bragg may be unable to testify before Congress until after Trump's sentencing, which is slated for July 11.\n\n\"The trial court and reviewing appellate courts have issued numerous orders for the purpose of protecting the fair administration of justice in People v. Trump, and to participate in a public hearing at this time would be potentially detrimental to those efforts,\" Dubeck wrote.\n\nJordan recently told the Washington Reporter that the committee plans to subpoena Bragg and Matthew Colangelo, one of the lead prosecutors in the case, if they do not show up to testify.\n\n\"Everything's on the table, if they're not going to. We got a notice yesterday and we're communicating with them. But if they don't come, we will. If they're not willing to come voluntarily, we will subpoena them,\" he told the outlet.\n\nColangelo, a former top-ranking Department of Justice official, effectively took a demotion to join Bragg's prosecution team in the New York criminal trial against Trump. Jordan stated that Bragg's decision to recruit Colangelo as a lead prosecutor in the case gave \"the perception that the Justice Department is assisting in\" the \"politicized prosecution\" of the former president.\n\nLike Blaze News?

Alvin Bragg never wanted to bring this lawless case against me,' Trump alleged.\n\n'He was furious at the way it was handled, and especially angry at Mark Pomerantz [New York District Attorney Prosecutor] for his behavior, and what he did.'\n\nTrump wrote about himself in the third person as he suggested that Bragg was forced into action by the Department of Justice, stating that the 'Biden/Harris DOJ forced Bragg to concoct anything to embarrass Trump.'\n\nDonald Trump made a shock claim that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was 'forced' to prosecute him by the Biden Administration\n\nIn the fiery statement posted online, Trump claimed the legal proceedings were all part of a politically motivated effort to discredit him\n\nTrump suggested that Bragg was forced into action by the Department of Justice, stating that the 'Biden/Harris DOJ forced Bragg to concoct anything to embarrass Trump.'\n\nBut the president-elect reserved his harshest criticism for the judge presiding over the case, accusing him of bias and misconduct.\n\n'It was even more so what the corrupt and totally conflicted political hack judge did, and is doing, on this sham trial,' Trump wrote.\n\nHe further decried what he described as an 'unconstitutional gag order,' which he claimed prevents him from discussing the judge's alleged 'highly disqualifying conflicts of interest.'\n\nTrump insisted the trial lacked merit, asserting that 'virtually every legal scholar and pundit says THERE IS NO (ZERO!) CASE AGAINST ME.'\n\nHe accused the judge of fabricating facts and manipulating the law, comparing the proceedings to other legal challenges he has faced in New York, which he described as 'judicial and prosecutorial witch hunts.'\n\nBeyond his personal grievances, Trump painted a dire picture of New York's legal and economic climate claiming the state's legal system was driving businesses away, costing millions of jobs and billions in tax revenue.\n\n'The legal system is broken, and businesses can't take a chance in getting caught up in this quicksand,' he said. 'That's why businesses are fleeing New York, taking with them millions of jobs and billions of dollars in taxes.'\n\nTrump framed the case as part of a broader effort to undermine his political ambitions, calling it a 'rigged' attempt to target a political opponent.\n\nTrump accused Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and the judge overseeing his trial of orchestrating a 'lawless' case against him under pressure from the Biden administration\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said that Trump was unlikely to face jail time or other penalties in the criminal case in which he was convicted on charges involving hush money paid to a porn star\n\nThe case stemmed from a $130,000 payment Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump, who denies it\n\n'It's all rigged, in this case against a political opponent-ME!' he declared, characterizing the trial as an attack on democracy.\n\nTrump will appear at a court hearing just only a week-and-a half before his January 20 inauguration - an unprecedented scenario in U.S. history.\n\nBefore Trump, no U.S. president - former or sitting - had been charged with or convicted of a crime.\n\nThe judge said Trump, 78, may appear at his sentencing either in person or virtually.\n\nHe wrote that he was not inclined to sentence Trump to jail, and that a sentence of 'unconditional discharge' - meaning no custody, monetary fine, or probation - would be 'the most viable solution.'\n\nThe case stemmed from a $130,000 payment Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump, who denies it.\n\nA jury in May found Trump guilty of falsifying records to mask the payment prior to the 2016 election.\n\nThe imposition of the sentence would pave the way for Trump to appeal. Merchan acknowledged in his ruling that Trump has made clear he intends to appeal.\n\nIn other posts to Truth Social over the weekend Trump said he never falsified business records.\n\n'It is a fake, made up charge by a corrupt judge who is just doing the work of the Biden/Harris Injustice Department,' Trump wrote. 'He created a case where there was none.'\n\nMerchan announced his plan for the sentencing in denying Trump's motion to dismiss the case due to his presidential election victory.\n\nTrump's defense lawyers had argued that having the case hang over him during his presidency would impede his ability to govern .\n\nMerchan rejected that argument, writing that setting aside the jury's verdict would 'undermine the Rule of Law in immeasurable ways.'\n\n'Defendant's status as President-elect does not require the drastic and 'rare' application of (the court's) authority to grant the (dismissal) motion,' Merchan wrote in the decision.\n\nMerchan also rejected Trump's argument in a December 3 court filing that dismissal was warranted because his 'civic and financial contributions to this city and the Nation are too numerous to count.'\n\nTrump's defense lawyers had argued that having the case hang over him during his presidency would impede his ability to govern\n\nTrump accused DA Bragg and the judge overseeing his trial, Juan Merchan, of orchestrating a 'lawless' case against him under pressure from the Biden administration\n\nWhile acknowledging Trump's service as president, the judge said Trump's public statements excoriating the justice system were also a factor for him in determining how Trump's character would factor into the decision.\n\nMerchan criticized what he called Trump's 'unrelenting and unsubstantiated attacks' against the integrity of the criminal proceeding, and noted that he had found him guilty of 10 counts of contempt during the trial for repeatedly violating an order restricting out-of-court statements about witnesses and others.\n\n'Defendant has gone to great lengths to broadcast on social media and other forums his lack of respect for judges, juries, grand juries and the justice system as a whole,' Merchan wrote.\n\n'Defendant's character and history vis-a-vis the Rule of Law and the Third Branch of government must be analyzed,' the judge said, referring to the judiciary. 'In that vein, it does not weigh in his favor.'\n\nA Manhattan jury in May found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up the payment to Daniels .\n\nHe had pleaded not guilty and called the case an attempt by Bragg, the Democratic prosecutor who brought the charges, to harm his 2024 campaign.\n\nDaniels' testimony in the trial last year went on for two days and included salacious details of her alleged affair with the president-elect\n\nLawyers for Trump argue the case involving porn star Stormy Daniels should be thrown out\n\nTrump's sentencing was initially scheduled for July 11, 2024, but has been pushed back several times.\n\nOn Thursday, Merchan said Trump's request in August that the sentencing be pushed back until after the election implied that he consented to being sentenced during the transition period.\n\n'Any claim Defendant may have that circumstances have changed as a result of Defendant's victory in the Presidential election, while convenient, is disingenuous,' Merchan wrote.\n\nBragg did not oppose delaying the sentencing until after the election. Merchan in September pushed it back to November 26.\n\nAfter Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election, the judge delayed the sentencing indefinitely to figure out next steps.\n\nBragg's office had argued there were measures short of the 'extreme remedy' of overturning the jury's verdict that could assuage Trump's concerns about being distracted by a criminal case while serving as president, such as delaying the sentence until after Trump leaves the White House in 2029.\n\nMerchan wrote on Thursday he found that alternative 'less desirable' than sentencing Trump before the inauguration.\n\nTrump on December 16 lost a separate bid to toss the hush money conviction in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's July 1 decision that presidents cannot be criminally prosecuted over their official actions, and that evidence of their official actions cannot be presented in criminal cases over personal conduct.\n\nIn denying Trump's motion to dismiss, Merchan said the prosecution over 'decidedly personal acts of falsifying business records poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the executive branch.'\n\nFalsifying business records is punishable by up to four years in prison, but incarceration is not required.\n\nBefore his election victory, legal experts said it was unlikely Trump would be locked up due to his lack of a criminal history and advanced age.\n\nTrump was charged in three other state and federal criminal cases in 2023: one involving classified documents he kept after leaving office and two others involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss .\n\nHe pleaded not guilty in all three cases. The Justice Department moved to dismiss the two federal cases after Trump's election victory.\n\nTrump's state criminal case in Georgia over charges stemming from his effort to overturn his 2020 election loss in that state is in limbo.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

If that happens, it will then be up to the prosecution to retry the case in front of a new jury.\n\nThe difference between the two charges is whether Penny behaved recklessly vs negligently when he put Neely in the chokehold.\n\nPenny held Neely in a chokehold on the subway car floor while others assisted on May 1, 2023\n\nThe May 2023 incident sparked uproar in America - BLM says it was the racist killing of a mentally ill black man by an overzealous white military faithful\n\nafter jurors reported being deadlocked multiple times, Assistant Manhattan District Attorney Dafna Yoran successfully requested the dismissal of the top charge.\n\nMcCarthy pointed out that Penny had adjusted Neely's position to help him breathe, cooperated with police, and was unaware Neely had died during the incident.\n\n'There is evidence that Penny moved Neely into a position that would make breathing easier, waited for the police to come and fully cooperated with them, and did not even know Neely was dead when he voluntarily spoke to police and explained what happened - that he wasn't trying to hurt Neely, just subdue him until the police arrived.\n\n'Now, after the jury could not find Penny guilty of recklessness after four days - and how disturbing it is that one or more jurors were apparently in favor of doing so - the judge is letting Bragg remove the recklessness count from the case. It will go down as an acquittal for Penny on that charge, so he is no longer facing a potential 15-year prison term. For the jury, however, it makes the hard work of the last four days pointless,' McCarthy explained.\n\nDespite McCarthy's objections, he acknowledged the prosecution's dual-charge strategy was having its intended effect. 'Unfortunately, the strategy is working the way it's designed to work,' he remarked.\n\nJudge Maxwell Wiley will now let jurors deliberate a charge of criminally negligent homicide, which carries a lighter punishment after the charge of manslaughter was dismissed\n\nManslaughter requires proving a defendant recklessly caused another person's death, and carries up to 15 years.\n\nCriminally negligent homicide involves engaging in serious 'blameworthy conduct' while not perceiving such a risk and carries punishments ranging from probation to up to four years in prison.\n\nPenny's lawyers have said he was protecting himself and other subway passengers from a volatile, mentally ill man who was making alarming remarks and gestures. Prosecutors said Penny reacted far too forcefully to someone he perceived as a peril, not a person.\n\nDuring the monthlong trial, the anonymous jury heard from witnesses, police, pathologists, a Marine Corps instructor who trained Penny in chokehold techniques, as well as Penny's relatives, friends and fellow Marines. Penny chose not to testify .\n\nThe case became a flashpoint in the nation's debate over racial injustice and crime, as well as the city's ongoing struggle to deal with homelessness and mental health crises in a transit system used by millions of New Yorkers every day.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

      "text": "How Daniel Penny will get revenge on Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan DA who went after him\n\nBy LAUREN ACTON-TAYLOR FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 14:11 EDT, 11 December 2024 | Updated: 23:18 EDT, 11 December 2024\n\n143\n\nView comments\n\nAfter Daniel Penny was found not guilty in the death of Jordan Neely , his lawyers revealed how he will get revenge on the Manhattan District Attorney who went after the Marine veteran.\n\nPenny's defense team is considering bringing a malicious prosecution lawsuit against DA Alvin Bragg and others who brought charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.\n\nPenny was acquitted on Monday at his trial over the death of Neely, a homeless man who Penny put in a chokehold on a New York City subway for threatening other passengers.\n\nPenny's defense attorney, Steven Raiser , told Fox & Friends on Wednesday: 'Just like Danny said in his interview, it was like they wanted to try and get him on something.\n\n'They knew they weren't going to be able to get him, so they had to get rid of that top count in order to get that second count, just in hopes that maybe they could pull out a win here, and they were unsuccessful, thank God.'\n\nRaiser said the lawsuit would target Bragg for 'blurring' the 'ethical lines' with the case's handling . It would also go after the medical examiner's office, which he alleged colluded with Bragg's office, Fox News reported.\n\n'The record was made fairly clear as to the extent of his involvement and what occurred here,' the attorney said.\n\n'He was appointed by Mayor Adams, [who belongs to the] same political party as Alvin Bragg. There was collusion there, and the collusion began from the very beginning of the case and all the way through.\n\nPenny's defense attorney, Steven Raiser, said: 'Just like Danny said in his interview, it was like they wanted to try and get him on something'\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Bragg said: 'The jury has now spoken. At the Manhattan D.A.'s Office we deeply respect the jury process and we respect their verdict'\n\nPenny had been charged and tried over the death of Jordan Neely, who Penny put in a chokehold on a New York City subway for threatening other passengers\n\n' The district attorney needed the medical examiner and needed the medical examiner to act quickly , and he did just that,' he added.\n\nPenny's manslaughter charge was dropped at the prosecution's request on Friday after jurors, for the second time, failed to reach a unanimous decision .\n\nAfter a brief return to deliberations, jurors found Penny not guilty of the lesser charge.\n\nRaiser said the two key reasons he walked free were the cause of death and Penny's justification for his actions.\n\n'He was absolutely justified. He was trying to help people and he did.'\n\nNeely's father Andre Zachary was escorted out of the room after Penny was acquitted on Monday.\n\nSome supporters of the prosecution were outside the building protesting as Penny was escorted out of the courthouse.\n\nA woman on the prosecution's side then told Penny : 'you're a racist fu****g c**t.'\n\nBLM activist Walter 'Hawk' Newsome, who says he is Neely's uncle, was also escorted out after he appeared to threaten Penny, saying 'it's a small fu***ng world, buddy.'\n\nPenny's manslaughter charge was dropped at the prosecution's request on Friday after jurors, for the second time, failed to reach a unanimous decision. After a brief return to deliberations, jurors found Penny not guilty on a lesser charge\n\nSome supporters of the prosecution were outside the building protesting as Penny was escorted out of the courthouse\n\nRaiser said the two key reasons he walked free were the cause of death and Penny's justification for his actions. 'He was absolutely justified. He was trying to help people and he did'\n\nBragg said: 'The jury has now spoken. At the Manhattan D.A.'s Office we deeply respect the jury process and we respect their verdict.\n\n'Unfortunately, over the duration of this trial, talented career prosecutors and their family members were besieged with hate and threats - on social media, by phone and over email.\n\n'Simply put, this is unacceptable, and everyone, no matter your opinion on this case, should condemn it. These are prosecutors who have dedicated decades of their lives to public service and to the safety of Manhattan.\n\n'I am grateful to them, as well as to the NYPD for their hard work and commitment on not only this matter, but for all they do on behalf of New Yorkers. I also want to thank Judge Wiley for presiding over this case.\n\nFinally, I want to thank the members of the jury who took time out of their lives to diligently evaluate the evidence.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

for which the former president will be sentenced on July 11.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has been slapped with a professional standards complaint over diversity-hiring at his office\n\nDan Epstein of America First Legal says Bragg has 'unlawfully discriminated against employment applicants to his office' by using race or sex as a factor in hiring.\n\nDan Epstein, AFL's vice president, said Bragg's office appeared to have 'unlawfully discriminated against employment applicants to his office' by using race or sex as a factor in hiring.\n\n'We should expect that those who carry out law enforcement are held to the highest legal compliance standards,' Epstein added in a statement.\n\nBragg's office did not immediately answer DailyMail.com's requests for comment.\n\nThe grievance committee said it cannot comment on the complaint, as its review and investigation process is confidential.\n\nIt's the latest in a series of lawsuits and complaints aimed at diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), policies in American institutions.\n\nAdvocates of DEI say it helps get more women and minorities into colleges and workplaces, but critics say it ends up hurting straight, white men.\n\nAccording to AFL, Bragg's office uses favors minorities when hiring for some 50 staffers each year.\n\nThe complaint highlights pages from the Manhattan DA's website and other documents that showcase its DEI policy.\n\nOne says the office is 'committed to the recruitment, hiring, retention, and promotion of a diverse staff.'\n\nAnother says it's 'dedicated to building a diverse workforce that reflects ... the diversity of the communities we serve.'\n\nThose applying for law clerk jobs at the office must disclose their race, ethnicity, gender, says the complaint.\n\nApplicants even get a drop-down menu that asks their 'LGBT' status - which only offers 'bisexual,' 'gay,' 'lesbian,' and 'trans,' as options, says the document.\n\nThere's no option to select 'straight' or 'heterosexual,' it adds.\n\nThe complaint does not present data about the backgrounds and identities of actual hires at the office.\n\nHiring practices at the Manhattan District Attorney's office are under the spotlight\n\nBragg drew ire from conservatives over what many called a 'selective' prosecution against former president Donald Trump\n\nAll complaints with the grievance committee are reviewed and some are investigated.\n\nThey can lead to attorneys being dismissed or admonished, though complaints do not typically relate to hiring practices.\n\nAFL, which is led by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, made a similar complaint against Bragg's DEI policies with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the New York Department of Labor earlier this month.\n\nBragg became a target for conservatives over the first successful prosecution against a former US president, which many observers noted was the least consequential of the cases against Trump.\n\nThe progressive DA stoked outrage again last week when his office let dozens of anti-Israel protesters arrested at Columbia University in April off the hook, dropping criminal charges against them.\n\nHe is considered one of the leaders of a new 'progressive DA' movement, one of several funded by left-wing billionaire George Soros.\n\nIn February, it was revealed that Bragg has downgraded a staggering 60 percent of felony cases to lesser charges in the last year, data from his office shows.\n\nThe DA reduced 938 of the most serious charged in 2023, 834 of which were brought down to misdemeanors.\n\nUnder Bragg, the percentage of felonies downgraded has increased to 60 - up from 53 percent under his predecessor.\n\nHis team defended the figures stating the office's performance is on par with other New York boroughs and higher when it comes to felony convictions.\n\nBragg, who campaigned on a promise of criminal justice reform, issued a controversial 'Day One' memo after taking office stating he would only seek prison time in the most severe cases.\n\nIt comes amid fury over criminals being allowed to roam the streets of the Big Apple, which continues to be rocked by a violent crime wave.\n\nSince being sworn in on January 1, 2022, the DA has also declined to prosecute 14 percent of all arrests, compared to just nine percent in 2021 when his predecessor was last in post.\n\nHowever, overall arrests screened by his office was up by more than a third compared to 2021.\n\nThe complaint was filed with New York's Attorney Grievance Committee this week\n\nBut this will be of little comfort to victims of the most serious crimes, with the data showing that Bragg's office has secured a felony conviction just 52 percent of the time, down from 65 percent in 2021.\n\nBragg has been criticized for his soft-on-crime policies, which include calling on prosecutors to ditch felony armed robbery charges and instead charge suspects with petit larceny and not seeking carceral sentences for criminals .\n\nCrime in New York City, has decreased by .032 percent since before the pandemic, but the decrease is not enough for many who feel unsafe in Manhattan.\n\nMAGA operatives have accused Bragg of having a political agenda.\n\n'Alvin Bragg is a disgrace. He cares more about targeting Joe Biden's political opponent than protecting New Yorkers from rapists, murderers, and robbers.' Alex Pfeiffer, spokesman for Make America Great Again Inc said.\n\nMeanwhile victims of crime have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the lack of justice.\n\nThe AFL complaint is part of a growing number of suits and filings against DEI practices since the US Supreme Court's landmark June 2023 ruling to end affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nThe conservative legal action group has filed more than 15 lawsuits and more than 30 complaints to a US civil rights agency.\n\nLawsuits have claimed that hiring and recruitment decisions made around both jobs and fellowships at large companies are biased against white workers.\n\nAdvocates of DEI schemes say they bring more black, brown, female, and queer talent into offices and colleges and raise morale across the board.\n\nBut critics say they're a 'woke' virtue-signaling exercise that fosters backlash discrimination against straight, white men.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Our job is to follow the facts and the law without fear or favour' said Bragg, responding to criticism of the case.\n\nIt was a long-awaited turn in the spotlight for Bragg, who Trump has ridiculed as 'fat Alvin' and called 'Soros-backed.' The DA smiled at times as he finally got to address the media about the high profile case.\n\nBragg showed restraint in his remarks, but still managed to take a victory lap and cracked a smile while praising a team that managed to secure the first ever conviction of a former president.\n\nAsked if his office would object to any effort by defense lawyers to stay a potential jail sentence for the former president - which experts call unlikely - Bragg responded, 'I'm not going to address hypotheticals.'\n\nAsked if his team would seek prison time for Trump, Bragg responded, 'We will speak in our court filings as we've done throughout this proceeding,' he said. Legal experts have said a sentence of probation is far more likely for the first-time, non-violent offender.\n\n'I did my job,' said DA Alvin Bragg after a jury convicted former President Donald Trump on 34 counts. Behind him to his left is Matthew Colangelo, a former DOJ official who Trump uses to accuse President Biden of being behind the case. To his right is prosecutor Joshua Steinglass\n\nAsked if he had any response to Trump repeatedly targeting him, Bragg said simply: 'I do not.'\n\n'This defendant may be unlike any other in American history. But we arrived at this trial and this verdict in the same manner as every case that comes through the courtroom doors, by following the facts and the law and doing so without fear or favour, said Bragg.\n\nHe heaped praise on his team, even after some legal experts criticized the decision to rely on federal campaign finance statutes to get around statute of limitations issues on misdemeanor charges of falsifying business records.\n\nBragg's predecessor, Cy Vance, Jr. and the feds had declined to bring charges against Trump for a period of time.\n\nIt came after Trump following the verdict called it a 'rigged trial' and a 'disgrace.'\n\n'I want to thank this phenomenal prosecution team embodying the finest traditions of this office, professional, integrity, dedication and service. They are model public servant and I'm proud and humble to serve side by side with them,' he said.\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump called his trial a 'disgrace' minutes after jurors found him guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records\n\nHe repeatedly steered his comments back to the jury, who called a group of 'everyday New Yorkers.'\n\n'I want to thank this phenomenal prosecution team embodying the finest traditions of this office, professional, integrity, dedication and service. They are model public servant and I'm proud and humble to serve side by side with them,' he said.\n\nA reporter asked prosecutor Joshua Steinglass about a 'masterful' prosecution. He only smiled, while Bragg talked up his team again while smiling broadly.\n\nBragg shared his 'enormous gratitude' and made a joke about the closing arguments that Steinglass let run beyond four hours.\n\nMr. Steinglass - I think some of you probably saw him speak for a little bit the other day,' Bragg said, earning laughs. 'So he's done his job as as this team,' he said.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

He faces sentencing on July 11.\n\nO'Donnell - a former Congressional speechwriter before his transition to television - was effusive in his praise for Bragg.\n\nHe referenced a 1995 op-ed written in the Harvard Crimson that called Bragg - then a student and a leader in the Harvard Black Students Association - 'the anointed one.'\n\n'That's the right title,' declared O'Donnell, a former writer for The West Wing. 'That's who this guy is.'\n\nMSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell couldn't contain his praise for Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg after he successfully prosecuted Donald Trump, referring to him as 'the anointed one'\n\nHe continued, 'The people of Manhattan who elected him, that's what they saw. They saw somebody who is dedicated to doing this job and doing it flawlessly and so profoundly modestly.'\n\n'In a country in the Trump era that desperately needs lessons in modesty, Alvin Bragg is that lesson.'\n\nFellow liberal MSNBC host Rachel Maddow agreed with O'Donnell.\n\n'You know, Lawrence, it is such a good point that in this moment, when it is remembered in history, yes, the crimes will be part of the history, the criminals will be part of the history, absolutely,' she said.\n\n'But the people who were brave enough to take this through the criminal justice system against all the threat that they had to face in order to do it, and against all of the odds and against the most powerful people in the country, some of the most powerful people in the world to do it.'\n\nThe Harvard Crimson op-ed praised an event Bragg organized in 1992, a speech by City University of New York professor Leonard Jeffries.\n\nBragg was able to lower tensions between black and Jewish students over the speech, which many protested over accusations that Jeffries was anti-Semitic, an accusation one black student called 'bulls***.'\n\nThe op-ed praised Bragg as 'a rare ability to reconcile diverse people and clashing views.'\n\nBragg led the prosecution as the former president was found guilty Thursday on all 34 felony counts after a very brief deliberation\n\nTrump faces sentencing for his 34 felony convictions on July 11\n\nThe Crimson argued, somewhat ironically, 'The Harvard senior himself says he will likely not end up running for office.

He stole her phone and bank cards before performing the 'lewd act' in front of the horrified woman.\n\nThe unnamed victim works for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Braggs , according to the New York Post .\n\nSimosa was arrested on Tuesday after police were able to track the prosecutor's stolen phone to the Row NYC Hotel migrant shelter in Midtown, where the perpetrator was found outside.\n\nHe was hit with charges including sexually motivated burglary, sexually motivated robbery, grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property.\n\nSimosa is connected with the criminal organization Tren de Aragua , according to the Post.\n\nIt is unclear when he came to the US or if he was staying at the Row NYC Hotel shelter , but he has already racked up at least six arrests in the last five months.\n\nBrandon Simosa, 25, was arrested on Tuesday for his Sunday atrocities after police tracked the stolen phone to a migrant shelter\n\nSimosa has racked up an extensive criminal record since coming to New York City\n\nJust last week, he was picked up for grand larceny and criminal mischief in Manhattan.\n\nPrior to that, sources told the Post he was arrested in Queens for a string of robberies between June and August.\n\nSimosa appeared in court on Wednesday and pled not guilty to the charges following Sunday's altercation before being released into the general public.\n\nThe violent Venezuelan super gang Tren de Aragua has racked up more than 500 arrests this year in NYC alone, as the mob's members commit heinous crimes across the country.\n\nThe majority of arrests were on charges of robbery and grand larceny, but the gangsters' rap sheets also include assault and car theft raps, data obtained by the Post revealed.\n\nMore than half the bookings occurred in Midtown - where Simosa was arrested - according to the stats, with with 295 busts having taken place near tourist hotspots.\n\nSome New Yorkers have grown outraged by the city's 'soft-on-crime' policies when it comes to migrants.\n\nEarlier this year, Brooklyn residents were shocked by an increase in shoplifting, panhandling, scams and street prostitution since migrants moved into the Floyd Bennett Field shelter .\n\nNearly 2,000 migrants were moved to the isolated temporary shelter in mid-November, 2023, as the city ran out of housing options.\n\nA NYPD cop told the Post at the time: 'This s*** is out of control.'\n\nMore than 200,000 migrants have arrived in the Big Apple since 2022.\n\nBeleaguered New York Mayor Eric Adams has been called out as the bill for housing the city's migrants soars toward $2.3 billion.\n\nRow Hotel has been converted into a migrant shelter. Simosa was arrested in front of the building\n\nThe victim is an assistant district attorney for the office of Manhattan's District Attorney Alvin Bragg\n\nCity Hall warned that 14,000 hotel rooms will be needed until at least the end of next year when the total cost of providing for the new arrivals will reach a staggering $5.76 billion.\n\n'The taxpayers can't pay for this indefinitely,' Nicole Gelinas of the Manhattan Institute think tank told the Post. 'We should stop using hotels as shelters by the end of the year.'\n\nSome of the city's most iconic hotels have been turned over to migrants since the start of the crisis, 22 of them in Midtown Manhattan, including Row NYC Hotel.\n\nHotel bosses have warned that they will struggle to return rooms currently housing migrants in a fit state for the millions of tourists who keep the economy afloat.\n\n'They're going to need renovations,' said Vijay Dandapani, the CEO of the NYC Hotel Association, said earlier this year.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Trump goes after soft-on-crime Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg AND his wife after grand jury indictment - as protesters turn out at Trump Tower while his fans swarm Mar-a-Lago\n\nBy JEN SMITH, CHIEF REPORTER and ROB CRILLY, SENIOR U.S. POLITICAL REPORTER and EMILY GOODIN, SENIOR U.S. POLITICAL REPORTER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 08:23 EDT, 31 March 2023 | Updated: 21:51 EDT, 31 March 2023\n\n4.5k\n\nView comments\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has launched a social media assault on Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, the Democratic prosecutor going after him for alleged fraud, and even took aim at his wife in the most recent round of complaints since he was indicted last night.\n\nTrump, 76, will be arraigned in Manhattan at 2.15pm on Tuesday on an array of business fraud charges relating to 2016 hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels.  He has denied any personal wrongdoing, and says he is the victim of a politically-motivated witch hunt led by the famously Democratic Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg .\n\nThe charges are not yet known - only once he is formally charged in person will the indictment become unsealed.\n\nWhile he waits for that to happen, Trump is not holding back in his criticism of Bragg.\n\nToday, he reposted several news videos and campaign trailers by Bragg's opponents, which described him as one of the worst DAs in the country and shamed him for not prosecuting many violent crimes.\n\nBragg is among a handful of Democratic prosecutors around the country who has received funding from mega-donor George Soros.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump today reposted these tweets which claim DA Bragg's wife  has a personal hatred of him, and was longing for an indictment\n\nBragg with his wife, Jamila Ponton Bragg, left. Trump is shown, right, on March 25. He has not been seen today, but entertained was at Mar-a-Lago last night\n\nTrump also shared videos which criticize Bragg's prosecutorial record.

For several years, @jpontonbragg has railed against Trump & retweeted posts calling him racist and advocating for his arrest.'\n\nPonton-Bragg has now made her Twitter account private. Perry did not provide any screenshots of the tweets he said she'd posted.\n\nShe and Bragg have been married for 20 years and share two children.\n\nProtesters have been gathering for weeks but were out in force today outside Trump Tower following the bombshell grand jury indictment\n\nOutside Trump Tower, protesters calling or Trump's arrest gathered throughout the day\n\nAnti-Trump protesters demonstrate outside Trump Tower after former U.S. President Donald Trump's indictment by a Manhattan grand jury following a probe into hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels\n\nA person poses with a newspaper with a picture of former U.S. President Donald Trump on the cover outside Trump Tower, after his indictment by a Manhattan grand jury following a probe into hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels\n\nAn anti-Trump protester holds a placard and a small U.S. flag outside Trump Tower after former U.S. President Donald Trump's indictment by a Manhattan grand jury\n\nProtestors gather in front of Trump Tower in New York City on March 31, 2023\n\nYesterday, Judge Juan Merchan was spotted arriving at the Manhattan criminal courthouse in casual clothes last night flanked by two security officers, leading many to believe that he has been chosen for the case.\n\nMerchan previously presided over the Trump Organization fraud trial, where the family business was fined $1.2million on a range of charges.\n\nOn Friday morning, Trump took to Truth Social to complain that Merchan 'hates' him and had been 'handpicked' by Bragg and his cronies. His daughter Ivanka said the indictment has left her feeling 'pained' for both him and her country.\n\nMeanwhile, anti-Trump protesters gathered in force outside Trump Tower in Manhattan to celebrate the indictment. They held up protest signs that read 'lock him up', a play on his supporters' old chants about Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump, writing on Truth Social, fumed about the judge.\n\n'The Judge \"assigned\" to my Witch Hunt Case, a \"Case\" that has NEVER BEEN CHARGED BEFORE, HATES ME.\n\nHis daughter Ivanka said the indictment has left her feeling 'pained' for both him and her country\n\n'His name is Juan Manuel Marchan (sic) was hand picked by Bragg & the Prosecutors.'  which didn't \"plead,\" VICIOUSLY. APPEALING!\n\nHe also complained about how Merchan 'railroaded' Allan Weisselberg, the former Trump Org. CFO, into taking a plea deal. Trump claims he forced Weisselberg to admit guilt, and that he treated anyone who didn't 'viciously'.\n\nThe Trump Organization was found guilty of a series of tax crimes last year. As part of that case, Judge Merchan fined the organization $1.2million, but neither Trump nor any of his children, were personally charged or held liable.\n\nThe indictment against him signals the first time a US president has ever been criminally charged. Trump and his attorneys say it's a political witch hunt designed to hurt his chances in the 2024 election.\n\nAmong his few remaining supporters in Washington is Marjorie Taylor Greene. She has vowed to come to New York next week to protest the indictment and offer Trump her support.\n\nBoth President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris refused to comment on the indictment.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, on a high profile trip to Africa that has been overshadowed by the Trump news, also refused to comment on the former president.\n\n'I am not going to comment on an ongoing criminal case as it relates to the former president,' she told reporters at a press conference in Zambia.\n\nPresident Biden repeatedly refused to answer questions outside The White House this morning.\n\nTrump fans at Mar-a-Lago today.

I don't think they're going to allow this to become a circus.'\n\nHe added that even though he is yet to see the indictment or know what the specific charges are, he does not believe they are warranted.\n\nDespite predicting his own arrest, Tacopina said he was still shocked that the grand jury decided to indict him.\n\nDonald Trump fumed that the judge who is expected to preside over his looming case 'hates' him and is the same man who oversaw the Trump P\n\nManhattan DA Alvin Bragg is shown arriving at Manhattan Criminal Court on Friday morning\n\nA court sketch shows Judge Merchan (right) reading the counts aloud to Trump Organization lawyers (left) in December.

He was initially shocked.\n\n'After he got over that, he put a notch on his belt and he, you know, decided we have to fight now.\n\n'Now, he is in a typical Donald Trump posture - he is ready to be combative on something he feels is an injustice.'\n\nTacopina said Trump will plead not guilty, and that he will 'immediately' begin 'aggressively' fighting the case.\n\n'His knees don't buckle. He is ready to fight this,' he said.\n\nTrump's former attorney Michael Cohen - who was previously convicted of campaign finance violations and tax evasion over the same hush money payment - took a victory lap on Good Morning America today\n\nCalling it an 'unprecedented case', he fumed: 'The rule of law died yesterday.'\n\nIn a separate interview on Good Morning America, Michael Cohen - Trump's former attorney who was previously convicted of campaign finance violations and tax evasion -  took a victory lap.\n\nHe said Trump should be more concerned with the 'court of law' than with the 'court of public opinion'.\n\nPresident Biden declined to comment when approached by reporters outside the White House.\n\nTrump and his wife Melania were captured just hours after a grand jury recommended that he be indicted over a $130,000 hush money payment to former porn star Stormy Daniels .\n\nA photo of the couple was posted to Twitter on Thursday evening by Gina Loudon, a conservative media commentator, who tweeted: 'Beautiful evening here at the gorgeous Mar a Lago! Our REAL First Couple enveloped in the love of their friends and most loyal!'\n\nShe then added: '(Sorry to disappoint, corporate media. Actually not. Screw you! This is a happiness you will never know, sadly).'\n\nThe ex-president and frontrunner to be Republican nominee in 2024 said he is 'completely innocent' and has dismissed the accusations as politically motivated . He is set to face a mug shot, finger-printing and a court appearance next week following the indictment.\n\nThe appearance came as the Trump team was working out how to handle the news - which came as a shock. They had not expected a decision for several weeks, given announcements about the Manhattan grand jury's schedule.\n\nA Manhattan grand jury has voted to indict former president Donald Trump over hush money paid to pornstar Stormy Daniels\n\nTrump supporters were dispatched to news channels to argue that the case was political persecution, with Alan Dershowitz, a lawyer who represented Trump in his first impeachment, arguing that a fair trial was impossible in Manhattan. He said the trial should be moved from the Democrat stronghold to Staten Island - the only one of the five boroughs of New York City to vote Republican.\n\nThe news also caused consternation in Washington DC, according to a report. The New York Times said that some in the Justice Department were concerned that the charges could overshadow and perhaps complicate their own cases, which are felt to be stronger.\n\nThe Justice Department has a special counsel, Jack Smith, investigating efforts to overturn the election, and the handling of Mar-a-Lago classified documents.\n\nIt is unclear when those investigations will conclude.\n\nTrump's lawyer has said he will travel to Manhattan to be arraigned on Tuesday, when he could face as many as 30 charges related to business fraud.\n\nThe former president huddled with lawyers and advisers at his Mar-a-Lago home on Thursday evening after news broke that a Manhattan jury had voted to indict him over a $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nResponding to the news last night, Daniels tweeted: 'Thank you to everyone for your support and love! I have so many messages coming in that I can't respond...also don't want to spill my champagne.\n\n'#Teamstormy merch/autograph orders are pouring in, too! Thank you for that as well but allow a few extra days for shipment.'\n\nTrump has blasted the indictment and said Democrats would regret persecuting an innocent man when his supporters dumped them out of office.\n\nIn the meantime, the Manhattan district attorney's office said it was in touch with Trump's lawyers to arrange his surrender in New York.\n\nA source told DailyMail.com that the head of Trump's security detail recently traveled to Manhattan to review arrangements and that the former president would likely be formally arrested next week.\n\nThat could be as soon as Tuesday, Susan Necheles, one of his lawyers, told the New York Times.\n\nAlthough the indictment is sealed for now, CNN reported that it contained more than 30 criminal charges .\n\n'The Democrats have lied, cheated and stolen in their obsession with trying to \"Get Trump,\" but now they've done the unthinkable - indicting a completely innocent person in an act of blatant election Interference,' Trump said in an emailed statement.\n\n'Never before in our nation's history has this been done.'\n\nThe indictment marks the end of a five-year investigation into cash paid to the adult movie star in 2016, allegedly to buy her silence about their affair.\n\nAnd it takes the country into uncharted political and legal territory. Although being charged with a crime would not disqualify him from running for office, it does mean a leading 2024 candidate faces the humiliation of arrest.\n\nA spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said talks had begun to bring Trump to New York.\n\n'This evening we contacted Mr. Trump's attorney to coordinate his surrender to the Manhattan D.A.'s Office for arraignment on a Supreme Court indictment, which remains under seal,' they said.\n\nEarlier, Trump played nine holes of golf at his Florida club as usual on Thursday morning. But the 76-year-old did not stay for lunch even though his usual table was reserved.\n\nA source close to his Mar-a-Lago home said the Trump team was ready with statements and social media messaging as soon as the indictment dropped.\n\n'We had a plan in place and the plan was executed,' he said. 'Getting surrogates out, getting content out.'\n\nWithin minutes his sons Don Jr and Eric were livecasting or tweeting, fundraising appeals followed and an emailed statement arrived from Trump himself in inboxes soon after.\n\nTrump is expected to travel voluntarily to New York to be arrested. But Florida Governor Ron DeSantis tweeted that he would not help any effort to extradite the former president\n\nTrump railed against the indictment in an emailed statement. He said this 'Witch-Hunt will backfire massively on Joe Biden' and predicted Democrats will be voted out of office\n\n'I believe this Witch-Hunt will backfire massively on Joe Biden,' said Trump, before criticizing the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\n'The American people realize exactly what the Radical Left Democrats are doing here. Everyone can see it.\n\n'So our Movement, and our Party - united and strong - will first defeat Alvin Bragg, and then we will defeat Joe Biden, and we are going to throw every last one of these Crooked Democrats out of office so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\n\nTrump is leading most polls of Republican voters for the party nomination.\n\nMeanwhile it also emerged on Thursday New York prosecutors were looking to charge Trump over a $150,000 payment made to another former Playboy model\n\nBut the Manhattan case is just one of the legal obstacles he faces, including probes into efforts to overthrow the result of the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMany leading legal scholars believe the hush money case may be the weakest of the lot.\n\nTrump and his allies had even floated the idea that the case was being dropped after a series of delays to grand jury hearings.\n\nAs a result, the indictment landed out of the blue on Thursday evening.\n\nIt leaves a city braced for protests. All uniformed members of the New York Police Department need to be 'prepared for deployment,' according to memo obtained by the New York Times.\n\nHis lawyers, Susan Necheles and Joseph Tacopina, promised to fight the 'political prosecution' in court. 'President Trump has been indicted. He did not commit any crime,' they said.\n\nAlthough he is the first former president to be criminally charged, he is not the first presidential candidate to be criminally charged. Eugene Debs, convicted of sedition and jailed for his opposition to World War One, ran for president five times.\n\nIt marks a victory for the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg.\n\nBragg's office has been probing a $130,000 hush money payment made by Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and fixer, to Daniels, 44, during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe Trump camp was quick to blast the indictment on Thursday night, with Eric Trump telling DailyMail.com it was 'the opportunistic targeting of a political opponent'.\n\nFlorida Governor and 2024 rival Ron DeSantis offered a partial lifeline on Thursday, saying he would try to thwart the extradition of the former president from his state.\n\nHe described the prosecution as 'unAmerican.'\n\n'Florida will not assist in an extradition request given the questionable circumstances at issue with this Soros-backed Manhattan prosecutor and his political agenda,' he said in a tweet, referring to the fact that Alvin Bragg's election campaign was backed by billionaire activist George Soros.\n\nTrump's Vice President Mike Pence also blasted Bragg's decision to bring charges against his former boss.\n\n'The unprecedented indictment of a former president on a campaign finance issue is an outrage. I think the American people are going to look at this... as one more example of the criminalization of politics in this country.'\n\nRepublican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel weighed in. She tweeted: 'When our justice system is weaponized as a political tool, it endangers all of us.\n\n'This is a blatant abuse of power from a DA focused on political vengeance instead of keeping people safe.'\n\nAcross the political aisle, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who were Trump's bete noires on Capitol Hill during his presidency, both released statements following the news.\n\nPelosi said: 'The Grand Jury has acted upon the facts and the law. No one is above the law, and everyone has the right to a trial to prove innocence. Hopefully, the former President will peacefully respect the system, which grants him that right.'\n\nLikewise, Schumer said: 'Mr. Trump is subject to the same laws as every American. He will be able to avail himself of the legal system and a jury, not politics, to determine his fate according to the facts and the law.\n\n'There should be no outside political influence, intimidation or interference in the case. I encourage both Mr. Trump's critics and supporters to let the process proceed peacefully and according to the law.'\n\nPresident Joe Biden's White House declined to comment on the indictment.\n\nMeanwhile it also emerged on Thursday New York prosecutors were looking to charge Trump over a $150,000 payment made to another former Playboy model.\n\nBragg's team has questioned grand jury witnesses about cash given to Karen McDougal, who was Playboy magazine 'Playmate of the Year' in 1998.\n\nEric Trump told DailyMail.com: 'This is the opportunistic targeting of a political opponent in a campaign year.\n\n'They are ruthlessly attacking my father because he dared challenge the political elite . This is Exhibit A to the decline of American Law.'\n\nThe former president has always denied having an affair with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.\n\nBut the case dogged him through his time in office after triggering a federal investigation.\n\nIn 2017 Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal charges, including tax evasion, fraud and campaign finance violations, and he told a court in Manhattan that Trump had directed him to make the payments.\n\nBut the investigation disappeared from the headlines as other legal cases focused on Trump's family business and his actions around the Jan. 6, 2021, riot hog the spotlight. But it never went away.\n\nAlthough the Justice Department decided not to charge Trump and the Federal Election Commission was deadlocked over taking action over claims that the payment amounted to an undeclared campaign contribution, the Manhattan DA was still looking at the case.\n\nAnd it took on fresh momentum early in 2023 when Cohen met with investigators from the Manhattan district attorney's office and it emerged that a grand jury was hearing evidence.\n\nSuch hearings are conducted in secret. But one theory was that it was probing Trump for falsifying business records in connection with the payment, by allegedly misreporting a campaign donation as a legal fees.\n\nThat amounts to a misdemeanor. But that rises to a felony if it is done in conjunction with a second crime, such as a campaign finance violation.\n\nThen in March Bragg's office asked Trump to testify, in the clearest sign yet that he could be indicted.\n\nThe former president confirmed as much in a social media post at the weekend, calling on supporters to rise up in protest.\n\n'The far and away leading Republican candidate and former president of the United States of America will be arrested on Tuesday of next week,' he posted on his Truth Social platform. 'Protest, take our nation back!'\n\nThe final act was reportedly the repeat testimony of Trump lawyer Robert Costello on Monday.\n\nHe was asked to appear by the former president's legal team because he may have evidence that contradicted Cohen's account. Privately Trump's allies are confident that the case has little substance.\n\nAn insider told DailyMail.com that it strengthens him politically, rallying the base in his support. 'It is very obvious that this is helpful,' he said.\n\nHe added that to get the second charge, elevating the case to a felony, prosecutors would have to show that Trump wanted to cover up an affair to help his campaign, even though the business mogul's love life had been frontpage news in New York for decades.\n\n'Of course no one wants to be indicted, but it is helpful politically and legally it's not even that much of a threat because the case is so weak and looks nakedly political,' added the source.\n\nLegal experts have also weighed in on the case's failings.\n\n'Although it may be politically popular, the case is legally pathetic,' said Jonathan Turley, Shapiro Professof of Public Interest Law at the George Washington  University in a column for The Hill .\n\n'Bragg is struggling to twist state laws to effectively prosecute a federal case long ago rejected by the Justice Department against Trump over his payment of @hush money@ to former stripper Stormy Daniels.\n\n'In 2018 (yes, that is how long this theory has been around), I wrote how difficult such a federal case would be under existing election laws. Now, six years later, the same theory may be shoehorned into a state claim.'\n\nMeanwhile on Thursday it emerged Manhattan DA Bragg's team has questioned grand jury witnesses about cash given to Karen McDougal, who was Playboy magazine 'Playmate of the Year' in 1998.\n\nMcDougal claims she had a ten-month affair with Trump which began in 2006. Trump's office released a statement on Thursday branding the development a 'hoax'.\n\nEvidence about payments to McDougal could either be used to bring new charges or establish a 'pattern of behavior' for the Daniels case, sources told the Wall Street Journal which revealed the development.\n\nA spokesman for Trump said: 'It is sad to see radical Democrats and their partners in the media try to resurrect a dead witch hunt.\n\n'Just like with every other hoax that President Trump has been targeted with, there is no crime, except for election interference through weaponization of our justice system against President Trump and his supporters.'\n\nBragg's office and McDougal's lawyer hadn't commented on the latest development on Thursday afternoon.\n\nAmerican Media Inc, the owner of the National Enquirer, paid $150,000 to McDougal in 2016 for exclusive rights to the story about her alleged affair with Trump , which he denies. But the purchase was a 'catch and kill' tactic to prevent the story being made public.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission later ruled that the company and its former president, David Pecker, struck the deal with Trump officials in order to suppress the story and 'prevent it from influencing the election'.\n\nThe FEC ruling detailed how Pecker and AMI met with Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen to help make negative stories about Trump and his relationships go away.\n\nAnd it concluded that AMI 'coordinated' with the Trump campaign in paying $150,000 to McDougal. Pecker gave evidence to the Trump grand jury on Monday.\n\nWhat a farce this all is!

Bragg's team defended the figures stating the office's performance is on a par with other New York boroughs and higher when it comes to felony convictions.\n\nBragg, who campaigned on a promise of criminal justice reform, issued a controversial 'Day One' memo after taking office stating he would only seek prison time in the most severe cases.\n\nIt comes amid fury over criminals being allowed to roam the streets of the Big Apple, which continues to be rocked by a violent crime wave.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg downgraded 60 percent of his felony cases to misdemeanors in 2023 as crime continues to cause havoc in the Big Apple\n\nOf the 938 felonies downgraded in 2023, 834 were reduced down to misdemeanor charges\n\nThe progressive DA was sworn in on January 1, 2022 but has come under criticism for his 'soft on crime' approach\n\nSince being sworn in on January 1, 2022 the soft-on-crime DA has also declined to prosecute 14 percent of all arrests, compared to just nine percent in 2021 when his predecessor was last in post.\n\nHowever, overall arrests screened by his office was up by more than a third compared to 2021.\n\nBut this will be of little comfort to victims of the most serious crimes, with the data showing that  Bragg's office has secured a felony conviction just 52 percent of the time, down from 65 percent in 2021.\n\nBragg has been criticized for his soft-on-crime policies, which include calling on prosecutors to ditch felony armed robbery charges and instead charge suspects with petit larceny and not seeking carceral sentences for criminals .\n\nCrime in New York City, has decreased by .032 percent since before the pandemic, but the decrease is not enough for many who feel unsafe in Manhattan.\n\nMAGA operatives have accused Bragg of having a political agenda.\n\n'Alvin Bragg is a disgrace. He cares more about targeting Joe Biden's political opponent than protecting New Yorkers from rapists, murderers, and robbers.' Alex Pfeiffer, spokesman for Make America Great Again Inc said.\n\nMeanwhile victims of crime have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the lack of justice.\n\nJoseph Borgen, 31, who was the victim of anti-Jewish mob assault in Manhattan, spoke out slamming the plea deal that allowed one of his attackers off with just 18 months behind bars .\n\nBragg's opponents have accused him of being soft on crime\n\nBragg, who campaigned on a promise of criminal justice reform, said he would only seek prison sentences for the most serious crimes\n\nWaseem Awawdeh, 24, faced seven years in jail after being filmed beating Borgen with crutches, calling him a 'dirty Jew' and pepper spraying him in the 2021 attack.\n\nBorgen struggled to contain his fury as he delivered a victim impact statement at the sentencing of Awawdeh who was offered the deal despite allegedly bragging he 'would do it again'.\n\nMost recently, Bragg has been slammed for allowing men accused of brutally beating two NYPD cops in Times Square last month to walk free.\n\nOne of the migrant gang accused of the attack was picked up a couple of days later at a Queens mall on attempted shoplifting charges.\n\nMayor Eric Adams meanwhile has continued to insist that crime in the city is headed in the right direction.\n\nOne of his most recent defenses saw him claim that New York is not as bad as LA's infamous Skid Row.\n\nThe first-term mayor made the proud proclamation as he touted year-end crime statistics at 1 Police Plaza in January - and held up a picture of the far-flung LA neighborhood as proof.\n\nA rant ensued - one that seemed to ignored how his city is in the midst of an unprecedented migrant crisis which he himself warned will soon see asylum seekers 'sleeping on the streets'.\n\nBragg has been criticized for his lenient plea deals including one offered to Waseem Awawdeh, 24, after he was arrested for an anti-Semitic attack on Joseph Borgen in May 2021\n\nJoseph Borgen (above) struggled to contain his fury as he delivered a victim impact statement at the sentencing of Waseem Awawdeh, who was facing up to seven years in jail but handed just 18  months under the plea deal\n\nBorgen is seen hospitalized left, and in an interview a day after the attack right\n\nHowever, he failed to address data which showed crime in his city was down a miniscule .032 percent.\n\nMurders this year fell by 11.9 percent compared to last, to a reported 386 as opposed 438, the data showed.\n\nRapes, meanwhile, were down 10.5 percent, while robberies were down 3.1 percent.\n\nGrand larceny thefts were were also down 2.5 percent and burglaries 13.1.\n\nHowever motor vehicle theft rates have spiked 191 percent from before the pandemic, while  felony assaults are up 6.3 percent.\n\nA spokesman for the DA's Office said Manhattan is leading the citywide decrease in crime, highlighting a 38 percent decrease in homicides and a 24 percent decrease in shootings during DA Bragg's first two years in office.\n\n'Manhattan's felony conviction rate is higher than the other four boroughs, and our felony decline to prosecute rate is lower than the citywide average,' he said.\n\n'We are getting results from our comprehensive crime strategy that includes more gun prosecutions, focusing on drivers of violent crime and making investments that prevent crime and build strong neighborhoods.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Brian Steil, R-Wis., on Republicans hoping to make Alvin Bragg testify if President Trump is arrested\n\nThe Manhattan grand jury indictment Thursday night of former President Donald Trump is sparking new scrutiny of the George Soros-supported district attorney who led the investigation into Trump's alleged violations of state campaign finance laws.\n\nThe former president is expected to surrender to District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office early next week, following his indictment stemming from Bragg's investigation into Trump's alleged hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016.\n\nTRUMP INDICTMENT: LIVE UPDATES\n\nFox News Digital previously reported that in May 2021, financier George Soros pushed $1 million to the Color of Change PAC, which turned around and spent big, backing Bragg's candidacy.\n\nSoros' son, Jonathan Soros, and Jonathan's wife, Jennifer Allan Soros, also donated directly to Bragg's campaign, according to New York campaign finance records reviewed by Fox News Digital.\n\nTRUMP INDICTED AFTER MANHATTAN DA PROBE FOR HUSH MONEY PAYMENTS\n\nJonathan Soros, left in the photo, and his wife, Jennifer Allan Soros, combined to give Bragg's campaign $20,000 in 2021. (Mike Coppola/Getty Images for International Rescue Committee)\n\nOn April 26, 2021, Jonathan Soros sent a $10,000 check to the now-district attorney's coffers, state filings show. Three days later, on April 29, Jennifer Allan Soros added a $10,000 contribution to the campaign. While other individuals provided more direct cash to his committee, the couple were among the field of some of its biggest donors.\n\nThe contributions were also uncommon for the pair, as they generally do not get financially involved with district attorney races, though they have donated to other New York political campaigns and issue groups. Jonathan Soros did not respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment on the Bragg donations.\n\nGeorge Soros , on the other hand, has targeted numerous prosecutor races with millions of dollars in recent years.\n\nSoros' district attorney operation usually involves his longtime treasurer, Whitney Tymas, establishing \"pop-up\" political action committees in states where he targets the races. Once set up, the financier injects money into the PACs, which tend to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars backing his preferred candidates. The PACs typically dissolve after the elections.\n\nMANHATTAN DA ISSUES SCATHING RESPONSE TO GOP LETTER ON POSSIBLE TRUMP INDICTMENT: 'WE WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED'\n\nGeorge Soros has financially backed left-wing prosecutors for years. (Simon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nIn Bragg's case, this did not happen. Instead, Soros donated $1 million in May 2021 to the Color of Change PAC, which in the following weeks spent cash backing Bragg's candidacy. The timing of the money makes it likely it aided the efforts.\n\nSoros' spokesperson, Michael Vachon, did not respond to a Fox News Digital's previous request for comment.\n\nSoros has provided financial backing to dozens of far-left district attorney candidates, which he views as a significant component of overhauling the criminal justice system. Controversial DAs such as Larry Krasner in Philadelphia, Kim Foxx in Chicago, Kim Gardner in St. Louis, and George Gascón in Los Angeles have all received massive boosts from his money.\n\nSOME DEMOCRATS FEAR ARRESTING TRUMP COULD BACKFIRE, QUESTION STRENGTH OF CHARGES\n\nManhattan DA Alvin Bragg and George Soros (Associated Press & Reuters)\n\nBragg's potential charges, which were still unknown as of Thursday evening, stem from an alleged $130,000 hush money payment then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen made to Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, in the weeks leading up to the 2016 presidential election in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006.\n\nFederal prosecutors in the U.S. attorneys office for the Southern District of New York opted out of charging Trump related to the Daniels payment in 2019, even as Cohen implicated him as part of his plea deal. The Federal Election Commission also tossed its investigation into the matter in 2021.\n\nFox News Digital's Joe Silverstein and Brooke Singman contributed reporting.\n\nJoe Schoffstall is a politics producer/reporter for Fox News Digital.

(Fox News Digital/Getty Images/DOJ)\n\nJordan pointed to Bragg's indictment of Trump, charging the former president with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Trump pleaded not guilty to all counts. His unprecedented and historic criminal trial is underway for its third week.\n\nA charge of falsifying business records typically is a misdemeanor, but Bragg must convince the jury that Trump allegedly falsified those records in the furtherance of \"another crime.\" Prosecutors suggest that other crime is a violation of New York State Law - to prevent or promote election. On its face, as a stand-alone offense, that charge is also typically a misdemeanor. Coupling the alleged falsification of business records with alleged prevention or promotion of election becomes a felony crime, according to Bragg.\n\n\"New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg is engaged in one such politicized prosecution, which is being led in part by Matthew B. Colangelo, a former senior Justice Department official,\" Jordan wrote. \"Accordingly, given the perception that the Justice Department is assisting in Bragg's politicized prosecution, we write to request information and documents related to Mr. Colangelo's employment.\"\n\nJordan claims that Colangelo's employment history \"demonstrates his obsession with investigating a person rather than prosecuting a crime.\"\n\nNY VS TRUMP: THE EVIDENCE PROSECUTORS CAN PRESENT IF FORMER PRESIDENT TESTIFIES\n\nJordan pointed to Colangelo's work at the New York Attorney General's Office, where he ran investigations into Trump and led a \"wave of state litigation against Trump administration policies.\"\n\nJordan said on the first day of the Biden Administration, Jan. 20, 2021, Colangelo began serving as an acting associate attorney general. Colangelo then became the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General.\n\nColangelo joined Bragg's office in December 2022, after the resignations of Mark Pomerantz and Carey Dunne - prosecutors who were investigating Trump and resigned in protest of Bragg's initial unwillingness to indict the former president.\n\nTodd Blanche, lawyer of former U.S. President Donald Trump, speaks from a podium at a hearing next to prosecutor Matthew Colangelo at the Manhattan Federal Court over Trump's push to move his criminal case to federal court, in New York City, U.S. June 27, 2023 in a courtroom sketch. REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg (Reuters)\n\n\"Bragg hired Mr. Colangelo to 'jump-start' his office's investigation of President Trump, reportedly due to Mr. Colangelo's 'history of taking on Donald J. Trump and his family business,\" Jordan wrote. \"Mr. Colangelo is now a lead prosecutor in President Trump's trial.\"\n\nNY PROSECUTORS REVEAL 'ANOTHER CRIME' TRUMP ALLEGEDLY TRIED TO CONCEAL WITH FALSIFIED BUSINESS RECORDS\n\nJordan reminded Garland that Bragg's prosecution of Trump \"concerns federal subject matter identical to a matter that the Justice Department closed in 2018, raising concerns that a state-level prosecutor is seeking to relitigate an issue on which the federal government previously declined prosecution.\"\n\nBragg's prosecution relies \"heavily\" on testimony of ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, making false statements to Congress and tax evasion. He was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\n\"In the years since, Cohen has been vocal about his deeply personal animus toward President Trump,\" Jordan wrote.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim Jordan speaking to the press. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nJordan went on to demand documents and information about Colangelo's work at the Justice Department related to Trump and Cohen.\n\n\"As the Committee has previously explained, Bragg's politicized prosecution of President Trump has serious consequences for federal interests,\" Jordan wrote. \"That a former senior Biden Justice Department official is now leading the prosecution of President Biden's chief political rival only adds to the perception that the Biden Justice Department is politicized and weaponized.\"\n\nTRUMP TRIAL: FORMER PRESIDENT 'INNOCENT,' DEFENSE SAYS AS DA ALLEGES 'CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY'\n\nJordan requested documents from January 2021 through December 2022 between or among Colangelo and any employee of Bragg's office, New York Attorney General Letitia James' office, Fulton County, Ga. District Attorney Fani Willis' office or the Justice Department's special counsel office referring or relating to Trump, the Trump Organization, or any other entity owned by or associated with Trump.\n\nNY Attorney General Letitia James, Manhattan Prosecutor Matt Colangelo and DA Alvin Bragg.\n\nTrump has argued that the cases against him in all jurisdictions - Bragg's; Special Counsel Jack Smith's election interference charges; Smith's classified records charges; and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' charges - have been brought against him for the purposes of election interference and in coordination with President Biden.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nTrump also was hit with a now-slashed $454 million judgment out of a non-jury civil fraud trial stemming from New York Attorney General Letitia James' lawsuit. He is appealing that ruling.\n\nMeanwhile, Jordan is requesting all personnel files related to Colangelo; all communications between the DOJ and Bragg's office relating to the prosecution of Trump; all records relating to the conviction of Cohen at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York. Jordan requested Garland produce the records by May 14.\n\nThe investigation into Colangelo comes just days after the Jordan and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee released their 300-page report saying Bragg  \"allowed political motivations and animus to infect its prosecutorial discretion.\"\n\nBrooke Singman is a political correspondent and reporter for Fox News Digital, Fox News Channel and FOX Business.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)\n\nEngoron ruled Trump was liable for fraud and \"falsifying business records,\" \"issuing false financial statements,\" \"conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,\" \"insurance fraud\" and \"conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.\"\n\nTrump was required to post a slashed judgment bond of $175 million as he appeals the ruling.\n\nTRUMP'S $454M JUDGMENT BOND SLASHED BY MORE THAN HALF IN APPEALS COURT RULING\n\nThe trial took place without a jury.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has been in court for the first two days of jury selection in a Manhattan criminal court this week.

Bragg, in his case, wants Trump to be held in contempt of court, claiming he violated the gag order imposed upon him by Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the criminal trial.\n\nBragg says he also intends to use information from the E.

The former president was ordered to pay $5 million in that trial.\n\nBragg also said in the filing that he would point to Clinton v. Trump, in which the former president was sanctioned and fined for filing a \"frivolous, bad-faith lawsuit.\"\n\nThe filing came Wednesday, after two days of jury selection in the trial.

      "website": "https://ijr.com",
      "text": "TREY TRAINOR: Alvin Bragg's Overreach Into Federal Election Law To Take Down Trump Is Extremely Dangerous. Here's Why\n\nOn June 13, 2024, I had the honor of appearing before the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary to discuss the critical issue of jurisdictional overreach in the prosecution of federal campaign finance law.\n\nSpecifically, my testimony centered on the actions taken by New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg in prosecuting former President Donald Trump. This case raised significant concerns about the integrity and consistency of enforcement of federal campaign finance law.\n\nThe Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) of 1971 serves as the bedrock of federal campaign finance regulation. It delineates the authorities responsible for enforcing these rules, vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nThis statutory framework is designed to ensure a uniform application of campaign finance laws nationwide, preventing the creation of a fragmented enforcement landscape and leveraging the expertise and resources of federal agencies.\n\nDistrict Attorney Bragg's decision to pursue charges against former President Trump for alleged violations of federal campaign finance laws marks a significant deviation from this established legal framework. By doing so, Bragg effectively usurped the jurisdiction that Congress explicitly reserved for federal authorities.\n\nThis overreach sets a troubling precedent for the politicization of legal proceedings at the state level.\n\nThe danger here lies in the disparate state enforcement standards that torture well established federal law processes. As an example, the state judge in New York misinterpreted the federal criminal mens rea (mental intent) standard and gave a jury instruction which read \"willfully\" contributed, but the mens rea standard under FECA is \"knowing and willful.\"\n\nNow imagine the 50 states enacting the crime of \"campaigning by unlawful means\" and a thousand different state and local prosecutors prosecuting presidents, former presidents, presidential candidates, and any number of candidates for other federal offices under varying interpretations of the FECA by bootstrapping those laws through their state's \"unlawful means\" criminal code.\n\nNext, given the clear precedent established by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the prohibition of state officers prosecuting federal crimes, it is perplexing why Attorney General Merrick Garland, and the DOJ did not intervene in the prosecution of former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe DOJ's Election Year Sensitive Policy is designed to protect the public from being influenced by legal proceedings during an election year. Had the DOJ intervened early to assert its jurisdiction, and that of the FEC, this issue would not be the predominant topic of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nI recently asked for documents at the FEC to be unredacted which show that the DOJ, after a year-long investigation, found no criminal acts committed by former President Trump. The FEC documents reveal that the DOJ had previously requested that all civil enforcement investigations into the supposed $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels be held in abeyance.\n\nThis move, coupled with the DOJ's conclusion that no further legal action was warranted, highlights the federal jurisdiction over this matter. Thus, underscoring the problematic nature of Bragg's prosecution.\n\nThe implications of allowing local district attorneys to prosecute based on their interpretations of federal campaign finance laws are profound. Such actions risk eroding the uniformity and predictability that FECA aims to provide.\n\nThis could lead to a fragmented enforcement landscape where political motivations and local biases influence the application of laws meant to govern national elections.\n\nMoreover, the actions taken by the state court in New York, at the behest of a local official, reflect a long-standing concern articulated by Alexander Hamilton as far back as 1784 in his \" Letter from Phocion to the Considerate Citizens of New York .\"\n\nThere, Hamilton warned against state government officials taking arbitrary actions against citizens. A caution that remains relevant today.\n\nAn even larger concern is the deterrent effect this encroachment on federal jurisdiction will have on well qualified candidates from seeking public office, fearing disparate legal standards based on locality. Preserving the centralized enforcement mechanism envisioned by FECA is essential for fair and impartial oversight of federal campaign finance regulations.\n\nAlvin Bragg's misguided prosecution of former President Donald Trump represents a clear usurpation of federal jurisdiction, with the DOJ's inaction compounding the issue. The dangerous precedent of local prosecutorial overreach in matters of federal concern must be addressed to maintain the integrity of our electoral system.\n\nWe must reaffirm the exclusive authority of the FEC and the DOJ to enforce federal campaign finance laws, ensuring consistent and impartial application across the United States.\n\nTrey Trainor currently serves as a U.S. Senate confirmed Federal Election Commissioner.

Turley said that Penny spent \"a year going through hell\" because of Bragg's prosecution in the wake of Neely's death after Penny restrained on a New York City subway in May 2023.\n\n\"Fortunately, the result is something that everyone can celebrate. But, really, this jury was speaking not just in terms of themselves, but I think in terms of the city at large,\" Turley told \"Fox and Friends\" co-host Lawrence Jones. \"At the end of this process, this was a very strong voice that in New York, you really don't have to walk away, you don't have to just watch.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"But the problem here is the mixed message by Bragg. He put this person through hell. I mean, he put him through a criminal trial, he'll now face a civil trial brought by the family and the question is what was it that Bragg was representing?\" Turley continued. \"Ultimately, the criminal justice system protects the most fundamental values. What is the value here? Across the city in the other case involving the shooting of this CEO, you had the mayor saying, you know, this shows people need to step forward and act. Well, just blocks away, you just tried a guy, at least Bragg did, who did precisely that and he has spent a year going through hell.\"\n\nPolice in Altoona, Pennsylvania, arrested Luigi Mangione Monday following a five-day manhunt after United Health Group CEO Brian Thompson was killed in a Dec. 4 shooting just outside a Manhattan hotel while en route to a conference. Jones asked if Penny's acquittal would see the end of \"political prosecution.\"\n\n\"Well, the question is, who really is the constituency of Alvin Bragg? I think you saw many of those voices outside the courthouse that were filled with rage and anger at this verdict, some even threatening Penny not to remain in New York City,\" Turley responded. \"But you know, beyond that mob is the rest of New York City and they need to look at this case in a more broad sense: This is what you have come to.\"\n\n\"You have a prosecutor who takes an individual like this, who should be celebrated as a hero, in fact, was celebrated by a hero by people in that car and you have prosecuted him and fortunately, other people stepped forward to help support him,\" Turley continued. \"But that's the message that's being sent. You step forward, don't look for support. In fact, we could very well come after you.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Andy McCarthy Says Bragg 'Played Games' From The Beginning Of Daniel Penny's Case\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy said Friday on Fox News that Democratic New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg \"played games\" with Daniel Penny's case, following the announcement that a Manhattan judge agreed to drop his top count of manslaughter.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran announced Friday afternoon that prosecutors would move to dismiss Penny's top count of second-degree manslaughter after the jury had already approached the judge twice, unable to reach a verdict on the charge. On \"Your World with Neil Cavuto,\" the Fox News host asked McCarthy for his thoughts on the \"significance\" of the judge's last-minute decision.\n\n\"I think Bragg played games from the beginning here, Neil. This really was never a recklessness case. The evidence doesn't lend itself to that. I think he threw in the recklessness charge in the hope that it would increase his odds of getting a conviction by giving the jury something to basically compromise on,\" McCarthy said.\n\n\"He knew that they probably wouldn't get him on the recklessness, so they could feel better about convicting him on the negligence, like they were being more fair. So what's happened here is exactly that, in the sense that the recklessness charge after four days and 30 hours of deliberations is finally gone,\" McCarthy added.\n\nMcCarthy went on to state that the jury would still have to return to court on Monday to deliberate on Penny's negligence charge. He called the case unfair and said it should never have involved manslaughter.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"But now the jury's being told it's got to come back and start from scratch on the negligence charge. And that's really not the way the case was tried, because that was not the way the indictment tees it up,\" McCarthy said. \"So I think it's really unfair to Penny in the sense that this should never have been. I don't think it should have been a case at all, but it should never have been anything other than a one count negligence case. I think then it would have been decided by now.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old former Marine's trial began last month after Bragg's office charged him with the death of 30-year-old homeless man Jordan Neely, following Penny's attempt to restrain Neely on the subway in May 2023. At the time of the incident, Neely had allegedly been screaming and threatening commuters, prompting Penny to try to subdue him.\n\nDuring the trial, Penny's defense medical expert, Dr. Satish Chundru, testified that Neely did not die from Penny's chokehold, but from the \"combined effects\" of synthetic marijuana, schizophrenia, and other factors, according to the New York Post.\n\nBecause only the lesser charge is being considered, the maximum sentence Penny could face is up to four years, according to NBC News. Penny has pleaded not guilty.\n\n( Featured Image Media Credit: Screenshot/Fox News/\" Your World With Neil Cavuto\")\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Alan Dershowitz Outlines How Trump Lawyers Should Handle Bragg's Plan To 'Freeze' Business Docs Case\n\nNoted attorney Alan Dershowitz said Tuesday that President-elect Donald Trump's attorneys should seek a writ of mandamus to prevent Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg from drawing the case out.\n\nBragg signed a legal filing opposing a motion by Trump's attorneys to dismiss the case, instead urging New York Judge Juan Merchan to postpone sentencing until 2029, after Trump would leave office. Dershowitz accused Bragg of trying to \"freeze\" the case for his political gain.\n\n\"You can't unfreeze a case any more than you can unfreeze... a live human, human being. What's the purpose of freezing the case? It's so obvious to any lawyer. Now, people who are not lawyers may not understand why Bragg wants the case to be frozen for four years,\" Dershowitz said. \"While the case is frozen, until there is a sentence, under New York law, Trump can't appeal. We all know that once Trump appeals, the conviction will be reversed. Ideally, it will be reversed.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"There is no crime. You can't even recite what there is because they tried to turn a misdemeanor into a felony, and it wasn't even a misdemeanor. It was banned by the statute of limitations,\" Dershowitz added. \"There's just no crime, but by putting off the sentencing for four years, actually four years and two months or so, several things can happen. Number one, Trump can't appeal. So a conviction, jury verdict of guilt for a crime that didn't exist, hangs over his head for four years, while he's president. Exactly what Bragg wants, and I suspect it maybe it'll be what Merchan wants as well.\"\n\nA Manhattan jury of seven men and five women convicted Trump on 34 felony counts of falsification of business records May 30 in the case, which centered around a $130,000 payout to porn star Stormy Daniels as part of a confidentiality agreement. Dershowitz said Trump's attorneys could prevent the delay.\n\n\"Here's what I recommend the Trump lawyers do, and I will certainly be in touch with the Trump lawyers and tell them to do it and I'll even help outline how to write the brief if they want my assistance on that: Bring a writ of mandamus,\" Dershowitz said. \"A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary application to the appellate courts to do something that the district court should have done, but refused to do so.\"\n\nMerchan was scheduled to sentence Trump on Nov. 26, but he paused all deadlines Nov. 12.\n\n\"So you bring a mandamus to the appellate division, saying: Look, we have a constitutional right to appeal. Judge Merchan, if he does this, is violating our constitutional right to appeal. This is a deliberate ploy, deliberate effort to try to prevent us from appealing because they know we're gonna win this appeal,\" Dershowitz said. \"So we don't care whether you delay the sentence or not. That's not particularly the point. The point is: Let us appeal. Let us appeal now, with or without a sentence. Let us appeal, and I suspect the court would do one of two things: It would either let them appeal, which would be extraordinary. I've never heard of a case like that, but I've never heard of a case like this. It would either let them appeal, or it would demand, send it back to the district court judge and, say, sentence him within 30 days.\"\n\n\"One way or the other, sentence within 30 days, one or the other, the courts will not allow a four-year freeze designed to circumvent the right to an appeal,\" Dershowitz added.\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screenshot/Rumble/The Dershow)\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Leo Terrell Blasts Penny Trial Judge For 'Going Along' With Bragg's Plan For 'Gaming The System'\n\nCivil rights attorney Leo Terrell criticized Judge Maxwell Wiley Monday for allegedly \"going along\" with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's plan of \"gaming the system\" in the case against former Marine Daniel Penny.\n\nA Manhattan jury acquitted Penny on the criminally negligent homicide charge in the death of 30-year-old homeless man Jordan Neely, who the defendant held in a chokehold to protect surrounding passengers on a New York City subway train in May 2023. Terrell accused Wiley of going along with Bragg's attempt of \"gaming the system\" by suddenly dismissing a portion of the case when the jury was in a deadlock.\n\n\"Let me be very clear, Alvin Bragg was gaming the system,\" Terrell said. \"Look, when you file charges, you start off the case with the charges, you don't all of a sudden dismiss part of the case if you have a hung jury or a mistrial. You don't dismiss a part of the case and say 'well judge, let's go after this portion of the case.' He was gaming the system. Why, John [Roberts]? Because he was desperate for a win. He lost. He lost his case and he did everything. I'm embarrassed for the judge who went along with this scheme. The jury spoke unanimously not guilty on the negligence charge, which is the lower standard.\"\n\nWiley instructed the jury to reach an agreement on the second-degree manslaughter charge before considering the charge of criminally negligent homicide. The jury told the judge they were deadlocked on the manslaughter charge Friday, eventually prompting Wiley to dismiss the first charge at the prosecution's behest.\n\nBragg charged Penny with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide after a medical examiner ruled Neely's death a homicide in May 2023. The manslaughter charge carried a sentence of up to 15 years in prison, while the negligent homicide charge held a maximum of four years imprisonment.\n\nDr. Satish Chundru, a forensic pathologist hired by Daniel Penny's attorneys, said during the trial that Neely died from the \"combined effects of sickle cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint and the synthetic marijuana\" in his system, according to NBC News.\n\nTerrell said \"race hustlers\" attempted to \"intimidate the jury\" into convicting Penny for alleged racial purposes.\n\n\"And the point is very clear, you had people out here which I think has to be addressed,\" Terrell continued. \"You had race hustlers out there trying to intimidate the jury. People out there always playing the race card for 10 years, they'll play the race card again. This case wasn't about race, it was about a Marine veteran who was trying to protect people in the subway, who was terrorized and the jury saw it.\"\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy said during a Monday Fox News segment that the jury reached a \"deadlock\" likely due to many jurors buying into Bragg's alleged \"racialized\" narrative of the incident.\n\nProtesters in support of Neely gathered outside of the courthouse to call for retaliation in response to Penny's acquittal.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "'Ugly Illicit Schemes': Gregg Jarrett Says Those Who Targeted Trump Illegally Must Face Justice In Court And Publicly\n\nFox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett said Friday evening that those who targeted President Donald Trump by attempting to push criminal charges against him through the Biden-Harris Department of Justice (DOJ) should face justice in court and publicly.\n\nIn a speech at his second administration's new DOJ, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump called out former President Joe Biden and former Attorney General Merrick Garland on Friday for attempting to turn the department into an agency of \"injustice,\" accusing them of using \"the law to terrorize the innocent and reward the wicked.\" On \"Hannity,\" Fox News host Sean Hannity asked Jarrett if he believed it would be \"the right thing to do\" for Congress and the DOJ to investigate people who abused power \"for political purposes to take down\" the president.\n\n\"Oh, it absolutely would. We're just now inevitably learning about the ugly illicit schemes that were used to target Donald Trump by the Department of Justice and the FBI. You know, part of the things we've learned over the last several days is that Biden's aides in the White House were handing over Trump and Mike Pence's cell phones,\" Jarrett said.\n\nAccording to Fox Digital , in May 2022, the Biden White House had turned over both Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence's government cell phones to the FBI as part of a bureau probe after the 2020 election. While the agency did not need a warrant to physically obtain the phones, agents had allegedly begun drafting a search warrant to extract the data, according to the outlet.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"We already know that Biden leaked purposely to the media his demand that Merrick Garland prosecute his political opponent, Donald Trump,\" Jarrett said. \"So, you know, those people who broke the law, who violated standards, who were weaponizing their power and position for political purposes and vendetta should not only be held accountable publicly, but in a court of law if they broke law.\"\n\nDuring 2023, Trump was charged by Biden's DOJ with over 80 felony charges across four criminal investigations, being found guilty on 34 of the felony counts by May 2024 due to Democratic District Attorney Alvin Bragg bringing a case against the president on charges of falsifying business records. Since Trump's first administration, however, he has called out the DOJ and FBI for being corrupt. This, following the FBI's investigation into his 2016 campaign after it was accused of colluding with Russia. The agency found no evidence of collusion.\n\nAmong the indictments charged against Trump, Garland had tapped former special prosecutor Jack Smith to lead the investigation efforts against the president, alleging the president had not only attempted to overturn the election but had also allegedly held classified materials at Mar-a-Lago after his first term in office. Smith racked upwards of $50 million in taxpayer money for his two prosecutions against Trump. Calls for investigations against Smith have already begun, with some questioning the former special prosecutor's motives to push the cases despite later dropping them after Trump won the election in November.\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screenshot/Fox News/\"Hannity\")\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Elias responded by announcing on LinkedIn that his firm, Elias Law Group, is hiring and \"will never bow down to Trump or stay silent when he attacks the legal system.\"\n\nElias also chairs Democracy Forward, which is behind many current challenges to Trump's executive actions, including a case filed Monday against his order eliminating the Department of Education.\n\nDemocracy Forward CEO Skye Perryman wrote in a statement Saturday that the \"ongoing threats to the legal profession and the rule of law by the President are intended to intimidate and inspire fear, but instead they should inspire action.\"\n\n\"President Trump is delivering on his promise to ensure the judicial system is no longer weaponized against the American people,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement to the New York Times on Saturday. \"President Trump's only retribution is success and historic achievements for the American people.\"\n\nTrump previously issued three other executive orders directly targeting Democrat-aligned law firms, including those that supported his prosecution during the campaign.\n\nPerkins Coie, a firm that represented Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, sued after Trump issued an order stripping security clearances and access to government buildings for the firm's employees. The Trump administration argued in a motion filed Friday that District Court Judge Beryl Howell, who blocked part of the order, should be removed from the case because she has \"demonstrated partiality against and animus towards the President.\"\n\nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison came to an agreement with the White House in exchange for withdrawing an order against the firm. Under the agreement , the firm will provide $40 million in pro bono legal services to the administration.\n\nA former partner of the firm, Mark Pomerantz , worked with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office to investigate Trump and later spoke about the prosecution in the media.\n\nBrad Karp, chairman of Paul, Weiss, explained in an email to colleagues on Sunday that the order \"could easily have destroyed our firm,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\nIn February, Trump also signed an order stripping security clearances from members of a law firm that represented former special counsel Jack Smith, Covington & Burling LLP.\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screenshot/Fox News/\"Hannity\")\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

First, he indicted Donald Trump in a partisan case, and then he indicted Daniel Penny for saving the lives of other subway passengers from a deranged lunatic threatening to kill everyone,\" Cruz (R-Texas) stated.\n\n\"Penny should sue Bragg for malicious prosecution and hold this rogue Soros prosecutor accountable,\" Cruz continued.\n\nThe Texas senator's comments follow Penny's acquittal on Monday, in which he was initially charged with criminally negligent homicide for putting Jordan Neely, a homeless Black man with schizophrenia who was high on synthetic marijuana at the time and threatening the lives of passengers on a subway car, in a chokehold in May 2023.\n\nJUST IN: Police bodycam footage shows witnesses *defending* Daniel Penny for protecting them from Jordan Neely who they say was drugged out. \"The guy in the tan (Penny) did take him down really respectfully... he didn't choke him.\" Penny was charged with m*nslaughter &... pic.twitter.com/OrYvgTz412\n\n30-year-old Neely had previously been arrested 42 times prior to the encounter with Penny for theft, evading fares, and assaulting women, among other crimes.\n\nPenny, a Marine Veteran, was taken into custody after the incident. He pleaded not guilty to the charges after being indicted by a grand jury.\n\n\"The jury carefully deliberated for four days. They requested readbacks of testimony and asked for video footage to re-watch, as well as written definitions of the law,\" the Manhattan District Attorney's office stated following the verdict. \"The jury has now spoken. At the Manhattan D.A.'s Office we deeply respect the jury process and we respect their verdict.\"\n\nPenny recently spoke out on the incident, explaining that he \"didn't want any attention or praise, and I still don't.\" Penny also previously expressed that Neely was threatening the lives of women and children in the vicinity at the time and he truly believed that he was doing the right thing.\n\n\"The guilt I would've felt if someone did get hurt [by Neely], if he did do what he was threatening to do, I would never be able to live with myself.

These policies \"have clearly not worked,\" Penny noted.\n\n\"[Policies] that the people, the general population, are not in support of, yet their egos are too big just to admit that they're wrong,\" he added.\n\nStay informed!

      "text": "Judge Merchan Rejects Request To Toss Alvin Bragg Charges On Presidential Immunity Basis\n\nOAN Staff Abril Elfi 5:52 PM - Monday, December 16, 2024\n\nJudge Juan Merchan has rejected President-elect Donald Trump's attorney's request to dismiss charges brought against him by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg on the basis of presidential immunity.\n\nThe trial evidence, according to Merchan on Monday, was \"entirely to unofficial conduct and thus, receive no immunity protections.\"\n\n\"Further, even if this Court were to deem all of the contested evidence, both preserved and unpreserved, as official conduct falling within the outer perimeter of Defendant's Presidential authority, it would still find that the People's use of these acts as evidence of the decidedly personal acts of falsifying business records poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the Executive Branch, a conclusion amply supported by non-motive-related evidence,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nThe decision followed in July when President-elect Trump and his staff asked Merchan to reverse the guilty conviction in New York v. Trump, citing the U.S. Supreme Court's decision regarding how presidents are immune from prosecution for official actions.\n\nThe judge also said that \"if error occurred regarding the introduction of the challenged evidence, such error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt.\"\n\nHe rejected the request, but has yet to rule on Trump's formal motion to dismiss the case altogether.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump spokesman and incoming White House communications director Steven Cheung told Fox News that the decision is a violation of the U.S.  Supreme Court's decision on immunity.\n\n\"Today's decision by deeply conflicted, acting Justice Merchan in the Manhattan DA Witch Hunt is a direct violation of the Supreme Court's decision on immunity, and other longstanding jurisprudence,\" Cheung said. \"This lawless case should have never been brought, and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed, as President Trump must be allowed to continue the Presidential Transition process, and execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this, or any other, Witch Hunt.\"\n\n\"The sooner these hoaxes end, the sooner our country can unite behind President Trump for the betterment of all Americans,\" he added.\n\nAs part of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office's years-long investigation into the president-elect, Trump entered a not guilty plea to 34 charges of first-degree falsification of business documents. Bragg brought charges against Trump, and the inquiry was initiated by former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance.\n\nAfter an unprecedented six-week trial in New York City, a liberal New York jury found the former president guilty on all counts. However, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a former president has substantial immunity for official acts carried out while in office.\n\nIn a formal motion filed in July, Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, cited the Supreme Court's immunity decision and argued that certain evidence related to \"official acts\" should not have been admitted during the trial.\n\nBlanche specifically contested the inclusion of testimony from former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks and former Special Assistant to the President Madeleine Westerhout. He also challenged evidence regarding the Special Counsel's Office, Congressional investigations, the pardon power, Trump's responses to FEC inquiries, his \"presidential Twitter posts,\" and other related testimony, claiming they were impermissibly admitted during the proceedings.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump attorneys officially requested to \"immediately\" dismiss charges against the president-elect in New York v. Trump, declaring the \"failed lawfare\" case \"should never have been brought.\"\n\n\"The case would never have been brought were it not for President Trump's political views, the transformative national movement established under his leadership, and the political threat that he poses to entrenched, corrupt politicians in Washington, D.C. and beyond,\" Trump attorneys said. \"Wrongly continuing proceedings in this failed lawfare case disrupts President Trump's transition efforts and his preparations to wield the full Article II executive power authorized by the Constitution pursuant to the overwhelming national mandate granted to him by the American people on November 5, 2024.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers pointed out that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel came to the conclusion that \"the categorical prohibition on the federal indictment of a sitting president...even if the case were held in abeyance...applies to this situation.\"\n\nLast month, Bragg asked Judge Juan Merchan to postpone the case until the end of Trump's second term.\n\nThey further stated that Bragg's \"ridiculous suggestion that they could simply resume proceedings after President Trump leaves Office, more than a decade after they commenced their investigation in 2018, is not an option.\"\n\nStay informed!

It also names NYPD Detective William Garcia with other arresting officers and detectives.\n\nOn July 1 st , 2022, Simon, a 35-year-old Black ex-convict, was stabbed at the Harlem bodega by Alba, a 61-year-old Dominican immigrant, after the clerk got into a verbal fight with Simon's girlfriend over the fact that she refused to pay for a bag of chips and was allegedly attempting to steal them, according to footage.\n\nSimon then forced his way behind the counter where Alba was and the ex-convict shoved him and allegedly threatened his life. This prompted a dispute that resulted in Simon's murder and the clerk's arrest when he contacted the police to report what happened.\n\nEven though Alba insisted that he acted in self-defense, Bragg accused the clerk of second-degree murder and demanded a hefty bond of $500,000. However, the court reduced it to $250,000.\n\nAlba was then sent to Rikers after being unable to pay the exorbitant bond amount, where he was subjected to \"inhumane and unconstitutional conditions,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nDemocrat Mayor Eric Adams and former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton were among those who criticized the typically soft-on-crime DA for imprisoning a working man who appeared to be defending himself and his store from a robbery after Bragg decided to charge Alba with murder.\n\nAlba was detained at Rikers Island for six days before being released when the prosecution reduced his bail to $50,000.\n\n\"My heart goes out to the employee who was in the store doing his job,\" Adams said.\n\n\"I am hoping that we take all of that into consideration, as this hard-working New Yorker was doing his job, and someone aggressively went behind the counter to attack him,\" he continued.\n\nFollowing the public outcry, Bragg ultimately dropped the charges on July 19 th , conceding that there was not enough evidence to show the employee \"was not justified in his use of deadly physical force,\" according to a motion from his office.\n\nAlong with Bragg, the complaint holds the city and Department of Corrections Commissioner Louis Molina \"responsible for the unconstitutional conditions of confinement and inadequate medical care at Rikers Island.\"\n\nPrior to launching the complaint, Alba and his attorneys attempted to reach an unfruitful pre-lawsuit settlement when they first declared their intention to sue in February, according to Rich Cardinale, an attorney representing the former Bodega employee.\n\nCardinale stated that Alba is requesting compensatory and punitive damages, the amount of which will be decided by a jury. The cost was not mentioned in the court documents.\n\nThe Manhattan DA is \"is treating people differently and he's hurting people,\" Cardinale told the press.\n\n\"We can't keep pitting ourselves against each other based on race,\" he continued.\n\nA DA's office representative in Manhattan declined to comment.\n\nStay informed!

However, he has not dropped the case and maintains that he doesn't plan to.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bragg stated in a letter to Judge Juan Merchan that Trump is not likely to be sentenced \"until after the end of [the] Defendant's upcoming presidential term.\" However, he did assert that the felony conviction should stand, in his opinion.\n\n\"No current law establishes that a president's temporary immunity from prosecution requires dismissal of a post-trial criminal proceeding that was initiated at a time when the defendant was not immune from criminal prosecution and that is based on official conduct for which the defendant is also not immune,\" the district attorney's office wrote.\n\nA New York court found Trump guilty of 34 felonies related to allegedly manipulating business records pertaining to a $130,000 payment made by his former attorney, Michael Cohen, to porn star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 election.

He illegally entered the US in 2023. pic.twitter.com/ukLsZVZF3V\n\nWhen the 38-year-old assistant district attorney came home to her 44th Street apartment at around two in the morning on Sunday, that's when he robbed her. She reportedly caught him in the middle of the obscene sexual act in the corridor of the building.\n\nSimosa, who is also known as Brandon Jesus Simoza Seijas, also allegedly stole the prosecutor's phone when she dropped it, running off with it. Sources noted that the phone was later located near the migrant shelter.\n\nSimosa, who now faces numerous charges, including grand larceny, sexually motivated robbery, and illegal possession of stolen property, was seen smiling as police dragged him away in handcuffs before his scheduled arraignment on Wednesday.\n\nSpecifically when and where Simosa had been residing in New York was not included in the officer's information. According to insiders, one of his residences was once on the list of the city's taxpayer-funded Queens migrant shelters, according to the New York Post .\n\nFederal law enforcement officials told the press that Simosa illegally entered the United States in October last year at Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\nFederal authorities also say that he was initially detained by U.S. border patrol officials, but was later released with a notice to appear before an immigration judge in New York City. However, a court ultimately threw out his removal procedures case in February for \"unknown\" reasons, according to the sources. Simosa was no longer being aggressively sought for deportation as a result of the ruling, which left him with no pending immigration applications.\n\nAlthough local officials wouldn't have notified U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the arrests due to the city's \"sanctuary\" status, Simosa amassed a substantial criminal record during his short time in the Big Apple, including six busts in the last ten months alone, according to police.\n\nPolice sources also noted that Simosa was arrested just last week and charged with grand larceny in connection with a theft that occurred at a CVS store in Times Square on April 23 rd . He was released soon after.\n\nAccording to authorities, he was also detained for a series of other robberies, violent assaults, and transit evasions that occurred in Queens and Manhattan between January and August.\n\nHis arrests for the Times Square CVS incident on November 11 th , grand larceny inside Macy's at the Queens Center Mall in Elmhurst on August 5 th , and robbery at a Flushing supermarket on June 13 th are among the at least three cases he still has pending, the police sources added.\n\nStay informed!

Mueller initiated an investigation to try and depict Trump as an agent of Russia, claiming that Russia colluded with the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nHowever, Special Counsel John Durham found that the FBI \"acted too hastily and relied on raw and unconfirmed intelligence when it opened the Trump-Russia investigation,\" AP News reported. Durham's investigation found no evidence of Russian interference.\n\nAndrew Weissman served as the chief prosecutor within Mueller's investigation, while Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer, represented the whistleblower during Trump's first impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"Hmmm, so where are my due process protections? You are familiar with Executive Order 12968, are you not? Still in effect!\" Zaid responded to the announcement, citing a 1995 presidential order that established policies and procedures for granting security clearances to government employees and contractors needing access to classified information.\n\nThe revocations will also affect individuals like New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. They have both been accused of engaging in a politically-motivated \"witch hunt\" against Trump in order to stop him from winning the most recent presidential election, among other goals - ultimately intending to bring him down.\n\nJames, the former public defender and municipal councilwoman, attacked Trump the night she was elected in 2018.\n\n\"He should know that we here in New York - and I, in particular - we are not scared of you [Trump],\" she warned. She also vowed to shine \"a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn,\" insinuating that none of his business dealings were legitimate - as reported by the BBC.\n\nTrump also recently revoked former President Joe Biden from his intelligence briefings, as Biden did the same to him back in 2021.\n\nAdditionally, on his first day in office, President Trump issued an executive order directing the revocation of security clearances of 51 former intelligence agents who signed a 2020 letter claiming that the Hunter Biden laptop story held \"all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\" This claim ended up being false and was later debunked, as the Russians were not involved whatsoever.\n\n\"In your letter, you claimed that the laptop story was 'Russia trying to influence how Americans vote.' I ask you to respond publicly to one simple question: if you knew then what you know now about the laptop, would you still have signed the October 19, 2020 letter?\" U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) questioned , in a letter to those former agents.\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesperson for James issued a statement following Trump's announcement of the revocation of her security clearance, responding: \"What security clearance? Anyway, this is just another attempt to distract from the real work the Attorney General is doing to defend the rights of New Yorkers and all Americans.\"\n\nStay informed!

      "text": "2024 Men Of The Year: The Trump Prosecutors\n\nYou can be your own worst enemy. It's a lesson the Trump prosecutors learned the hard way in 2024.\n\nAlvin Bragg, Jack Smith, and Fani Willis each went in for kill shots against Donald Trump in 2024. They had on their side dozens of spurious felony charges, juries stacked with frothing libs, and a media salivating at the prospect of claiming their long-awaited presidential scalp.\n\nDonny wouldn't be able to wiggle himself out of this one. Until he did.\n\nWillis was first up to bat, with 41 charges primed and ready to go against Trump all because he politely asked Georgia's secretary of state to look for some missing votes. Willis's charges included racketeering, which had the media very excited. Willis, after all, knows a thing or two about RICO. She threw the book at rapper Young Thug for the alleged crime of writing song lyrics and, after a two-year trial, scored a hefty sentence of time served. You go, girl!\n\nBut her case against Trump was over before it even started. First, an overeager Willis released Trump's mugshot to the public, granting the former president an iconic political image just in time for the start of the 2024 primaries and galvanizing voters behind the Don. Don't take our word for it, take rapper Chief Keef's:\n\n\"All da Blacks finna have my boy back,\" Mr. Keef said . And they did. Roughly 30 percent of Black men under 45 voted for Trump in 2024, doubling his performance in 2020.\n\nThe nail in Willis's coffin came in January when it was revealed that Willis was secretly banging Nathan Wade, her hand-selected special prosecutor who had no prior prosecutorial experience. He raked in $650,000 for his \"hard work\" with Willis on the case, earnings he used to secretly treat Willis to lavish vacations all around the world.\n\nThe law forced Wade to resign from the case in March, a big loss for Willis because, somehow, her lover had become the brains of their operation. Willis followed his fate just before Christmas when a Georgia Court of Appeals removed her from the proceedings . So. Much. Winning.\n\nUp next was Bragg, the progressive Manhattan prosecutor who ran on campaign promises to go after Trump and touted his record of lawsuits against the real estate tycoon. Bragg followed through on the threat, slapping Trump with 34 felony charges in April 2023.\n\nIt whet the appetite of the most ardent anti-Trumpers. Bragg charged that Trump manipulated his company business records related to a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to illegally corrupt the 2016 election. Never mind that the Federal Election Commission declined to punish Trump for the payments, nor that respected legal analysts found the case to be lacking. That didn't stop a New York jury from finding Trump guilty on all of Bragg's charges.\n\nBut it was Trump who won the court of public opinion.\n\n\"Trump is a real n-,\" rapper Kodak Black declared after his conviction. \"He's a soldier. It ain't how he snapped for a n-. It ain't even about that. Y'all get off Trump, man.\" Even Green Party presidential nominee Cornel West jumped on the Trump train after the Bragg verdict, calling the former president a \"bonafide gangster.\"\n\nAnd finally, there was Jack Smith. According to the media, democracy itself almost died on Jan. 6, 2021. Smith was to be their standard bearer, leading the crusade against Trump for his alleged crimes against our sacred norms.\n\nBut on Election Day, it was Republican voters who were more concerned about threats to democracy in the United States, exit polls found . Following Trump's victory, Smith announced he would retire, taking the walk of shame to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to dismiss his case against the incoming president. Great work, Jack, you played yourself.\n\nBragg, Smith, and Willis may very well be on their way to collecting unemployment checks. But they can do so with their heads held high as Washington Free Beacon Men of the Year.\n\nPublished under: Alvin Bragg , Fani Willis , Georgia , Jack Smith , Stormy Daniels\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Even the Liberal Media Aren't Buying Alvin Bragg's Bogus Trump Indictment\n\nWhat happened : Former president Donald Trump on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to 34 criminal charges brought by Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg (D.). Upon his return to Mar-a-Lago, Trump defiantly declared that the \"only crime\" he ever committed was to \"fearlessly defend our nation against those who seek to destroy it.\"\n\nAs expected, the mainstream media covered the occasion with a breathless obsession indicative of mental illness. Though hysterically excited about the idea of Trump being indicted, even liberal journalists were not very impressed by the actual substance of Bragg's case against the former president.\n\nWhy it matters : Mainstream journalists are, by and large, partisan hacks who believe it is their moral duty to defend American democracy by helping Democrats win elections. When a Republican is charged with a crime, they will often insist the case is strong and entirely justified from a legal standpoint. So the fact that journalists and other liberal pundits have expressed even a moderate degree of skepticism suggests Bragg's case is a heaping pile of garbage.\n\nWhat they're saying :\n\n• \"Legally weak.\" - Noah Feldman, Bloomberg\n\n• \"These are hard charges to get excited about.\" - Michelle Goldberg, New York Times\n\n• \"There are novel elements to this case that could complicate Bragg's legal pathway to a conviction while arming Trump and his allies with talking points about a supposedly overreaching prosecutor.\" - HuffPost\n\n• \"[Bragg is] plunging forward with a premise that has given pause to even some of Mr. Trump's toughest critics.\" - Charles Savage, New York Times\n\n• \"Dubious legal theory ... painfully anticlimactic ... It is unclear that the felony statute that Trump is accused of violating actually applies to him.\" - Ian Millhiser, Vox\n\n• \"You can't build a case on the testimony of [former Trump attorney Michael] Cohen and [porn star Stormy] Daniels.\" - Former media darling and convicted felon Michael Avenatti\n\nJust to be clear : Mainstream journalists are still partisan hacks, and they also published a bunch of ridiculous takes on Trump's indictment, perhaps none more absurd than this New York Times report, headlined \"Trump Will Be Arraigned Today. Clinton Will Be Honored.\"\n\nTurns out that Hillary Clinton, the failed candidate who lost to Trump in 2016, was the guest of honor at some private club's black-tie dinner in Manhattan on Tuesday. She was being recognized for her \"great contributions\" and \"accomplishments in society.\"\n\nBottom line : It's almost as if the substance of the indictment doesn't matter. Journalists and other Democrats are emotionally and financially invested in making sure Trump wins the Republican nomination in 2024, so they will do whatever it takes to keep him in the news and boost their ratings by giving him billions of dollars worth of free coverage.\n\nPublished under: 2024 Election , Alvin Bragg , Donald Trump , Hillary Clinton , Journalists , Media , Media Bias\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

Chairman Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) wrote in the letter accompanying the subpoena that \"Congress has a specific and manifestly important interest in preventing politically motivated prosecutions of current and former Presidents.\"\n\n\"Based on your unique role as a special assistant district attorney leading the investigation into President Trump's finances, you are uniquely situated to provide information that is relevant and necessary to inform the Committee's oversight and potential legislative reforms,\" Jordan said in the letter.\n\nThe subpoena intensifies House Republicans' vows to investigate Bragg. It's the first concrete step in seeking answers on the investigation, which Republicans are calling politically motivated.\n\nBragg on Thursday called the House investigation an \"unprecedented campaign of harassment and intimidation,\" adding that Republicans are trying to \"weaken\" local and state law enforcement. He said Congress shouldn't be \"intruding\" on New York's \"sovereignty.\"\n\nPomerantz left the office shortly after Bragg took the reigns, citing Bragg's decision to \"indefinitely suspend\" the investigation into Trump, whom Pomerantz felt was guilty.\n\n\"I believe that Donald Trump is guilty of numerous felony violations,\" Pomerantz wrote last year in his resignation letter. \"The team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes-he did.\"\n\nHe added that he was quitting because ignoring the Trump investigation was a \"grave failure of justice.\"\n\nJordan pointed to Pomerantz's pressure as a reason Bragg went forward with the investigation, and eventual arrest, of Trump.\n\nTrump was arraigned in a New York City courthouse on Tuesday, where he was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records surrounding hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nRepublicans and some in the media are criticizing Bragg for the charges, which Vox called \"painfully anticlimactic.\"\n\nPublished under: Alvin Bragg , Donald Trump\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

New York City police-called in by Columbia president Minouche Shafik after a week of protests- arrested more than 100 participants who broke into Hamilton Hall on April 30.\n\nCuomo accused Bragg of using masks as an \"excuse\" to not prosecute properly, noting that the Justice Department had no trouble prosecuting the Jan. 6 rioters who wore masks.\n\n\"By letting the cases lapse,\" the former governor said, \"Bragg's office has sent the message at this time of increased anti-Semitic activity that those looking to instill fear in Jews by creating chaos and destruction can do so with reckless abandon.\"\n\n\"[Bragg's office has] given the impression that certain crimes are not worthy of prosecuting and that certain groups are not worthy of protecting,\" Cuomo continued. \"As a serious secondary consequence, Bragg's decision is likely to further dishearten the majority of New Yorkers who believe that the criminal justice system has been politicized.\"\n\nPublished under: Alvin Bragg , Andrew Cuomo , Columbia University , New York City\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

Bragg proposed \"non-dismissal options\" such as halting the sentencing until Trump's departure from office in 2029.\n\n\"The People deeply respect the Office of the President, are mindful of the demands and obligations of the presidency, and acknowledge that Defendant's inauguration will raise unprecedented legal questions,\" the filing reads. \"We also deeply respect the fundamental role of the jury in our constitutional system.\"\n\n\"This is a total and definitive victory for President Trump and the American People who elected him in a landslide. The Manhattan DA has conceded that this Witch Hunt cannot continue,\" said Steven Cheung, Trump's incoming White House communications director.\n\nBragg's proposal, pending the court's approval, comes as Judge Juan Merchan is expected to make a decision later Tuesday on whether Trump's charges should be dropped entirely. The judge agreed last week to delay the decision until Tuesday, giving the prosecutors more time to assess the \"unprecedented circumstances.\"\n\nTrump was convicted in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

      "text": "FACT CHECK: George Soros Insists He Didn't Contribute to DA Who Charged Trump\n\nClaim: Liberal billionaire George Soros \"did not contribute\" to Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg's political campaign.\n\nWho said it: Members of the media , Soros himself .\n\nWhy it matters: Soros's potential links to Bragg have become a hot-button issue after the prosecutor charged former president Donald Trump over alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. Republicans say that Soros, who funds numerous anti-Trump causes, helped Bragg get into office. Democrats have in turn accused Republicans of pushing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories that Soros, who is Jewish, is pulling the strings of the Trump investigation.\n\nContext: Soros is by far the largest donor to Color of Change PAC, a left-wing group that was Bragg's biggest campaign contributor. Color of Change in May 2021 pledged to spend $1 million to support Bragg's campaign. Days after the endorsement, Soros contributed $1 million to Color of Change PAC. That was by far the largest individual donation to Color of Change that year. The next largest contribution was $50,000, according to campaign finance records .\n\nSoros has given $1,450,000 in all directly to Color of Change PAC and millions more through other committees he funds. Democracy PAC, which is funded almost entirely by Soros, gave $2.5 million to Color of Change PAC in 2020, records show .\n\nA progressive group called Win Justice contributed $2,025,133 to Color of Change PAC in 2020. Soros is by far that group's biggest backer. He gave $5 million of his own money to Win Justice in 2018 and another $5 million through Democracy PAC in 2020.\n\nColor of Change, which has long called for Trump's prosecution, praised the Trump indictment on Thursday.\n\n\"In this historic moment, Color Of Change applauds New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who refused to let corporate influence, racist right-wing attacks, and threats of violence interfere with holding the former president accountable. This is the kind of political courage we need from every district attorney in the country,\" said Color of Change president Rashad Robinson, who is perhaps best known for stoking actor Jussie Smollett's hate crime hoax.\n\nAnalysis: Soros says that he \"did not contribute\" to Bragg and has never met the prosecutor.\n\n\"I think some on the right would rather focus on far-fetched conspiracy theories than on the serious charges against the former president,\" he told Semafor.\n\nWhile Soros did not write a check directly to Bragg's campaign, his cash almost certainly flowed to the prosecutor's election war chest through the anti-police, anti-Trump Color of Change PAC. Regardless of whatever pressure Soros did or did not place on Bragg's investigation, both he and Color of Change are happy with the outcome, as indicated by their statements about Trump's indictment.\n\nPublished under: Alvin Bragg , Democratic Donors , Donald Trump , George Soros\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

No one is above the law.\"\n\nBragg appealed the ruling.

      "text": "Manhattan's Soros-Backed DA Won't Seek Life for Cop Killers, Terrorists\n\nManhattan's newly installed, George Soros-backed district attorney this week ordered prosecutors not to seek life without parole sentences for murderers, terrorists, and cop killers.\n\nAlvin Bragg issued a memo on Jan. 3 that forbade staff from seeking life without parole sentences and broadly discouraged them from seeking sentences beyond 20 years. A $1 million contribution from Soros helped Bragg secure a narrow 4-point victory last June in the Democratic primary.\n\n\"My commitment to making incarceration a matter of last resort is immutable,\" Bragg's memo reads.\n\nBragg's election is the biggest victory yet for Soros and his Justice and Public Safety PAC, which has helped elect soft-on-crime candidates in Chicago, Philadelphia, and suburban Washington, D.C. Manhattan is uniquely visible as the economic and media capital of the nation, meaning Bragg's new approach-and Soros's criminal justice philosophy-will attract attention nationally and around the world.\n\nCrimes that qualify for life without parole sentences in New York state penal law include first-degree murder, terrorism, criminal possession of chemical and biological weapons, assassination of police officers, and molesting and murdering a child.\n\nDefendants in those cases would likely serve prison terms in the range of 20 years or less, if Bragg's office pursues incarceration at all. Under the new policy, the maximum sentence Manhattan prosecutors are advised to seek in cases that can't be reviewed by a parole board is 20 years. There is a carveout for \"exceptional circumstances,\" which are not defined in the memo.\n\nThe memo leaves open the possibility that murderers or violent assailants otherwise eligible for life without parole could qualify for early release, provided the victim or a victim's loved one goes along.\n\n\"In exceptionally serious cases such as homicides where lengthy periods of incarceration are justified, ADAs shall consider the use of restorative justice as a mitigating factor in determining the length of the sentence, only when victims or their loved ones consent,\" the memo reads.\n\nThere are between 200 and 300 individuals serving life without parole sentences in New York as of this writing. Another 10,000 are serving life terms but are eligible for release in the future. Among them is David Berkowitz, the notorious \"Son of Sam\" serial killer who was sentenced to six life sentences for a string of shootings in New York City between 1976 and 1977. Another is Mark David Chapman, who murdered John Lennon in 1980 and is eligible for parole. He was prosecuted by Bragg's office.\n\nCritics like Bragg say such sentences are the functional equivalent of capital punishment, calling it \"death by incarceration.\"\n\nAbout half of states have banned life without parole sentences outright for juveniles, and a series of Supreme Court decisions have narrowed the range of minor defendants who qualify.\n\nThe Manhattan prosecutor's office is one for long tenures. Just three individuals, Democrats all, have served as district attorney in an official capacity since 1942.\n\nThe office is also politically salient because of its jurisdiction. Bragg's predecessor Cyrus Vance led a sweeping investigation into the Trump Organization's financial practices that reached the Supreme Court. Robert Morgenthau, Manhattan's DA from 1975 to 2010, was a legend in legal circles and mentor to numerous prominent lawyers, including Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nUpdate 11:03 a.m.: This piece has been updated to reflect the fact that the Justice and Public Safety PAC did not donate to San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin.\n\nPublished under: Crime , George Soros , New York City , Prison Reform\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "'Top Priority': House GOP Leadership Puts Alvin Bragg in Crosshairs\n\nORLANDO, Fla.-House Republican leadership says it will use \"every tool\" at its disposal to compel Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg to testify to Congress, calling his expected indictment of former president Donald Trump the epitome of political weaponization of power.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik (R., N.Y.), who chairs the Republican conference, said getting Bragg on the witness stand is the \"top priority\" for House Republicans on the Judiciary Committee's weaponization subcommittee.\n\n\"We need to have Alvin Bragg testify,\" Stefanik told the Washington Free Beacon in a wide-ranging interview Monday morning. \"This skyrockets as a top priority because it epitomizes at the highest level the political weaponization, literally against Joe Biden's leading opponent, and it's a form of meddling in the presidential elections.\"\n\nHouse Republicans, convening in Florida for their annual issues conference, are united in their response to a potential indictment of Trump, which the former president said he expects to come on Tuesday. Stefanik's comments came as three House committee chairmen, Reps. Bryan Steil (R., Wis.), Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), and James Comer (R., Ky.), sent a letter to Bragg Monday morning demanding all communications relating to the alleged decision to arrest Trump and called on him to testify.\n\nHouse majority leader Steve Scalise (La.) echoed those demands in an interview with the Free Beacon from the conference. Scalise said subpoenas are one of the various tools House Republicans are ready to use, citing other ongoing investigations such as the one into Hunter Biden's finances and the Department of Justice's monitoring of school board meetings.\n\n\"Sadly there have been so many agencies, both federal and local, behaving like this,\" Scalise said. \"You see people abusing their position of government power to go after political enemies.\"\n\nRepublicans point to Bragg's tenure as district attorney as evidence that his office's treatment of Trump is nakedly political. Since he took office in 2022, felony indictments have plummeted in New York City.\n\n\"You don't get more far-left radical than Alvin Bragg, who was funded by over a million dollars by George Soros,\" Stefanik said, a line repeated by several Republican lawmakers. \"He's one of the reasons why we have a crime crisis in New York.\"\n\nThere will likely be multiple avenues into the Bragg probe. Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said the House would probe whether any federal funds were used in Bragg's investigation of Trump. \"That's what I'm concerned about,\" McCarthy said at a Sunday press conference. \"That's why I have to investigate.\"\n\nWhile Stefanik said \"every tool\" was on the table to get information from Bragg, she said the decision on whether to issue subpoenas would be made by Jordan, who chairs both the judiciary and weaponization committees.\n\nA spokesman for Jordan reiterated to the Free Beacon that \"everything is on the table\" when it comes to Bragg. Jordan in his short tenure as head of the newly formed weaponization committee hasn't shied away from using subpoenas for other investigations.\n\nMcCarthy said, however, that Bragg's actions would not influence how Republicans conduct their own investigations, such as those of the Biden family.\n\n\"We don't play politics,\" McCarthy told the Free Beacon .\n\nPublished under: Alvin Bragg , Donald Trump , Elise Stefanik , Feature , House of Representatives , Jim Jordan , Kevin McCarthy , New York\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
