      "text": "Black Lives Matter in rural America: A nationwide uprising comes to life in a tiny, conservative and virtually all-white community in upstate New York\n\nDELHI, N.Y. - According to the New York Times' remarkable list of Black Lives Matter protests over the last two weeks, the largest outpouring of street activism since the Vietnam War has now spread to more than 2,000 cities and towns in every American state. Certainly the biggest and most newsworthy protests have occurred in large, diverse and often symbolic or significant cities: Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed, but also New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and every other metropolis of note. What was less expected, and perhaps even more striking, were the protests we've now seen in hundreds of second-tier cities and small towns clear across the country, including many places with overwhelmingly white populations.\n\nFew of those places were smaller or whiter than this village in west-central New York State, where I attended a BLM protest a week ago that was reported as the largest public demonstration seen in this community , this county or the surrounding region within living memory. More than 700 people, the vast majority of them white and most under age 40, lined Main Street for several blocks in both directions - maintaining appropriate social distancing, and wearing masks - outside the Tractor Supply store and the Speedway mini-mart and the Delaware National Bank and Dubben Brothers Hardware. They did call-and-response chants and held up the now-familiar array of signs protesting police violence or white silence, and honoring the equally familiar litany of black people's names: George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice, Mike Brown - as you know, we could go on.\n\nOfficers of the village police department looked on, clearly unaccustomed to dealing with a crowd of anywhere near this size (or, for that matter, dealing with anything above speed-trap violations and minor property crimes). The Delhi police chief posted a cheerful Facebook message in support of the protest, while making clear that whatever bad things involving cops may have happened elsewhere had nothing to do with him.\n\nI don't mean to suggest there was anything exceptional about this particular protest in this particular town. Quite the opposite, in fact. It was exceptional for me, of course, because I was there - and it was a striking experience for other denizens of this half-forgotten bucolic corner of the Northeast. What was exceptional was the fact that scenes like this were repeated in so many different kinds of places in America, signaling a generational, political, psychological and perhaps spiritual shift that not many people saw coming. No one with any humility or any sense of history can consider the last few weeks without concluding that things have changed more rapidly in this country than almost anyone expected - and that more change is now demanded.\n\nLast Saturday was a beautiful day on the cusp of summer in a region where summer is brief and beautiful days are precious. The mood in Delhi was more festive than somber. Most motorists passing through the center of the village were exuberant in support. I can say with a high degree of confidence that plenty of people in this area feel less than enthusiastic about the BLM cause, but those people were lying low last Saturday afternoon. If 700 people doesn't sound impressive compared to the enormous protests in many American cities, consider that Delhi is a village of around 3,000 people (part of a larger town that totals about 5,000) at the center of a remote rural county of densely forested mountains and family farms with a larger land area than the state of Rhode Island and roughly 45,000 full-time residents - a population largely unchanged since about 1890. In relative terms, it's as if a protest in New York City had drawn more than a million people.\n\nDelhi - which is pronounced DEL-high , by the way - is a college town and the seat of Delaware County, in the western Catskills, about 160 miles northwest of New York City. It's a charming community, but those facts make it sound somewhat more cosmopolitan than it is. I bring this up to reiterate the central point that these protests are happening clear across \"middle America,\" not just in bastions of liberal preciousness and \"political correctness.\" Delhi is much closer to being the former than the latter, and has more in common with predominantly white heartland communities from the Times list - Wenatchee, Washington; Naperville, Illinois; Morgantown, West Virginia - than with Brooklyn or Berkeley.\n\nThe college on a hilltop just outside the village, SUNY Delhi, is a third-tier state school focused on agriculture, business and \"culinary arts,\" not a hotbed of radical activism or critical theory. The student body certainly brings some diversity to town during the school year - but the students all went home three months ago, and nobody knows when they'll be back. There were undoubtedly some weekenders and part-timers from the city at that protest (including me), but this is a long way from Woodstock or the Hamptons, and urban refugees are a minor presence up here. If when I say \"Catskills\" you think \"Dirty Dancing,\" that's also misleading. Delhi is on the other side of the invisible boundary that for decades separated Jews from gentiles in upstate New York; there is exactly one synagogue in Delaware County, in a tiny village 30 miles east of here.\n\nThe elected county judge who hears cases every Monday in the historic Delhi courthouse (which was once painted by Norman Rockwell ), is a Republican, as are nearly all local elected officials. Donald Trump got 60% of the vote in this county in 2016, which was no surprise; the Republican nominee has carried Delaware County in 33 of the last 35 presidential elections, going back to 1880. (The exceptions were Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and Bill Clinton in 1996.) When I say that last Saturday's protesters were overwhelmingly white, I'm not trying to diss this community or undermine the legitimacy of the event. The Census Bureau reports that Delhi is 92% white and about 4% black - which makes it a veritable cauldron of diversity compared to the county as a whole, which is more than 96% white.\n\nDelaware County has been the focus of heated controversy in recent years over the display of the Confederate battle flag , beloved by so many rural white people in America for what look (at least to outsiders) like barely coded reasons. This is especially ironic given the Civil War monument in front of the Delhi courthouse - just visible toward the right of my mediocre photograph above this story - which commemorates the 144th New York regiment of the Union Army, recruited entirely from this county. The men of the 144th fought at Antietam and Gettysburg and Cold Harbor and the Battle of the Wilderness, and 218 of them never came home to this little green corner of America. Those 218 young white men did not die for a symbol of slavery and white supremacy and Lynyrd Skynyrd or whatever-the-fuck else it supposedly symbolizes; they did not die for what Ulysses S. Grant described as \"one of the worst\" causes in the history of warfare, \"and one for which there was the least excuse.\"\n\nMaybe, in the long arc of history that Martin Luther King Jr. famously spoke about, they did not die in vain. Protests in this county over the Confederate flag in previous years were pretty small and didn't seem to accomplish much, but I now wonder whether they may have moved the needle just a little in the direction of righteousness. What I witnessed in this insignificant village last Saturday came as a challenge to my deeply ingrained cynicism. To make the point once again, there is nothing special about this place or about last week's protest, except that if it happened here it is happening everywhere, and represents a genuine groundswell that cannot be contained, or even addressed, by the platitudes of conventional politics.\n\nI suspect we are seeing the arrival, and the arising, of a generation that has been raised amid a torrent of lies - and amid the immense moral corruption of America after 9/11 - and has started to see through them to the reality on the other side. We can mock them for being overly woke, or overly concerned with taxonomical or semantic disputes about identity, but when they point to all the lies they have been told, we should perhaps be shamed into silence. Those lies are about race and crime and the social role of the police, as is obvious in this moment - but I think they are also about a whole litany of other things, all of them interconnected: capitalism and democracy and terrorism and gender and the climate catastrophe and the nature of power and the tormented, hypocritical history of this country. It is extraordinary, and perhaps unprecedented, that those lies now feel like lies to young people in predominantly white communities in rural New York State, rural Indiana or rural Idaho just as much as they do to young people in Louisville or Oakland or the Bronx.\n\nThose of us from older generations, especially if we lived through Vietnam or Watergate or the Reagan years or the end of the Cold War, have a harder time believing that the lies are entirely lies. This is understandable, but to employ an overused metaphor, it casts us in the role of Charlie Brown, running up to kick that football one more time. The institutions are still robust enough, we tell each other, and it's foolish and destructive to talk about socialism or police abolition or a radical restructuring of society. After all, Nancy Pelosi or Robert Mueller or Joe Biden or Andrew Cuomo or Tony Fauci or name-your-#Resistance-heartthrob are still here, working to pull the nation back from the brink; a \"new normal\" can be established even after Trump and the pandemic and this massive, cross-racial generational uprising, and if it won't exactly be the old normal, it will still push the republic forward on a somewhat familiar track.\n\nI do not claim to know which of these views is more correct, although I certainly have my suspicions. I know that this collision will define the future of American politics far more profoundly than a presidential election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, which is about competing visions of the imaginary past and will settle absolutely nothing.\n\nAfter two hours of largely upbeat protest on a beautiful Saturday in Delhi, nearly everyone up and down Main Street \"took a knee\" in commemoration of George Floyd and other victims of police violence. Whether in tribute to my antiquated journalistic ethics or my middle-aged knees, I didn't do it. I retreated under a storefront awning and stood next to a young, bearded bicycle cop, who chewed gum and avoided eye contact with the protesters who politely urged him to join them. It felt like a momentary brotherhood of uncomfortable white men, trying to figure stuff out.\n\nThen everybody got up and there was a lot of hugging, in small, socially-distanced groups. The crowd slowly dispersed into the afternoon. The two women in Tractor Supply smocks, who had been standing outside the store smoking cigarettes and watching us, put their masks on and went back to work."

      "text": "'Gas em': New video reveals disturbing conversations among Pheonix cops at BLM protest\n\nPolice officers like those from the Phoenix Police Department are the very reason whole communities of color distrust cops and would sooner try to protect themselves than voluntarily call officers to their neighborhoods. Body camera footage ABC 15 obtained revealed barbaric recommendations from three police officers who didn't realize their body camera devices were recording. The officers called demonstrators protesting police violence at a Black Lives Matter rally on Oct. 17 \"dickheads\" and \"asshole kids,\" according to the news station.\n\nAnd when one of the cops questioned why responding officers didn't \"stomp on them right away,\" another said: \"Gas em. I don't give a s--t if we just gas them and let them run like crazy ... (inaudible) the s--t out of them, who gives a s--t?\"\n\nAt one point in the footage, officers complained about changes in police department practices and policies:\n\nMCAO VIDEO_OCT 17 PROTEST youtu.be\n\nThese officers represent the same department accused of awarding \"challenge coins\" for shooting a protester in the groin on Aug. 22, 2017. The coins allegedly contained the phrases: \"GOOD NIGHT LEFT NUT\" and \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN ONE NUT AT A TIME.\" Police Chief Jeri Williams and City Manager Ed Zuercher condemned the coins in a joint statement on Feb. 6. \"I not only expect more, but demand more from my officers,\" Williams said, adding the coin language is being investigated as hate speech. Zuercher said in the statement: \"We do not accept hate speech at the city of Phoenix. It is unacceptable and we must have an independent look at these disturbing allegations so we can take appropriate action.\"\n\nIt's hard to take the officials' stand against hate speech seriously considering the Phoenix Police Department together with the Maricopa County Attorney's Office tried to build a criminal case that 18 demonstrators supporting the Black Lives Matter movement should be prosecuted as a street gang. Although prosecutors eventually dismissed the charges, their initial prosecutorial efforts relied on Arizona statutes that loosely classify a street gang based on self-proclamation, witness statements, electronic correspondence, paraphernalia, tattoos, and colors of clothing, ABC 15 reported. Because demonstrators were accused of shouting \"all cops are bastards,\" prosecutors argued that was a self-proclamation and their choice of all-black attire met the clothing requirement, ABC 15 reported.\n\nAmy Kaper, a graduate student accused of being a gang member, told the news station the only other protester she knew was her boyfriend, with whom she attended the rally. \"It's scary,\" she said. \"It feels like totalitarianism. It feels like we're not allowed to speak out about our rights. And unless you're on the side [police are] on, they're going to arrest you and try to ruin your life.\"\n\nIn response to an ABC 15 request for comment, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office responded with this statement:\n\nThe district attorney's office later said in a statement on Twitter Friday that it is dismissing the case and \"re-evaluating the evidence ... MCAO remains committed to holding those who committed criminal acts in this event responsible,\" the office tweeted."

      "text": "Who Really Protests, and Why?\n\nThe racial-justice and pro-reopening protests of 2020 had significant overlap in attendees.\n\nIn 2020, two major protest movements defined our political landscape: the racial-justice protests after the murder of George Floyd and the anti-lockdown protests pushing against COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nAt the time, these movements were seen by many as near-polar opposites and were often defined by their extremes. For the police-brutality protests, images of Minneapolis on fire and demands for total police abolition seemed to define the movement. For the anti-lockdown protests, militiamen with firearms in and around state capitols were among the most striking visuals. And an association with fringe right-wing groups marred the public-health protests with a sense of extremism.\n\nBut research from economist Nick Papageorge complicates these findings. Along with his co-authors, Papageorge ran surveys in the summer of 2020 that captured demographic and ideological information about the people who participated in these movements. Much to Papageorge's surprise, his findings revealed significant overlap between the BLM and anti-lockdown protest movements. And-on some metrics-the paper reveals that the protesters were not out of touch with the majority of Americans. Rather, they were more representative of the country than even the 2020 electorate.\n\nIn this episode of Good on Paper , I speak with Papageorge, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who largely works at the intersection of public health and economics.\n\n\"There has been this notion of, Maybe it's just fun. Protesting is the new brunch was one of the things that came out,\" Papageorge said. \"And I think that was one part of the caricaturization, right? That there are these gun-toting vigilantes protesting. And then there were these privileged leftist extremists going to these BLM protests. And that just wasn't in line with what we were finding. The median protester was not an extremist.\"\n\nListen to the conversation here:\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\n[ Music ]\n\nJerusalem Demsas: This is Good on Paper , a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives.\n\nI'm your host, Jerusalem Demsas. I'm a staff writer here at The Atlantic, where much of my written work begins with seeing a new working paper come out and following it down a research rabbit hole.\n\nAn exciting, new finding is always great, but the most important work is figuring out how it sits in the context of the rest of our knowledge base. What is it adding? Where does it depart from consensus?\n\nAnd particularly when we're talking about new findings in economics-those often come from early versions of papers, before all the levels of review have been completed, so there's an extra, added level of scrutiny you have to have.\n\nThere's one such paper that's been stuck in my brain since I first saw it come into my inbox more than two years ago-one that upended much of my thinking around the protests in 2020.\n\nThe paper is called, \"Who Protests, What Do They Protest, and Why?\" and it focuses on the demographic and ideological characteristics of protesters in two major social movements: The BLM protests following the murder of George Floyd and the anti-lockdown protests that came in response to restrictive COVID-19 rules.\n\nThe paper finds that nearly 30 percent of protesters attended both a BLM and a lockdown protest, indicating significant overlap in the types of people attracted to both movements-and the research shows that these people are protestors, not counterprotesters. This finding really surprised me and made me question my priors about what kinds of people were attracted to these movements.\n\nNow, it's not possible to talk about protests without thinking about those that rocked college campuses this year. While this conversation doesn't touch on those protests, because we taped it in the spring, the research still has some lessons in it for those drawing large conclusions about who's protesting and why, and whether contemporaneous media reports can give us an accurate picture of chaotic events.\n\nThe stakes of misunderstanding the composition of protesters are high: Who we think is protesting drives how we respond to them. Who we think make up social movements affects whether our leaders react to them, and how. And, most importantly, for me, as a journalist, my own misunderstandings of what the 2020 protests were shaped my thinking about public-health restrictions and whether they had gone too far.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nI asked the lead author of that paper to come help me think through all of this. Nick Papageorge is an economist at Johns Hopkins University, where he mostly focuses on the intersection of public health and economics.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\nDemsas: All right. Nick, welcome to the show.\n\nNick Papageorge: Thank you. Thank you for having me.\n\nDemsas: So I want to take us back to spring of 2020. It was a really scary time. COVID-19 was in full swing. We were seeing caseloads rising. I remember just being terrified. I didn't really know what was the way to keep yourself or the people you cared about safe.\n\nI was lucky that I got to work from home the entire time. But at the same time, it was just like there was such different, changing informational environments. It just felt very chaotic. And the advice we were all getting was just stay away from other people, stay masked, and just limit contact as much as possible.\n\nAnd spring of 2020 is also when George Floyd is murdered. And in response, a nationwide movement erupted. Protests were happening in most American cities and even around the world. And all of a sudden, I have a vivid memory of seeing this open letter that's signed by over 1,200 people-public-health professionals, infectious-disease professionals-and it's a weird document from the time because you have them criticizing the \"heavily armed and predominantly white protesters\" for protesting stay-at-home orders, but then they say that, actually, the anti-racism protests were completely justifiable under public-health grounds.\n\nReading-quoting directly from it now-they say, \"Do not disband protests under the guise of maintaining public health for COVID-19 restrictions.\" And it just felt very weird to me. It felt very weird that you had public-health professionals who, ostensibly, were giving us advice about how to stay healthy now telling us that, Well, for certain things it was okay to break some of these guidelines . So what was your reaction to that letter?\n\nPapageorge: I think if I could start at a high level, one of the critiques coming from economists-and people have an idea of what economists do, and it has to do with banks and finance and interest rates. And it turns out that what we do is a lot closer to what maybe comes into your mind when you're thinking about what a sociologist does: We study people and behavior and factors that affect behavior, sources of inequality, and so on.\n\nAnd so one of the things that really frustrated economists was there seemed to be this implied hierarchy about what was important in these public-health debates. And, of course, we don't want people to die from a disease. At the same time, kids not going to school is really, really harmful. And I don't know where different people are going to land in that debate, because I could certainly see somebody saying, Look, preventing any death is just the most paramount thing . I could also hear somebody saying, We need kids to go to school. That's just the most important thing .\n\nI can't tell you which one of those two is the right one. What I don't think we did was recognize this really nasty trade-off-this really brutal trade-off-and have that conversation. And then there was this implied view about what's a worthy thing to do, and I guess it wasn't opening schools.\n\nDemsas: Like, what's worth risking COVID-19?\n\nPapageorge: Right, exactly. What's worth risking COVID-19? And we decided-or it was decided-that, Well, okay, but going to a BLM protest is okay . And I think that undermined some credibility of some of these decisions that were made on our behalf. And I think that maybe I agreed, in a way, with that trade-off. I decided to leave the house and join a big group to go to a BLM protest. But I could see why people might have thought, Hey, wait. You're telling me I can't take my kid to school but that I'm allowed to go to this protest? That doesn't seem right. Who decided that ?\n\nDemsas: I was rocked back to this. I remember vividly a couple years ago when-and I'm going to out myself as a weirdo for this, but-the National Bureau of Economic Research puts out this weekly rundown of studies, and I'll click through them. And I remember seeing your study in 2022, when it first came out, and seeing the findings that people who attended anti-public-health protests and people who attended BLM protests, that there was a lot of overlap over those people. Can you tell us about that? How did you find that? Like, what was the process of even doing that survey?\n\nPapageorge: It was a strange study for me. We were playing with data, and we found a pattern that didn't make sense. And so we had to come back and figure out: What's the question this is answering?\n\nDemsas: Yeah. Why were you doing the survey in the first place?\n\nPapageorge: The survey started pretty soon after the emergence of COVID-19. And Washington University got some outside funding to run a high-quality survey. I was asked to contribute some thoughts on what we might want to look at. That is because I've looked at infectious disease before in the economic context, in particular HIV, risky behavior, how it interacts with medication usage, and employment, and these kinds of things-these health-economic interactions.\n\nSo we started asking questions, and then the data set-we were going to go back for several rounds. And so by the time of the second round of questions, when they were asking whether we wanted to add more questions, the BLM protests had started. And so we thought, Well, we should probably collect data on whether or not people are attending them . And then-I don't know who in the group (it might have been me; I don't think it was)-somebody said, Well, there are these other protests going on for reopening . I don't want to quite call them anti-public health. I think that they were maybe pro-reopening. And so-\n\nDemsas: No, fair. That's probably a biased way of me talking about it.\n\nPapageorge: So there were these protests and, in my mind, there was still this caricature that these were, like, gun-toting vigilantes, and that we, Okay, sure, we should probably collect that data as well, because we're trying to be scientists here . And I thought, Why don't we see what's predicting protest attendance ? Obviously, you know, going to a BLM protest probably predicts not going to a reopening protest, just because that would make sense according to my bias, my priors.\n\nAnd we found the opposite. And then we checked it again, and we found the opposite again, and then we really started to kick the tires. But the result didn't go away, and so then we entered this period of thinking, Okay, maybe this is novel, and maybe we need to start to figure out why this might make sense . Economics, as a field, tries to be a little bit apolitical. I would say that one out of every five of my findings, I'm like, Oh man .\n\nDemsas: ( Laughs .) Didn't want to find that out .\n\nPapageorge: Didn't want to find that . But you shouldn't be able to tell my politics by reading my papers. But one thing I did think to myself was, I am getting frustrated by some of the public-health mandates that seem to me to be a little bit excessive .\n\nDemsas: More than just the closing schools or other stuff?\n\nPapageorge: Just the decisions that didn't make, to me, a whole lot of sense, like, Okay, we're gonna let some bars open, but we're gonna keep the schools closed .\n\nDemsas: Yeah, yeah.\n\nPapageorge: And I just was like, Okay, well, what are we waiting for here? What's the evidence, and where's the cost-benefit analysis here ?\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nPapageorge: Like, at what point-\n\nDemsas: And whose values are being followed?\n\nPapageorge: Whose values are being used in that cost-benefit [analysis], right?\n\nAnd so I was getting more and more concerned that, throughout this entire period, you could still get stuff off of Amazon. There's all these people that had to still work. And they don't have the kind of job that I have, where I can telework. And I started thinking about just the mental-health burden. I started thinking about my own kid, who, you know-he has two parents who still have jobs, but I know that he's missing out on socialization at this critical period. These costs are starting to build up. And so I was getting frustrated, and I remember my husband saying to me, If it's shut down again in Baltimore city, I'm going to go to join a reopening protest .\n\nDemsas: Wow.\n\nPapageorge: And it was kind of joking, I think, or maybe he wasn't. I think he was serious. And we'd gone to BLM protests, and I thought that we were just really isolated in having that mixture of views. And so when I looked at the data, I thought, Oh, maybe we weren't .\n\nDemsas: But it's really interesting to me that you were surprised by these findings, even though they represented your own views.\n\nPapageorge: That's totally true. But that's one of the things also, I think-and maybe I'm just conditioned to be like this with science, to really remove myself from my science. And so I don't necessarily assume that folks-I think that's one of the biggest dangers in sciences, especially in the social sciences, is thinking that your views are representative, that your opinions are shared by others. I think a lot of good social science comes when you step back and listen to other people and make sure you're not speaking for them, but maybe elevating their voices.\n\nDemsas: Well, let's dig in a little bit into some of the findings here on the numbers. So, 33 percent of BLM protesters identified as Republicans, and 36 percent of reopening protesters as Democrats. I mean, just generally stepping back, if I think about how these were characterized, we think about BLM protests as a left-wing movement and the reopening protest as a right-wing movement. So when you actually look at who is involved in these protests, what are you actually seeing? Who are these people? And where is the overlap?\n\nPapageorge: Right. So, if you go to a BLM protest, or if you report having gone to a BLM protest, they tended to be a little more Democratic. And then the reopening protests tended to be a little bit more Republican. But then there was this mixture, right? There were plenty of Republicans at BLM protests, and there were plenty of Democrats at these reopening protests, which again, I thought was a little bit strange.\n\nBut I do remember in the early days of the BLM protests, it wasn't the same movement that it is today, which I think it's become much more politicized. You know, you remember Mitt Romney was joining in these protests. There was this outrage from a lot of different places that was collective. The other thing that we found interesting is that people who protested tended to be working in person and have children, which you would think, These are things that are going to make me not want to protest . We also found that people and different measures of well-being were higher.\n\nDemsas: Like higher well-being meant you were more likely to go to a protest?\n\nPapageorge: Yes.\n\nDemsas: Yeah, okay.\n\nPapageorge: Which again, you wonder, Isn't it frustration and anger that drives you to protest? But then there is precedent in earlier research saying that people might go to protests and then feel good. Maybe they feel like they have some say, they have some agency here. Maybe it was cathartic to go to the protest. Or we could just be thinking that people who are energetic and feeling good about themselves are the kinds of people who will go to a protest, as well.\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nPapageorge: I think that if one reflects a little bit on it, it makes sense that folks who might've been really frustrated with the state of things were folks who were working and who were worried about losing their job. These are also parents who have lost their childcare arrangements, which was incredibly frustrating. But I can also imagine those same parents saying, I don't want my kid to grow up in a world where this kind of violence happens . And so that was another set of findings.\n\nOne thing that we found strange was that people who saw themselves at greater risk of COVID-19 were more likely to go to protests.\n\nDemsas: I found this super interesting. So first of all, you're just asking the question: How scared are you of dying, of getting sick ? Or how are you determining that?\n\nPapageorge: So you can do different things. One is kind of more objective, where you can just look at the county caseloads or county reports. And, if I remember correctly, we have a positive correlation with it, but a lot of that can just be, Hey, there were more protests available in places where there were higher rates , right? Maybe bigger cities or whatever.\n\nYou can also ask people about their beliefs. Now, doing that is always wacky, so we got sort of wacky answers there.\n\nDemsas: You got high numbers, right? Like, 30 percent chance of death?\n\nPapageorge: Exactly. But in our defense, anybody who looks to get beliefs data, it's really tricky to do that. And people answer in a very wacky way.\n\nDemsas: But also if you asked me in June 2020, what I thought the risk of death from COVID was-I remember my dad, who always, every year around June gets really bad allergies. My dad has really bad ones. I remember him calling me like, Hey, I feel kind of sick . And I just freaked out. I went to his apartment, and I just dropped off-I'd just been on Twitter, looking up random virologists and being like, Are they using Motrin? Are they using Tylenol? Are they using -you know what I mean? So there's a level where I think I would have said, Oh my gosh, I'm acting like I think my father's going to die , you know? And so I don't know how I would have evaluated that.\n\nPapageorge: Yeah, I think that's right. There is a whole lot of research on how to collect these kinds of data. And if you want to do it well, you have to do it really carefully, kind of anchoring people. For example, people are really bad at small probabilities. So maybe something that's, like, 0.1-percent chance, they'll think it's 10. And to them, it's the same number.\n\nDemsas: It just means small. Yeah.\n\nPapageorge: But I mean, these are massively different numbers. I think if I remember, on average, people thought there was a 30-percent chance that they would get COVID-19, which maybe that's not so bad. But then they think if you get COVID-19, there's a 30 percent chance of dying. And you're thinking, Okay .\n\nDemsas: And that's if they go to the protest?\n\nPapageorge: No, no. This is just in general. So you're thinking, Okay, this is really high . But we did find that people who saw themselves at greater risk of COVID-19 were more likely to go to the protests, which that in itself doesn't surprise me, because that could just be a recognition that, you know, I do risky things . And so, that actually checks out.\n\nDemsas: So, you find that 28 percent of protesters attended both a reopening protest and a BLM protest. One hypothesis raised when I first read this paper was: Maybe there are just certain kinds of people who like to protest, or not like it as an activity but have a high propensity to just protest if it's something that's available in their area.\n\nAnd I was looking into the literature on this, and there's a study by a sociologist at the University of South Carolina at Aiken. Her name is Michelle Petrie, and she looks at the determinants of protest participation. And one thing she brings up is this concept called biographical availability , which is basically whether someone has the time, particularly unstructured time, where they feel like they're less at risk of being surveilled or facing consequences for engaging in protest.\n\nAnd she cites Doug McAdam, who has this paper about the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer Project, and he finds that then the people who participated largely came from affluent families, where they were in their early 20s. It's summer, so they didn't have jobs. They were unemployed, unlikely to be married.\n\nI mean, in your sense, is it what's going on here? It feels like there's two potential hypotheses-and maybe they're both true. One is that there's a large overlap on these ideologies between people who were concerned about anti-police brutality and people who were worried about reopening and public-health restrictions. But it's also possible that a lot of people are just like, Maybe I'll just protest . You know what I mean? And so how do you tease that out?\n\nPapageorge: I think it's hard to tease out, is the first thing. And I think that there is this notion of biographical availability. Certain people are just going to be more likely to protest. And that's something that we spend a lot of time doing. That's why we look at these predictors. What are the factors that seem to predict protest attendance?\n\nAnd I think the story's a bit nuanced because, Okay, sure. Younger? That makes sense. That checks out. But having kids and also working in person? That does not . And then there was also and has been this notion of, you know, Maybe it's just fun . \"Protesting is the new brunch\" was one of the things that came out.\n\nAnd I think that was one part of the caricaturization, right? That there are these gun-toting vigilantes protesting. And then there were these privileged, leftist extremists going to these BLM protests. And that just wasn't in line with what we were finding. The median protester was not an extremist. The median protester was not somebody who had plenty of time on their hands or plenty of affluence, and so they don't even need to worry about working. People seem to be overcoming obstacles to get there. And so that's got to be at least part of the story.\n\nWe also were able to look at police shootings in the area where these folks were, and that seemed to be also predictive.\n\nDemsas: So if there were more police shootings, they're more likely-\n\nPapageorge: If there were more police shootings, you were more likely to go to BLM, exactly. And so that seems to suggest that this isn't just a leisure activity, but something that people are taking seriously.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nDemsas: Okay, we're going to take a quick break, but more with Nick when we get back.\n\n[ Break ]\n\nDemsas: This is something I find with economists a lot when I'm talking to them, that there's a lot of frustration that, in many ways, our official apparatuses don't take into account costs like fun-\n\nPapageorge: ( Laughs .)\n\nDemsas: Things that you like to do that make your life happy. The trade-off, of course: We wanted people to stop dying and, especially at the very beginning, when we had no information, it makes a lot of sense to shut down a lot of things.\n\nBut it's interesting to think back again to that letter we talked about at the beginning because, in many ways, that letter was actually the way you would want public-health officials to engage with trade-offs. Because they go into it, and they say, Yes, of course, there are concerns with catching COVID-19 in public spaces. But also, people have a legitimate concern about protesting and about anti-racism . Our goal, as public-health professionals, is to provide them the tools to do mitigation of that kind of damage . And it was like, Where is that trade-off thinking in any other space?\n\nPapageorge: Right. No, that's what I think was so-and to be fair to people in public health, and I work now with some epidemiologists, there is now this call, in general for, Okay, we need to figure out a way to think about these trade-offs more carefully .\n\nObviously, there are some folks who still think any one death is worth just infinity and therefore anything else is just secondary. Fine. That's what they think. I just don't. One reason: We know poverty is deadly, so you're not comparing apples to oranges.\n\nAnd so what it really comes down to is it's kind of, Whose life matters mor e ? And I think that's really hard when you're comparing, say, my somewhere-in-her-70s mom and a low-income kid in the city. And, you know, whose life matters? Well, both. But you're going to put a policy together that's going to probably harm one person less than the other. And I think it's really hard to think about that.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. And, to me, there were so many times during the pandemic where I felt the way that public-health professionals-the value system in place-was sort of what I later learned is called the precautionary principle . It is this idea-\"do no harm\" is the very simple way of doing it, of just saying, Okay, whatever you actually are going to do, make sure-99.999 percent sure, even 100 percent sure-that anything you do is not going to cause harm. And that means let's not approve tests if we're not 100 percent sure that they're going to be perfectly accurate or at a really high level of accuracy, even though the status quo is that we have no tests. People have no way of figuring out whether or not they might be infected .\n\nAnd I wonder, do you think that the finding that you're having in this paper, and also the research you've done in other spaces, is that pushing the public-health field to think differently? Or are you seeing any kind of changes at all in the public-health field in response to how many people felt that trade-offs weren't really adequately considered during 2020?\n\nPapageorge: So I absolutely think that this paper and other work I've done pushes against this idea that, in public-health contexts, health is the only thing to think about. I've made a whole career off of thinking about the way that health interacts with other factors that are important to us. We're not health maximizers. We might have been. I mean, you can imagine some creatures living in some other planet that the only thing they care about is their health.\n\nDemsas: They're living on Soylent.\n\nPapageorge: Longevity is the only thing you care about. I mean, just any decision we make on any given day shows that that's not true. We leave our house. We eat fried foods. We drink. We get into cars. We get on planes. We do all sorts of things that show that we are not health maximizers. We're lots-of-things maximizers. Health is one of them. We would rather be healthy than not healthy if it were for free. The thing is, it's not for free.\n\nAnd so I think that there has been some movement towards, How can we do this better and just recognize that there are these trade-offs? And I think the subtle point is to say that I don't really care where you come down on that trade-off or where I come down on the trade-off; I want to present that trade-off.\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nPapageorge: And then politics can kind of decide-\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nPapageorge: Where we go from there.\n\nDemsas: So, returning to politics then, because I think another part of your paper that really would be great to delve into is a finding that the protesters, on some axes, were more representative of the public than even the 2020 voting electorate. And it's not on all of them.\n\nSo you find on age and income, the protesters were younger-much younger-and then slightly more low-income than the voting population and the general public. But then on gender and race, the protesting population is more representative of the public than voters.\n\nSo, when you see this, why do you think those distinctions are happening? Why on gender and race is that happening versus age and income?\n\nPapageorge: I don't know why one versus the other, though I know that younger people might not be as trustful about traditional modes of expressing themselves.\n\nVoting: I think there's some disillusionment. We know that voting is on a certain day, and there are lots of requirements that are maybe easier to navigate if you have more income or more work flexibility, which oftentimes is going to correlate to higher income. I mean, if I leave for three hours from my job, no one's gonna really even ask me where I've gone, whereas that's just absolutely not the case with people who are working hourly.\n\nAnd so, if you then have these protests sprouting up, and the only thing you need to do-you don't have to bring your ID; you don't have to make sure you registered a few weeks ago or whatever-you just go.\n\nDemsas: But you outlined for us earlier that these were people who thought it was costly to protest. And, for them, you said it's more likely that they're working in person, and they're going. So I was surprised, right? Because, to me, it would indicate these are people who clearly feel like there is some value to protesting, whether it's just expressive, whether it's communal, whether it's actually trying to enact change, or some combination of those three. They were willing to overcome things that were, to themselves, costly. But then with voting, you don't see that happening.\n\nPapageorge: Right. And I think a lot of that is just because you have one day. Suppose I work four or five days a week at a restaurant, and the hours are a little bit wacky, and Tuesday's the day you got to work. And that's that, whereas-\n\nDemsas: The protests were kind of going on.\n\nPapageorge: The protests were going on. And so there's going to be a day when you can make it. And I think that this is probably a lesson that we should be thinking a little bit about, which is: Why do people like to mail-in vote? Because it means you don't have to do it on a certain day at a certain time. In general, what we were trying to show is these weren't, like, weirdos who just are entirely unrepresentative. These were really typical Americans. And I think that what we wanted to take away from that was that we don't get to ignore them by caricaturizing them.\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nPapageorge: And I think that was something that some corners of the media did, and I think that was very unfortunate because it cheapened the message. It cheapened the will, the agency that people have.\n\nDemsas: I think this is actually the place where the stakes of this misunderstanding and caricature are really, really high. Because the BLM protests-I thought they were cross-racial. I saw a lot of white people participating in them, a lot of Black people, a lot of people from different backgrounds. I thought they were mostly young. But I saw a lot of men. I saw a lot of women. And I thought it was largely representative.\n\nBut I still had, you know, the image in my head of the Minneapolis police precinct on fire, or people talking about Seattle, where there was that kind of really radical zone of people. And then with the public-health protests, I thought it was even more biased. I think I saw, you know, militia members in state houses and assumed that's what's going on there.\n\nAnd the stakes of that are really bad because if you realize that these groups of people are actually representative and not just not your average person, then that changes how we talk about it as the media. It changes how politicians respond to it.\n\nAnd it's interesting. I mean, I haven't really worked through this myself, so maybe we can do it here. But in some ways-I mean, there's now a new paper by Amory Gethin and Vincent Pons. Their paper-it's an NBER working paper-that indicates that BLM protests in 2020 did actually really affect public opinion and made people more likely to oppose police brutality, become more quote-unquote liberal on racial-justice issues.\n\nBut they're finding that also BLM is one of the only protests in their sample that actually has a sustained effect. And I imagine it's because the other ones were not as widespread. And so, in that case, people did affect change despite these caricatures.\n\nAnd with reopening, I feel like it's harder to tell because obviously we reopened, but was it because of the protesters? How do you think about it? Because in some cases you can be pessimistic and say, These characters that exist really prevented these groups from getting what they wanted done . But there's some evidence that shows that despite the way that they were covered and maybe popularly understood, people still really were able to get certain policy things enacted.\n\nPapageorge: Yeah, I think both things can be true at the same time. I think BLM certainly did have an effect. It did morph a little bit into a different movement, and I think the idea of, like, defunding the police became much more prevalent. And I don't think that's where the original protests might have been, but I think that the original coalition of people-this very ideologically diverse set of people-would maybe say, Yeah, well, some things have happened. It's much more on the radar . The idea of police reform, I think, is much more reasonable to hear about in different corners, and when before, maybe that would've been a little bit more of an extreme view.\n\nIn terms of public health, I think it's really hard, like you said, to understand what were the effects of those protests. Because vaccines were coming around, and that was probably what was going to happen. This technology was going to just change. But at the same time, when I started getting into this idea of behavior and it being a really important part of epidemiological models-you know, when you're trying to follow a pathogen, you need to understand the interaction with human beings-that was controversial to people in those spaces. It was controversial to certain experts to say, Look, you don't necessarily need to shut down everything, because people are going to protect themselves . And I think these-\n\nDemsas: Yeah, wasn't there some data that people, before orders actually were in place, were already staying at home?\n\nPapageorge: Absolutely. Absolutely. And so the idea is, okay, How do you take account of that when you're deciding what you're going to close? So I think, in a way, that some of these-I don't know if it was the protests per se-but I would say that we've absolutely seen a change in some of the views that people hold. Not everybody, but I think that folks have said, Wow, we really didn't think about that trade-off. We didn't do behavior well. We didn't figure that out .\n\nDemsas: Well, how generalizable do you think your findings that you have about the BLM protests or the reopening protests are to protests writ large, right? Is it the case that like, you know, you're in June 2020, COVID-19 health precautions have sort of ensured that, in many ways, there's a large number of people who are doing self-limiting behaviors such that they're able to participate in protests? Or maybe the costs were just so high, at the time, to not engaging in protests that people were willing to do it.\n\nBut I feel like there's a lot of protests out there that are not like this. I feel like they are a really small group, and maybe no one's just done your analysis yet to figure out that they're very representative people, but I don't know. Sometimes I just see things, I'm like, That just seems like 20 people who are on this issue . Like, That does not feel like a regular thing . So, how do you think about why these ones felt this way versus what most protests look like?\n\nPapageorge: I think that if I'm a good scientist, I'm going to say, I don't know how generalizable this is, because that was a very unique moment in our history, where you have these movements occurring and data collected at just the right time.\n\nAnd so, in one sense, I would say it's not generalizable at all, but then you start to look. And I started to question this kind of received wisdom that we're just hopelessly at odds with one another, that there are these, like, extremists, and there's this polarization happening, and it's just relentlessly growing. And I started to think, Maybe that's not true , right? I mean, it sounds like it if you turn on the TV. But I started to question it. And I started to wonder, How much of this is manufactured polarization? How much of this is just not really necessarily there?\n\nAnd I think abortion is one of these issues, right, where the median American wants abortion rights with some restrictions. And I am very pro-choice in my views. I, for a long time, thought if anybody's not 100 percent pro-choice, then they're the enemy. And I, after all of this, started to think, Was that the right stance? If somebody said to me, Abortion's complicated for me. I think I'm a little pro-life. I understand that there should be different circum - whatever, whatever . Maybe I shouldn't have seen that as the enemy, but maybe I should have been thinking, Is there common ground?\n\nI think that there are certain areas in my life where I don't have a lot of room to budge. Like, if somebody says to me, Two gay men shouldn't have a kid , I'm like, There's nothing for me to say here, because it's my kid . And there's no room for me to be like, Oh, I guess it's okay if you take him away just a little bit .\n\nDemsas: ( Laughs .)\n\nPapageorge: I mean, that's just-we're done. But I think that on a lot of other issues, there's a lot more room to just recognize that we can do something together. And I wasn't ready for that before, and now I think I am.\n\nDemsas: Well, that feels like a great place to close out. Our last question is always the same: What is an idea that you thought was good on paper, but when it came to real life, maybe it didn't pan out the way you thought?\n\nPapageorge: Okay. I was trying to think of one that would be appropriate to say. ( Laughs .)\n\nDemsas: ( Laughs .) We've gotten a couple weird ones already.\n\nPapageorge: I don't want to lose my job or something.\n\nDemsas: No, yeah.\n\nPapageorge: No. I'm just kidding. So I was just thinking about parenting, and how I think I'm an okay parent. But I lack the instincts that my husband has. He is very nurturing and sweet and just gets it with kids.\n\nAnd so the kid was having trouble sleeping, even though he's a champion sleeper. So I am taking the kid home and singing the monkey-who-bumps-his-head song, and I thought it would be just brilliant to change the animals around. So we did bears and cats and dogs. And then I got to snakes, and my kid sang along with me until he got to two snakes. And then he just turns and starts crying and saying, I don't want snakes in my bed .\n\nAnd I just remember having to call my husband and tell him. He's like, What did you do? Because he's used to me being stupid.\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nPapageorge: And his boss was there, and the phone was on speaker. And she's like, Now I'm afraid to go to sleep . I was just like, Wow, I'm really bad at this .\n\nDemsas: Well, does your kid sleep now?\n\nPapageorge: Yeah, he's fine.\n\nDemsas: Well, then, you know-\n\nPapageorge: It's all fine. ( Laughs .)\n\nDemsas: It's all fine. Well, thank you so much for coming on the show, Nick. This has been a fantastic conversation.\n\n[Music]\n\nPapageorge: Thanks so much for having me and for all these interesting questions.\n\nDemsas: Good on Paper is produced by Jinae West.

      "text": "Black Lives Matter Fights Brutality And Backlash\n\nA sober New York Times headline last weekend described what many assume has been a dramatic change in fortune for Black Lives Matter , the de facto civil rights movement of the day. \"Black Lives Matter Was Gaining Ground,\" it read. \"Then a Sniper Opened Fire.\"\n\nThe story outlines how, since 2013, BLM has slowly but steadily built national support for its in-your-face protest tactics and its relentless message that African Americans have borne the brunt of police brutality, often fatally, for far too long. Against the odds, BLM and its larger critique of American racism have gone mainstream and become a de rigueur topic in circles ranging from celebrities to presidential hopefuls. The most recent fatal shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana,and suburban St. Paul, Minnesota, were among the most shocking and egregious of many such killings captured on camera in the last three years, including the high-profile shootings of Michael Brown and Tamir Rice.\n\nThese and other images were galvanizing the national conscience, much the same way as images of civil rights protesters being abused by police stunned the public in the '60s. But last week, when a black, military-trained sniper killed five Dallas policemen at the tail end of a peaceful BLM protest in that city, this national support allegedly stalled; in its place is a BLM backlash that has emboldened public figures like Rudy Guiliani to declare that by focusing exclusively on black lives, the organization is inherently racist. The question posed by the New York Times and other mainstream media is how, or even whether, BLM will survive.\n\n\"The two items are separate-the shooting in Dallas, and our demands for justice.\"\n\nThe criticisms of BLM, especially accusations of racism, are not new. But the Dallas shootings instantly moved such criticism from the background to the fore, giving Guiliani and other pro-police types full license to characterize BLM as counterproductive and even dangerous-one pointed accusation is that in stoking black dissatisfaction, BLM is actually responsible for the deaths of the Dallas cops.\n\nBLM activists have for their part rejected the backlash, as well as the narrative that their cause now hangs in the political balance. National protests against police violence have continued unabated, including in Los Angeles , where the rate of questionable shootings of black people by police is higher than in any other big city . The BLM backlash seems to have actually increased participation in protests.\n\n\"Of course people who have power want to say what we're doing is divisive, but what's divisive is killing black people,\" says Melina Abdullah, a key BLM organizer and professor of Pan African Studies at California State University, Los Angeles. \"State-sanctioned violence is the issue.\"\n\nAbdullah adds that the group that convened on Sunday at Chuco's Justice Center in Inglewood for a march numbered in the thousands; typically it would be about 200 people. She says the show of force speaks to the urgency of the cause of police reform and racial justice - an urgency that's growing, not diminishing.\n\nAkili, a fellow BLM activist and project coordinator for Corporate Accountability International, agrees with Abdullah that the Dallas shootings, tragic as they were, cannot obscure the real, deeply historical problems of inequality that have animated the movement from the beginning. \"The two items are separate-the shooting in Dallas, and our demands for justice,\" says Akili, who goes by one name. \"These two things are not related, but we're connecting them. That's wrong. [Sniper] Micah Johnson was a deranged individual and we are not accountable for that. You can't paint all black people with the same brush, but that happens all the time.\" Especially when it comes to acts of violence.\n\nCoincidentally, or appropriately, Los Angeles has become a hotbed of protest this past week. The Sunday night march in Inglewood shut down the 405 Freeway near LAX airport. On Tuesday, protesters were visibly angered by the Los Angeles Police Commission's ruling that the 2015 fatal shooting of Redel Jones, a 30-year-old black woman who allegedly charged officers with a knife, was in policy. Jones was one of 36 people killed by the Los Angeles Police Department last year. After having swarmed City Hall, only to be refused entry, protesters are now enacting an \"occupy\" campaign; Abdullah says she and others will stay in the streets until LAPD chief Charlie Beck is fired. They will stay, she says, until that goal is achieved. No more negotiating.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Home Depot Broke Law By Making Workers Remove 'Black Lives Matter,' NLRB Rules\n\nLabor Reporter, HuffPost\n\nIn a win for social justice advocates in the workplace, the National Labor Relations Board ruled Wednesday that big-box retailer Home Depot broke the law by requiring workers to remove \" Black Lives Matter \" insignia from their uniforms and punishing one for refusing to do so.\n\nThe board's majority wrote in their decision that employees sporting the letters \"BLM\" on their attire as they pushed management on race issues amounted to \"protected concerted activity,\" and was therefore shielded by the law. They ordered Home Depot to offer reinstatement and back pay to a worker who'd resigned rather than remove their BLM marking.\n\nThe NLRB enforces collective bargaining law on private-sector employers, and its five-member board in Washington serves as a high court for resolving labor disputes. (At the moment, there are only four members.) The BLM ruling falls in line with the board's more progressive reading of the law under a Democratic majority shaped by President Joe Biden.\n\n\"One employee was told that if they wore 'BLM' on their uniforms, then management would have to let others wear swastikas, according to trial testimony.\"\n\nThe board's lone Republican member dissented.\n\nAccording to the NLRB decision, a Home Depot manager had told the workers they had to take off their BLM insignia because it conflicted with the company's dress code. One employee was told that if they wore \"BLM\" on their uniforms, then management would have to let others wear swastikas, according to trial testimony.\n\nA Home Depot spokesperson said the company disagrees with the decision.\n\n\"The Home Depot is fully committed to diversity and respect for all people. We don't tolerate any kind of workplace harassment or discrimination,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe company declined to say whether it plans to appeal the ruling to federal court.\n\nThe labor board's decision reversed an earlier ruling by an administrative law judge who heard the case and determined that the workers' BLM protest wasn't protected because it wasn't specifically tied to issues at their workplace. Instead, the judge found, Black Lives Matter served as a \"political umbrella for societal concerns,\" rather than for a particular work grievance.\n\n\"We reject that reasoning,\" the board members wrote. \"Neither the origins of BLM messaging, nor its primary use, dictate how the BLM marking may be used or understood in a particular workplace context (or, indeed, in a broader setting).\"\n\nThe Home Depot dispute arose at a store in the Minneapolis suburb of New Brighton, Minnesota, in the months following the 2020 murder of George Floyd , a Black man, by Minneapolis police officers. Floyd's death sparked Black Lives Matter protests around the country.\n\nWorkers at the New Brighton store were dealing with what they said were several racist incidents at the time. One co-worker had exhibited \"racial bias toward customers and fellow employees,\" the NLRB decision states, to the point where other workers would \"intercept\" customers of color so they wouldn't have to deal with the employee in question. Black History Month displays in the store had been vandalized, and some workers felt that managers didn't sufficiently address what had happened.\n\nThe worker who was unlawfully punished, Antonio Morales, pressed management on the vandalism incident and wound up getting reprimanded for wearing \"BLM\" marked on a work apron.\n\n\"The Home Depot case is one of several before the board involving racial justice messages at work.\"\n\n\"This was the first time that a manager or supervisor had said anything about the BLM marking even though Morales had worn it continuously for the prior 5 months,\" the decision states.\n\nThe Home Depot case is one of several before the board involving racial justice messages at work.\n\nIn December, one of the agency's administrative law judges ruled that Whole Foods did not break the law when it told workers to remove their Black Lives Matter gear, saying the protest wasn't directly tied to their working conditions.\n\n\"The fact that BLM may be a movement of great significance to African Americans, and that its goals are valid, does not mean that a rule prohibiting the displaying of such messages at work is 'racist,' as some employees implied,\" the judge wrote.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "BLM Protest At London Airport Calls Out Environmental Inequality\n\nAir passengers in Britain and beyond faced delays on Tuesday after a \" Black Lives Matter \" protest on a runway halted flights for six hours at London City Airport and a computer glitch hit British Airways in London and the United States.\n\nMore than 120 flights were canceled, delayed or diverted at City, a few miles east of the Canary Wharf financial district, after nine protesters locked themselves together on the runway. Police said late on Tuesday morning they had arrested all nine and the airline was preparing to resume flights.\n\nBritish Airways said it was taking longer than normal to process customers at a number of airports around the world, including London's Heathrow and Gatwick, and urged passengers to check in online before they reached the airport.\n\nThe airline, owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group, apologized to customers.\n\n\"Really unhappy with @British_Airways \"The system is down\" & can't check in!,\" one passenger, Shail, said on Twitter.\n\nAnalysts at Royal Bank of Canada said the delays - the second problem with the service this year - could damage the airline's reputation after passengers took to social media to complain about delays in San Francisco, Washington D.C. and Atlanta on Monday night.\n\nBritish Airways has been rolling out a new check-in system since last year and a spokeswoman said the check-in delays were teething problems that affected many airports.\n\nShares in BA's owner rose 1.5 percent, apparently unaffected by its airline's computer troubles.\n\nAt City Airport, the protesters earlier erected two large posters with the slogans \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Climate Crisis is a Racist Crisis.\"\n\nThe British arm of the group, which started in the United States as a reaction to fatal shootings of black people by police, said it wanted to highlight Britain's environmental impact on the lives of black people locally and globally. Members blocked a main road to London's Heathrow Airport in August.\n\n\"Black people are the first to die, not the first to fly, in this racist climate crisis,\" the group said in a statement.\n\n\"When black people in Britain are 28 percent more likely to be exposed to air pollution than their white counterparts, we know that environmental inequality is a racist crisis.\"\n\nThe campaign group said City airport was designed for the wealthy while those who lived near the site struggled on low salaries.\n\nPolice said the protesters were now in police custody after being arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass, being unlawfully airside and breaching London City Airport bylaws.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Health Authorities' COVID-19 Warning To Sydney Black Lives Matter Protesters\n\nEditor, HuffPost Australia\n\n.\n\nAustralian health authorities had a stern message for Black Lives Matter protesters after the NSW supreme court ordered a halt to Tuesday's BLM protest.\n\nDuring an interview with ABC News on Monday morning, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth was asked if he had concerns about the protesters willing to go ahead on Tuesday despite the ban.\n\n\"We were talking a moment ago to Paddy Gibson, the organiser of the public interest immunity protest in Sydney. He is not happy at the suggestions that it is arrogant and dangerous to go ahead with the march. What do you think about it?\" presenter Lisa Millar asked Coatsworth.\n\n\"Well, I don't think I'd use those terms,\" he responded.\n\n\"I think that people in a democratic society, for a cause like Black Lives Matter, do want to protest and like many things, our activities have had to be put on hold for COVID-19.\n\n\"But what I would say to Paddy and others is that if it wasn't the time before, it is not the time now. There are unlinked cases of community transmission in New South Wales and gathering together, it is not our view that that can be done safely. When it can be done safely, I will be out there with you, Paddy.\"\n\nOn Sunday the New South Wales state supreme court granted a police application to halt the rally. Police cited concerns about the spread of the new coronavirus to protesters, the public and police officers.\n\nSeveral thousand people had been expected at the protest in Sydney on Tuesday against the deaths of Aboriginal people in custody, building on momentum from the global Black Lives Matter demonstrations for racial justice and against police brutality.\n\nJustice Mark Ierace noted public health authorities raised their risk assessment for the transmission of the new coronavirus to \"medium\" from \"low\" in early July, after thousands had attended protests across Australia 's main cities in June without any evidence of transmission.\n\nAustralia n health authorities have been fighting more than 100 outbreaks in the neighbouring state of Victoria, which saw a record 10 deaths overnight from Saturday to Sunday, raising fears that small clusters in NSW could quickly escalate.\n\nOutside the court, organiser Paddy Gibson said he would appeal the decision and the protest would go ahead.\n\n\"We do not suspend the basic fight for justice that Aboriginal people have got going in this country just because there's a pandemic,\" he told ABC.\n\nBut NSW police \"strongly urged\" people to reconsider plans to attend the \"unauthorised\" protest, referring to public health restrictions on large gatherings.\n\n\"Police will not hesitate to take the appropriate action, if required,\" the police said in a statement.\n\nProtesters are demanding justice for David Dungay Jr, 26, an indigenous man who died after being restrained by police at a Sydney jail in 2015, where footage showed him repeatedly telling officers he could not breathe.\n\nA coronial inquest in November 2019 found that none of the five guards who restrained Dungay should face disciplinary actions.\n\nWith reporting by Melanie Burton (Reuters)"

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nLiberal pundits in Sweden are quick to assert the country's Black Lives Matter protests are an \"import of American racial discourse,\" at odds with local realities. Yet neoliberal welfare reforms and a racialized war on drugs are eroding the egalitarian policies that have long made Sweden so distinct.\n\nProtesters march through Stockholm City Centre in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and against police brutality. Linnea Rheborg / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOver the past weeks, Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests have been organized all around Sweden, both to show solidarity with victims of US police brutality and demand an end to violent racist policing practices at home. Although the protests have been mostly nonviolent, footage has circulated online of Swedish police officers using forms of violence that range from knee-holds to pepper spray - used unprovoked on adults and children alike.\n\nTo many observers, the Swedish BLM protests have been surprising . International media coverage of Swedish politics and society rarely discusses race relations and inequality, much less police violence. Instead, it tends to paint the country as an egalitarian utopia. Indeed, even national media has largely dismissed the Swedish BLM movement calling it inorganic - not a response to the realities of racism and policing in Sweden but rather an \" import of American racial discourses .\"\n\nYet Sweden is neither some postcapitalist, post-racial utopia, nor does it have a magically benevolent police force. On the contrary, the country has handily participated in the two historical processes that have come to define racist criminal justice systems in the United States and elsewhere - and against which the Swedish BLM movement is now rising up - white supremacy and neoliberalism.\n\nDespite the place it holds in the global left's imagination, Sweden has its own vicious history of racial subjugation and white supremacy,  its colonial and economic roots having been built on the back of racial slavery. The Swedish colony of Saint Barthélemy , for example, was a locus of the Caribbean slave trade in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, facilitating the buying and selling of thousands of slaves.\n\nIn its heyday, in the early nineteenth century, the island brought in a considerable profit for Sweden as the local port of Gustavia became a major transition point for Caribbean goods. Indeed, although the Swedish involvement in the slave trade is often overlooked, Sweden was one of the last countries in Europe to abolish slavery, fourteen years after the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter abolishing slavery, Sweden extended its tradition of being white supremacist by helping develop the pseudoscience of race biology. In the eighteenth century, the Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus gained international fame not just for his work in botanical taxonomy, but also for being the first scientist to divide people into biologically-defined races . These biological definitions helped justify the subjugation of nonwhite people around the world for centuries.\n\nIn fact, through the Swedish State Institute for Racial Biology , Sweden continued to take a leading role in international \"research\" dealing with racial eugenics well into the 1930s. Research produced by the institute facilitated the implementation of forced-sterilization laws which pertained to certain groups of people with \"unwanted\" genes, such as the Swedish Romani population or the indigenous Sámi people - laws which were only completely abolished in the 1970s.\n\nLike in the United States, structural racism in Sweden survived the abolition of both slavery and race biology, and continues to shape its politics and institutions today. Although few Swedes today are descendants of slaves, over one-quarter of all Swedish citizens have foreign heritage - including approximately 350,000 Afro-Swedes, most of whom arrived in the past fifty years.\n\nTo these black and minority communities, structural racism is apparent everywhere from the frequent occurrence of racially-motived hate crimes to the widespread prevalence of discrimination in the labor market . And as Black Lives Matter protestors have pointed out, racism also extends to the Swedish criminal justice system:\n\n\"It's important that we realize that Sweden has a high degree of racism in society, including in the criminal justice system,\" says Ibbi Chune, one of the organizers of the first BLM protest in Stockholm. \"Afro-Swedes like me and my friends know this well from our lived experiences. We are constantly being stopped and harassed by police and security officers, and often using violent measures.\"\n\nAlthough modern structural racism in Sweden can be traced to the country's disturbing history of colonialism, slavery, and race biology, it has been bolstered in recent years by a contemporary global political development: the growth of the neoliberal state. In Sweden, as elsewhere, this development has exacerbated racial inequality and introduced new techniques for racialized policing.\n\nOn the American left, politicians like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez often speak of the \" Nordic model ,\" pointing to Scandinavian countries, and especially Sweden, as successful examples of democratic socialism. However, despite their historical differences in national politics, economic policy in Sweden and the United States have seen an increasing convergence since the late twentieth century when the socialist and working-class coalitions that built Swedish welfare lost much of their momentum.\n\nOver the past four decades, a succession of Swedish governments have drawn inspiration from the neoliberal models advanced by the British and American center-right. Between 1990 and 1991, the Social Democratic Party agreed with the Liberal Party to install the \" tax reform of the century ,\" slashing the top marginal tax rate from 80 percent to 50 percent. Other economic reforms have enabled the privatization of state-owned enterprises, increased the deregulation of labor protection, and led to an expansion of New Public Management through the outsourcing of health, education, and other social services to the private market.\n\nThese policies have dismantled much of the social welfare systems that defined Sweden throughout the twentieth century; since the 1990s, income inequality in Sweden has increased faster than any other country in the world.\n\nAnd although neoliberal policies have adversely affected all working-class Swedes, they have disproportionately impacted racial and ethnic minorities, a trend which is particularly prominent in many of the densely populated suburbs of Stockholm, Malmö, and other major cities.\n\nAccording to sociologist Tobias Hübinette, suburbs with high populations of immigrants have been increasingly subject to similar trajectories as black neighborhoods in the United S tates during the Reagan era. This means that a decline of low-skilled living wage jobs has been accompanied by deteriorating housing conditions, a decrease in the quality of education, and increasing racial segregation. Unemployment rates for Swedes of a non-European background currently stand between 25-30 percent - compared to 2.5 percent for white Swedes - and approximately one-third of minority workers have unstable jobs.\n\nAs immigrant neighborhoods have become increasingly marginalized, Sweden has primarily sought to solve the growing prevalence of social unrest through increasing policing and security activities. In the past three years, the Swedish Police Authority received an increase of 7.1 billion SEK ($760 million) in government financing.\n\nThe decision followed a growing public discussion of immigrant criminality filled with populist tropes of \" no-go zones \" and minority lawlessness. Police departments have also introduced new techniques for control and surveillance including the deployment of CCTV in public areas, the development of intrusive software for digital wiretapping, and the adoption of new stop-and-search practices, particularly inside immigrant communities.\n\nSimilar to the American discourse on \"thugs\" and \"superpredators,\" Swedish police operations have extended their target demographic to encompass an entire generation of black and minority Swedes through the deployment of racial profiling. In Randomly Selected: Ethnic/Racial Profiling in Sweden, a recent report by criminologist Leandro Schclarek Mulinari, Afro-Swedes, Muslims, and Romani minorities detail how they are stopped, harassed, and intimidated by police and security guards based on their appearance, oftentimes using unnecessarily violent and intimidating methods.\n\nAnd although some policing techniques are contemporary developments, the racist stereotypes at the core of racial profiling can be traced back to Sweden's long history of racial biology - both Linnaeus's \" sly African ,\" and black and brown residents of Stockholm's suburbs are considered inherently predisposed to crime.\n\nIn fact, by over-policing immigrant communities, the Swedish police have also inflated crime rates for minority Swedes and fueled a racist narrative of immigrant delinquency. For instance, statistics from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention show that police reports for possession of narcotics increased by 79 percent over the past ten years, primarily due to expanded investigative and intervention activities.\n\nAccording to Schclarek Mulinari, this supposed clampdown on drugs has disproportionately targeted black and minority Swedes through \"selective policing,\" despite higher self-reported drug usage in majority white neighborhoods. Today, a second-generation immigrant male is almost two and a half times as likely to be prosecuted for a crime compared to a white Swede, with narcotic-related crimes constituting a majority of these charges.\n\nLike in the United States, working-class minorities in Sweden have suffered from the intersection of structural racism and neoliberal strategies for managing social instability. Because black and brown Swedes are blamed for the unrest produced by political disinvestment, they are not only missing out on much-needed programs of affordable housing, living-wage employment, and youth support. For they are also forced to carry the psychological and physical burden of racialized surveillance and intrusive policing.\n\nAlthough racism in the Swedish criminal justice system often takes a different - usually less violent - form from that in the United States, protestors in both countries are rallying against similar patterns of racialized policing, surveillance, and harassment.\n\nAs the BLM movement has shown, however, the question of criminal justice is also a question of class and racial inequality under neoliberalism. In both Sweden and the United States, protestors are not just asking to reform or defund the police, but also for a redistribution of resources, to invest in communities long overlooked by white and upper-class politicians:\n\n\"What we need is a reversal of funding and resources,\" says Chune. \"We have to stop closing down youth centers, cutting back costs in the education sector. We need to stop putting more resources toward police and security officers. Over-policed neighborhoods do not make us feel safe, but rather the opposite. Instead, resources should go to supporting the youth, improving our infrastructure, and creating sustainable employment. This needs to happen not just here in the suburbs of Stockholm, but everywhere.\"\n\nBy suggesting that inequality and crime can be addressed through community support and distribution of resources rather than policing, the BLM movement does not just challenge a global structure of racism and white supremacy. It also represents a reversal of the neoliberal ideology and governance that, in recent years, has found its way into even the most socialist-friendly countries.\n\nAlexander Burlin is a Research Fellow in migration and development studies at New York University Abu Dhabi.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nThe shooting of protesters in Minneapolis is part of a backlash attempting to quiet the movement against police brutality.\n\nProtesters demonstrate at a Minneapolis police station over the weekend.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nTonight, white supremacists attacked the ‪#‎4thPrecinctShutDown‬ in an act of domestic terrorism.\"\n\nThat was how Black Lives Matter Minneapolis described the shooting of five unarmed African-American protesters by a group of at least three men outside of a Minneapolis police station Monday evening.\n\nActivists have been holding a running protest outside of the Minneapolis Police Department's 4th Precinct since November 15, when twenty-four-year-old Jamar Clark was shot by police.\n\nPolice fired after reportedly receiving a call from paramedics saying that someone was interfering with their efforts to aid an assault victim. Witnesses say that Clark, who was unarmed, was laying on the ground, handcuffed with his hands behind his back, when he was shot by police. Clark died the following day after being removed from life support.\n\nDespite the fact that the killing was caught on multiple sources of video, including security cameras from a nearby public housing estate and by bystanders, authorities so far have refused to release any footage to the public - fueling speculation of police wrongdoing and prompting the continuous protest outside the police precinct.\n\nPolice had earlier cleared an encampment from around the station, but protesters have remained outside around the clock, in addition to holding larger actions, including a sit-in on Interstate 94 that brought traffic to a halt and led to the arrest of more than fifty people.\n\nAccording to reports, at least one of the men involved in the shooting on Monday night was wearing a ski mask, and one or more may have worn bulletproof vests - suggesting the attack may have been premeditated.\n\nYolanda, an activist involved with the Black Lives Matter movement before Clark's death, says she was horrified to see what had happened to him in her North Minneapolis neighborhood. She was one of those present at the 4th Precinct when the shooting took place - and she came out to march against the racist backlash the following day.\n\nShe recounts that a group of men showed up at the encampment who seemed \"off.\" Their faces were covered, and they refused to remove their masks. At that point, they were told to leave and a group of protesters led them away from the site. Yolanda says that when a smaller group had broken off to walk the men with the masks further away, the men began calling Black Lives Matter activists the \"n-word.\" It was after the group of protesters turned back toward the encampment that shots were fired. (All five victims are expected to recover.)\n\nThe horror and outrage many feel over the shooting is compounded by how some say the police responded. When Yolanda attempted to call 911, she says it took her three attempts before someone finally picked up. But, she says, given that there were police inside the precinct, it's hard to understand how they could not have heard the gunshots and the cries for medical help. Instead, they only came out once squad cars arrived on the scene.\n\n\"Last night was revelatory,\" Yolanda said yesterday. \"I feel like I'm going to start sleeping here every night now.\"\n\nIn the hours immediately after the shooting, a crowd of protesters turned out to the 4th Precinct in an outpouring of solidarity against the attack. Black Lives Matter Minneapolis and other activists called for a mass march and rally the next day from the 4th Precinct to city hall, the county courthouse, and the federal courthouse to send a message that they won't be intimidated into silence.\n\nSome one thousand people turned out for yesterday's march, including high school students who walked out of school. The mood was one of perseverance and determination, with protesters carrying banners and signs reading \"Justice for Jamar,\" \"Black Lives Matter,\" \"We have nothing to lose but our chains,\" and \"This could be your city next.\" Their chants included \"Handcuffed? Don't shoot,\" \"No justice, no peace. Prosecute the police,\" and \"Send those killer cops to jail.\"\n\nA young Iraqi-American addressed the crowd about the need for solidarity, saying that the struggle reaches from Minneapolis to Gaza. He quoted Martin Luther King, saying, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\"\n\nOne protester named Izy had been involved in the movement since the initial protests after Clark's killing. She was arrested along with fifty others the night of the I-94 shutdown. She says that for her, even worse than right-wing politics, are those who claim to be neutral, saying that they \"can see both sides.\" Neutrality, she says, is a luxury that not all are afforded.\n\n\"I'm out here to make sure those cowards know that they didn't scare anybody,\" Demetrius Pendleton, who runs a local homeless shelter, explained to the Washington Post . \"We want to see justice, and we won't stop until we get it.\"\n\nPastor Danny Givens Jr, the clergy liaison for Black Lives Matter Minneapolis, told the crowd through a bullhorn that protesters would not allow racist vigilantes to scare them away. \"We ain't going nowhere,\" he said. \"This is our precinct. We ain't scared of domestic terrorists.\"\n\n\"What happened last night was a planned hate crime and an act of terrorism against activists who have been occupying the 4th Precinct,\" Black Lives Matter Minneapolis activist Miski Noor told KARE news on Tuesday.\n\nAt the time of writing, three suspects had been taken into custody.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Janeé Harteau lauded police on Twitter, saying that the officers are \"true professionals\" and noting that \"MPD worked nonstop through the night to bring justice in last night's shooting.\"\n\nBut according to protesters, November 23 wasn't the first time that racists had turned up at a Minneapolis BLM protest intent on disruption. Noor told the Star Tribune that white supremacists had showed up on November 23 \"as they have done most nights.\" Activists say that police did nothing about the threat they posed.\n\nAccording to a report in the Twin Cities' City Pages , on the evening of November 19:\n\ntwo guys wearing camo with their faces covered arrived at the precinct to film. They went up to a livestreamer with [alternative media outlet] Unicorn Riot and stated they were curious about how the protest was going.\n\n\"I don't know if this is what [Black Lives Matter protesters] were planning, just standing here,\" one of the white supremacists said. \"It's almost as if they expect one of us to do something. They expect one of us to be in the wreckage of all this. It's boiling. It's going to be happening soon.\"\n\nAsked about what \"justice for Jamar Clark\" meant to them, one of the men sneered, laughing, \"All the folks here should get the justice and peace that they deserve. What we need to do is reach out to our communities, especially our melanin-enriched communities.\"\n\nAccording to City Pages :\n\nLater, Black Lives Matter discovered a video that the two men filmed en route to the 4th Precinct from Uptown. It shows one brandishing a gun. \"We're gonna go see what these fucking dindus are up to,\" he said, referencing a racial slur for Blacks. \"We're going to knock this shit out . . . a little reverse-cultural enriching. Let the fire rise.\"\n\nWhile it's not clear if these men were involved in the November 23 shooting, what is clear is that organized racists were intent on disrupting the Clark protests with violence - and police did nothing even after they harassed demonstrators.\n\nFor their part, protest organizers put together a safety committee to watch for racist agitators and escort them away. \"We reiterate that we have zero faith in the police department's desire to keep our community safe,\" Noor told KARE.\n\nOn CNN, Raeisha Williams, communications chair of the Minneapolis NAACP, stated that police were \"lurking\" near the scene and had refused to provide help to injured protesters. Williams suggested that at least some of those involved in the shooting may actually be police:\n\nWe believe the police department is facilitating the injustice, bullying the protesters. And we also believe that they're involved in this shooting. We know from blackboards and chat rooms and also videos that we have posted on our website that police that are from different counties, police from different districts have come down to entice the protesters, have come down to bully the protesters . . .\n\nWe believe - and we stand behind our belief - that the Minneapolis Police Department is not protecting us, and therefore they stand with racist white supremacists who want to destroy a peaceful movement.\n\nWilliams stated that one of the officers who arrived at the scene of the shooting said, \"This is what you've been wanting,\" and that it took at least fifteen minutes for police to arrive after the shooting - though police claim they were on the scene within three minutes.\n\nWilliams also said police began to mace some of the Black Lives Matter protesters when they arrived - a claim corroborated by Yolanda, who says she met a young man who was part of the group that had escorted the gunmen away. As he applied pressure to the wound of a fellow activist who had been shot in the stomach, he told Yolanda, police arrived and ordered him to move away. They proceeded to mace him in the face when he did not comply fast enough.\n\nAdditionally, some activists reported that an armed racist showed up at the encampment the day after the shooting. They claim that when police were called, his gun was confiscated, but that he was let go.\n\nThe Minneapolis shooting is part of a backlash attempting to quiet the movement against racism and police brutality.\n\nIncredibly, some in Minneapolis have suggested that the antiracist protests themselves are to blame for the shooting. City Council President Barb Johnson, for example, seemed more concerned about those living around the 4th Precinct than about Clark or the activists who were shot. She lamented to the Star Tribune that the shootings were a \"continuation of a stressful time for the neighbors that live in the area surrounding the 4th Precinct\" - adding without irony that the residents \"deserve some peace and some rest.\"\n\nJohnson went on to blame \"outside agitators\" - a favorite scapegoat, from Ferguson to Baltimore, for those trying to clamp down on protests against police brutality. \"That's part of the problem with these protests: the longer they go on, the more participation there is from across the country,\" Johnson told the Star Tribune . \"The longer it goes on, the worse it gets.\"\n\nIn the days preceding the November 23 shooting, Clark's family and Black Lives Matter supporters had reportedly discussed bringing the running protest outside the station to an end and exploring other tactics. Following the shooting, out of concerns for safety, Clark's family called for an end to the occupation of the 4th Precinct.\n\nBut in the wake of the shooting, activists announced they are recommitting to the ongoing protest until they win justice for Clark and justice for the victims in this latest attack. Among other things, protesters are demanding direct prosecution of the officers involved in Clark's killing (as opposed to the prosecutor presenting a case to a grand jury for indictment - unlikely in cases involving police shootings), and for the 4th Precinct to be turned into a community center.\n\nThe shooting has sparked new anger and a determination to stand united in the fight against racism and police brutality, undeterred by the backlash.\n\nAs Miski Noor told the crowd at yesterday's march, \"We will not bow to fear or intimidation.\"\n\nRyan Green and Chance Lunning contributed to this article.\n\nNicole Colson is a contributor to Socialist Worker .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "14 Trump Voters on the Legacy of George Floyd\n\nSupported by\n\nAhead of the first anniversary of George Floyd's death on May 25, my Times Opinion colleagues and I began planning articles from civil rights leaders , academics and others to explore Mr. Floyd's legacy, the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement and race in America. We also asked younger people to tell us, in their own words , what changed - and didn't - after his death.\n\nAs part of this coverage, I wanted to see if some conservative voters had shifted their thinking on Mr. Floyd and the continuing racial justice movement; Republican support for Black Lives Matter briefly rose after his death. I was curious to hear their views at a time when Americans are both divided and interdependent, when many people listen only to like-minded opinions and when systemic racism is an urgent issue for the entire society.\n\nI decided to sit in on a focus group led by Frank Luntz, a longtime strategist for Republican candidates and a veteran of such discussions. He chose 14 conservative Trump supporters who reflected the Republican electorate: overwhelmingly white, evenly divided by gender, more old than young.\n\nAs is customary in focus groups, my role was not to argue with or fact-check the speakers. Mr. Luntz encouraged them to share candidly; several made false claims, including that the election was stolen and that Black Lives Matter is a Marxist or violent hate group. Many criticized the news media but were clearly shaped by it: Some kept overstating the scattered street violence last summer, which Fox News and other news outlets popular with conservatives regularly showed.\n\nThis transcript has been edited for length; the full audio is below. As is common with focus groups, the speakers' last names are not included.\n\ntranscript\n\nI'm going to start this off. Patrick's going to stay on he has every ability to interject and ask follow up questions. After about half done, I'm going to turn it over to him to lead. And I will do exactly the same. And there's no gotcha in here. You can pretty well guess what we're going to ask. So the first question, and I'm going to go through each of you. And by the way, Jeremiah, you're from Michigan, correct?\n\nYes, sir.\n\nOK. I am going to ask each of you. And I'm looking through where everyone's from, and this is amazing. This is the only good thing about COVID is as I look at this, this is America, or at least this is Trump's America from all the states that are represented here. So the first thing is I want a word or phrase to describe Donald Trump. Jeremiah from Michigan, I will start with you.\n\nI'm sorry. I missed the first part, a phrase to describe him?\n\nWord or phrase. By the way, am I coming through clear here with you guys?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd you hear me OK?\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nI just want to make sure because there's another spot I can move to in this place. But if I'm OK, that's better because this is close. I'm in London, by the way. So I've never done a focus group from London, which is why occasionally, here, I've got an accent. OK. Jeremiah, give me a word or phrase to describe Donald Trump.\n\nEccentric.\n\nEvelyn from Texas.\n\nPatriot.\n\nLouis from Arizona. A true patriot that loves our country.\n\nJosh from Wisconsin.\n\nAssertive.\n\nNancy from New Jersey. A leader.\n\nAnn from South Carolina.\n\nA true American example of America.\n\nMartha from Georgia. Relentless. Kathryn from Arizona.\n\nBrilliant, American.\n\nTaylor from Ohio.\n\nPassionate.\n\nLarry from South Carolina.\n\nA narcissist that did a great job.\n\nOK, Larry, you're going to get your ass kicked over the next hour and a half, but the whole purpose behind this. Alex from Florida.\n\nSavvy.\n\nDiana from Colorado.\n\nStrong and opinionated.\n\nJames from Arkansas.\n\nFearless.\n\nWanda from Indiana.\n\nHe's opinionated.\n\nSo when you look back I'm just curious by show of hands because we got to get this out so we can do the other topics. How many of you think he was actually elected president and that the election was stolen? OK, we got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 out of 14. You represent Trump voters across the country. This is exactly the percentage right now of Trump people who think it was stolen. Can I get three or four of those seven people who think it was stolen, what evidence do you have?\n\nI'm in Arizona, so I'm going through the Maricopa audit right now. I was at the Stop The Steal rally and saw a lot of weird things going on. But in Maricopa County, my biggest question, Frank, is, why is everyone trying to hide? If you have nothing to hide, OK, then you would be transparent. But our board of supervisors who should be in jail by now, OK, because they defied subpoenas, et cetera, all right, that tells me, and I know there's other things, but that tells me that there's fraud going on.\n\nOK. Somebody else? Jeremiah, why do you think the election was stolen from Trump? What evidence do you have?\n\nWell, I'd start by saying that the stolen part, it's still unclear. And I think that's probably the biggest question I have, is I don't really feel like anybody has thoroughly looked into this. Familiar with Michigan, Antrim County, in the northern state there. We were one of the first ones to report the anomaly, with 90% of that small town being Trump voters. And we found out that the votes were actually for President Biden. And they went back and looked at it. And they said, oh, no, we corrected it, though, because we changed them back. And I don't think the question really is ever asked or framed the right way, even in the media, as if the votes were changed in the first place, who changed them? And why did they change back? So I mean, to say it's stolen, for me, personally, I'm still out. I want to see a thorough investigation. Pull all the software. Look at the algorithms, and make sure. You show me proof that it wasn't, I'll accept that.\n\nLet's get two more of you who think it was stolen.\n\nI would like-\n\nAnn.\n\nOK. I've been speaking to various people over at Heritage, including Hans von Spakovsky, who has a monitoring on Heritage Foundation with proven vote tampering, not just this election but in the past. I am also a precinct committee woman for my precinct. And on Election Day, I was getting reports from members of our voting members of buses pulling up to nursing homes to ballot harvest. And in South Carolina, you legally can harvest 12 ballots. But one woman said, hey, I got to report my mom voted. My mom has dementia. She's in a coma. There's no way she could vote. So we are getting reports back from various sources of proven vote fraud. It's just now getting the courts to recognize these lawsuits.\n\nCan I get one more of you to explain why you think the election was stolen?\n\nHere in New Jersey-\n\nYeah, go ahead. Go ahead.\n\nOK, sorry. So here in New Jersey, my vote and several of my family members that did their mail-in votes have yet even to be counted. They didn't even go through. So you go to the website, you check on it, it's still pending. Now, I know I'm a blue state. But my vote's still pending.\n\nHm. OK, I want to switch to where we are right now, which is in May 18 of 2021. I'm going to give you another name. And I would like a word or phrase to describe this individual. When you hear this person's name, what do you think? And I'm going to go in the opposite order now. When I say \"George Floyd,\" Wanda, what word or phrase comes to mind?\n\nThat's a tragedy.\n\nJames, from Arkansas.\n\nBad.\n\nEvelyn, from Texas.\n\nODed.\n\nDiana, from Colorado.\n\nPainful.\n\nAlex, from Florida.\n\nAddict.\n\nI can't hear you.\n\nAddict.\n\nLarry, from South Carolina.\n\nMurdered\n\nTaylor, from Ohio.\n\nTragedy.\n\nKathryn, from Arizona.\n\nTroubled individual.\n\nJosh, from Wisconsin.\n\nDivisive.\n\nSay again.\n\nDivisive.\n\nNancy, from New Jersey.\n\nA sad situation.\n\nJeremiah, can you take your hand down, please? We see you. We know you're there. You're at my left-hand corner. You got to because it looks bad on TV. Jeremiah, from Michigan.\n\nPerfect storm of tragic decisions.\n\nLouis, from Arizona.\n\nUnfortunate. But he also played a part in what happened.\n\nMartha, from Georgia.\n\nTragic.\n\nAnn, from South Carolina.\n\nA tragic circumstance with a criminal.\n\nEvelyn, from Texas.\n\nAlready answered, but I'll say again. ODed.\n\nOK, I didn't realize I got you. So please explain to me, as I sit back in my chair. If you see me sit back, this is me in my learning mode because I don't understand. I listen to how you responded to Donald Trump and to the election fraud. And you were immediate. Like, the response just came. There was no pause. I asked you about George Floyd. I know you all know who he is. I know you all know what happened. And yet you were very, very slow to give me just a word or phrase to describe him. Why were you pondering for so long? Please explain to me the delay. Why did you not give me a response immediately? I need to understand this. Anybody.\n\nI think- [INTERPOSING VOICES]\n\nAlex. Go ahead.\n\nOK, well, I don't want to speak for everyone. But I think with Trump, even though he was president, he's much less of a controversial figure than George Floyd was. And we're trying to temper our responses. We're on camera. And so we got to really think about what we should say compared to, say, how we feel about Trump.\n\nLouis, from Arizona.\n\nFor me-\n\nLouis, from Arizona.\n\nSorry.\n\nYeah, I think that there was some framing being done when the video first came out. I always said there's got to be more when they have the body cam and everything going around. But they didn't show what was- he was in the back of the car. And he was saying he was suffocating or words to that effect. And that didn't come out for a long time. As an individual, it really makes you wonder. And listening to some of the trial experts saying that he would have died, now, I think it's disgusting what the police officer did. Don't get me wrong. But I think that George Floyd had a big part and a big hand in that he could have easily sat in the car and been done with it.\n\nMartha, go ahead.\n\nFor me, it was more of a human reaction in that the watching of that video was so horrifying. I'm a mother and a grandmother. And just the mention of his name recalls that video. It's one of those things, like, if you watched some of the videos of the death of Daniel Pearl and other things like that, they're things you can't unsee. And so you respond to it when you hear the name.\n\nWell, also-\n\nSomeone else tell me what you felt about watching that video.\n\n-you asked us for a word about George Floyd. And that's what really caused me to stop and pause. If I had a couple of sentences, it would have been a lot easier. I mean, who was he? Well, he was a drug addict who was a criminal who resisted arrest and put himself in a position where what happened to him happened. If he didn't resist arrest, it wouldn't have happened.\n\nWho agrees with that? Who agrees with that? Raise your hands.\n\nOK, Ann, please tell me why.\n\nI come from a unique perspective. The maneuver is not a normal police procedure. I know a New York City patrol guy does not have something like that. But I understand theirs did. He did not intend to kill the person. So if anything, it would have been involuntary manslaughter. The officer was made a straw man for the argument. It wasn't intentional police brutality. If anything, I think that the sentence did not fit the circumstance. And how is an officer supposed to know someone's stoned on something? Sometimes you can't tell until they start acting up in an unusual way, in which he did, at which point the officers would suspect drugs are a factor. And how you handle someone that is high like that, it's like they got superhuman strength. And you need four or five guys to take one little 85-pound lady down. And tell me, I've been there.\n\nTaylor, I see you nodding your head. Please explain.\n\nI definitely feel like during- if this was all a year ago and a gut reaction, I feel like all of us could very easily say it's still a person that died. So it was obviously horrible to see. And it was horrible to watch. My education came farther down the road when I watched the testimonies and the witnesses and all the different people coming into the courtroom in Minnesota. And when they showed the different angle of the body cam that had never been released, that's when I was kind of, like, oh, it's not what was being portrayed on the media for months and months, that it was just racism and that it was intentional and that they were covering up for each other. There was no covering up because there was clearly footages from every which angle. And then we just now get to see this angle that was from the police officer that was never on- that when I saw that he was never on the neck, I was like, how could he say he couldn't breathe when he was on the top of the spine? So when I saw that, that's kind of where I drew the line in the sand of, like, OK, he shouldn't have been convicted for anything except for what Ann said, as maybe involuntary manslaughter. But I feel like there was definitely no malicious intent going into it. I don't think that all the three things that he was convicted of [INAUDIBLE] I think that was uncalled for.\n\nOK, so let me ask you all, how many of you think that the policeman should have been convicted of murder?\n\nWhat kind of murder?\n\nWhat he was convicted of. How many of you think that that was an accurate sentence? Larry, you do. Martha, you do. And that's it. How many do you think that the policeman should not have been convicted at all, that he was just doing his job? Raise your hands. OK, so you agree that he's guilty of something. But you don't think it's murder. Let's keep going on this. James, from Arkansas, what's your reaction to the verdict? What's your reaction to the whole George Floyd situation? And then Wanda next.\n\nI didn't get to sit in on the trial, hear all the evidence. I did see the video. And part of the video was when they put him in that cruiser, that police car. He was beginning to say he was claustrophobic. And I'm claustrophobic. And I know what kind of reaction you can have when you get put in a position like that. And I believe the officer was probably guilty of involuntary manslaughter. He should have, even watching, he should have let George up. He should have got off of him before he did. I think that would be obvious to see. But you know, it's just a sad situation for George Floyd. It's a sad situation for Chauvin, a sad situation for the nation that that happened. But involuntary manslaughter- should have let him up.\n\nWanda and then Diana.\n\nI would agree with James- involuntary manslaughter. Murder just seems like it was intent to harm, intent to take a life. I think the policemen were doing their job, trying to get a hold of the situation maybe.\n\nBut I think it was a response to what the victim did. It makes it no less tragic. But I don't think it qualified as murder. But I think a more just sentence would have been involuntary manslaughter.\n\nSo, Diana, I'm going to go to you in one second. But, Wanda, I need to ask a follow-up. Do you think that George Floyd was, in some ways, responsible for what happened to him?\n\nYes, I do.\n\nAnd, Louis, you're nodding your head yes. Larry, you're nodding your head yes. By a show of hands, how many of you think that George Floyd was, in some way, responsible for what happened to him? Raise your hands. That's really overwhelming. So Diana and then Nancy and then Josh. Why is George Floyd responsible for what happened to him?\n\nWell, I think in any situation where you have police and civilians, for lack of a better definition, coming together, especially in a situation where there was perhaps an apparent crime taking place, I think that, as a citizen on the street, we need to respect our police officers. We need to allow them to do our jobs. And when they ask us to do something, we need to do it, period. These people, they put their lives on the line every day to help keep us safe. And George Floyd clearly did not follow all the instructions. I don't believe that the officer had the intent of killing George Floyd or murdering him. I think manslaughter would have been a better sentence.\n\nDo I think what the officer did was right? No, I think he should have let George Floyd up. I think it was Louis who said that. But I also think that George Floyd was culpable in what happened because he didn't respond as he should have to the officers.\n\nNancy, do you think that George Floyd was responsible in some way for what happened to him?\n\nI agree with what Diana just said. Our law enforcement are there for a reason. And you respect in any situation that's there. He was obviously doing something wrong. He obviously has a path of doing things wrong. If he had just listened to the authority and sat up- and again, that officer, what he did was wrong. No officer out there will tell you what he did was wrong. He shouldn't have knelt on his neck for that long. But they probably could have sat him up and waited for a bigger transport to come for him, and let things out.\n\nJosh, why is George Floyd at least somewhat responsible for what happened to him? And then, Kathryn, I'm going to you next.\n\nWell, they wouldn't have been there if the police hadn't been called there in the first place. The reason was a counterfeit $20 bill. So I mean, he was the reason that they showed up to begin with. And then, like others have said, he didn't comply, got a little unruly. He was high. So I mean, he definitely contributed to what happened to him.\n\nKathryn, then Jeremiah. Then, Patrick, I'm going to go to you for one follow-up here. Kathryn, you're up.\n\nOK, so in full disclosure I have to say that I am married to a cop, a 30-year lieutenant with the fourth largest department in Arizona. And he said chokeholds were banned a long time ago in their department. That would have never happened. However, in any case, whether it's a traffic ticket, whatever, do not resist the police. Do what they say. Just comply. Don't try to run. Don't try to resist, because that's when you're going to get in a lot of trouble. And he looked like he was a pretty big guy. And four officers are trying to hold him down. Again, if it was a chokehold thing, that shouldn't have happened. But that's a Minnesota thing. That wouldn't have happened here. But detaining him was what they were supposed to do. And he kept resisting. He kept fighting. He kept trying to find every excuse. And he had a history of it. He had a record of it. And those officers knew that. So he's involved. He's complicit.\n\nJeremiah, and then I'm going to Patrick for a follow-up.\n\nThanks, Frank. I'm going to show my cards a little bit here. Like Kathryn, I actually am a law enforcement officer. I have to take this from a different perspective. I'm never going to see it through the same lens that many of you here, that maybe not in the same situation I am are. I would watch that frame by frame. As Chauvin came into the picture, that had been going on for a while. I believe it was his decision to remove him from the car because he was complaining of being claustrophobic. Up to that point, everything that would have had been done, I would have done the same thing if I were in that similar circumstance with fighting with him and trying to get him under control. Kicking officers- he was tall enough that he had his feet out the other side of the vehicle, as well. It's very difficult to put somebody that size in the back of a vehicle to begin with. In a caged vehicle, there's not a lot of leg room. And if you're that big, it's difficult anyway. Once they got him down onto the ground, that's when the situation, what we would call it, evolved and changed. As he's down on the ground, you have a lot more control over a subject. You're handcuffed behind the back. When he rolled him onto his stomach, we call that a position of asphyxiation. That's not a position that you ever want to leave somebody in regardless, unless it's a deadly force situation. You just don't leave somebody in that position for very long, and I mean seconds. So that was bad. What I think happened to Chauvin, in my opinion, is I think he went into the black. I think he completely blacked out and was lost in the moment and did not move. The point that Mr. Floyd had stopped resisting, even at the point where he was just relaxed more, he should have rolled them on to his side, even sat him up. In a sitting position with his legs crossed in front of him, that guy's not getting up and running very far.\n\nOK, I don't want to get- I've let this go on too long. One question, Jeremiah. If that person was white, would that person have been treated any differently?\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, no, I don't believe. For me and my fellow officers, we don't ever go into the situation looking at it like that. It's very plain and clear to us. You're either doing something that causes a reaction from us or you're not. It's not a race thing. I think if that same exact situation- and that situation probably happens a thousand times a day across the United States with white, Black, Latino, it doesn't matter- male, female.\n\nThen explain to me why it is that Blacks are the victims of police shootings at a way disproportionate number. Why is the evidence to the contrary? And, Louis, you can shake your head as much as you want.\n\nNot true.\n\nWhy is the evidence to the contrary?\n\nI think those facts are pretty solid. And they lean towards crimes committed. I know the FBI puts their stats out every so often, every year, whatever it is. But if you work in inner city areas, high population inner city areas- Detroit for instance- there are a lot of Caucasian people living in the inner city of Detroit. When I say 'inner city', I mean downtown area other than along the riverfront. So when you have crimes that are happening and taking place, the level of death that you have from that will reflect. If you come out to a rural community where I live, we don't have a lot of people of color.\n\nWhy are Black people- Jeremiah, why are Black people getting killed by cops?\n\nI mean, it's tough to say. I don't have the stats in front of me.\n\nJust say it.\n\nI'm sure the-\n\nJeremiah, so you don't have an answer for that? You're a cop, and you don't have an answer for why Blacks are getting killed by cops?\n\nI have one.\n\nNo, no. I don't think that's the correct way to pose the question.\n\nI am posing it.\n\nI understand you're posing it. But I don't know if it's the-\n\nIncorrect question.\n\nThat is the way that everyone wants to pose it. But it's difficult for a law enforcement officer to answer, well, X people get killed more often than not. I mean, I have the same resistance from white people that I do Black people. I've never had to, thank God, on the job use deadly force on anybody. So I can't answer that question.\n\nLouis, why are so many Black people so afraid of the cops?\n\nFirst off, OK, if you look at the facts, there's more whites killed by cops than Blacks. Now, as a percentage, that may not be true. But the pure numbers are whites get shot more than Blacks. And you can sit there and argue the facts. But those are the facts. Look them up. The FBI puts it out. And from 2015 to 2019, actually it's almost double the number. So let's not put the-\n\nHold on, Louis. And what percentage of the population is white versus Black? You say-\n\nWell, Blacks are 13% to 14% of the population. And whites are just under 50%.\n\nOK, so that's not double. That just proved the point, Louis.\n\nNo, my point is, Frank- my point is that everyone wants- you can make numbers and statistics look any way you want. The pure and simple number is the number of people that get shot by cops are higher for whites than Blacks. Now, there are more inner city, probably, shootings as a percentage of Blacks because they're probably in a lower income because of the- my feeling is because of how they might have been put into a situation. And they haven't been able to come out of it. OK, but at the end of the day, you look at Chicago. No one cares about Black-on-Black killings, OK? It's always about the cop, the white cop against the Black. And let me tell you something. There are Black cops that shoot Black people. There are white cops that shoot white people. This is not a race issue. I grew up in a military family. And I grew up in an age that you respected your elders and authority, all right? And you said 'yes, sir,' 'no, sir.' And when you don't, the consequences could be severe.\n\nWell, and- [INTERPOSING VOICES] Frank, one point about the num- oh, sorry.\n\nMartha, go ahead.\n\nNow, one point about the numbers. It's true that the population of Blacks is 13% to 14%. But where most of these shootings are happening are in urban areas, where the population is 50% or more in many cases. So as you know, you've got to look at where they're happening. But I do think, for me, George Floyd was a tragedy. And the worst thing about it, I think, was the fact that the three minutes that he went on keeping the knee on the neck after he wasn't moving. For me that was the hardest part because it seemed personal as opposed to- in the case of Chauvin and Floyd, it seemed personal rather than just police work.\n\nWhy is the Black population so afraid of the police? Martha-\n\nCan I-\n\nThe media.\n\nCan I answer that, please?\n\nGo ahead.\n\nAll right, because I- [DOG BARKING] -was a cop in New York City. And we would have political agitators like Al Sharpton come into the neighborhoods. [DOG BARKING] We would have no problems. But then after he leaves-\n\nOK, hold on. If you're going to have a dog screaming in the background, you do something with the dog. And, Martha, I'm going to go back to you because it just won't look right. It won't sound right. I'll come back. Ann, I'll come right back to you. But if the dog is barking that loud, that's a problem. Martha, go ahead.\n\nNo, I think that there's going to be a big challenge as far as the fear that Black people have. And I know it's true. I have enough friends that have told me enough times that they're afraid, especially Black men, are afraid of the police. But the big surprise was talking to people that I know that- I don't want to get pulled over either. I'm afraid when the police pull me over, too. I don't want to be- it's different, I know, because I'm a middle-aged white woman, OK? But I don't think anybody wants to be pulled over by the police or have interaction with the police. But I do think that it is true that Black people, especially Black men, are afraid of the police. And we need to work on that.\n\nEvelyn, you're from Texas. Why is the Black community so afraid of the cops?\n\nI think more because of what the media has portrayed, not that some of it isn't true, because it is. But it's also very twisted these days, as we have seen. And it's also biased. It's also one-sided. And when that's all you see and that's all you hear, then that's how you think.\n\nHow many of you blame the media for the fear that the Black community have towards the police? Larry, Louis- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9- jeez- 10 of you. OK, Larry, then Kathryn, then Nancy, tell me why. And then I'll have Patrick follow.\n\nWell, one of the oldest rules with media- if it bleeds, it leads. So they have every incentive to fuel the fire to try and get Black people as upset as humanly possible, to make them believe that they will be shot on sight by a cop for no apparent reason. And a lot of them believe it. And that's why they're resisting arrest. That's why they're running away. And that's why there are problems. If somebody running one of the news outlets would ever stop to think about what he's doing and the effect he's having, as opposed to trying to push his political agenda, a lot of this wouldn't happen.\n\nKathryn.\n\nUnfortunately they've given up all of their journalistic integrity.\n\nYeah, the media is clearly with the Democrats and their narratives. So it's about the narrative in that this is a racist society and that Blacks are in a far worse situation of getting shot by cops. And I think there's just so much more trouble with that. And it's just not true. And so unfortunately that's all they spew. It fits the Democrat narrative because they're doing whatever they can do to cling on to the Black vote because they're losing it slowly but surely. And that's the number one reason I can think of.\n\nNancy and then Ann.\n\nIt's 100% media and political agenda. I work from home. I watch different news channels throughout the day to see what's covered. And there's only one channel that really talk about what's going on. It's fair and balanced. But you look at it, and none of them will cover how many police officers were shot this week. None of them will cover that. But anybody has an issue with any African-American out there, that has it there. But let's try and cover all of the issues, not just pinpointing that one, because there's a lot more issues that are out there that can be talked about and need to be known about.\n\nAnn, you're up.\n\nAll right, a lot of these neighborhoods that I worked in, the political agitators made a field day of coming in there to stir up trouble. They get their 15 minutes of fame. And they end up getting money donations into their organizations. And it's all about the Benjamins. It's about the media selling their news stories and their papers. And it's about the agitators collecting more money in their bank account. And if you take that out of the equation, we would have far less problems. We don't put our uniforms on every day thinking, hey, I'm going to go beat up a Black guy, or I'm going to shoot a Black guy. No, that's not what we do. I almost got stabbed by a Black guy. And he's alive today because I didn't shoot him. That's not what we do. We go out there to serve. No matter what your color is or your flavor of the month, we're there to protect you.\n\nPatrick, you want to throw in a couple of questions here?\n\nGreat. Thanks, Frank. Thanks, everybody. Just to start with a show of hands, a question regarding the police. How many of you before George Floyd's death- raise your hands- how many of you believed that the police officers in America did their best to treat everyone- white, Black, Hispanic, Asian, everybody- the same, professionally and fairly the same? OK, it looks like everybody. After George Floyd's death, I'd like to see a show of hands, did any of you feel differently about that, in terms of how police officers treated people by race? Would anyone feel differently, if you'd raise your hand.\n\nNot one of you. Actually, hold on. Kathryn is the only one.\n\nMaybe. Kathryn, yeah, what do you think about it?\n\nI think that was just a unique situation. I mean, that's unfortunate. But again, the media just ran with the story for weeks and weeks and weeks. And that is not representative of 99.9% of the cops in America. And that is unfair to spread that lie to every community and put fear in Black people, put fear in white people and Hispanic people and things like that. So I think of it as a unique situation. Did I feel differently after I saw it? No, but I know that that was an improper police procedure. Like I said, that would have never happened in Arizona. But it would have been handled differently.\n\nDiana, do you want to speak to that, too?\n\nYeah, I think people who become police officers do that because I feel like it's a calling for them. I mean, personally I could never do the job. And I don't think that a police officer goes out every day, like one of the other panelists said, to go, I'm going to go kill a Black person today. Or I'm going to go kill a Hispanic person or a white person. I'm just going to go kill a person today. I don't think that they ever go into their days thinking about that. Maybe more often they might go into their day thinking, oh, am I going to be alive at the end of this day? I mean, I can't imagine. I had an opportunity to take a class from a police officer. It was actually a basic gun class from a police officer. And the stories that he shared, I mean, it's stunning what our police officers go through on a daily basis. And I really wish that Americans would respect our police officers. I wish our media would respect our police officers. And I, too, believe it's the media that really is pushing the hate and the divisiveness that we see in our country today. I don't think it's everyday Americans, like all of us here. I really don't.\n\nMartha, do you want to speak to it? And then I'll pass back to Frank.\n\nYeah, and we talk about the media. And we talk about the mainstream media. But the one thing we haven't touched on that has caused divisiveness is social media. I mean-\n\nYeah.\n\n-prior to social media, you were able to have clearer lines about what's right and what's wrong. And now you can find 200 people that will agree with you on anything on social media- any kind of behavior, any kind of way. And I think that it divides us. It puts us in silos. The one big change I've made in the last year is I do a lot less social media. I only do what I have to do related to work. And I don't trust anything that I see on social media unless I've checked it out.\n\nI think people find it much easier to be mean, so to speak, on social media. I mean, I think people feel freer to say what they want to say on social media. And they don't care who it hurts.\n\nThat's right.\n\nOK, I'll take it back. You've all heard the phrase \"white privilege.\"\n\nUgh.\n\nOK, clearly I see that reaction. Go ahead. White privilege- comments.\n\nYeah. I was raised in a blue collar family, military family. My father was a sergeant in the Marines. No one ever gave- my mom worked three jobs. My dad worked. He was a union carpenter. No one ever gave us anything. We worked hard. And you know what? My parents instilled, you work hard, and you will get somewhere. No one's ever just handed it to me. In fact, I think nowadays- and I went through it in corporate America- I think nowadays white older men are the most discriminated people in this country. And the media plays it up that it's white privilege. And I'm so sick and tired of hearing about white privilege. No, I didn't create slavery. I didn't create- you know, when we grew up, I grew up through the era of Martin Luther King-\n\nYes.\n\n-and segregation. Now the media and the Democrats want segregation again. What good is that going to do? No, there's no- white privilege, to me, is a bunch of bull.\n\nJames, white privilege?\n\nNo white privilege. I came up the same way he did. I came up in the '60s, through Martin Luther King. I've seen racism. I've seen the white side and the Black side, [INAUDIBLE]. And I've seen minorities being discriminated against. But we worked our way. My father was in Air Force. And he retired. We moved to a farm. We worked the farm. I had opportunities that I blew, not because I was white, because I was dumb sometimes. But I believe, in this country, if you are Black, white, Latino, Asian, if you really want to work and earn and be something, be somebody, you have every opportunity as anybody else to achieve anything you want to be and just- you could be a doctor, scientist, astronaut, a president of the United States in this nation. And white privilege is a myth.\n\nEvelyn, white privilege, your reaction.\n\nAbsolutely not. We worked hard. I remember growing up on a farm. And we had three huge gardens that we worked. And it was just all about work, work, work, work to even have enough to eat and have enough milk to drink. We had to take care of the cows and all that. And none of that has changed. I'm not on a farm anymore. But it's still about making my own way and not depending on the government- God help us- or anyone else to make that way for me. It's up to me to do what I want to do in life.\n\nLarry- [INTERPOSING VOICES] -reaction to white privilege?\n\nIt's total nonsense. I mean, I was born and brought up in a broken home. My father was an alcoholic and a compulsive gambler. So we were always broke. We had utilities turned off. I paid for my student loans years after I graduated. For someone to tell me that I am privileged, that is damn offensive.\n\nAnn, you feel that way?\n\nAbsolutely. I grew up under busing. And I had to make sure my younger brother and sister got to their bus stop. So I ended up walking two miles to school. So don't tell me about busing. I lost many jobs because of affirmative action. I got passed over for a promotion because of affirmative action. I was told to my face, no, you have to be either Black or Hispanic, to my face. So don't tell me about white privilege when I had to work three jobs to put myself through college because I was not the right color to get a grant or a scholarship. No, I worked hard. I climbed the corporate ladder. I walked away from corporate America to become a cop because I felt I needed to serve in any community. And I got put in the worst community possible. And I did my job no matter who was there in front of me. And I treated everyone equally. So don't tell me about white privilege. I'm responsible for what I do today, not what someone did before me. I take responsibility for myself, not anyone else.\n\nBingo.\n\nAlex, I know you've wanted to get in. And then, Josh, I'm going to you. And, Patrick, I'm going to throw it back to you in one second. Alex, go ahead.\n\nSo no offense to everyone, but I think I'm a unique case where I'm probably the youngest person in here. I'm in college. And I've seen firsthand throughout my experience- my firsthand experiences throughout my life where I've been, like Ann was saying, where I've had scholarship opportunities turned down, where I have to work full time, 60 hours a week, just to pay my student bills because I can't get any financial aid because my parents are married and I can't get any financial aid because I'm a white man. And so I'm seeing all this stuff where I've had classmates who are of a different skin color with lower grades than me, the same extracurriculars, and lower test scores get into a college that I didn't in high school. And I mean, it was an African-American male. And I'm a white male. And he got in. I didn't. I had better test scores and grades. And so that was really eye-opening to me, where I had opportunities taken from me because of the color of my skin. And then I hear people tell me on a daily basis that I'm privileged and that I need to pay reparations and things like that.\n\nJosh, I'm going to make a- this is a very wrong thing for me to do. But I'm going to suggest by looking at you that you're not Caucasian.\n\nNo. [LAUGHS] So first off, Alex, I apologize. I was probably one of those minorities that took one your spots at one point.\n\nNo, you're Asian. I think you're good. [LAUGHTER]\n\nBut no, I don't think white privilege exists. For me, and this is when people try to tell me about it- and I don't know everyone's background here and income levels. But in general, for me and my family, I'm better off than 70% of white people that I know. So if white privilege existed, I wouldn't be able to do what I do and have the things that I have. And kind of going back to what some people have said about- I think it was Ann- about getting passed over by jobs, so I work in IT project management and managed services. And I had a client recently, it was, like, last week, that said that they specifically wanted minorities and/or minority women over white candidates. And like, uh, we can't really do that, man. But we'll try. So there definitely is a bias against white people. And actually, I know some people said they don't like social media. I happen to enjoy TikTok a lot. Someone on TikTok told me I was Asian by ethnicity but a white apologist because I didn't agree that there was white privilege on some stupid TikTok dance. So there is definitely a bias out there against white people more so than actual white privilege at this point.\n\nPatrick, I'm going to throw it to you because the other issue- George Floyd. And I'm going to do a commentary because I know some of you are aware of the focus groups that I do. And I don't mind sharing this with you. This is a very different session of what I normally do. Patrick, you saw how they struggled with George Floyd. There is no struggling on this issue. There is resentment. And the work that I'm trying to achieve, this blending of the American experience, trying to find common ground, phrases like this immediately divide. So I don't know what you're going to ask. But this was very enlightening to me just how immediate the response was, how angry people are, how they personalize it for themselves. And this is just something for you to consider. But what's your question?\n\nThanks, Frank. And I've been struck by all of this, as well. I did note the fact that a number of people thought that, when they thought about George Floyd, they thought about \"tragic,\" and to a person thought that showed them did something wrong. And candidly, I think there are probably a lot of liberals out there who would think that this group would not think those things, that the people would be at the barricades defending cops and criticizing Floyd. So I found this really interesting. Frank, I think I want to borrow from you, where you were at the beginning, which was to- I'd like to say a phrase. I'm going to say a phrase, and I'd like to get one word or a brief reaction for your feelings about that phrase. And the phrase is Black Lives Matter. So I'd like to go around and just get a brief reaction, your thoughts when you hear that phrase. My screen may be different than Frank's. But maybe, Ann, could you go first?\n\nIf Black lives matter so much, why aren't they out there protesting in front of Planned Parenthood, where the vast majority of abortions are Black children, when it was formed by a person that wanted a genocide- Margaret Sanger? Tell me. No, all lives matter, that all lives in the eyes of God are equal. And that is how I feel as a Christian.\n\nOK, possible short answer. Maybe, Martha, do you want to go next?\n\nI think it started out as an organic movement. But it's now become a corporation, where there are people benefiting from moneys and other things like that. So it's hard to trust what that really means.\n\nOK, Louis.\n\nYeah, I think they're a part of Antifa at this stage, backed by Soros. And I believe that all lives matter. When you get mad at that, something's wrong, because all lives matter. We're from the same creator. We all bleed red. And we're all God's children. But when they do things that shouldn't be done, then, sorry, not going to get my pity.\n\nOK. If you can keep it tight, that'd be great because I know we don't have a ton of time. Thanks, Louis. Jeremiah?\n\nMisguided.\n\nThank you. Nancy?\n\nPolitical.\n\nOK, Josh?\n\nThe idea is fine. The group itself- a bunch of losers.\n\nKathryn?\n\nFraud organization.\n\nSay that first word again?\n\nFraud organization.\n\nOK. Wanda?\n\nISIS statement.\n\nTaylor?\n\nCorrupt, and going the wrong direction for the Black community.\n\nOK, Larry?\n\nAn organization where the founders are making a ton of money by encouraging violence.\n\nAlex?\n\nA tool.\n\nDiana?\n\nHate-filled.\n\nJames?\n\nMarxist hate group.\n\nAnd Evelyn?\n\nWell, he took mine. I was going to say Marxist. So I'll say communist. [LAUGHTER]\n\nSorry.\n\nI'm curious, going back to last May, a year ago right around now, in terms of your views about the Black Lives Matter movement after George Floyd's death and the protests that started in May. In that moment, were any of you any more or less put off by Black Lives Matter than you were before Floyd's death? And I ask because there has been polling, public opinion polling, that shows shifts in how people saw Black Lives Matter around that time among people who identified as Republicans. I would just love to hear from a few of you on that. Taylor, do you want to go first?\n\nI would say before George Floyd, I was always kind of not a huge fan of the phrase of the group. And then I feel like- I'm a teacher in Columbus.\n\nMy school's, like, 99% African-Americans. So there was almost, like, a pressure on me that after that if I didn't show some kind of sympathy towards it, it was almost kind of, like, I was viewed as lesser than. So I would have to have these conversations with my students. And I was so conflicted because I'm just like, OK, we're focusing in on this. But we don't even know all the details. But I'm having to have these conversations with my students that are 100% gung ho. And I'm like, I'm so torn. I feel like, to answer your specific question, over the course of this past year, I have grown more and more skeptical and have been very, not paranoid, but just very- skeptical is the best word of just what they really, truly stand for, how they use their funds for corrupt leaders. Their mission is not condemning violence in some areas. But then they'll condemn it in others. It's like, you can't have it both ways. So I feel like, at first, I was kind of skeptical to begin with. And then now I'm to the point where the mention of Black Lives Matter when I read projects from my students- all the time they focus on things to do with race- I'm just like, I'm done. I'm very much over it. It's very divisive. And it's very frustrating that they are not being educated because their parents are kind of speaking into them. And this is our next generation. I teach middle school. So in their very formative years, they're being told this by their parents and their communities. And I'm just like, I can't say anything because then I'll be looked at as the bad guy. So for me, I'm in a really weird, awkward situation when it comes to this, especially in my professional life.\n\nTaylor, maybe before we go to Louis, can I just ask, as you were listening and talking to your students about it, did anything that they say hit you in a way that made you, not- it doesn't sound like you were skeptical of Black Lives Matter. So I'm not saying it changed your mind. But just listening to your students' experiences, your Black students' experiences, did that influence your thinking about the group or the idea at all?\n\nI mean, I think, as a teacher, you have to keep an open mind to an extent. You have to be able to at least listen. So I've definitely listened to my students because I'm not Black. And I don't know what they're going through. And I will never be able to be fully in their shoes. So when I was having these conversations with them, it was- I feel multiple people have said it throughout the night about multiple issues- I feel like they're being so fed this narrative from the media or social media or from their parents or from the Black community or from x, y, and z, that if I were to ever- that when I did present, 'well, have you thought about it from this perspective,' that's so foreign to them because they're not being exposed to the other side. And so when I'm there with them, I try to have these very intellectual, hospitable conversations. But for them, it just does not click. So for them, they see me- they don't see me as, like, a sympathizer with white people or with cops. They see me as, well, we're going to talk about it with you. But you'll never fully understand. And yeah.\n\nNo, that's very helpful. Louis?\n\nYeah, I think- well, first off, to Taylor's point, I don't think anyone knows how anyone else feels because they can't walk in their shoes. So Black people can't walk in my shoes. And I can't walk in their shoes, OK? We can only imagine what's gone on. When my grandparents came over, they were discriminated against. They were Italian, OK? And my point about Black Lives Matter is, eh, it was a movement. And I'm OK with peaceful protests because that's our First Amendment, right? But what happened is it turned into, OK, let's burn. Let's loot. And they're hurting the Black community. They're going into Black communities, taking over their businesses, burning them down, looting them. And now these business owners that are Black have nowhere to go. So if Black lives really mattered, they would sit back and, hey, let's have a million protesters peacefully march that Black Lives Matter. But also, when we say all lives matter, let's not make it just Black lives. We're all together. So all lives should matter. It doesn't really matter what color. Again, I keep coming back, we're all from the same creator. Call him what you want. But at the end of the day, I grew so totally against Black Lives Matter. And I lump them into Antifa at this stage because I am so tired of robbing and looting and burning cities down. And the media is to blame- is partly to blame for allowing it without calling it out, and so are the Democrats. They just hide it all. And it's like, no, just tell the truth. Tell the truth. That's all I care about.\n\nLouis, to that- oh, Alex, why don't you go. And then I'll throw in a question.\n\nWell, so the question that you guys posed was, like, did our opinions really change? But I remember back in 2015 when Freddie Gray died, and I remember- I was in the DC area at the time. And I remember seeing high school kids my age go up to riot in Baltimore and get in fights on the street. And so to think that the events of George Floyd really changed the image of BLM, I guess it became more popular. But that was always their shtick. Like, they were never non-violent. Any time a BLM protest showed up, it was always a riot.\n\nI want to ask about that question to all of you. It is a fact that the Black Lives Matter protests last summer in American cities were overwhelmingly peaceful. Do you disagree? That is a fact. In terms of the 26 million-\n\nLook.\n\n-the 26 million people who marched through the summer, there were not 26 million rioters. So do you disagree with that fact? And what evidence is there in terms of numbers and numeric damage can you cite to disagree with that fact?\n\nEvelyn, go ahead.\n\nEvelyn.\n\nEvelyn, go ahead.\n\nI just want to say, is this a joke? I mean, are you serious? Really? They were peaceful protests? You've got to be kidding.\n\nBingo.\n\nEvelyn, tell me what evidence is there that they were not overwhelmingly peaceful?\n\nOh, murder, looting, burning buildings down. You know, just that type of stuff. That's it.\n\nThis subject gives me such anxiety just thinking about it because you watched on the news, things were burning, things were looting. People were stealing. I live in New Jersey. I live in a beach town. Last June, over Juneteenth weekend we had every police department in our town because a group of people came into our town, which is a very, very nice town- beach, boardwalk, everything- they were peeing on people's lawns. They were pooping on people's lawns. They were publicly drinking. And it lasted for about 24 hours in my quiet, little beach town. And it didn't need to happen. It could have been peaceful, but it wasn't.\n\nSo what evidence-\n\nI'd like to weigh in. I feel like, to answer your specific question, Patrick, I think overwhelmingly when you look at 26 million people, yes, probably statistically they were a majority peaceful. But what we saw and what the majority of people were led to believe was that it wasn't. I know my family owns restaurants in downtown Cincinnati. And the fact that even if they were peaceful, the fact that they had to close down every other day for weeks on end, not because of COVID but because of fears of getting their windows knocked in or because of something Over-The-Rhine because there was such violent crime in the area, having to be so incredibly paranoid about the structural integrity of this 175-year-old building, that if something were to break, nothing could be fixed. So I feel like when you see it, it makes you think, like, oh, that's all there is. I'm sure statistically yes, the overwhelming majority probably was peaceful because there wasn't everywhere. But I think, to a lot of our points, what we've seen for the last year or two, three, five, six years is that the media has very clearly shown that there's large groups of people that think this. And if they don't participate, they at least sympathize with the people that are doing the damage and the looting and the murdering and the defecating on lawns. I feel like even when you sympathize with that, I feel like that is still a problem.\n\nKathryn, from Arizona- Kathryn and then Martha.\n\nYeah, I didn't see anything peaceful about the protests. I mean, obviously I wasn't part of the 26 million group or whatever across the country. But there was nothing peaceful at all about those protests. I mean, violence was insurrected everywhere. They made such a big deal about the politicians dead, about January 6. No, what happened all summer, all last year, that should have been called out. If there's going to be a commission to investigate anything, it should have been all of that.\n\nMartha, then Jeremiah. Then I'll give it back to Patrick.\n\nI think it's true that what we saw over and over again was that in the early-day part, the protests were peaceful. It looked like regular folks. It looked like people that were coming together because they were concerned about what happened. As the day wore on, you would start to see people come in, almost like- I mean, it's the middle of the summer in Atlanta, Georgia. It's 95 degrees. And people are coming in all dressed in Black with almost, like, riot gear on. And these weren't the police. And the crowds would change as the day went on. So the violence happened as the day went on. Now, you can say they were infiltrators, Antifa, whatever you want to call it. But there was a major change in who was at these rallies from the early part of the day as it became nighttime.\n\nJeremiah.\n\nYeah, I agree with Martha on that. And I think this is where Patrick- and this is not a knock on you at all. But this is where the media is able to have that platform to glorify- I think somebody said it earlier, if it bleeds, it leads. I agree with that. In the city of Detroit, we didn't have those problems. So if you were to just take a Detroit resident, and Chief Craig would tell you the same thing, we didn't have any of those problems all summer. There were not storefronts being boarded up. There were not trash cans burning in the streets, although those people were protesting. And if you were to get inside of these groups and talk to them, they didn't have radical, off-the-wall commentary. Their concerns were genuine. And you empathize with them. And somebody else said, you can't walk in their shoes. I'm not Black obviously. But what Martha said, I think, is pretty accurate. Depending on where you lived, at night with these infiltrations, Antifa, the radical groups would come in. They get the story. They become the story. For people like us that look at it, and we don't agree maybe with the messaging, we then somehow see it as, this is what those movements were versus how the media portrayed it as 26 million people, it was overwhelmingly peaceful. Yeah, well, I mean, you could say that with any statistic. And if you want that to be your number and be the lead, that will be your lead.\n\nSo we're now seeing a real violent crime spike in a lot of cities, a rise in murders. I mean, it's happening now and in recent months, I think, more than a mass crime spike and wave and arrests last summer during the protests. How afraid are you about violent crime today? How much does that concern you?\n\nAnyone want to go first on that? Louis.\n\nYeah-\n\nI-\n\n-here in-\n\nThen Martha.\n\n-Arizona, I keep saying we're the Wild West. But I do remember when Fashion Square was taken over by the looters and everything else. And then we got word that Antifa and Black Lives Matter were going to march on Scottsdale Quarter and Kierland. And I got to tell you, you know what? A lot of people, citizens, went there with their arms to protect it, OK? And it's a shame they never came because, you know what? I think they realized that Arizona is a little different, just like, maybe, Texas or something else. So I believe totally that if they're going to try and do something, it's going to be in the urban areas. And when you say \"defund the police,\" like you do in other areas- Minneapolis and all these other things, New York- that's where the crime is rising. Look at the blue states versus the red states. It's mind boggling that people can't see that it's all about the blue states and the red states and how they deal with crime and how they deal with police.\n\nMartha, do you want to go next? And then Alex.\n\nYeah, so I live in a fairly rural area. So I'm not as worried about crime. But my daughter lives near downtown Atlanta. And she and her husband have what they call a bug-out bag so that if things get too hot or if they get too bad, they'll throw the bag in their car. And they'll come up and stay with us. And that's terrifying for me as a parent. There were 14 shootings over this weekend in Atlanta. I mean, I'm a native Atlantan, which is very unusual, OK? And we're the city too busy to hate, until this summer. And you know, people are terrified, if they go into Atlanta, to leave their car or any of that kind of stuff. But that's going to change.\n\nBut I will tell you, as a parent who's got kids that live in urban areas that are afraid, it's pretty scary.\n\nAlex.\n\nSo this doesn't relate to this question. It's to the previous, so just bear with me. So you wanted numbers. And so I referenced the study that you looked up from the- let's see. It's the ACLED, where they said 93% were peaceful. Is that correct? I don't want to misinterpret what you were saying.\n\nIt was-\n\nHold on, hold on. We're not going to do this. No, this is moderator prerogative. This is not a debate. I'm trying to understand opinion. I'm not trying to have an argument here. So-\n\nNo, it's not an argument. I just want to- I don't want to-\n\nAlex, you got 10 seconds to make your point. Go ahead.\n\nAll right.\n\nGo.\n\nOver 20 deaths, $2 billion in damages, since, the study said, about 7,000 events. That means that there were almost 550 riots. And the fact that there were 550 riots should be a headline in and of itself. There you go.\n\nOK. Actually you did very well on that. [LAUGHTER]\n\nFrank, do you want to jump back?\n\nYes, because I got a question that normally I would ask at the end. But I'm starting to cough. So I don't know whether I'll make it or not. This is for all of you. And this is two or three sentences each. Are you afraid in America to voice your point of view about issues of race? I watch you carefully. I see you, because you're all in front of me on a screen. And I notice those times when you respond immediately and those times when you're slow about it. Are you afraid to tell me your real thoughts about race in this country?\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nNo. [INTERPOSING VOICES]\n\nI'm surprised. Ann, tell me why not.\n\nI have been- [INTERPOSING VOICES]\n\n-talk about it.\n\nI have been very vocal in my opinion about the breakdown of race relations inside the United States, especially with critical race theory being taught in our schools. And I have been an activist dealing with our school board, with our elected officials. And I am not afraid to speak my mind.\n\nYou know-\n\nLarry.\n\n-I think one of the things that people get wrong about the South all the time is that we actually- most Southerners have actually interacted and lived together more, especially since the civil rights movement, than any other place in the country. The most segregated city I've ever been to in my life is Boston, OK? And I went through- I remember colored water fountains. I remember desegregation and busing. So I don't have any trouble talking about how I feel about race. I'm more concerned about making sure I don't misspeak and not just here but anywhere because of the cancel culture and if you say one wrong word, people try to tell you what you really meant. And I know what I mean when I say what I say. So I'm not afraid to speak my mind about race. I've been doing it all my life. But I do think that we're in a place right now where people are being measured in a way they haven't been in a long time.\n\nWanda, are you nervous about speaking about race?\n\nI guess I'm in the minority here. Yes, I am. I feel like if you have an unpopular opinion on Black Lives Matter or whatever, that you're discriminated against, no matter what color you are. And I found that a lot of my liberal friends, they're ready to pounce on anything you say that they can turn around, whether it's about Black Lives Matter or LGBT. You know, it doesn't matter. So yes, I'm very careful what I say and who I say it to. And it shouldn't be that way. But that's the feeling I get.\n\nJosh, you're one of the younger- Josh, how old are you?\n\n38. I'm Asian, man. We all look young. We look young until we're, like- [LAUGHTER]\n\nBy the way, just for the record, Josh, I'm going to put you in every single focus group because you're the comic relief. [LAUGHTER] Are you ever afraid to talk about issues of race?\n\nNo, because I'm not white. So I'll say whatever. I'm also not trying to get into Harvard, so they won't hold it against me that I'm Asian. No, I'm never going to be, like, a dick about it. But I'll always speak what I think.\n\nWhat about the crimes against the Asian community?\n\nWell, I think that, again, it's probably a pretty small part of the population that is actually committing these crimes. And I think one of the things that's overlooked and that the media doesn't really cover a whole lot is that most of them are Black people that are doing it. And they're all in pretty liberal cities, which, again, just part of it just being larger urban areas, just more people. But a lot of it's in San Francisco, New York. And so it's elderly Asian folks. And that's definitely not right.\n\nBut you're blaming the Black community, not the White community.\n\nCorrect.\n\nThat's a big deal. You sure you want to say that? [LAUGHTER]\n\nYeah.\n\nThere you go.\n\nGood job. Frank, can I just interject?\n\nLike you aren't?\n\nYeah. One thing I would say is- and I keep saying this to people- my parents were probably more racist. They were- and I'm 60, all right? My generation then saw a lot of change. And yes, there was probably- there is racism in my generation. My kids' generation don't see color. They don't see gender. They really don't. And my grandkids- I have one grandson. And I will tell you this, Frank. I highly doubt that they will ever see any type of- or very, very small; obviously you can't say none- racism, sexism, or whatever because I just think that we all learn from each generation. And we get better at it. And that includes Blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians, whatever. It includes us all.\n\nWell, look. I think it's fair to say that most white people think we've gone farther than we actually have. And most Black people think we haven't gone as far as we actually have. And somewhere in the middle is the truth. And my kids always say to me, are you going to strike up a conversation with strangers when we go out today? And I always say yes, because that's what I do. I go out, and I meet people wherever. I strike up conversations with people in lines, wherever. But when you do that, you really expand your circle of people that you talk to. And it's not just the same five people that live around you.\n\nCan I just jump in to ask the whole group about Martha's point there? How many of you agree with Martha's statement- could see a show of hands- that most white people think that white people have come farther than they have, and most Black people think that we haven't gotten far enough- come far enough? So 1, 2, 3-\n\nAlmost everybody.\n\nYeah, almost everybody. Kathryn, can you say why do you think that is, and then maybe, Larry, why you don't?\n\nI mean, I have Black friends. And I have friends of all color, creed, and race and everything. So my Black friends would probably disagree with that, the latter part of that statement. But I think she does make an excellent point, in that white people are like, we're not racist. We have friends of every race, color, and creed. We treat everybody kindly and the same. We don't care. So what's the big deal? Whereas Black people or Hispanics or Asian or whomever, if they're in a situation where they're discriminated against and it's something we just aren't aware of, being white, I guess- I can't help that I'm white by the way. I'm not [LAUGHS] going to apologize for it. So I would say white people are thinking we're doing pretty good because we get along with everybody. But maybe Black people are still having some issues.\n\nAnd, Kathryn, just so I understand, you think that's really not- they may think that way, but that's actually the reality.\n\nRight.\n\nYeah.\n\nI mean, I don't know. But I know my Black friends don't feel that way. But I can't- obviously they don't know the whole Black community. None of us do.\n\nSure. Larry, how do you see that?\n\nThis is the Great Society. We've been giving out subsidies, different government programs, all these giveaways, so many of them targeted specifically to the Black community right up to today, where we've got affirmative action. We're bending over backwards to try and make things as equal as possible. And they just try to keep on coming up with excuses as to why they're being held back, with many of them being fictitious.\n\nOK. Frank, do you want to- or I can keep going.\n\nKeep going. I'll jump in there in two minutes.\n\nOK. Just a show of hands, I would like to know just how many of you believe that discrimination against minority groups is a serious problem in society today.\n\nAnybody? OK, no one believes that. And there's a great deal of talk now about racial diversity in the workplace. And certainly affirmative action programs have been around for decades. But a lot of companies and workplaces are putting more emphasis on racial diversity. And that's been one of the outgrowths of some of the protest movements from last summer. Do you generally see racial diversity in the workplace as- I was going to ask- as a good thing, a bad thing, or it doesn't matter?\n\nBad.\n\nI'd just love to hear a few voices on that.\n\nI think it should be the-\n\nBad.\n\nI think it should be the qualified person. I'm sorry.\n\nPatrick? Patrick, you want to do it this way. Hold on, because-\n\nSorry, I asked the question. [LAUGHS] [INTERPOSING VOICES] Frank's the expert.\n\nHold on. But this what I want to do. And, Louis, you get credit for this. I want you all to stick your fist out towards the camera. Stick your fist out towards the camera. Put your thumb horizontal. Start horizontal. Make sure I can see your thumb. Kathryn, I can't see your thumb. Look at your screen. Everyone, look at your screen. Now vote. Diversity programs at work- up or down. Vote.\n\nDiversity programs at work. [INTERPOSING VOICES]\n\nAlmost all of you are negative. Diana and then Evelyn and then Wanda, why so negative about diversity programs at work? Why not open it up and promote it for everybody?\n\nI think when you start talking \"diversity,\" you're talking about racism. And we keep saying we have systemic racism. OK, so I agree we have systemic racism in this country. And the reason we have systemic racism in this country is because we're seeing it again. We're seeing color. We're concentrating so much on color that we don't see anything else. We don't see what people have to offer regardless of their color. We see color first. And we don't say, oh, well, you're an excellent candidate for this job because you could have a master's degree in telecommunications or whatever, where you might say, OK, we have to put a person of color into a position when maybe they're really not the most qualified.\n\nEvelyn and then Wanda.\n\nHaving worked for the post office, I saw so much of that, where if you were a Black woman in particular, you were promoted so quickly as opposed to me, just being a woman and being the wrong color. And I saw so much where it wasn't about qualifications. Diversity to me is racism, because it's making you aware that there is a difference. And that's the problem.\n\nWanda and then Nancy.\n\nI think hiring, promotions, should be based on merit, not the color of your skin. And it goes both ways. A white person shouldn't get a job because they're white. They should get it because they're the best person for the job. Same with Blacks. Same with Asians. It should always be based on merit.\n\nA qualified person, if they're not getting a job because of the color of their skin, is wrong regardless of whether that person is Black or white. It's wrong.\n\nGang, can I ask you, though, just historically, do you believe that that's been true, though, what Wanda was saying and Larry, that historically Black people, Hispanic people, white people all got the job because they were the best, the most qualified for the job?\n\nNo.\n\nIdiocracy versus meritocracy.\n\nDefinitely not.\n\nNow, I mean, I guess what I'm asking- and it's sort of a loaded question, I realize. But the degree to which, for a lot of the 20th century, white people got jobs, and, well, it's true, for most of the 20th century, white people got jobs. And that's partly why affirmative action happened.\n\nYou ever hear the old saying 'two wrongs don't make a right'?\n\nHow about age? How about age? Why don't you factor that in?\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nMartha, do you want to-\n\nI mean-\n\nAge discrimination is just as bad as race discrimination. So I went through age discrimination. I'm sorry, but I did not get a job because I was white. I got a job because I was most qualified. I got health issues because I was older, and they wanted to get rid of me for a younger guy. I'm sorry- not buying it.\n\nYeah, no, I kind of was talking about the long arc of history. But, Martha, go ahead. And then, Frank, I have one last big question if we have time for it.\n\nWell, I mean, I think in the long arc of history, yes, there was obviously discrimination. It wasn't until 1968 that in Georgia state employment was desegregated. I mean, so there's a lot of things that happened there. The first job I ever got I got because they were looking for a woman, OK? And I knew I was hired just because I was a woman. But I knew I wasn't going to keep the job just because I was a woman. I had to be better than the men. This was in the workforce in the early '80s. I had to be better than the men to keep the job. And I've been successful at it. But I think, a number of years ago I was on the board at the University of Georgia. And the decision came down where you couldn't take into consideration race. And you couldn't take into consideration other factors in admissions. And we had to do a wider net at the University of Georgia to be able to get more diverse students. And I think there is a value in diversity in your institutions. I think that that's true. But you have to be careful that you don't go as far as- and I've forgotten his name, the student in Florida- you don't go as far as where you say you can't get help just because you're a white man. So we've got to find that balance between fairness and giving opportunity and reaching beyond your own group to be able to look for people in jobs. I mean, that's what The New York Times does. That's what big companies do. But over the summer, recently with big corporations complaining about things, when you look at their actual corporate boards, when you look- they talk a lot about diversity. But they haven't delivered on diversity. But yet they want to judge and criticize other people about diversity. I think most people honestly are just trying to get through life day to day and that if you will just- most people are nice to each other and that if you just go and look and are honest with people, that you're going to get treated right because the law is fair. The law is fair. People may not be. The implementation may be wrong sometimes. But the law is fair. And we just have to make sure the law gets implemented.\n\nIt's not fair for politicians. They get away with murder, literally.\n\nSo just a-\n\nPatrick- [INTERPOSING VOICES]\n\nYeah, OK. It's an open-ended question. We don't have time for everybody to answer, certainly. But if people have thoughts.\n\nGeorge Floyd died about a year ago. Did his death and what followed, the protests, the trial, the discussions about race and racism, did that change anything about America for you or how you saw life in America, people in America, or what's to come in the near future? Just, it's an open-ended question. But, Alex, do want to- Alex and then Nancy, I think, or Ann. Alex and then Ann.\n\nYeah, I don't think it changed how I saw anything. But it's certainly changed who got elected and who's sitting in the office right now.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's for sure.\n\nHow so, Alex? And then Ann.\n\nWell, I mean, you've seen many articles since the election about how the Black turnout, clearly mobilized by all these months and months of protesting and civil engagement- I think that that definitely mobilized the African-American demographic and got them to turn out to vote, even if it was for Joe Biden.\n\nGot it. Ann and then Diana.\n\nIt saddened me because growing up through the civil rights, we, as a nation, have come so far. Never in history have we had so many interracial marriages and children. We have gone from slavery- and our founding fathers put the building blocks in place with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, knowing we had to come down this path. We walked it. We put the laws in place to give an equal chance to everyone to attempt to succeed. And what we have with something like George Floyd and these protests, we have a segment, a very small segment, like 1%, trying to tear our republic down by creating victims and dividing us. And this is what we have to fight. We have to reunite the nation.\n\nThanks. Diana.\n\nI grew up outside of Washington DC. And I lived there during the Martin Luther King riots. So I felt like I was growing up really in the heart of racism in that time. And what I have seen now and what I see in this country- the hate, the divisiveness, the anger between races- I think it is far worse now than it was then. And I remember the fear that I lived with during those riots in DC. And I have felt that fear again, even as an adult. I won't go downtown Denver at night. I would never go down there by myself. I think that what's happening in this country, I think we're going backwards. I don't see us going forward. And it breaks my heart. I grew up in an Air Force family. So you know, I am a proud, flag-waving American. And I'm happy to admit that out loud. I love this country. And I really hate to see the direction we're going. We're not moving forward.\n\nEvelyn, do you want to- oh, sorry. Go ahead, Louis.\n\nI lived in Buffalo. I still remember the day Martin Luther King was shot. And my parents called us in. We were across the street at the playground of our school. And I believe that at this stage, the goal of the politicians and the media is to divide us. I think by divided- united we stand, divided we fall. And I truly believe that they want us divided. And it's disgusting, as opposed to, I think the media could help bring us together. Instead, they're bringing us further apart, or they're splitting us and dividing us. And so are the politicians. I don't care whether you're GOP or a Democrat, OK? There's a lot of that. So my concern as an American, I am a patriot. I do believe in God. I do believe in our flag. I do believe in our Constitution and our amendments and the Bill of Rights. And I will fight for whatever I can. But I will fight side by side with anybody that believes in that, whether they're Black, white, green, yellow, orange. I don't care. It doesn't matter as long as they are on our side and together we stand. OK, that's all we need. We all bleed red.\n\nThanks, Louis. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Yeah, Martha, go ahead.\n\nJust a quick statement. I mean, I'm an optimist. So I think we're resilient as a country. And I'm glad they made the reference to the '60s and early '70s because you think about- New York was a pit back then. It was violent. We had three major figures in our country assassinated within a five-year period. But we didn't have social media. So it didn't feel like it was happening all the time the way it is now. So I'm optimistic. We're resilient. We're going to get back together again. We're going to have a new leader come out of all this. I don't know who it's going to be yet. But I'm optimistic about the future.\n\nCan I just say- make a quick point?\n\nYes, Wanda.\n\nFirst of all, I don't believe President Obama would have been elected twice if we were a racist nation. And my second point is, people who constantly talk about racism perpetuate racism.\n\nYes.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. advocated peaceful change. Over the course of this past year, nearly every congressional Democrat was advocating violence. Huge difference between the two periods.\n\nI don't think that's true, Larry. But we'll agree to disagree. Evelyn?\n\nWould you like me to send you some clips? [LAUGHTER]\n\nEvelyn?\n\nMy first marriage was- I was married to a Black man. So my daughter is mixed. And we discuss these things quite often because she's kind of torn between being white- and I shouldn't say 'torn between.' But I know it's probably put her in a difficult position to be raised by me, but yet she's got darker skin. And of course we've been questioned, is she adopted? No, she's mine, you know? But these topics have come up. And believe me, I lived with some things when we were married. Oh, my goodness, it was horrendous. And it wasn't from white people. It was a scary time then. And that's what I see happening again with what's happening in our nation now. I see the regression that reminds me of those days. And I had quit feeling that entirely. I mean, it wasn't near my mind anymore. And then with discussions that I have with her, we've both made the comment about going to the grocery store. And if I look at a Black person the wrong way- and it's not intentional- but how am I supposed to look at a Black person? And she said, Mom, I feel the same way. She said, I'm scared I'm going to look at somebody wrong and not mean anything. I'm just thinking about something else or whatever. And I thought, that is so sad, because she's lived her whole life- she'll be 40 this year- lived her whole life without that mess. And now here it is. And it's just sad. It's very sad.\n\nThat's terrible.\n\nMy husband and I, we sit and we talk. And I'm 38. I've been married five years. And we have the subject of children. Do we want to bring a child into this world right now? Because it's so crazy out there, what the future has to hold for them. And that's scary to sit down and talk about because you don't know what this future holds right now. So there has to be something out there that brings us together because we are so divided right now. And I'm terrified of bringing a child into this world right now.\n\nPatrick, can I add just a 10-second piece here?\n\nSure thing, Jeremiah.\n\nI think it's generational. It absolutely is generational. As we've been sitting here talking about this, I went back. I'm an '80s kid. I spent two decades in the Marine Corps. So I was amongst a lot of diverse groups, and even now with my coworkers in law enforcement. I remember Rodney King, Malice Green. I remember those times. Of course there wasn't social media back then. But you got your news at 6:00 AM, 6:00 PM, midnight, whatever. I think, what Martha's saying, I can't agree with any more- to be more of an optimist and take it that way. I have two young kids- 10 and 7. And we're constantly talking about these things. You know, I follow the same path I was taught, the Martin Luther King part- you judge a person by their character, not the color of their skin.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this is a lot of hyperbole that is built around us. I don't really think it's as bad as it's portrayed. I just don't.\n\nI agree.\n\nI agree.\n\nAs a way to end this, with Patrick on, do you all think you're going to get a fair hearing? Do you think your voice is going to be accurately represented?\n\nYes.\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nIt's The New York Times.\n\n[LAUGHS]\n\nI've had too many interviews edited and editorials edited- no.\n\nI think it will. I mean, Patrick was- he knew what he was walking into. And he wants to hear conservative voices. So I trust that he's going to portray our words fairly.\n\nI agree with Diana.\n\nHe was respectful.\n\nWe're trusting you, Patrick.\n\nHey, listen, I really appreciate everything. And I understand the lack of trust. I really understand how divided this country is and how so many people have suffered in so many different ways, especially over the last year. I just am grateful that everybody was as honest and forthright and direct as possible. And I appreciate you letting me in and letting me listen and learn because I did learn things. And I personally see it as kind of a waste of time living on the planet if you're not going to learn things and talk to people who are different than you. I really do hear what a lot of you were saying about social media and the silos that we live in. And you know, I'm just really grateful that you took the time out of your night to talk to us. So thank you.\n\nAnd also can we celebrate Jeremiah, who puts his life out on the line? And I gave him a lot of shit at the beginning because that's my job. But now I want to say, good for you. Thank you very much. We all appreciate it.\n\nThank you for your service.\n\nAnd Ann, as well, who's served.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nAnd Kathryn's husband.\n\nYes.\n\nNo, you don't get a chance to say thank you to the spouses. It's only the person who's- [LAUGHTER]\n\nHey, they're the ones at home worrying about us.\n\n100%\n\nFor what it's worth, he's the one keeping my great dane at bay so that he doesn't interfere with this wonderful session.\n\nYeah.\n\nI thought that was Louis' dog barking in your screen, Kathryn. So-\n\nIt was mine. Sorry, that's Aussie. [LAUGHS] He hears things. And that's Aussie. [LAUGHTER]\n\nI have a Saint Bernard. But she's in the other room.\n\nI tried. [LAUGHS]\n\nI have a lazy bulldog behind me.\n\nDogs unite us, except Ann- except Ann with that cat. Ann, your cat is so cute.\n\nYeah.\n\nYes, and her name is Puppy. [LAUGHTER]\n\nGod bless you all.\n\nPlayer\n\nBy The New York Times\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "\"White Girl Moans Black Lives Matter\"\n\nOutwardly, Pornhub has joined large companies such as Amazon, Twitter, and Nike in the corporate rush to put out public statements that condemn racism. @Pornhub, the site's popular Twitter account run by Aria Nathaniel, wrote that \"Pornhub stands in solidarity against social injustice,\" and encouraged people to give to organizations such as the Bail Project and the NAACP. The site also promised to donate $100,000.\n\nAround the same time, Pornhub saw the rise of a new subgenre: Black Lives Matter porn. One such video is called \"White Girl Moans Black Lives Matter While Getting Fucked #BLM.\" Another is \"Black Anal Matters.\" There is also a subcategory called BLM protest that mainly shows Black men penetrating white women during a supposed Black Lives Matter protest. Some of these women have \"BLM\" written on their backs, while others are in jail cells being penetrated by Black porn performers dressed as police officers. In a classic marriage of racist themes, one video purports to show a \"black lives matter thug choking out a white cop daughter.\"\n\nSpencer Bokat-Lindell asked in the New York Times last month : \"Are companies taking a meaningful, if overdue, stand against racial oppression, or are they just protest-proofing their bottom lines?\" Time will tell, but one company that stands out as a sure bet to keep its brash brand of racism alive is Pornhub, owned by porn media giant MindGeek .\n\nThe porn industry has a long history of depicting Black men as hypersexualized predators of white women, a trope that has its roots in the terrorism and lynching of Black men on trumped-up charges of rape, or even just for looking at white women. This has long been neatly distilled in the porn category \"interracial.\" That might seem to imply performers of different races having sex, but in reality, interracial porn features mainly Black men and white (often blond) women, with titles such as \"Black on Blondes\" and \"White Sluts on Black Snakes.\"\n\nThese films are produced for, marketed to, and distributed mainly to white men. One producer has said his most popular movies are those where \"the purity of the sacred white women is compromised.\" Another pornographer told Adult Video News, \"My customers seem to enjoy black men 'taking advantage' of white women: seducing their white daughters and wives. The more 'wrong' a title is, the more appealing it is.\" This explains why interracial porn geared toward white men is more dominated by Black male porn performers than any other ethnic group. Pornhub is a particular showcase for such titles. It offers 50,000 videos under \"interracial.\" One very popular series hosted on the site is called, variously, \"Oh No! There's a Negro in My Wife,\" and \"Oh No! There's a Negro in My Daughter.\"\n\nBlack women in porn are also victims of ugly racist stereotypes. Depicted as having excessive and uncontrollable sexuality, Black women are often portrayed as living in a ghetto, a setting that is sexually lawless, debauched, and brimming with \"hos,\" \"pimps,\" and \"gang bangers.\" Virtually every porn scene talks about \"booty\" in its promo text, promising lots of \"big black round asses.\" Black writers such as Patricia Hill Collins have explored how this fetishization is rooted in the belief that Black women are especially promiscuous and that their \"booties\" are the only body parts worthy of notice, reducing them to sexual objects devoid of humanity, individuality, and dignity.\n\nThe \"Black ho\" and \"Black ghetto slut\" categories are classic moneymakers for porn. As these women are penetrated by any number of men, racist stereotypes are constantly pelted at them. During the body-punishing sex, male porn performers often make reference to the woman's skin color, and her debased status as a woman is seamlessly melded with, and reinforced by, her supposed debased status as a person of color. In the process, her race and sex become inseparable. In Pornhub's \"ebony\" category, it doesn't take long to find titles about \"nasty hood bitches\" and others. These videos legitimize the rape of Black women from slavery to the present day.\n\nAs a platform, Pornhub hosts both amateur and professional porn, and while it's largely user- or studio-generated and not produced by the site, Pornhub's leaders like to boast that a human curator monitors every video uploaded. These curators make no discernible attempt to filter for racism, hate, and content that could incite violence. (They can barely stop porn featuring minors .) As one of the most visible, visited, and prolific porn sites on the internet, Pornhub functions as a gatekeeper for the industry and one of its most important vectors. And even as it pays hypocritical lip service to Black Lives Matter, the site is profiting from the insidious stereotypes and racist images that threaten those lives.\n\nThe porn business news site XBIZ recently hosted a \"virtual town meeting\" with performers of color who talked about the rampant racism in the industry, from being paid less than white performers to being marginalized in interracial porn. (The industry's racism is hardly confined to its output.) A summary of the event included a series of action items for the porn industry, including \"no more mockery of people of color.\" It's hard not to be cynical about such initiatives, given that the commercial porn industry's depiction of people of color is always one of mockery and degradation. The recent subgenre on Pornhub that sexualizes and trivializes Black Lives Matter highlights the hypocrisy of this public relations effort: With more than 1,000 such videos already on the site, Pornhub is drawing revenue from the exploitation of the protest movement, with recycled racist themes to boot.\n\nThe pornographic images that meld the racial with the sexual breathe new life into old stereotypes that circulate in mainstream society. While these stereotypes are sometimes a product of the past, they are reinforced in the present every time a user masturbates to them. They're a powerful way to disseminate and amplify racist ideology, as they not only display the supposed sexual debauchery of Black people but also feed white fears of Black people as a dangerous and predatory group to be controlled, policed, incarcerated, and shot to protect white innocence. As one white man who self-described as \"racist\" wrote on irmovement.com , a site where fans post about their fondness for interracial porn, \"most racists do fear blacks\"-\"they see the black tendency for group violence. This fear builds up into anxiety and eventually all of that anxiety and fear needs an outlet.\"\n\nThe commercial porn industry and its biggest vessels like Pornhub have been given a pass to harness overt racist ideologies that would immediately be called out should they appear in any other media. For too long, the industry has used the mask of liberated sexuality to shield its racist imagery and hateful ideology, which would not be tolerated elsewhere. As we see Black men and women continuously die as a result of this manufactured \"fear,\" the industry must be held accountable for its role in profiting from the use of racist tropes that put at risk the lives of all Black people.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Word Nerd Reckoning\n\nIt is an accepted norm of competitive Scrabble that for the duration of a game, from the first tile played to the last, the meanings of words are meaningless. Whatever combination of letters offers the best strategic outcome is the right one. A little old lady once played CUNT against me. My teenage daughter laid down FUCKERS. A frequently played word is JEW, defined in some dictionaries as an offensive term for \"bargain.\" It gets rid of the tricky J and W.\n\nBut the nationwide protests over racism and police violence have prompted a rethinking of the conventional wisdom about the role of words in Scrabble. What started with a call last week for the Scrabble community to support Black Lives Matter led to a proposal by leadership of the North American Scrabble Players Association to eliminate slurs-about 80 in all, plus alternate spellings and inflections, for a total of 238 words-from the master list of words that are permissible in club and tournament play.\n\n\"I have felt for a long time that there are some words in our lexicon that we hang onto in the mistaken belief that our spelling them with tiles on a board strips them of their power to cause harm,\" NASPA's chief executive, John Chew, wrote to the group's 11-member advisory board. \"When we play a slur, we are declaring that our desire to score points in a word game is of more value to us than the slur's broader function as a way to oppress a group of people. I don't think that this is the time for us to be contributing divisively to the world's problems.\"\n\nIn theory, Scrabble strips all words of their \"broader function.\" Players don't say the words they form out loud, and aren't using them to communicate thoughts, feelings, or ideas-they're using them to score points and nothing more. The only standard for a word's playability has been whether it meets the criteria for admission into the Scrabble lexicon. But it's also true that the words are always lying there, staring up from the board. And the question of whether the appearance of slurs in that space should be troubling or not is dividing players of the game.\n\nThis is Scrabble's second walk on these hot linguistic coals. In the mid-1990s, an art gallery owner in Virginia objected to the fact that JEW, along with a slew of other slurs and obscenities, was in the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary . Hasbro, the game's owner, and Merriam-Webster, the dictionary's publisher, replied that while they don't condone the words, the dictionary is a repository of the language, not its moral arbiter. Unsatisfied, she took her case to the Anti-Defamation League, which accused Hasbro of \"literally playing games with hate.\" Hasbro backed down. Words carrying the label \"offensive\" were expunged from the Scrabble dictionary .\n\nCompetitive players objected, and a deal was brokered: Club and tournament Scrabble would be governed by a separate lexicon that allowed the expurgated words, including vulgarities like FUCK (and a half-dozen variations) and SHIT (more than a dozen variations) and slurs like the N-word and REDSKIN . Players collected them in what came to be known as the Poo List . In the quarter-century since, elite Scrabble players have deployed the occasional offensive word without controversy or, usually, a second thought.\n\nNow players are proposing to do from within what a lobbying campaign once succeeded in forcing from without. The move began with the suggestion, in a private Facebook group called NASPA Member Concerns, that the community demonstrate support for the protest movement. A player from Texas, Jim Hughes, offered a concrete action. \"[R]emoving certain offensive words from our lexicon, such as N--(S) and others,\" he wrote, \"could show our solidarity with BLM and demonstrate that NASPA does not condone racism.\" Two days later, news of the proposal to remove the slurs was posted, and since then various threads on the topic have generated more than 1,000 comments. The NASPA advisory board considered the proposal on Thursday night but took no action pending further discussion in the community.\n\nTo prepare the list, Chew, the Scrabble association executive, electronically collected words labeled offensive and separated them into seven categories: slur, anatomical, political, profane, prurient, scatological, and vulgar. The proposed deletions would be limited to slurs only-\"that is,\" he wrote, \"words that are used to label someone as being of less value than the speaker based on some innate trait such as gender, race, or sexual orientation.\"\n\nThe words range from obvious and common aspersions to ones unfamiliar to most people ( BOHUNK , HAOLE , CULCHIE ) to others they might be surprised to learn have a disparaging meaning ( JESUIT , PAPIST ). A few don't always carry a monitory label in dictionaries ( GRAYBEARD , JAILBAIT ). Some familiar ones didn't make the list because they have other, inoffensive meanings ( BITCH ).\n\nIn the Scrabble Facebook discussions, the N-word-the only slur in this article that isn't typed in full-received special attention. Several players suggested it should be the only word removed from the list, on grounds that its calumny exceeds all others. (Merriam-Webster calls it \"almost certainly the most offensive and inflammatory racial slur in English, a term expressive of hatred and bigotry.\") Some players wrote that they wouldn't ever play it in a game. Others held the lexicographic ground: If it qualifies as a word, it's playable.\n\nOtherwise, the focus of the debate was less on the particular words marked for excision than the place of slurs in the game. Many argued that Scrabble would lose nothing by dropping words that obviously cause offense in real life. Such a move, some players said, might also make the game more attractive to sponsors or broadcasters, and could generate positive media and attract new players. More important, they said, it could be a fitting contribution from a cabal of word nerds to the swirling conversation about race and equality.\n\n\"The issue is not censorship,\" wrote Tony Leah, a longtime player from Toronto. \"The issue is a much stronger commitment to oppose racism.\" Marsha Gillis of Texas posted: \"If you want to keep these words in the [word list] because one of them might someday be the best play available to you, you need to drop everything and check your privilege.\"\n\nBut the mention of privilege-reckoning with whether competitive Scrabble players' \"unquestioning acceptance of the worst of the worst ethnic slurs in our book comes from a position of privilege,\" as a top player, Chris Lipe of St. Louis, said-led others to ask who exactly was displaying it. \"You as a white person don't get to decide what should be a word,\" one expert-level player wrote in response to a comment. \"I as a white person don't get to decide what should be a word.\" Another player said that deleting words as a show of tolerance might itself be patronizing. \"Speaking as a person of colour,\" he wrote, \"it actually bothers me that some people seem to be thinking of this expurgation as a 'magnanimous' gesture.\"\n\nThe pool of people commenting on the proposal was self-selecting-the 377 players who belong to a closed Facebook group and approach the game as obsessive insiders. And while the sample size was small, players in the threads from marginalized groups supported leaving the slurs in. One black player, Art Moore of Florida, who has directed Scrabble's annual national championship tournament, said he wouldn't be fazed by an opponent \"playing the anagram of GINGER.\" He argued, by way of analogy, that \"the Confederate flag in a museum to instruct about the past means nothing,\" whereas \"waving the same flag at a BLM protest is something entirely different. Leave the strings of letters alone.\"\n\nMarlon Hill, a black expert from Baltimore, wrote in one thread that \"it would be patently absurd to pretend such n such letter string does not EXIST.\" In another, he said that \"yall NEED to STOP PRETENDING/IMAGINING things will get better wif da elimination of a single word-or a THOUSAND words-from da dictionary, a Scrabble lexicon, or even da fuckin language.\"\n\nJason Idalski of Michigan, who is a member of the Scrabble's group's advisory board, told me on the phone, \"I'm openly gay. It doesn't matter when an opponent plays FAG or FAGGOT. It does irk me that people are telling me you should be mad when people do this.\" A player from Connecticut named Benjamin Bloom, who has cerebral palsy, said he wouldn't be offended if someone played SPAZ against him. \"The spoken word can be offensive,\" he told me, but \"a random string of tiles on a 15-by-15 Scrabble board should never offend anyone.\"\n\nAs a practical matter, apart from a few short words, offensive terms get played infrequently, and are noticed by the public even more rarely. But it happens. In 2010, an Ohio newspaper apologized for printing a photo of a board from a tournament that included the word JEWED. (A local synagogue saw the photo and complained; a NASPA spokesperson explained that competitive players \"consider these terms 'playing pieces' rather than hate speech and don't want them taken out of competition,\" the paper wrote.) When ESPN covered the North American championship for a few years in the 2000s, the rules were bent to avoid obscenities showing up on camera. The two players meeting in the finals were told not to play offensive words. When LEZ was played inadvertently one year, the game was paused and a do-over ordered.\n\nTournament Scrabble players like those in the NASPA discussion typically make a conscious choice to overlook definitions during the course of a game. This might be a semantic feint, but it reflects how linguists, lexicographers, and wordplay lovers often treat words: as discrete objects to be probed and analyzed both for the meanings humans ascribe to them as well as the properties reflected in their structure and composition-including their strategic value on a playing board.\n\nBanning words from Scrabble didn't make them disappear from the language when Hasbro cleansed the OSPD 26 years ago, some players argued in the Facebook threads, and it wouldn't now. Some said that if the slurs are removed, they could receive more attention by virtue of their absence than in their continued presence. \"I can't help reminding all that in The Handmaid's Tale Scrabble was used to represent the last refuge of liberty of the human mind and the spirit of rebellion against tyranny,\" Joel Sherman, a two-time North American champion, wrote. \"We should endeavor to protect not the sensitive ears, but the words, of all meanings and connotations.\"\n\nIn his proposal, Chew noted his mixed ethnicity and said that when he joined a Scrabble club in diverse Toronto in 1993, he was struck by the way players \"could ignore their differences on every social axis when absorbed in playing a board game.\" But, he wrote, \"I am increasingly aware ... that no matter how little meaning matters to us when anagramming FORETOP , GINGER , or SOH , it tells others that if they cannot distance themselves from those meanings, we neither value their stories nor welcome them into our community.\"\n\nI've been playing and writing about tournament Scrabble for more than 20 years, and I have no trouble distancing myself from those meanings. I'm also a straight white man, and deeply immersed in the game. Players attending a club for the first time-or someone reading this article who doesn't play at all-might not feel the same way. Inside Scrabble, even to some players of color, permitting slurs can feel no different than accepting that ZA is perfectly legit or that OK now meets the criteria for entry. Outside Scrabble, the view can be understandably less nuanced.\n\nIn the Facebook group, Paul Epstein of Michigan, an expert player who has competed in tournaments for nearly 40 years, proposed a compromise that appealed to many: Keep the slurs-but with a warning. At every tournament, and before any game that might wind up before the public, organizers would declare that some offensive words might be played, but that they are \"assumed as unintended to be construed within the context of their problematic usages.\" In other words, acknowledge the cold reality that language isn't ever neutral or benign, even in a seemingly innocuous game, while letting players exploit every available string of letters.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Turning Point: Black Lives Matter organizers say right-wing backlash was expected as movement grew\n\nAndrew Young says civil rights protesters endured similar attacks.\n\nThis report is part of \"Turning Point,\" a groundbreaking series by ABC News examining the racial reckoning sweeping the United States and exploring whether it can lead to lasting reconciliation.\n\nDuring a Black Lives Matter march in late May, Nia Miranda says she decided to take a stand when she saw something that marred what she described as \"a beautiful protest.\"\n\nMiranda said she spotted two women, both apparently white and dressed in black, tagging the exterior of a Starbucks at The Grove mall in Beverly Hills. The 30-year-old filmmaker and actress said she started recording video on her cell phone and approached the pair, who were spray painting the letters \"BLM\" on the front of the store.\n\n\"I remember looking around and realizing what they were doing and that no one else was saying anything. I had to capture it and confront them at the same time,\" Miranda told ABC News. \"I knew that I had to say something because if the news would have reported the vandalism without seeing who did it, I know who they would have said committed that crime: It would have went on Black people and it would have been told that the protesters became rioters and it became looting, and that wasn't the case at all.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said the mostly-peaceful protest on May 30 in Beverly Hills devolved into multiple incidents of vandalism and looting of stores at The Grove, on ritzy Rodeo Drive and elsewhere in the city, leading to 500 arrests. It was unclear if the women Miranda confronted were among those arrested.\n\nMiranda's video instantly went viral and inspired Grammy-winning music producer Skrillex to write a song \"Sullen Sunday\" featuring the raw words of Miranda: \"When they see the vandalism on these places, know that it wasn't us. And when you see stuff like that you're supposed to stand up and say something.\"\n\nAs support across the country has skyrocketed for the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, so too, has a backlash against the group -- fueled by months of protests that have, at times, descended into violence and destruction, often instigated by those unaffiliated with the movement.\n\nSome law enforcement officials said the emergence of an anti-police atmosphere has led to low morale and a drop in enforcement. In addition, BLM's detractors have gone to great lengths to conflate the violence, looting and general rise in crime that have appeared in some cities in recent months with the push for equal rights and police reform.\n\nBLM organizers say they are currently enduring a smear campaign that is being ratcheted up in the waning days of the presidential election, with lawmakers, including President Donald Trump , branding BLM protesters as \"terrorists,\" \"Marxists\" and \"left-wing radicals\" bent on destroying the country.\n\nTrump's surrogates such as Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have all issued statements or Tweets slamming BLM as a radical Marxist movement out to destroy the country. Giuliani told reporters at the White House in August, that \"Black Lives Matter has been planning to destroy the police for three years.\"\n\nIn a more measured response, U.S. Attorney General William Barr released a statement on May 30 that attempted to separate the rioters from the peaceful protesters. \"With the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements,\" Barr said, adding that \"groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda.''\n\nMelina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles and part of the movement's global leadership, told ABC News the backlash was expected.\n\n\"We understand what they're doing. We understand that they understand that Black Lives Matter has now been recognized as the largest social movement in global history and that scares people,\" Abdullah said. \"That scares folks who are invested in making the world more racist, not less and making the world oppressive not less and folks who are tethered to a system of policing that's oppressive and brutal and violent.\"\n\nSpeaking at the National Archives Museum in Washington on Sept. 17, Trump, who has been portraying himself as a law-and-order candidate in his re-election bid, took aim at what he called the \"radical movement\" behind nationwide protests over police disproportionately violating the rights of Black people.\n\n\"Left-wing mobs have torn down statues of our founders, desecrated our memorials and carried out a campaign of violence and anarchy,\" Trump said without specifically naming BLM. \"Whether it is the mob on the street or the cancel culture in the boardroom, the goal is the same: to silence dissent, to scare you out of speaking the truth, and to bully Americans into abandoning their values, their heritage and their very way of life.\"\n\nEight days later at his campaign's Black Economic Empowerment conference in Atlanta, where he presented his so-called \"platinum plan\" for the Black community, Trump ramped up his attacks, zeroing in on BLM.\n\n\"It's really hurting the Black community,\" Trump said in a speech. \"This is an unusual name for an organization whose ideology and tactics are right now destroying many Black lives.\"\n\nTrump claimed Black Lives Matter wants to \"achieve the destruction of the nuclear family.\"\n\n\"This is not the agenda of the Black community. This is the agenda of an extreme socialist or worse, you know what the other word is -- Marxist, communist -- this is the extreme socialist left, but beyond that in my opinion,\" Trump said.\n\nWhile organizers of BLM, which is a decentralized movement made up of more than 150 different groups, did not specifically respond, Trump's allegation appear to have been taken out of context from a \"what we believe\" statement on the Black Lives Matter Global Network's website, which reads, \"We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement\" by supporting and caring for one another as \"extended families.\" The statement has since been taken down from the website.\n\nIn August, the faculty and staff of the Southern Evangelical Seminary and Bible College in Matthews, North Carolina, released a public statement about \"current issues related to racism and social justice,\" echoing Trump's views on BLM. The statement said the school and other evangelical groups \"have grave, fundamental disagreements with their (BLM's) moral, cultural, and political agenda.\"\n\n\"Consequently, SES cannot mouth the mantra 'black lives matter' lest we be misinterpreted as supporting their godless agenda,\" the statement reads.\n\nIn a broadcast of \"The 700 Club\" in September, televangelist Pat Robertson of Christian Broadcasting Network also bashed BLM, saying, \"They're talking about destroying essentially Christianity... And all the way through, they want to upend the capitalist structure and destroy America.\"\n\nBLM Global Network Executive Director Patrisse Cullors responded in a statement, calling Robertson's comments \"completely inflammatory and dangerous.\"\n\nIn August, U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., wrote a letter to the Women's National Basketball Association objecting to the league's plans to honor the BLM movement. Loeffler, co-owner of the WNBA franchise the Atlanta Dream, warned that subscribing to a \"particular political agenda undermines the potential of the sport and sends a message of exclusion.\"\n\nAs thousands of mostly-peaceful protests organized by BLM have occurred across the country in recent months over a string of police-involved killings of Black people, the movement has been blamed for vandalism, looting and assaults against police officers during confrontations that have accompanied some of the demonstrations.\n\nProtests in cities including Portland, Oregon; Seattle; Atlanta; New York; Los Angeles; and Chicago have, at times, been declared riots by police as agitators have looted, committed arson and other crimes, reflecting badly on the entire BLM movement and providing critics fodder in their condemnation of the social justice group.\n\nIn May, two lawyers, who claim to have no affiliation with BLM, were arrested in Brooklyn, New York, on federal charges after being caught on surveillance video allegedly hurling Molotov cocktails at occupied police vehicles during a protest. They have both pleaded not guilty to federal charges of arson, conspiracy, use of a destructive device and use of explosives during a crime of violence.\n\nIn September, police in Santa Monica, California, thwarted what they said appeared to be a coordinated looting spree being perpetrated by non-protesters using a demonstration as cover.\n\nIn June, New York City police alleged that gang members and \"opportunist action by regular criminals\" were responsible for looting stores in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan during a protest. Also in June, Philadelphia police said criminals used BLM protests as camouflage for a crime rampage in which they allegedly blew up and emptied multiple ATMs in a single night.\n\nIn St. Louis, a 24-year-old convicted felon was arrested and charged with murder in the June 2 killing of retired St. Louis police Capt. David Dorn , who was gunned down after interrupting a group of people looting his friend's pawn shop during a protest. While police released no evidence tying suspect Stephan Cannon to the protests, Dorn's widow linked her husband's death to the demonstrations in a speech at the Republican National Convention in August.\n\n\"Violence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest,\" Ann Dorn, a St. Louis police officer, said in her speech. \"They do not safeguard Black lives. They only destroy them.\"\n\nMark and Patricia McCloskey, a white couple from St. Louis, made national news in June when they were caught on cell-phone video pointing a semiautomatic rifle and a handgun at BLM protesters marching past their mansion in a gated community. The couple, who claimed they feared imminent harm, pleaded not guilty to felony charges of unlawful use of a weapon and tampering with evidence.\n\nThe McCloskey's initially released a statement through their attorney saying they supported the BLM movement and touted a \"long-standing commitment to protecting the civil rights of clients victimized at the hands of law enforcement.\" But after President Trump contacted them directly, the McCloskeys seemed to have a change of heart about the movement.\n\n\"These radicals are not content with marching in the streets. They want to walk the halls of Congress, they want to take over, they want power,\" Mark McCloskey said in a joint speech he and his wife gave at the RNC Convention. \"This is Joe Biden's party. These are the people who will be in charge of your future and the future of your children.\"\n\nPatricia McCloskey added, \"They're not satisfied with spreading the chaos and violence into our communities. They want to abolish the suburbs altogether by ending single-family home zoning.\"\n\nAbdullah, who is also a professor of Pan-African studies at California State University, Los Angeles, suspects it is more than a coincidence that the attacks against BLM have grown as the movement's popularity has widened and its activities have included a massive push to get people to vote in the November Election.\n\n\"I think that it would be really naive of us to think that we were going to have a goal of upending an oppressive state without experiencing some of that oppression,\" Abdullah told ABC News. \"You can't say the system of policing is fundamentally unjust, that we want to reimagine and transform public safety without that system of policing kind of doubling down and entrenching itself and doing what it's done since the creation of the system. It targets the people, it targets the groups that attempt to transform the world.\"\n\nThe BLM movement was launched in 2013 following the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the white neighborhood watch member, in the fatal 2012 shooting of Black teenager Trayvon Martin, who Zimmerman mistook for a prowler.\n\nIn July, an ABC News/Washington Post poll showed that 63% of Americans supported the BLM movement and 69% agreed that Black people and other minorities are denied equal treatment in the criminal justice system.\n\nAlong political party lines, support for BLM varies widely. The poll found that while 92% of Democrats, including 91% of white Democrats, support the movement, 28% of Republicans and 62% of independents feel the same. By ideology, support for BLM ranges from 93% of liberals to 70% of moderates and 34% of conservatives.\n\nBut the BLM backlash appears to be eroding the popularity the movement spawned over the spring and early summer.\n\nA poll released by the Pew Research Center in mid-September, showed 55% of U.S. adults express at least some support for BLM, down from 67% in June. The poll showed that 29% strongly support the movement, down from 38% three months earlier.\n\nAndrew Young, former mayor of Atlanta and ambassador to the United Nations, told ABC News that similar attacks were waged against the civil rights movement in the 1960s.\n\n\"We were always being called communists. There was a serious backlash. Martin Luther King's picture was up on billboards all over the South,\" said the 88-year-old Young, who was part of King's inner circle and was with the civil rights icon when he was assassinated on the balcony of the Lorrain Motel in Memphis on April 4, 1968.\n\nHe said that when he first ran for Congress in Atlanta in 1970 and lost, two years after King's death, he was subjected to racist attacks.\n\n\"One of the campaigns against me was that if Andrew Young is elected, the Black Panthers are going to get your daughter,\" Young, who ran again Congress in 1973 and won, told ABC News.\n\nYoung said that during the civil rights marches in the South \"agent provocateurs\" were hired by white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan, and sometimes the police, to disrupt the peaceful protests by creating havoc.\n\n\"People paid kids to disrupt the marches and to break windows. And once you get a few people starting something it gets out of hand,\" Young said.\n\n\"I'm not saying that the police are responsible for the violence now, but neither was Black Lives Matter,\" he said.\n\nHe said that over the summer he attended a BLM protest in Atlanta and saw for himself how quickly a group of agitators turned a peaceful protest into a violent one.\n\n\"There was a massive movement of Black and brown and white people together that were marching peacefully in Atlanta. And then I saw some kids ... some of them were dressed in black. They were on skateboards and they came behind the Black Lives Matter movement, moving in the opposite direction, but they went through a row of police cars and they smashed in all the windows.\n\n\"Now those were two distinct groups of people and I think what the president is doing is trying to bring it all together and make it one movement,\" Young added.\n\nAbdullah alleges that the words of President Trump and his allies against BLM have prompted violence against her and other organizers of the movement.\n\nIn August, Abdullah, a single mother of three, was the target of a \"swatting incident,\" in which a police SWAT team was sent to her home after a 911 dispatcher took a call from a man who claimed he was holding people hostage at her home and demanded $1 million in ransom. She said she obtained a copy of the 911 call and that the caller, who was never identified, made derogatory comments about BLM.\n\n\"Police arrived at my house with assault rifles, a helicopter was overhead. They pointed the assault rifles in the window at me,\" Abdullah said. \"It terrorized us and deeply, deeply traumatized my children.\"\n\nShe said that following the swatting incident, death threats against her increased.\n\n\"It's important to remember that the backlash is not just about words and narrative, it's about threatening actual lives,\" Abdullah told ABC News.\n\nSeveral protesters across the country have been severely injured by people who deliberately drove their vehicles into the middle of demonstrations.\n\nOn Aug. 25, Kyle Rittenhouse, a white teenager, allegedly shot and killed two protesters during a demonstration in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rittenhouse, of Illinois, and other armed men claimed they went to Kenosha to help police keep the peace after an officer shot and paralyzed a Black man named Jacob Blake.\n\nRittenhouse, who is fighting extradition from Illinois back to Wisconsin to face charges, has yet to enter a plea.\n\nDespite the attacks, protesters like Nia Miranda say they have pledged not to stop fighting for justice. She said she sees the Black Lives Matter movement at a turning point and with help from thousands of white supporters has come within reach of its goal of achieving significant change in policing in America.\n\n\"Before this moment happened, I used to think that it was just Black people who were fighting this fight,\" Miranda told ABC News. \"But after this specific moment and being on social media and marching myself, and seeing how many different people of different races, different religions, different tax brackets were out there all for the cause of fighting against injustice, I know this time we're going to have a successful ending. Even if it takes some time, I'm OK with that.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Republicans had a rough night on Tuesday. Does that spell trouble for Ron DeSantis?\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nIn Jacksonville, the GOPâs candidate for mayor warned that Democrat Donna Deegan would start âdefunding the policeâ and âplacing radical activists in chargeâ of law enforcement. In Colorado Springs, Republican Wayne Williams claimed that his opponent would ruin the city with âsocialism.â And in Kentucky, Kelly Craft ran for governor on promises to execute drug dealers and âdismantleâ the state Department of Education.\n\nDeegan won, Williams lost, and Craft slumped into third place in Tuesdayâs GOP primary. In each race, tactics that paid off for Republicans in 2021 didnât have the same impact. Donald Trump immediately branded them as defeats for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, declaring his âmagic is gone,â after endorsing both Craft and defeated Jacksonville mayoral candidate Daniel Davis.\n\nFor once, Democrats agreed with Trump. In Jacksonville, where Davis out-spent Deegan better than 3-1, their candidate â a popular former TV anchor and the head of a breast cancer foundation â promised to âput more [police] officers on the streetsâ and reminded voters that crime had surged under Republican Mayor Lenny Curry. Davis, they said, ran too far to the right in a city Trump lost twice, and helped other Democrats win down-ballot.\n\nâWe just finished one of the most controversial legislative sessions in Tallahassee,â said Nikki Fried, the new chair of the success-starved Florida Democratic Party. âThat was fresh in peopleâs minds. It all backfired on them, and gave permission for Republicans and independents to cross over, to support Democrats.â\n\nThe GOP loss in Colorado Springs was more complicated: Mayor-elect Yemi Mobolade ran as an independent entrepreneur, not a Democrat. But like Deegan, he picked up some Republican endorsements and prevailed against a campaign that tried to drive up conservative turnout with warnings about crime and racial âequity.â\n\nAdd it all up and the picture looked concerning for Republicans looking to move on from Trump, but build off his culture war appeal. The default message Republicans had settled on in his absence âÂ much of it embodied by DeSantis and his âwar on woke,â and some of it delivered by consultants integral to his own expected run â again failed to win converts this week. That could spell trouble for a general election, but also for DeSantisâ electability argument in a primary against Trump.\n\nIn this article:\n\nTrumpâs never ending search for an angle to use against his opponents helped make Tuesday about DeSantis in the press. Thatâs a little too easy.\n\nFloridaâs governor endorsed Craft with full knowledge of the public polling, as a favor to two friends who happen to be deep-pocketed donors, according to a person familiar with the decision. And Davis lost in Jacksonville with the strategic advice of Susie Wiles, a senior Trump advisor ever since DeSantis exiled her. A victory would have been spun as a Trump-aligned rescue mission; defeat, predictably, was blamed on the governor whoâs about to run against him.\n\nRepublicans in Kentucky also credited Craftâs defeat to a few different factors that may be less applicable to DeSantis. Attorney Gen. Daniel Cameron was popular in his own right, earning what GOP strategist Scott Jennings called âa deep and abiding affectionâ from conservatives for refusing to charge police officers in the killing of an unarmed Black woman, Breonna Taylor, in a no-knock raid on her apartment, then facing protests outside his private home.\n\nCameron had Trumpâs endorsement, a particular problem for Craft, whoâd worked in the administration. But he was also closely associated with Mitch McConnell, the dominant power broker in the state and the type of institutional Republican who DeSantis is counting on to help back a run against Trump. There were also candidate issues: Craft dodged public forums to the extent that even a promising Fox News interview foundered on questions about why she wouldnât face Cameron in person.\n\nHer paid messaging, much of it developed by Axiom Strategies, the firm behind the pro-DeSantis Never Back Down PAC, couldnât fix that. A super PAC ad hit Cameron for once supporting cashless bail , while her own campaign warned that the attorney general wouldnât take on the woke left like she would.\n\nâKelly Craftâs consultants let her down,â said T. J. Litafik, an unaffiliated Kentucky GOP strategist. âIt ended up looking contrived, and her messaging was uneven. For all that money, she deserved a better campaign.â\n\nStill, the less complicated, less personalized lesson from Tuesday was that some popular post-Trump GOP messaging may not be as effective as it was in 2021, or even last year.\n\nThe Florida GOP, with more resources and a better turnout operation, made the Jacksonville race close, but Davis lost because Democrats persuaded more non-affiliated and Republican voters to cross over. The relentless GOP effort to label her support for Black Lives Matter as a defund-the-police code felt labored and stale, especially in a GOP-run city where violent crime was out-pacing New York on a per capita basis. Democrats around the country are growing more confident, post-midterms, that they can rebut these appeals with ads showcasing support from sheriffs and police chiefs and clear candidate promises to boost police resources.\n\nâI believe it is both possible and necessary to support our law enforcement while demanding racial justice,â Deegan told Semafor. âEveryone was horrified by the murder of George Floyd, and I marched in BLM protests alongside other community leaders, like Mayor Lenny Curry, and our Sheriff to show solidarity for the innocent lives that are lost every day due to racial violence.â\n\nKentucky was another story â an all-GOP electorate and a front-runner whose conservative credentials were never effectively challenged. Craft wasnât the first wealthy candidate to pay consultants for a populist can-she-really-say-that campaign and then lose to a conservative who voters trusted more. But voters arenât as reactive to this message this time.\n\nRepublicans did pick up the mayoralty of Panama City on Tuesday, and argued that Democrats had ideal conditions for a win in Jacksonville that may not be present elsewhere. Speaking with Politico , FLGOP chairman Christian Ziegler bemoaned the partyâs âhuge bloody primaryâ in the mayoral race âwhere millions of dollars were spent to rip apart the eventual Republican nominee.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Fact check: Meme inaccurately portrays police action at New York BLM protest\n\nSince the Capitol attack Jan. 6, many Americans highlighted anti-racism protests in 2020 to question whether there is a double standard in the way police responded to  demonstrators . One such meme zeroes in on police treatment of a Capitol trespasser compared with Martin Gugino, an anti-racism demonstrator.\n\n\"Watching police holding the hands of an elderly Trump terrorist helping guide her down the stairs of the Capitol one at time and remembering footage of the old man bystander who had his head kicked in by police at BLM protest,\" reads the meme The Other 98% shared and later removed .\n\nThe meme includes side-by-side images of police escorting a woman down the Capitol steps during the riot and Gugino lying injured on the pavement after police shoved him at an anti-racism protest in June. The meme attributes the statement to Twitter user Carly Kimmel.\n\nFact check: Image of 'Simpsons' character doctored to mimic Capitol riot participant\n\nThe Other 98% removed the meme, and its executive director and co-founder, John Sellers, responded to USA TODAY in an email:\n\n\"Of course you are correct that police didn't literally kick his head in (which is a figure of speech). If they had kicked his head in he would be dead now,\" Sellers wrote. \"What police actually did is push him down, fracture his skull, and then offer him zero assistance as they marched by him in lock step.\"\n\nThe meme is still circulating on other social media accounts.\n\nKimmel tweeted the message Jan. 6. Her tweet went viral, receiving nearly 50,000 retweets, more than 900 quote tweets and more than 200,000 likes.\n\nKimmel did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nFact check: Video shows Trump family in tent before rally Jan. 6\n\nDuring the Capitol riot, a police officer helped a woman in a Trump hat down the Capitol steps. The officer, dressed in riot gear, held a shield in one hand and the woman's hand in another. It is unclear why the officer escorted her.\n\nAtlanta NBC-affiliate television station WXIA-TV posted to YouTube a video of the incident filmed from another angle.\n\nSocial media users , including comedian Leslie Jones , posted home videos of a TVshowing coverage of the incident.\n\nThe identities of the officer and woman involved are unknown.\n\nUSA TODAY could find no evidence that police aided other demonstrators down the stairs.\n\nFact check: False claim about pardons for those involved in Capitol riot\n\nA 75-year-old Amherst, New York, resident became an unexpected focal point of the 2020 protest movement against police brutality. At an anti-racism protest in Buffalo on June 4, Gugino approached a line of police in riot gear and was pushed to the ground by an officer . Blood pooled under his head as he lay on the pavement. \"He's bleeding out of his ear,\" a police officer said. Bystanders' videos of the incident went viral soon after.\n\nBystanders told the Democrat and Chronicle, a USA TODAY Network newspaper in Rochester, New York, that police called for medical help, which arrived within minutes.\n\nGugino spent a month in a hospital recovering from a brain injury and fractured skull.\n\nThe two officers responsible, Robert McCabe and Aaron Torgalski, were suspended without pay and charged with assault.\n\nPolice didn't kick Gugino in the head as the meme claims.\n\nWe rate the claim that police guided trespassing Trump supporters down the Capitol stairs and \"kicked in\" the head of an elderly activist as PARTLY FALSE because much, but not all, of the claim is supported by our research. It is true that media coverage shows a police officer helped a pro-Trump demonstrator down the steps of the Capitol on Jan. 6. And officers in Buffalo, New York, were charged with assault after shoving an elderly anti-racism protester, causing a head injury June 4.. But it is false to describe what happened to Martin Gugino at a Black Lives Matter protest as having \"his head kicked in by police.\"\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

I had a lot to learn.\"\n\nRating:\n\nFor years, an image supposedly taken at a Black Lives Matter (BLM) protest that showed a white man in a wheelchair with a sign reading, \"I'm sorry I'm late. I had a lot to learn\" has spread online.\n\nIn February 2025, the image was widely posted across Reddit . We also found posts that included it on Threads .\n\nMan owns to his past mistakes and changes for the good. by u/starlight_collector in pics\n\nMany social media users who shared the image commented that they wished more people were able to publicly change their mind on opinions they once held. At least one user who commented on the posts was suspicious of the image and hoped it was real.\n\nWe first fact-checked this claim in 2020, when we found the photo authentically showed a demonstrator at a BLM protest against racial injustice in Bethel, Ohio. (We identified him in the fact check as Ryan D. \"Wheelz,\" which we reported was a nickname given to him by his friends.)\n\nWhen we looked into this photo again in 2025, we found the man's Facebook account - along with posts he had made giving further information about the image and why he had shown up at the protest - appeared to have since been deleted. We'll update this story if any further information about the photo or the man in it emerges.\n\nWhen we originally looked into the claim, the man confirmed to us that he was the person in the photo and shared a second image of himself as proof:\n\nHe told us:\n\nI hope that the photo lets people of color know that despite popular stereotypes, they have the love and support of many people in rural communities. I also hope it lets people know that it's OK to change your opinion when you're presented with new evidence that clearly shows you were wrong. I used to be in the \"all lives matter\" camp, which they all do but when individuals say black lives matter, it doesn't mean only black lives matter. When you examine the evidence it's very clear that this civil rights movement welcomes and advocates for people of many different backgrounds.\n\nThe man also said he had experienced some harassment regarding the photo, but that he found supporting the protest to be bigger than himself and worth the abuse he had dealt with.\n\nThe protest that the man was attending in Bethel made national news in June 2020. Several reputable publications including The Guardian , The Washington Post and USA Today reported that hundreds of armed counter-protesters confronted around 80 people in the small Ohio town who had gathered to support the BLM movement.\n\nAt the time, the man told us that he hoped the image gave some evidence to BLM activists that they had support in rural communities.\n\nSnopes archives contributed to this report.\n\nEvon, Dan. \"Is This 'I'm Sorry I'm Late.

Take for example, Sgt. Dana Martillo who was caught donning a pro-Trump badge at a BLM protest, mocking demonstrators. Her actions landed her with a suspension, per the NY Daily News . However, some officers still get away with their nonsense.\n\nThe heightened awareness of police brutality and movement to protect Black lives have been a driving force behind police accountability. Though, what accountability looks like certainly depends on the situation . If a cop kills someone, the people demand criminal charges . In Martillo's case, she was caught wearing a Punisher logo and \"Trump 2020/ Make Enforcement Great Again \" patches at a Feb. 2021 BLM protest in downtown Brooklyn.\n\nRead more\n\nAside from Halle Bailey, Here Are Other Black Disney Actors and Characters We Love\n\nBest Streaming Service for your Black Dollar in October\n\nShe even asked a superior officer beforehand if she'd get in trouble and was told to keep her jacket zipped so the patches wouldn't show. She testified at the hearing that she was told no such thing.\n\n\"I have to brush up on my First Amendment rights. I didn't know I was so photogenic,\" Martillo said at the protest, per her department trial in May.\n\nRead more about the trial from the NYPD 's report:\n\nThe presumptive penalty for failure to comply with a lawful order is 20 penalty days; the mitigated penalty is 15 days, and the aggravated penalty is 30 days.\n\nRespondent engaged in a knowing, deliberate display of disobedience when she chose to wear the two patches on her ballistic vest and then reveal them while on-duty after having been told to conceal them. She compounded this disobedience by wearing the patches when she supervised police officers at a demonstration. Respondent treated the protesters with the same contempt she showed for Department regulations when she engaged in snarky banter with them that was completely unrelated to, and not in furtherance of, her duties as a Member of Service, let alone as a supervisor. Even when allowed to express some regret for her poor decision making, Respondent was defiant. Respondent's supervisor gave her an opportunity to remedy the violation; she complied temporarily and then defied the order by allowing the patches to be displayed.\n\nAlas, NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell signed off on a measly 10-day suspension and forfeit 30 vacation days. It wasn't like Martillo was going to be sentenced to prison for being a bigot. But the fact she was ordered some form of punishment can set an example.\n\nThough the discipline for officers often looks like a slap on the wrist , it seems now many jurisdictions who haven't considered accountability before are forming offices specifically for it. Prince George's County, Md., Cleveland, Berkley, Ca. and more have formed police accountability boards to monitor misconduct.\n\nMaybe the more cops are held accountable, it will normalize picking out the bad apples before they spoil the department. That is if the department isn't already spoiled.\n\nMore from The Root\n\nEven More Beloved Black Banned Books You Must Read Now [UPDATED]\n\n15 Priceless Black Twitter Moments Worth Remembering\n\nSign up for The Root's Newsletter.

Col. Christopher Kasker said Saturday. It's unclear how long the inquiry will take and too soon to say what consequences it could have for the cadets, who are poised to graduate May 21.\n\nBy campus tradition, groups of cadets often take pictures in traditional dress uniforms to echo historical portraits of their cadets.

Gov. Dan Patrick in an interview on Fox News on Friday. He added that the protesters were \"hypocrites\" for expecting protection from police after shots were fired.\n\nThat same day, Texas state Rep. Bill Zedler (R) expressed similar sentiments in a tweet, writing, \"Clearly the rhetoric of Black Lives Matter encouraged the sniper that shot Dallas police officers.\"\n\nBLM leaders responded to the criticism in a press release, arguing that \"to assign the actions of one person to an entire movement is dangerous and irresponsible.\"\n\n\"There are some who would use the events to stifle a movement for change and quicken the demise of a vibrant discourse on the human rights of Black Americans,\" the statement said. \"We should reject all of this.\"\n\nIn cities around the country, from Atlanta to St. Paul, Minn., to Washington D.C., BLM activists returned to the streets on Friday and Saturday to continue mourning the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, the black men killed by police in Louisiana and Minnesota on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.\n\nThe flames were fanned further Saturday night when prominent BLM activist DeRay McKesson was arrested by police at a protest in Baton Rouge, prompting thousands of outraged tweets with the hashtag #FreeDeRay.\n\n\"[The shooting] is not going to stop our movement,\" Dominique Alexander, a leader of the Next Generation Action Network and an organizer of the Dallas protest, told reporters on Saturday. \"In fact, we want it to strengthen it .\"\n\nHowever, BLM leaders say, the tragedy in Dallas has presented new challenges for the movement.\n\nThe shootings \"make it harder for us to continue on in doing the work of police accountability because it makes the narrative more complicated,\" Judith A. Browne Dianis, civil rights lawyer and co-director of the Advancement Project, told The Washington Post. \"And in some ways it felt like the pain that we have felt [for the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile] was swept under the rug.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nIn the days following the shooting, groups of activists in the BLM community have held meetings across Dallas to come to grips with what happened and how to move forward. Next Generation Action Network, the group that organized the fatal rally Thursday, is set to hold such an event Sunday evening.\n\n\"This is definitely a time that we come together and have an open dialogue,\" said Next Generation Action Network leader Dominique Torres at a meeting in Dallas on Friday, as reported by Time. \"There is definite mistrust, significant mistrust within the African-American community. It's time for community leaders, pastors, elected officials and police to sit down at the table and be candid, have a conversation about what changes need to be effected.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Col. Christopher Kasker said Saturday. It's unclear how long the inquiry will take and too soon to say what consequences it could have for the cadets, who are poised to graduate May 21.\n\nBy campus tradition, groups of cadets often take pictures in traditional dress uniforms to echo historical portraits of their cadets. Indeed, a different picture of the same women, without the raised fists, was tweeted out by the chairwoman of the academy's Board of Visitors, 1980 graduate Brenda Sue Fulton.\n\nBut the fists-up image, which circulated online, led some observers to question whether the women were expressing support for the Black Lives Matter movement, which grew out of protests over police killings of unarmed black men.\n\nThe Army Times , which first wrote about the photo Thursday, said several readers had written in to say they believed the cadets were breaching a Defense Department policy that says \"members on active duty should not engage in partisan political activity,\" with exceptions for voting and certain other things.\n\nBut Mary Tobin, a West Point graduate and mentor who knows the students, said they were simply celebrating their forthcoming graduation as a shared accomplishment, like a sports team raising helmets after a win.\n\n\"It was a sign of unity,\" Tobin, a 2003 graduate, said by phone. \"They weren't trying to imply any allegiance to any movement.\"\n\nThe raised fist has served as a symbol of power and resistance for various political movements and causes.

      "text": "After a Violent Summer, Black Lives Matter Doesn't Deserve a Nobel Prize | Opinion\n\nAdvocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nAmerican cities burned, businesses were looted and innocent civilians were beaten and murdered. Summer 2020 was like no other thanks to the Black Lives Matter movement, which inspired radical activists to take to the streets in the name of fighting police brutality and injustice.\n\nDespite that historic civil unrest, the BLM movement somehow earned a nomination for a Nobel peace prize.\n\nWhile the BLM movement didn't intend to lay siege to cities and create incalculable tragedy for people and businesses, that's exactly what it did. The nation's most extreme activists felt called by the movement to literally fight and riot. That's decidedly unpeaceful and it shouldn't be ignored for a feel-good nomination.\n\nSo how does the movement earn a peace prize nomination?\n\nPetter Eide, a Norwegian member of parliament, made the nomination. He told The Guardian that he credits BLM for its \"tremendous achievement in raising global awareness and consciousness about racial injustice.\"\n\nIt certainly raised awareness for its cause, though the messages adopted unmistakably controversial positions. They perverted what could have been a peaceful movement based on a message most anyone could get behind. There is little doubt that black lives matter-that's not in dispute, no matter what race-baiting politicians may claim. But the BLM movement did so much more than ask for equality.\n\nThe movement has been mired in anti-police rhetoric, attracting Antifa criminals and Marxist radicals. They weren't merely calling for police reform; many were seeking its abolition. And to get their way, they were willing to burn down a police station in Minneapolis, illegally occupy a police precinct in Seattle, go to war with police in Portland and coordinate a vicious attack on police in Chicago.\n\nIn all these cities and others, police routinely came under physical assault by BLM adherents.\n\nSeveral NYPD officers were assaulted in New York City on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. After several hundred protesters crossed the Brooklyn bridge peacefully, the march turned violent in Manhattan when the crowd refused to stop blocking the streets. Scuffles broke out, a captain was hit in the head with a bottle and 10 officers were injured.\n\nIn Seattle, a hotbed of criminal activism, Antifa and other radicals tried to burn officers alive inside a police precinct. Activists used quick-dry cement to seal the main entrance to the building, while others tried to set the station on fire. Thankfully, it wasn't successful. The U.S. attorney for western Washington identified and charged one man with conspiracy to commit arson. Desmond David-Pitts, 20, pled guilty and now faces up to five years in prison.\n\nThe movement didn't only target cops. There was a rash of incidents of BLM marchers harassing and bullying strangers trying to go about their day.\n\nA mob of BLM protesters swarmed one woman at a restaurant in D.C. They angrily demanded she raise her fist in solidarity, while chanting, \"White silence is violence!\"\n\nIn a similar incident in Pittsburgh, a man harassed diners, stole a beer from an elderly couple and shouted obscenities towards white people, and three agitators were charged for harassment.\n\nMeanwhile, near Kansas City, homeowners say they were harassed and faced intimidation tactics when they asked a rowdy BLM protest to leave their neighborhood. They say they faced doxxing and a suspicious truck stalking the neighborhood. They even claim they were followed.\n\nIn Seattle, BLM marchers targeted white homeowners for harassment , demanding they leave their homes and pay reparations. Other neighborhoods are simply taunted by the BLM mobs to get \"Out of your homes and into the streets!\"\n\nSome unscrupulous media members and politicians claimed the movement was \"mostly peaceful\" even as buildings burned behind their live reporting. To help amplify such claims, the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) released a study showing 93 percent of the 10,600 BLM protests they tracked were, in fact, peaceful.\n\nTaken on its face, 7 percent of 10,600 is a large number of violent, illegal protests that shouldn't be downplayed. Indeed, of that 7 percent, the vast majority (88 percent) involved BLM activists. But even a casual review of the data shows its limitations-and bias.\n\nACLED, which expressed solidarity with the very social justice demonstrations it studied, under-counted violent rallies. In Seattle, for example, while it noted that the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone emerged violently in June, it claimed \"only peaceful protests were recorded during the intervening period.\"\n\nACLED must have missed the mob of protesters that attacked a local business, threatening to burn it down, in the early morning of June 14. Plus, two months later, two protests that included plenty of vandalism and black bloc Antifa thugs weren't even included in the data set. How many more did it miss?\n\nBLM supporters have argued that their tactics are necessary and their cause is justified. You won't get them to change their minds-so be it. But to claim that somehow this movement deserves a Nobel peace prize is untenable.\n\nSome may wonder if such a transparently pandering nomination for BLM will make it far. I hope reason prevails and that the Nobel committee rejects the nomination. But this is the same organization that gave President Barack Obama a Nobel peace prize less than a year into his presidency, sans any accomplishments on peace (and before he used a drone strike to take out an American citizen overseas).\n\nRewarding such violent behavior sends the wrong message, especially when too few BLM activists did anything meaningful to keep the peace or condemn the violence. It says violence is the answer, a position anyone can abuse to further their own political agenda. Should we legitimize that view? I sure hope not.\n\nJason Rantz is a frequent guest on Fox News and is the host of the Jason Rantz Show on KTTH Seattle, heard weekday afternoons.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nEarlier this month, a brawl broke out between the hostess of an Italian restaurant in New York City and Black women from Texas over the requirement that they show proof of vaccination.\n\nIt later emerged that the three women had provided documentation of COVID-19 vaccinations, but the altercation had escalated after two men, both Black, turned up to join them at Carmine's and didn't have proof.\n\nThe restaurant's hostess suggested the vaccination cards the women provided were fake, spoke condescendingly and used a racial slur, Justin Moore, an attorney for the women, told the New York Times .\n\nCarmine's has denied the allegation that racism played a role in the incident. In a statement provided to Newsweek , the restaurant's owner, Jeffrey Bank, said the hostess is Asian American and that other employees who were involved are also people of color. \"None of our hosts-all of whom are people of color-ever uttered such a slur,\" he said.\n\nBut the incident, prompted by the city's enforcement of rules that require people to show proof of having received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine before dining indoors, underscores another issue at play: the racial vaccination gap in the U.S.\n\nBlack people are less likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19, even though the pandemic has taken a disproportionate toll on them. Racial breakdowns of vaccination data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show Black Americans are lagging far behind other groups with only around 30 percent fully vaccinated.\n\nThis means vaccine requirements disproportionately impact the Black community, Hawk Newsome, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter Greater New York told Newsweek. His group is not affiliated with the Black Lives Matter Global Network.\n\nNewsome, who organized a protest outside Carmine's earlier this week , pointed to recent data showing that less than half of the city's Black residents between the ages of 18 and 44 are vaccinated. \"That means that you're excluding a tremendous amount of Black New Yorkers, from engaging in everyday actions,\" he said.\n\nSeveral factors are driving the racial disparity, including mistrust of the medical establishment due to a history of discriminatory treatment, said Amara Enyia, policy and research coordinator for the Movement for Black Lives.\n\nIt dates back to the nation's history of medical experimentation on Black enslaved people. Other examples include the government's Tuskegee syphilis experiment, where treatment was withheld from Black men with syphilis.\n\n\"I think it's important to note the historic context for vaccine hesitancy. There is a history of a healthcare system that has actually been harmful to Black people,\" she told Newsweek.\n\nBut more recent examples of Black people not receiving adequate medical care have also reinforced the mistrust, Enyia said, citing the case of Susan Moore, a Black doctor who died of COVID-19 complications after complaining of racist treatment while in hospital.\n\nPresident Joe Biden 's announcement of vaccine mandates, after previously vowing to not take the step, has fueled further mistrust, according to Newsome.\n\n\"I'm not an anti-vaxxer. I'm no Fox News-watching conservative. Many Black people are not, they just do not trust this vaccine,\" Newsome, who is unvaccinated, added.\n\nThe president \"made a lot of promises to us around all the Black Lives Matter movement, but he hasn't taken any substantial steps on that front,\" Newsome said, and pointed to the mistreatment of Haitian migrants at the border.\n\n\"Black people are realizing that Democrats are almost as bad as the Republicans when it comes to their treatment of Black people,\" he said. \"It's a very sobering feeling.\"\n\nBut he added: \"We're fully aware that Republicans only care about Black issues when it impacts them. They were pro-police when there was BLM protests, anti-police when they stormed the Capitol on January 6.\"\n\nAnd while he disavowed any comparison between vaccine mandates and Nazi Germany or slavery, he believes they would be used \"to make Black people second-class citizens.\"\n\nForcing Black Americans to make a decision to take the vaccine or lose their job is \"completely unfair... because as a Black person, I do not trust the government,\" he said. \"The largest numbers of unvaccinated people are Black. We will truly feel the penalty of not complying.\"\n\nNewsome said he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine until he can trust it is safe. \"I think each individual has their own threshold,\" he said. \"I'll know mine when I reach it.\"\n\nEnyia added: \"When we talk about issues of vaccine hesitancy, and we hear 'trust the science' and those sort of phrases, you just can't overlook the role that historical factors play into the scepticism and perhaps the mistrust.\n\n\"Frankly, it's condescending and a bit trite to toss it aside... because the time for trust building is throughout time, it's throughout that history. It's harder in the middle of a pandemic, to need to hurry up and convince people to trust an institution when the history has not shown that that trust has been earned. That's a very real challenge.\"\n\nThe information gap, as well as the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation, also feeds into vaccine hesitancy, Enyia said. \"Local governments, state governments, federal government, and including the CDC as the federal agency that's at the helm of this need to be consistent in their messaging,\" she said.\n\nAnd humorous campaigns that target the Black community like Baltimore's \"ginger ale can't cure COVID\" meme can also be effective, she added.\n\nAlthough she sees why vaccine mandates haven been imposed, Enyia describes it as a territory fraught with ethical and legal questions. \"Because it involves essentially forcing people who have made a conscious choice not to get a vaccine to get a vaccine,\" she said.\n\nStructural issues can also be barriers to Black Americans getting the vaccine, Enyia said, such as whether or not they can get paid time off and access to transportation. \"If we're looking at the profile of workers who tend to have the least opportunities to take paid time off, you're looking at Black and Latinx workers,\" she said.\n\n\"The landscape is changing, but it's important for us to continue naming structural inequities an developing solutions, because regardless of what people are choosing to do, we have to make sure that there are no structural barriers to them being able to make the decision, especially when it comes to taking the vaccine.\"\n\nErica Loewe, White House director of African American Media, told Newsweek : \"President Biden and Vice President Harris have committed to instilling equity and racial justice in every policy pursued across the government, including the Administration's response to COVID-19.\n\n\"As part of this effort, we have worked closely with community-based partners and implemented a comprehensive strategy to ensure our nation's highest risk and hardest hit localities have the support they need. From those efforts, we are seeing strong, positive increases in vaccination rates in communities of color across the country-as well as closing of gaps in vaccination rates between races/ethnicities as we continue our vaccination push. We will continue to work with stakeholders to pay heed to their concerns with the shared goal of saving lives.\"\n\nThe graphic below, provided by Statista , shows the share of the world population fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by region.\n\nUpdate 9/27/21, 4:00 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with a White House statement.\n\nUpdate 9/30/21, 4:00 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with comment from Carmine's.

      "text": "Participating in Black Lives Matter Protest Isn't Protected by Federal Labor Law\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nFree Speech\n\nEugene Volokh | 8.27.2024 10:12 AM\n\nFederal labor law limits employers' ability to fire employees for \"engag[ing] in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\" (It also limits unions' ability to discipline members for their speech on union matters.) But, unlike the laws in some states, it doesn't protect employees' broader political activities. The question then arises: What kinds of concerted activities are for purposes of employees' \"mutual aid or protection\"?\n\nIn NLRB v. SFR, Inc. , the National Labor Relations Board (Members Kaplan, Prouty & Wilcox) affirmed Administrate Law Judge Arthur Amchan's decision that participating in Black Lives Matter protests wasn't sufficiently focused on employee rights:\n\nSpecifically, we agree with the judge that the employees' participation in Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests was not shown to be for mutual aid or protection in the context of the facts here and under extant law; therefore, we dismiss the allegations.\n\n{Although Member Wilcox agrees that the evidence here does not establish that the employees' participation in outside BLM protests was for \"\"other mutual aid or protection\" under Sec. 7 as defined in Eastex, Inc. v. NLRB (1978), she observes that the judge's articulation of the relevant standard was unduly narrow. Instead, as the Board explained in Home Depot USA, Inc. (NLRB 2024), \"an employee's concerted actions are protected by Sec. 7 of the Act so long as an objective is protected. The fact that the employee's actions may have other objectives, or even that those objectives may predominate, is immaterial.\"}\n\nAnd here's an excerpt from the decision that was affirmed (read the full document for more factual details):\n\nNichols and King engaged in concerted activity by attending a BLM protest together.... However, in the circumstances of the instant case, none of the alleged discriminatees engaged in activity protected by Section 7 of the Act. The lead case on this issue is Eastex, Inc. v. NLRB (1978). In that case, the Supreme Court held or reaffirmed the proposition that Section 7 protects employees when they engage in otherwise protected concerted activities in support of employees of employers other than their own. The Court also made it clear that Section 7 protection may cover appeals to persons or entities that are not being solicited for support in their capacity as an employer, such as an appeal to a state legislature opposing \"Right To Work\" legislation, and an appeal to voters to elect representatives favorable to the employees' concerns.\n\nHowever, Justice Powell, in the majority opinion also wrote, \"It is true, of course, that some concerted activity bears a less immediate relationship to employees' interests as employees than other such activity. We may assume that at some point the relationship becomes so attenuated that an activity cannot fairly be deemed to come within the \"mutual aid or protection\" clause.\"\n\nBLM was at least originally a protest movement against police misconduct of African Americans. It may well have morphed into a protest movement against all forms of racial injustice, including in the workplace. Nevertheless, that is not BLM's primary focus. At the BLM protest attended by Taylor, not a word was said about racial discrimination in the workplace. The protest appears to have been focused entirely on mistreatment of African Americans by the police and specifically the George Floyd murder.\n\nThere is no connection between the BLM protests in this case and any concerns about racial injustice at Parkside Cafe or any other particular employer. In this record, there is no evidence that the BLM protests focused on any specific workplace issue festering in workplaces generally, e.g. racial discrimination in hiring. To find that the Act protects activity which by no stretch of the imagination can be related to the workplace, is to expand the scope of the Act far beyond that to which it has ever been applied before. Moreover, I doubt it was intended to reach such activity.\n\nThe consequences of such an expansion of the scope of the Act would logically forbid employers for prohibiting all sorts of divisive activity from their workplaces, which are at best tangentially related to the concerns of employees as employees.\n\nI find that the attendance of Taylor, King and Nichols at BLM rallies, at least in the circumstances established in this record, is so attenuated to the interests of the alleged discriminatees as employees to fall outside of the \"mutual aid or protection clause. Thus, even if they were constructively discharged, Respondent did not violate the Act by doing so....\n\nThe Administrative Law Judge also held that the employees weren't \"constructively discharged\" (i.e., pressured into quitting because work conditions had become intolerable) or told that they couldn't remain employed if they supported Black Lives Matter:\n\nWhile Dykes expressed his displeasure towards BLM and his employees' participation, he made no demand or suggestion that they could no longer work at Parkside if they continued to attend BLM protests.... Bagwell, who normally set employee work schedules and supervised them, never conditioned continued employment on ceasing support for Black Lives Matter. In fact, in the three-way text exchanges between Bagwell, Dykes and Taylor, Bagwell wrote that he was not firing anybody. Given this situation, which was ambiguous at best, I find that the discriminatees were not given a clear and unequivocal choice between continued employment and continued support for Black Lives Matter....\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The Libertarian Party Mourns Garrett Foster, Activist Killed at a Black Lives Matter Protest\n\nBlack Lives Matter\n\nZuri Davis | 7.27.2020 4:42 PM\n\nGarrett Foster, a libertarian activist, was killed on Saturday while attending a Black Lives Matter (BLM) protest in Austin. While the events surrounding his death are still being investigated, libertarians who recognize the importance of being involved in the anti-police brutality protests have expressed their sadness for his loss, and are reminding others that libertarians have both an opportunity and a duty to participate in the current debate on American policing.\n\nFoster attended a BLM protest with his fiancée, Whitney Mitchell. The pair met when they were teenagers and moved to Austin a few years ago. Foster was lauded by his family and several others for the care he provided for Mitchell, a quadruple amputee. Foster and Mitchell were actively involved in local BLM protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nThere is some dispute between the Austin Police Department (APD) and numerous witnesses over details in the official story, Intelligencer reports .\n\nOn Saturday, Foster was exercising his right to open-carry an AK-47 rifle, as allowed by Texas state law, and marching alongside fellow protesters. Just before 10 p.m., the protesters crossed the intersection of Fourth Street and Congress Avenue. That's when a driver, who remains unidentified by the APD, aggressively accelerated his car toward the crowd of protesters. The protesters, including Foster, who was pushing Mitchell through the intersection, approached the vehicle in an attempt to get the driver to stop.\n\nBoth witnesses on the scene and the APD confirm that the driver fatally shot Foster from the vehicle and that Foster did not discharge his weapon during the encounter. Another member of the crowd returned fire. The APD says both shooters had licenses to carry.\n\nThe fact in dispute is whether Foster pointed his weapon at the driver. Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said on Sunday that the driver maintained Foster had aimed his gun towards him, leading him to shoot. Several witnesses say the opposite is true. They maintain that Foster's rifle was pointed downward.

      "text": "Court Strikes Down Up-to-28-Day Review Period for Demonstration Permit Applications\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nFree Speech\n\nEugene Volokh | 7.24.2020 11:40 AM\n\nFrom American Patriot Express v. City of Glens Falls , decided Wednesday by Judge Lawrence E. Kahn (N.D.N.Y.):\n\nGlens Falls City Code § 87 ... regulates \"demonstrations,\" defined as \"pre-planned gathering[s] of 25 or more persons ... convene[d] for the purpose of a public exhibition including a procession, parade, protest, picket, march or rally\" on \"public\" property, defined as \"any place to which the public has unrestricted access,\" excluding indoor spaces.\n\nAny \"person, corporation, partnership or other entity\" that \"hold[s] or cause[s] to be held\" any \"demonstration,\" as defined above, anywhere on \"public\" property, as defined, must first acquire a permit. Section 87-4(A) provides that permit applications must be submitted to the City Clerk and \"will be processed in order of receipt[,] and in all cases decisions whether to grant or deny the application will be delivered within 14 days of application, unless, upon written notice to the applicant, a further 14-day extension is necessary.\" ...\n\nPlaintiffs are a political organization with a conservative mission, and a collection of people who frequently engage in protests in Glens Falls in support of police, President Donald Trump, and United States Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, as well as counter-protests against left-wing demonstrators, and who plan to continue doing so....\n\nPlaintiffs have, on at least one instance, refrained from protesting because the delay inherent in the maximum 28-day review period precluded their protest. Specifically, on June 3, when Sherman learned that a planned Black Lives Matter (\"BLM\") protest was to occur on June 5, Plaintiffs wished to organize a simultaneous counter-protest for but refrained from doing so, because they believed that § 87 required a permit for this counter-protest and that § 87's 28-day permit processing period precluded their acquisition of a permit on two days' notice....\n\nAt the time that they filed the Complaint and Motion, Plaintiffs planned to stage a protest countering the message of the June 5 BLM protest, as soon as possible. At that demonstration, protesters were to advocate in favor of police and display political signs in support of Trump and Stefanik. Plaintiffs anticipated that the demonstration would be attended by more than twenty-five people. The rally was \"time sensitive,\" because \"plaintiffs want[ed] to send an important message to police at a time when they and their reputation is under attack.\" ...\n\nThe court held that the permitting process, with its up-to-28-day delay, was unconstitutional:\n\nA delay in granting a permit to engage in a demonstration can amount to censorship, regardless of whether the permit is ultimately granted or denied. When a speaker \"wishes to take a public position on a pressing public issue ... the time required to obtain approval may prevent him or her from doing so until after the public issue is settled[.]\" ... [C]ourts have invalidated advance notice requirements (requiring that demonstrators apply for a permit a certain amount of time prior to an intended demonstration) of comparable length on the ground that such requirements censored spontaneous speech and were not narrowly tailored to meet similar public safety concerns to those at issue in this case....\n\nThe truism that administrative processing imposes delays that burden spontaneous speech is highlighted by the example permit application that Defendants attach as an exhibit to their Response. The person who filed this application, who sought to hold a protest on June 5, 2020, filed on May 2, 2020. Practically, a prospective protester must file this long in advance to ensure that she is able to protest on her planned date, because she must account for the possibility that her application will take 28 days to be approved (assuming that it does not need to be revised, which will lengthen the processing period by seven days, see § 87-4(C), and assuming that the application is not denied, necessitating an administrative appeal that likewise lasts seven days, § 87-4(E))....\n\nDefendants argue that the small physical size of Glens Falls (3.8 square miles) and the small size of its police force (thirty officers) justifies a longer permit-processing period than might be constitutional in a larger city. To the extent that Glens Falls' relatively small police force allows it to accommodate fewer simultaneous protests on short notice than, say, Chicago, it still seems implausible that twenty-eight days of preparation time for any protest anywhere in the town is justified by this resource limitation.... [I]t is conceivable that the relatively limited staff and resources devoted to processing applications could necessitate longer processing times than in, for instance, Chicago, if there were a substantial number of permit applications for Glens Falls officials to review. But Defendants point to only a single permit application filed in the several months since the ordinance was passed, and do not otherwise suggest that the Glens Falls government has been inundated with permit requests....\n\n[Moreover], under § 87-4(A), there are no standards constraining the exercise of discretion in the decision to delay a permit beyond fourteen days, let alone \"narrow, objective, and definite\" ones, and the clerk is required only to provide notice of, and not to explain, a delay beyond fourteen days. Section 87-4(A) states simply that an application will be processed in fourteen days or, with notice, in up to twenty-eight days. § 87-4(A). Such limitless discretion is prohibited under the First Amendment, because \"it allows officials to suppress viewpoints in surreptitious ways that are difficult to detect.\" A politically biased Glens Falls government employee could, entirely undetected, hinder an applicant's political activism by unnecessarily delaying an application for up to twenty-eight days, without justifying this decision by reference to any statutory standards....\n\nThe court also struck down another provision in the ordinance, which apparently banned the use of signs at demonstrations. This provision, the court held, was \" a comprehensive prohibition on speech\" that didn't \"leave open ample alternatives for communication.\"\n\nAnd it held that a separate provision imposing strict liability for violations was also unconstitutional:\n\nStrict liability is disfavored for criminal penalties when First Amendment concerns are implicated, and a knowledge requirement is necessary for any sanctions provision that might chill speech.... As a problematic example of how this strict liability sanction provision might operate, the Court considers a situation in which an organizer arranges a protest that she reasonably anticipates will be attended by fewer than twenty-five people but that is actually attended by twenty-five or more. In such a situation, it appears that ... such an organizer could be subject to criminal penalties despite her lack of intent to hold a \"demonstration\" to which permit requirements apply.\n\nThe problematic consequence of strict liability in the context of regulations burdening speech is that the potential violator (in this case, a demonstration organizer) will err on the side of self-censorship in order to steer well clear of the possibility that she will be sanctioned for a violation that she accidentally commits. See Smith v. California (1959) (\"For if the bookseller is criminally liable [for obscenity] without knowledge of the contents, and the [anti-obscenity] ordinance fulfills its purpose, he will tend to restrict the books he sells to those he has inspected; and thus the State will have imposed a restriction upon the distribution of constitutionally protected as well as obscene literature.\"). Mindful of applicable sanctions, an organizer may, for instance, rather than simply seeking a permit for public gatherings she anticipates will be attended by at least twenty-five people, seek a permit for any public gatherings she organizes, to insure against the possibility that a gathering will unexpectedly turn out to be attended by at least twenty-five people. She may do this despite the fact that she unambiguously has both a constitutional right to organize small gatherings without acquiring a permit, and a statutory right to do so under § 87....\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Justin Jones tossed a traffic cone at a driver during 2020 BLM protest\n\nUnearthed surveillance footage from a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest outside the Tennessee Capitol shows newly reinstated Rep. Justin Jones throwing a traffic cone at a driver in frustration.\n\nJones, 27, who was returned to office after leading a protest in the Capitol against gun violence in the wake of the Nashville school shooting, was seen on video blocking a street with six other demonstrators on June 18, 2020.\n\nDressed in all black and a tan-brimmed hat, the future lawmaker could be seen attempting to stop a white truck trying to drive around them by placing a traffic cone in front of the vehicle.\n\nUndeterred, the driver runs over the cone, causing the group to approach the truck and yell at him with a megaphone.\n\nAppearing angered by the driver's actions, Jones can be seen pulling the cone from underneath the vehicle and using it to repeatedly jab the driver, who attempts to smack it away.\n\nAs the driver tries to speed up, Jones tosses it into the truck, but the driver quickly pushes it out and makes his getaway.\n\nDuring the incident, another driver on the opposite side of the stalled road could also be seen confronting the protesters, with their vehicle inching forward until it bumped into one of them.\n\nDespite the small push, the protester, wearing a neon-green long-sleeve shirt, threw themselves on the ground and lay down in front of the car as another demonstrator rushed to check on them.\n\nJones has repeatedly claimed that the chaotic incident was not violent after District Attorney Glenn Funk attempted to indict him in 2021 for participating in the protests in an \"aggravating\" manner.\n\nHe noted that the man in the white van was allegedly hurling \"racial slurs\" at the protesters and that he was the one at fault for pushing his car past them.\n\nDefending himself on Twitter at the time, Jones wrote: \"They will try to push a false narrative portraying me as 'violent' as a way to deflect from their own actions. They will suggest that I am out of order. That is their strategy.\"\n\nThe charges pressed against Jones for the protest were all dropped.\n\nJones has recently made headlines after he and fellow Democrat Justin Pearson, 28, both of whom are black, were expelled from the state legislature after they joined protests on the House floor on March 30.\n\nThe demonstration called on lawmakers to pass gun reform policies following the horrific mass shooting at Nashville's Covenant School , where three 9-year-old children and three faculty members were shot dead by Audrey Hale, a 28-year-old alumnus of the Christian school.\n\nGloria Johnson, 60, a fellow lawmaker who is white, was notably not expelled despite demonstrating with her fellow Democrats.\n\nJones and Pearson were reinstated earlier this week after their respective governing councils voted them back into office.\n\nAdvertisement"

His back was turned. How was that aggressive?\"\n\nBut Casillo's defense lawyer said justice had been served.\n\n\"We're very gratified after an exhaustive and thorough review the Manhattan DA's office has decided that Kathleen Casillo should not receive a criminal conviction, which we have maintained from the beginning of the case,\" attorney Oliver Storch said.\n\n\"Ms. Castillo is a retired grandmother who looks forward to putting this horrible ordeal behind her and spending time with her family,\" Storch said. \"Her thoughts and prayers go out to anybody injured.\"\n\nA contrite Casillo also apologized as she left court.\n\n\"I\"m sorry for everyone, I really am,\" she said.\n\nCasillo was in her black BMW sedan with her 29-year-old daughter on Dec. 11, 2020 when she drove into a BLM protest on 39th Street and Third Avenue.\n\nShe told cops she feared for her safety - and her daughter's - when she panicked and stepped on the gas.\n\nVideo footage of the incident showed several protestors being hurled into the air, with six people suffering injuries that were non-life-threatening.\n\nCasillo was charged with reckless assault and reckless endangerment and released without bail.\n\nShe twice turned down deals that would have had her perform six days of community service and suspended her driver's license for one year, in exchange for a guilty plea.\n\nProsecutors with DA Alvin Bragg's office said Monday they agreed to the new terms because Casillo had no criminal record, did not flee the scene, did not intend to hurt the protestors and took responsibility for the incident.\n\n\"We believe, given all this, it is just to permit the defendant to try to earn a non-criminal disposition,\" Assistant District Attorney Andrew Mercer said in court.\n\n\"If she fails in fulfilling any of the conditions of this plea - that is, if she does not complete the community service or gets rearrested in the next year - she will not be permitted to withdraw her plea,\" Mercer said. \"The misdemeanor conviction will stand and she will face possible jail time.\"\n\nUnder state law, misdemeanor convictions can warrant jail terms of up to one year.\n\nCasillo is due back in court on June 9.\n\nAdditional reporting by Steven Hirsch\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Face facts: 'Black Lives Matter' is all about hate\n\nIts agenda is plain for all to see: cop-killing.\n\nWith another two police officers shot at the Black Lives Matter riot in Louisville on Wednesday , it's time to lift the veil on the whole movement: It's a haven for unrepentant cop-killers.\n\nThese aren't isolated incidents. It has been fewer than two weeks since supposedly \"peaceful\" BLM radicals chanted, \"We hope they die,\" while blocking the entrance to a hospital where two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were undergoing life-saving surgery. An assailant had walked up to their patrol vehicle and opened fire from point-blank range without provocation .\n\nThose chilling words echo the rhetoric we hear from BLM founders and members, who make clear that a prime objective of BLM is to \"Kill Cops.\" Up until now, this has been kept well enough under wraps to ­deceive major corporations, professional sports leagues and countless well-meaning Americans.\n\nJoe Biden has made propagating this movement's lies a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, waiting months before condemning the wanton ­violence perpetrated by BLM . Staff members on the Biden campaign contributed money to secure the release of rioters charged with crimes. Meanwhile, progressive Democratic prosecutors refused to even charge some of the worst rioters.\n\nSome people try to separate BLM \"the organization\" from \"the movement\" that goes by the same name, but at most they are two sides of the same coin. From the start, both the organization and the movement - BLM writ large - have been about hatred and violence that extends beyond police and includes all white people, all blacks who are conservative and the United States of America.\n\nWe saw this in 2014, when BLM first attained national prominence. After months of ­anti-police rioting, a man pledging \"revenge for Michael Brown and Eric Garner\" traveled to New York City, stuck a pistol through the window of a squad car and opened fire. Detectives Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu died on the scene.\n\nI mourned the officers like the rest of New York did. And when I met with the Ramos and Liu families, I was aghast. I reiterated my call for politicians to abandon their reckless anti-police rhetoric. \"Maybe,\" I suggested, \"they should spend the next four months not talking about police hatred, but talking about what they are going to do about bringing down crime in the community.\"\n\nNineteen months later, a man opened fire at a BLM protest in Dallas, murdering five officers. BLM disavowed responsibility, but the killer had deep links to the movement's radical ideology , stating that he \"wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.\" BLM supporters certainly didn't stop chanting \"Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon\" in the aftermath, either.\n\nBLM counts on a legion of journalists who believe BLM will help advance a \"progressive\" agenda. They will never admit that violence against ­police isn't an unfortunate outgrowth of the BLM movement - but the central point.\n\nBlack Lives Matter isn't about black lives. It ignores the 8,000 to 9,000 black lives taken by other blacks every year in minority communities across the nation. Those black lives, and the lives of African American police officers, don't matter.\n\nBlack Lives Matter isn't about \"holding police accountable,\" and it isn't a good-faith call for reasonable reform.\n\nIf we had a functioning mainstream media, this would be common knowledge by now. ­Instead, people are learning the real nature of BLM by watching protesters scream \"We hope they die\" outside a hospital where two cops are fighting for their lives.\n\nThe time has come to face the facts. If you ever supported Black Lives Matter, then you are either a left-wing radical - or you got duped. There is no shame in the latter. By design, the relentlessly repeated cry of \"Black lives matter\" is an unassailable moral truism, calculated to bully people into supporting a radical, revolutionary, anti-order movement.\n\nThe good news is that it isn't too late to make the right decision. You can be a good person who decries racism and condemns police misconduct yet still reject violent left-wing radicalism unequivocally. You can stand for the safety and human dignity of black people - and of all people - and simultaneously stand with the police officers who maintain law and order.\n\nIt starts with rejecting BLM and every politician who has been cynical enough to enable the radical forces intent on tearing this country apart. When you see Black Lives Matter, realize they are dedicated to killing cops. Too much blood has been spilled already. It has to stop.\n\nRudolph Giuliani is the former mayor of New York City."

Neither were seriously hurt.\n\nHe was sentenced Tuesday to three years and eight months behind bars after pleading guilty Thursday to five misdemeanors, including three counts of assault, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported .\n\nThree felony charges and a fourth count of assault were dropped by prosecutors in exchange for Rogers' guilty plea.\n\nHe had been initially sentenced to six years in prison in August after being convicted on six misdemeanor counts, but agreed to plead guilty on the fewer charges rather than go to trial, the Times-Dispatch reported.\n\nRogers was first charged with a hate crime enhancement on each assault charge, but a judge agreed to toss them after his attorney argued that the victims - who are white - were not targeted due to their race.\n\nDefense attorney George Townsend had accused prosecutors of seeking to unfairly sentence Rogers \"just because of his connection to the KKK,\" the Times-Dispatch reported.\n\nPrior to sentencing, Rogers had pleaded with Henrico Circuit Judge L.A. Harris Jr. for leniency while acknowledging his actions.\n\n\"Maybe I didn't make the right decisions that day, but we can't rewind time,\" Rogers said in court.\n\nPrior to his arrest, Rogers boasted about the attack on a Facebook Live video, characterizing the demonstrators he targeted as insects.\n\n\"This Chevrolet 2500 went up on the curb and through the protest,\" Rogers said on the clip, which was played in court. \"They scattered like [expletive] cockroaches ... It's kind of funny, if you ask me.\"\n\nHis attorney also acknowledged Thursday that Rogers is a member of the KKK as prosecutors had previously alleged.\n\n\"He was born into it,\" Townsend told the judge last week. \"That was never hidden.\"\n\nPolice said the 14-year-old son of Rogers' girlfriend was riding in the passenger seat of the truck when it drove through the protest.\n\nRogers was later arrested near a statue of Confederate Gen. A.P. Hill, which he reportedly told police he and about 20 others were protecting.\n\nInvestigators found a pistol, a rifle, Confederate patches and a document titled \"The Practice of Klanishness\" - which a gang unit officer likened to a \"book of the Bible\" for KKK members - inside the truck, the Times-Dispatch reported."

      "text": "White House ordered border authorities to clear out bridge by Friday evening ahead of BLM protest: Sources\n\nDEL RIO, Texas - The Biden administration has set a deadline of Friday night to clear out the Haitian migrant camp that has caused major headaches for the White House , sources told the Washington Examiner .\n\nTwo senior officials within the Department of Homeland Security said the camp, underneath the Del Rio-Acuna International Bridge, is creating bad \"optics\" and drawing renewed scrutiny to the administration's inability to curb illegal immigration. At one point, more than 15,000 people were in the camp, though the number had dwindled to less than a third of that by Thursday.\n\n\"They want those people out from under that bridge so they can't be seen anymore,\" the first official said. \"It's an optics thing. They are moving them around for process and release. They're going to have everyone at the bridge gone in the next two days.\"\n\nTOWNSFOLK HORRIFIED AT THE DUSTY WARZONE DEL RIO HAS BECOME\n\nAs of Thursday morning, fewer than 4,000 noncitizens remained under the bridge. Roughly 3,000 to 5,000 of the 15,000 have been deported or are expected to be expelled. The remaining 10,000 to 12,000 people will be released into the country and permitted to travel nationwide, according to two top officials at different DHS agencies that handle border and immigration matters.\n\nThe sudden push to get everyone out of the squalid living conditions is only happening now following orders from the West Wing. Federal authorities learned this week of a Black Lives Matter protest scheduled to take place near the bridge this weekend and moved quickly to avoid a more chaotic scene.\n\n\"They don't want them all riled up [at the time of the protest],\" the official said, adding that most are being sent to San Antonio, a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Del Rio.\n\nA second person who also shared operational information on the condition of anonymity wrote in an email Thursday that the \"White House wants all cleared out by Friday evening.\"\n\n\"Most will be at other holding facilities in other sectors. They are basically just moving the bridge to other areas. It's all about optics,\" the second official wrote. \"It's getting hard to move them because they are getting aggressive.\"\n\nBorder Patrol agents are interviewing and providing release documents to migrants at a rate of 15 minutes per person.\n\nMost of the migrants being moved to San Antonio will be released onto the street. Releases into the community have been unfolding for months, community members told the Washington Examiner in a series of interviews this week.\n\nAll women who claim to be pregnant will be released and will not be asked to complete a pregnancy test to verify their claims, the first official said.\n\n\"Once they have their babies in the U.S., we can't remove them because we can't deport U.S. citizens. We can't deport the sole parent,\" the first official said.\n\nDeportations are limited. Immigration and Customs Enforcement oversees deportation flights, and its 737 jets can hold approximately 180 detainees per flight. The Biden administration has attempted one to three flights daily, with some not taking off due to assaults from passengers against the federal officers on board.\n\nFrom San Antonio and other nearby regions across the southern border, the Biden administration will release thousands of migrants. Approximately two-thirds of the people who lived under the bridge will not be removed from the country, the first official said.\n\nThose released will not be given notices to appear, which are documents stating that they must appear in immigration court down the road, when a judge will decide an asylum claim if they have made one or decide how to respond to their illegal entry at the border.\n\nInstead, migrants are being pushed out the door of Border Patrol stations and processing centers with notices to report, which instruct them to self-report to an ICE office in the coming weeks after they arrive at their final destination nationwide. There is no legal requirement to show up, and changes that President Joe Biden made to immigration policy earlier this year forbid ICE officers from going into the community and arresting people who are not a significant public safety threat.\n\nThe first official said the challenge for Border Patrol agents who take custody of illegal immigrants and book them into the system is that virtually none have identification documents.\n\nIn addition, those who receive letters that state they should report to ICE down the road will not be a priority for deportation if they fail to show. ICE also will not know where they went after departing the border.\n\nOver the past week, Del Rio was inundated with Haitian migrants swarming across the Rio Grande in droves. The majority have lived and worked for years as residents of Chile, the wealthiest South American county."

      "text": "Firebombing the truth about political violence\n\nA fter a North Carolina Republican Party office was firebombed last week, news media denounced the political Left's tendency to turn violent.\n\nHa ha, no, of course they didn't. Instead they stuck to what they know best, blaming Republicans and insisting that the Right is prone to violence.\n\nOn his show Monday night, \"NBC Nightly News\" host Lester Holt spent a segment not on the actual violence perpetrated in the firebombing against Republicans, but on \" undertones of violence \" that allegedly lurk within Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The segment included clips of fights at some of Trump's rallies but didn't mention that much of it was caused by supporters of socialist former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.\n\nThis was in a week, moreover, in which two Democratic activists, one the husband of a member of Congress, were implicated in sending rent-a-mob provocateurs to start violence at Trump rallies.\n\nSo the Left organizes and pays people to tarnish Republicans in general and Trump in particular with violence, and the press dutifully wrings its hands about undertones of violence.\n\nPeople on the Right sometimes resort to violence, but it is hard plausibly to argue that they are responsible for most, or even the majority, of it.\n\nNews media downplay left-wing violence not just because they tend to support left-wing causes and so avoid negative reporting, but also because they swallow flimsy left-wing rhetoric that presents disruption, intimidation, and sometimes assault as legitimate democratic action. When right-wingers are violent it generally isn't camouflaged by bogus political principle.\n\nBut you still find sympathy on the Left for such movements as Occupy Wall Street, which was presented as a protest against big banks but was always (or at best swiftly became) a parade murder , sexual assault and violence against the police.\n\nContrast that with Tea Party rallies and the way the media portrayed them. They were almost entirely peaceful and put on by people who even picked up their own trash. Whenever a fight did break out, news media would conclude that it was \"a symptom of the polarizing rhetoric that fueled\" the Tea Party.\n\nThese days, protests against the police routinely involve street violence, shutting down highways, vandalizing police stations, and destroying local businesses .\n\nIt's true that no movement, whether it be Black Lives Matter or any other, can control all the people it inspires. In July, after two black men were killed by police in Baton Rouge, La., a gunman took advantage of a BLM protest to target and kill five police officers. Other officers have been targeted as well by fanatics who cite its inspiration.\n\nBut the smashing of city centers, even though it is depicted as extreme, nevertheless is tinted with media sympathy for the cause. There is no such indulgence but, rather, hair trigger condemnation when there is any unrest associated with the right, particularly the GOP's presidential nominee.\n\nNews media need to stop pretending the violent left-wingers are just rowdy kids going too far in a good cause. When firebombs are thrown at Republicans, Republicans are not to blame."

Nonetheless, BLM instructed all white people not to speak to the media and pass any interview requests to black protestors.\n\nBLM protest leaders instructed protestors to separate themselves by race and leave a barrier of about 15 feet between the mostly white protestors and the trucks with BLM activists and leaders in order to make it appear that protestors weren't mostly white.\n\nWhen white people tried to break into the middle of the black activists to hold up a coffin with the symbol of the Democratic donkey on it, they were told to stop invading their space and to stand behind a sign saying \"Hillary has blood on her hands.\"\n\nMeanwhile they flew flags of several African countries that had brutal regimes that killed, terrorized, and abused black citizens.\n\nProtestors yelled \"f*** the police\" and \"f*** the pigs.\" Police officers stood by and, when Akbar asked them if the protestors had permits, they said they were unsure but didn't crack down on the events.\n\nMore shocking was the fact that the white protestors were in total agreement with the segregation and demands that they not talk to the media. Akbar asked a white Bernie supporter why she agreed to move to the back of the protest, and she said because it's what BLM wanted and she needed to check her privilege.\n\nAkbar said that these protestors didn't reflect most black people and there were very few of them even there. He said that after the protests he drove past a poor black neighborhood and saw dozens of unemployed black people from northern Philadelphia, all of whom could have came to protest but didn't.\n\n\"This so-called movement is manufactured,\" Akbar said. \"It's more media than voter or societal education. My team and I watched as the march leaders spent more time organizing than speaking their truths. No one in the protest was local. Not one person I met. Black Lives Matter and the Black Resistance to the DNC left blacks behind. These local blacks were not engaged in the tomfoolery and media spectacle that went on for hours.\""

      "text": "Texas Governor Pardons Daniel Perry, Veteran Who Shot Armed BLM Protester\n\nAuthored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott has pardoned former U.S. Army Sgt. Daniel Perry, who was convicted of murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison for shooting an armed Black Lives Matter (BLM) protester who wielded an AK-47.\n\nMr. Abbott issued a proclamation on May 16 indicating that Mr. Perry has been granted a full pardon and restoration of full civil rights of citizenship, while taking aim at Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza for allegedly directing the lead investigator to withhold exculpatory evidence and demonstrating \"unethical and biased misuse\" of his office in prosecuting Mr. Perry.\n\n\" Texas has one of the strongest 'Stand Your Ground' laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive District Attorney, \" Mr. Abbott said in a statement announcing the pardon. \"I thank the Board for its thorough investigation, and I approve their pardon recommendation.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles issued a pardon recommendation to the governor's office, indicating in a statement that it had \"delved into the intricacies\" of Mr. Perry's case, including reviewing police reports, court records, witness statements, and interviews with people linked to the case.\n\n\" The Board voted unanimously to recommend a full pardon and restoration of firearm rights ,\" the board said in the statement.\n\nMr. Garza's office told The Epoch Times in an emailed statement that board's decision and the governor's pardon amount to a \"mockery of our legal system.\"\n\n\"Their actions are contrary to the law and demonstrate that there are two classes of people in this state where some lives matter and some lives do not,\" he said.\n\nMr. Perry was convicted on April 7, 2023 , on murder charges for killing Garrett Foster on July 25, 2020, during a BLM protest in Austin, Texas.\n\nOn the night of the shooting, Mr. Perry was working as a ride-share driver and had turned onto a street where Mr. Foster and dozens of other protesters were marching. After Mr. Foster approached Mr. Perry's car carrying an AK-47 rifle and began to raise the rifle toward Mr. Perry, the former Army sergeant shot Mr. Foster, his attorneys said in his defense.\n\nMr. Perry claimed self-defense, but prosecutors claimed he had maliciously driven into a crowd of protesters and that Mr. Foster had the right to approach him and investigate.\n\nDoug O'Connell, Mr. Perry's attorney, said in a statement posted on social media that his client is grateful for the pardon and wishes \"this tragic event never happened and wishes he never had to defend himself against Mr. Foster's unlawful actions.\"\n\n\"He is thrilled and elated to be free,\" Mr. O'Connell wrote, while criticizing the \"courtroom travesty\" that put him behind bars for what would have been over two decades.\n\nMr. Perry served 372 days of his sentence before being freed, Mr. O'Connell said, while blaming Mr. Garza for tampering with witnesses during the case.\n\nMr. Garza told The Epoch Times that the pardon sends a message to those Travis County community members who served on the grand jury that their service is meaningless.\n\n\"To the family and friends of Garrett Foster, and to the people of Travis County, we will not stop fighting for justice,\" Mr. Garza said.\n\nMr. Perry, who was working as an Uber driver at the time of the shooting, traveled to Austin in July 2020 for work, according to a statement he provided through his attorneys.\n\nAfter dropping a client off, Mr. Perry drove his vehicle onto Congress Avenue and encountered the protest, which was blocking the road. His attorney said that Mr. Perry was unaware of the demonstration before encountering the group.\n\n\"When Sgt. Perry turned on the Congress Avenue, several people started beating on his vehicle,\" the statement said. \"An individual carrying an assault rifle, now known to be Garrett Foster, quickly approached the car and then motioned with the assault rifle for Mr. Perry to lower his window.\"\n\nMr. Perry complied with the request, initially believing that Mr. Foster was with law enforcement.\n\n\" It has now been confirmed by several witnesses that this individual with the assault rifle then began to raise the assault rifle toward Sgt. Perry ,\" his lawyer said in the statement. \"It was only then that Sgt. Perry, who carried a handgun in his car for his own protection while driving strangers in the ride share program, fired on the person to protect his own life.\"\n\nAfter Mr. Perry shot Mr. Foster, another person in the crowd began firing on Mr. Perry's vehicle, prompting him to speed away and, after reaching a safe location, to call the police.\n\nAustin Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters after the shooting that people on the scene gave conflicting accounts of what happened, though he acknowledged that Mr. Foster may have pointed his gun at Mr. Perry.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Mr. Perry had provoked the shooting by driving into the crowd of protesters.\n\nHis attorneys argued that prosecutors withheld key evidence from the jury that suggested Mr. Foster was the aggressor. For instance, his attorneys sought to introduce evidence of three incidents that they said showed Mr. Foster had previously tried to intimidate cars on public streets.\n\nMr. Perry's lawyers also repeatedly tried to introduce into evidence a video recording of Mr. Foster, taken by a protester witness on the morning of July 25, 2020. The video showed that when Mr. Foster was asked if he felt like he'd need to use his AK-47, he said: \"Na. I think the uh-I mean if I use it against the cops, I'm dead. I think all the people that hate us, and you know, wanna say [expletive] to us are too big of a [expletive] to stop and actually do anything about it.\"\n\nAccording to Mr. Perry's attorneys, the evidence showed that Mr. Foster and fellow protesters \"routinely harassed vehicles that attempted to interfere with their efforts to 'take the streets.'\"\n\nTexas law indicates that a person is justified in using force against someone when they \"reasonably\" believe it's necessary to protect them against another's use of unlawful force.\n\nThe Board of Pardons and Paroles said in its May 16 statement that, after a \"thorough review of the amassed information,\" it concluded that Mr. Perry had acted lawfully and recommended he be pardoned.\n\nMimi Nguyen-Ly and Zachary Stieber contributed to this report.

We are grieving for our loved ones, our kings, our Queens, let's not forget that,\" she said.\n\nAnother BLM activist noted: \"Have you noticed most of this fight is done by strong, black queens, right?\"\n\nFormer Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said that the \"demonstration today, despite everything else that is going on and the national mourning that is going on, the fact that we are here is very important, it's bearing witness with the family to their tragedy.\"\n\n\"We cannot have a situation where someone is shot dead through the windscreen of a car and the officer concerned was not immediately suspended from the police force. In any other job, professional walk of life, if someone else dies as a result, possibly of your actions, you get suspended,\" the septuagenarian socialist claimed.\n\nJefferson Bosela, 27, the cousin of Chris Kaba, emotionally relayed his account of seeing the body of his slain family member.\n\n\"The whole time I was just thinking Chris, just get up, please,\" Bosela said.\n\n\"I'm a huge believer in God, and Thomas Jefferson once said 'the justice of God never sleeps', so he's not here, and he doesn't have a voice, but we have a voice and I'm going to fight for him until the end because this isn't normal, we can't let them get away with this.\"\n\n\"He was a human being, he had fears, he was once a child, he was at school, he was looking forward to things, he was a soon-to-be father and he won't have that anymore, for what reason, why?\" he concluded.\n\nOthers at the demonstration complained about the media trying to \"defame Chris' character\". It has been noted in the press that while he was \"unarmed\" at the time of his death - with the exception of potentially being in control of a car - Kaba had previously served prison time for firearms offences .\n\nNevertheless, Kaba's parents have asserted that the shooting was \"very racist\" .\n\nAn unnamed officer, who is said to have given evidence to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) on the killing, was quoted by The Sun as saying: \"The officer [who shot Kaba] has said he was faced with a lethal weapon as the car was being driven towards him at speed.\"\n\n\"He followed correct training procedures,\" the police source added. \"He could have been killed if he had not fired.\"\n\nThe police shooting has already been branded as racist regardless of any pending investigation, despite the body cam footage of it still being kept from the public while the inquiry is held. The IOPC has said that as a part of its investigation into the shooting, it will examine whether race played any part in the killing of Kaba.\n\nWhile there has been no such determination a this time, it has not stopped leftist London mayor Sadiq Khan from backing the officer's suspension, leading to his armed response colleagues threatening to turn in their guns following the Queen's funeral in protest.\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulka\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Health Experts 'Grappling' With Double-Standard Between Anti-Lockdown And BLM Protests\n\nCorrection: This post has been updated to reflect that an open letter excusing social justice protests during the pandemic garnered 1,288 signatories, not over 1,300. The signatories also included a number of medical students, activists, and others, not just epidemiologists and other health professionals.\n\nHealth experts are struggling to justify their widespread endorsement of social justice protests after repeatedly warning people against holding demonstrations against coronavirus lockdown orders.\n\nShortly after states began locking down in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus, business owners as well as furloughed and unemployed workers began marching in cities from New York to Los Angeles against the heavy-handed restrictions. Health officials and government officials condemned the anti-lockdown protests, and warned that the demonstrations could necessitate that the lockdown orders stay in place longer.\n\n\"I certainly condemned the anti-lockdown protests at the time, and I'm not condemning the protests now, and I struggle with that,\" University of Texas epidemiologist Catherine Troisi told The New York Times . \"I have a hard time articulating why that is OK.\"\n\nAfter the death of George Floyd on May 25, the anti-lockdown protesters were largely forgotten as thousands of social justice activists packed streets in cities across the United States to protest police behavior and make allegations of systemic racism. Many of the lawmakers and experts who criticized anti-lockdown protests flouted social distancing rules to show solidarity with Black Lives Matter (BLM).\n\nNearly 1,300 epidemiologists, health experts, and others signed an open letter endorsing the protests, stating that \"white supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19.\"\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who chided anti-lockdown protesters for weeks, flouted her own social distancing rules to join a BLM protest on June 4. Her spokeswoman later denied that she violated the rules, even as photos of the event show the governor kneeling with and touching activists.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the BLM protesters were fighting an \"extraordinary crisis\" that outweighed the threat of the coronavirus and is more important than reopening struggling businesses or allowing devout individuals to return to houses of worship.\n\n\"When you see a nation, an entire nation, simultaneously grappling with an extraordinary crisis seeded in 400 years of American racism,\" de Blasio said June 2. \"I'm sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services.\"\n\nHealth experts interviewed by the NYT admitted that condemning one protest and supporting another based on the grievance of the protesters at least appears hypocritical, if not evidence of a blatant double-standard.\n\n\"Instinctively, many of us in public health feel a strong desire to act against accumulated generations of racial injustice,\" Brown University Epidemiology Professor Mark Lurie said. \"But we have to be honest: A few weeks before, we were criticizing protesters for arguing to open up the economy and saying that was dangerous behavior ... I am still grappling with that.\"\n\nNicholas A. Christakis, professor of social and natural science at Yale, warned against officials and health experts making moral distinctions between the anti-lockdown and BLM protests. He pointed to other activities that health experts forbid during the pandemic, such as visiting loved ones in the hospital, which caused significant emotional stress.\n\n\"We allowed thousands of people to die alone,\" Christakis said. \"We buried people by Zoom. Now all of a sudden we are saying, never mind?\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Portland's Black BLM Activists Say They're Done With 'White' Antifa, Want 'Separation'\n\nOregon Public Broadcasting reports Wednesday that black members of Portland's Black Lives Matter movement are tired of their anti-racism demonstrations being hijacked by the mostly white \"Antifa\" anarchists and are working to separate the two movements as protests continue.\n\n\"Tensions between Black activists fighting for racial justice and anti-establishment protesters have bubbled beneath the surface for months,\" the outlet says, noting that many of the anti-racism protests, now in their sixth month, began as peaceful demonstrations but became violent after nightfall, when anarchist groups, who organized on social media, appeared.\n\nThe riots, which made national headlines, tainted the Black Lives Matter protests, activists say, and confused commentators who often assumed the violence developed from the demonstrations. Instead, they say, the unrest was wholly separate - and now they want the groups to disentangle.\n\n\"This week marks six months since Floyd's death, and protests continue in Portland,\" OPB reports. \"But now, activists in the city are divided as to whether they are still fighting in a racial justice movement centered on Black lives, or if an unfocused, anti-establishment fight against capitalism and state power has usurped the initial cause that brought thousands of Portlanders into the streets.\"\n\nBLM activists also contend that the largely white \"Antifa\" group is \"privileged,\" noting that many of those arrested during the protests are middle- or upper-class, are quickly free on bail, and often escape prosecution - luxuries not often afforded to people of color who tangle with the same justice system.\n\n\"Most Black people in our community don't feel like they have the privilege to go straight to the police and yell in their face,\" one activist told OPB.  \"If you're privileged, if you're white, you care less about whether or not a protest is going to result in reforms that might save even just one life. And you have the ability to be a purist in a way that Black and brown communities really do not.\"\n\nThe privilege gap becomes an even bigger problem, BLM activists say, when the Anarchists push back against peaceful protesters who suggest less violent tactics might be more effective at achieving protest goals. In Portland, especially, the notorious, Antifa-aligned Pacific Northwest Youth Liberation Front excoriated more peaceful groups for \"pacifying the nightly justice center action,\" calling members of BLM \"police collaborators.\"\n\nThe breakup does go deeper. Antifa-aligned groups tried to \"cancel\" social justice organizers, dredging up old Tweets, accusing key BLM protest leaders of sexism and \"being disrespectful to women.\"\n\nInterestingly, the calls for \"separation,\" though, have surfaced only recently, as protests are dying down. BLM was largely silent over the summer, even as the unrest in Portland threatened lives and security, and the more \"peaceful\" elements of Portland's protest community said little when Antifa-aligned groups began marching through Portland's residential areas, confronting homeowners they deemed insufficiently supportive of their cause.\n\nIt could be that the election made a difference. The Los Angeles Times reports that things began to fall apart between the two groups just a month ago - the day after the presidential election - after Antifa-aligned groups tried to \"send a message\" to leftists about party politics and attacked the city's Democratic Party headquarters.\n\n\"The day after President-elect Joe Biden delivered his victory speech, telling the nation it was time to heal and unite, a clandestine Twitter account - @safePDXprotest - summoned Portland anarchists,\" the LA Times reported. \"Word spread through the group that the target tonight would be the local headquarters of the Democratic Party. Somebody started beating a drum as a chant broke out: 'F- Joe Biden!'\"\n\nBLM activists, satisfied that President Donald Trump had likely been defeated, pushed back, claiming they'd reached their goal. At that point, BLM began accusing the anarchists of \"hijacking the movement and undermining the push for racial justice by continuing to commit violence.\"\n\nProtests in Portland have died down considerably. Although unrest over the summer drew crowds of several hundred, a demonstration over the weekend drew just over a dozen individuals.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Activist Wrecked White Student With Uncorroborated Accusations.\n\nDove is now partnering in a \"fat liberation\" campaign with a Black Lives Matter Activist accused of wrecking a white female student's life by accusing her of making threatening remarks - later admitting she may not have heard the remarks at all, according to a new report.\n\nZyahna Bryant, who celebrated on Instagram last week she was a Dove ambassador and spoke of \"fat liberation,\" accused fellow University of Virginia student Morgan Bettinger - a first-generation college student and the daughter of a police officer who had died six years before - of  saying that George Floyd protesters would make \"good speed bumps\" at a 2020 Charlottesville rally.\n\nZyahna Bryant is hired by Dove to promote 'FAT liberation' despite ruining white student's live over 'misheard' remark at BLM protest https://t.co/BvpVLWaiev pic.twitter.com/GEb2n9pNbL\n\n- Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) September 14, 2023\n\n\"The woman in this truck approached protesters in #Charlottesville, and told us that we would make 'good speedbumps,'\" Bryant, then 19, wrote. \"She then called the police and started crying saying we were attacking her.\" Bryant followed with a series of videos, but they did not show the alleged remarks, as Reason noted in a detailed article on the incident.\n\nThe group that organized the protest, Charlottesville Beyond Policing, followed by writing on Medium :\n\n... this rally and march was disturbed by a UVA student, Morgan Bettinger. Morgan drove around the public works truck blocking the street that demonstrators were convened on, and felt compelled to say, not just once, but twice, that protesters would \"make good speed bumps.\" The second time she repeated it loudly to a Black protester and added \"good f***ing speed bumps.\"\n\nThe story was amplified by local media; Bryant started a campaign demanding Bettinger's expulsion.\n\nBettinger said she had been driving home from work when she saw a dump truck blocking the road. She added that the truck didn't appear to be completely blocking the intersection, so she passed it, only later realizing the road was blocked ahead. She added that she exited her car and the truck driver began a conversation with her, during which she stated something like, \"It's a good thing that you are here, because otherwise these people would have been speed bumps.\" She said what she said had intended to thank the truck driver for protecting the protesters, some of whom were sitting in the street.\n\nAn inquiry by professional investigators at the university's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) found that three of Bryant's four allegations that she said happened before a large crowd could not be corroborated by other witnesses, Reason reported, and the fourth, that Bettinger yelled protesters would make \"good speed bumps,\" had one witness claiming it happened, but that witness contradicted Bryant and herself when interviewed. Additionally, Bryant later altered her story on that claim, acknowledging she wasn't certain she heard Bettinger make that statement at all, according to a report from the EOCR.\n\n\"While Bettinger eventually graduated from the university, she did so with a permanent mark on her record and a destroyed reputation,\" Reason reported. \"But despite two separate investigations, there's no evidence beyond Bryant's allegations that Bettinger said protestors would make 'good f***ing speed bumps' or that she threatened the protesters at all.\"\n\nBryant wrote on Instagram, \"#DovePartner Fat liberation is something we should all be talking about! That's why I am partnering with Dove, to support the work of @naafaofficial, @flareforjustice in the Campaign for Size Freedom. Tell us what Fat Liberation means to you using the hashtag #sizefreedom and tagging @dove to share your story.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "WATCH: PragerU Mini-Doc Exposes How Innocent Children Are Victimized When BLM Gets Its Way\n\nThe former BLM activist sits down with the parents of slain children.\n\nConservative media group PragerU released an already-viral short documentary on Wednesday digging into the repercussions of policies and attitudes promoted by far-Left activist group Black Lives Matter.\n\nNotably, the film, \" Their Lives Mattered: The Forgotten Victims of Crime in America ,\" is presented by a former BLM activist, Xaviaer DuRousseau.\n\nIn \"Their Lives Mattered,\" DuRousseau speaks to the families of innocent children who were slain in inner cities, crime experts, and activists to understand the heartbreaking cost of BLM-supported policies.\n\n\"I was a Black Lives Matter activist,\" DuRousseau says in the opening of the film, as shown in the teaser clip, below. \"I was initially drawn to BLM because the media convinced me that thousands of black people were being shot and killed by racist white police officers.\"\n\n\"The 'fiery but mostly peaceful' protests made me rethink my perspective,\" DuRousseau continues, referring to a CNN description of a destructive BLM protest. \"It didn't make sense to me why black rioters would loot and destroy their own communities in the name of racial justice, and why the media only cared about the loss of black life when the perpetrator was white.\"\n\nMATT WALSH'S 'AM I RACIST?' COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28\n\nHappy Gregg, a woman who lost her four-year-old son MJ to apparent gang violence in Chicago, told DuRousseau that not a single person has been prosecuted for the killing.\n\n\"When my son was murdered, I thought there would be outrage, and that justice was going to be swift,\" Gregg said. \"But I realized, there's no outrage; I'm gonna have to be that outrage, I'm gonna have to be that voice for my baby.\"\n\n\"No one even knows that a four-year-old was murdered, because there's a lot of people murdered. Like, 'get in line' is almost the tone of it, here,\" the mother said. \"Through that, I realized that a lot of children had been murdered. And I had no idea.\"\n\nThe same weekend MJ was killed, seven other children were also killed in Chicago. There was no city-wide, let alone nationwide, protest, like the media helped drum up for the death of George Floyd.\n\nDuRousseau also spoke to a man named Nathan Wallace, who lost his seven-year-old daughter Natalia to gang violence in Chicago. One man speaking alongside Wallace following the crime, posed, \"If black lives don't matter to us, how the hell is it supposed to matter to anybody else?\"\n\nOthers in the documentary, including Manhattan Institute senior fellow Rafael Mangual and STAND founder Bishop E.W. Jackson, help to shed light on crime statistics often ignored in the media and the policies and activism behind increased crime.\n\nWATCH:\n\n🎥 WATCH NOW 🎥\n\nEx-BLM activist @XAVIAERD exposes how innocent kids become victims of violent crime, de-policing, and lenient district attorneys.\n\nDo our leaders care that inner-city children are being killed?\n\nWatch #TheirLivesMattered NOW on PragerU: https://t.co/qhVfrxvyo9\n\n- PragerU (@prageru) October 23, 2024\n\nYou can view the full mini-doc, here.\n\nRelated: New Analysis: Corporate America Has Donated $82 Billion To BLM-Related Causes So Far\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "If You Don't Support Black Lives Matter, You're Fired\n\nThere will be no opting out of the Black Lives Matter movement. You're either for BLM or against it-and if you're against it, you're a racist. You will either support BLM publicly and enthusiastically, or you will be harassed, shunned, and shamed out of mainstream America. If you dare to speak a word against BLM, you will be targeted, mobbed, and probably fired.\n\nThat's the message coming through loud and clear, not just from protesters but from corporations and institutions desperate to seem woke enough to escape the wrath of the BLM movement.\n\nIt doesn't matter what your job or profession might be. It doesn't matter if you're in a position of power or prestige-in fact being in a position of power might make you more of a target. The only thing that can protect you from the BLM movement's punitive rage is fealty. Bend the knee, and you might be spared. Then again, you might not.\n\nThe list of people who have lost their jobs or been suspended for criticizing or even questioning the BLM movement is long-and growing daily. Most prominent on the list is erstwhile New York Times opinion page editor James Bennet, who \"resigned\" under pressure from woke NYT staffers after he ran an op-ed by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton that made the uncontroversial case that the U.S. military should be deployed if police can't get riots under control.\n\nThen there was Stan Wischnowski, top editor at the Philadelphia Inquirer, forced to resign over a headline of an architecture column that read, \"Buildings Matter, Too,\" which ran after scores of buildings in downtown Philly had been destroyed by rioters.\n\nBon Appétit editor-in-chief Adam Rapoport stepped down Monday after a piece he published genuflecting to BLM was deemed insufficient by staffers who claim there's a discriminatory culture at the magazine. Also, someone posted a 13-year-old photo of Rappaport in a Halloween costume that some people thought was offensive.\n\nClaudia Eller, editor-in-chief at Variety, was forced to take administrative leave after she got into a Twitter spat with a woman of South Asian descent who thought a piece Eller wrote lamenting the lack of diversity at the magazine wasn't obsequious enough.\n\nOn and on it goes. NBA announcer Grant Napear was fired from his sports talk radio program and resigned as the Sacramento Kings announcer after tweeting \"all lives matter.\" A professor at UCLA was placed on leave after refusing to cancel a final exam following the death of George Floyd. A reporter in Wales was forced to step down as Wales Book of the Year Judge after complaining that a BLM protest violated the government's social distancing rules.\n\nA cast member for MTV's reality competition series \"The Challenge\" was fired after writing \"people die every f-king day\" in response to an Instagram comment about George Floyd. Professional soccer player Aleksander Katai was \"released\" by the LA Galaxy not for anything he wrote or said, but because his wife criticized BLM on Instagram. A former Canadian cabinet minister lost three jobs after saying on television that he didn't think Canada was a racist country.\n\nThat's just a partial list.\n\nBlack Lives Matter as a political movement-as distinct from, say, thinking that black lives matter, which most Americans do because they aren't racist-isn't interested at all in ameliorating the state of black America, or fighting actual racism, or expanding liberty and justice for all under our constitutional system. This isn't an evolutionary movement but a revolutionary one. It doesn't draw on our tradition of constitutionalism but on Marxism. Its model isn't the American Revolution but the French Revolution-hence the purges, which for now are confined to the workplace.\n\nIt's fair to say the movement's power and influence are based on ideological purges. Exposing supposed racists is its modus operandi , and what began on campus has now percolated through into the mainstream of American life.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/agavedelacalle/status/1269174574962204672\n\nApologies and counterarguments won't help because the one thing the BLM movement cannot allow is honest discourse or the free exchange of ideas.\n\nConsider the case of Harald Uhlig, an economics professor at the University of Chicago and lead editor of the Journal of Political Economy, one of the country's top economics journals. A campaign is currently underway to get Uhlig fired for \"trivializing the BLM movement\" and then insufficiently apologizing for this supposed offense in a Twitter thread .\n\nHow did he trivialize the BLM movement? He wrote a blog post in 2017 defending the principle of free speech using the example of sympathetic media coverage of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. Essentially, he posed a diagnostic question about the motivations of journalists. He did this in a somewhat clumsy but provocative way, asking whether these journalists would still defend the players if instead of kneeling during the anthem they waved a Confederate flag and donned Ku Klux Klan gear.\n\nUhlig's point was that you're only really defending the principle of free speech if you're defending views you find despicable, like support for the Confederacy or the KKK. Since most journalists already agreed with the kneeling NFL players protesting police abuse, \"this isn't really an act of bravery,\" he wrote. \"This is all about defending the right to speak for those that you agree with in the first place, dressed up as a proud defense of the constitution. This is an act of a majority ganging up on one who is down. What a phony act of cowardice and pretense.\"\n\nStrong words, but certainly not \"trivializing\" the BLM movement or anyone who was protesting police abuse. In fact, Uhlig's blog post has nothing to do with the protests or BLM as such. It's a post about media coverage and the First Amendment. That much is obvious to anyone who reads what he wrote.\n\nBut no matter, the mob has come for the professor. An online petition , started by woke economists who think Uhlig's comments \"call into question his impartiality in assessing academic work on this and related topics,\" demands his resignation as lead editor of the Journal of Political Economy. \"We do not question the right of Prof. Uhlig to make such comments,\" the petition states, \"but we are strongly opposed to him holding a position of power as the editor of a prominent journal in our discipline.\"\n\nThat is, you're free to make such comments so long as you relinquish your job and \"position of power\" whenever the mob demands it.\n\nThis isn't some fringe incident in academia, by the way. This is an effort to oust the editor of a top academic journal for defending the principle of free speech. Yet among the mob calling for Uhlig's head are powerful people like Paul Krugman of the New York Times, who has been lobbing baseless smears at Uhlig for days now on Twitter, misrepresenting what he said and cheering on the people trying to get him fired.\n\nThe lesson in all of this is that the BLM movement is above all interested in power. It seeks to seize power in part by monopolizing the definition of racism and wielding accusations of racism against anyone who doesn't fall in line with its radical policy agenda .\n\nThat means you're a racist if you don't support BLM-and even if you do, you might be deemed a racist anyway. And in that case, you're fired.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "The Street Violence And Gunplay Started With The Left, Not The Right\n\nIn the wake of recent deadly clashes between Black Lives Matter activists and counter-protesters in Portland and Kenosha, Wis., the media is rolling out a new narrative: that right-wing extremists have introduced firearms to what have been, until now, \"largely peaceful protests,\" and BLM demonstrators are now trying to figure out how to keep themselves safe.\n\nConsider an appallingly dishonest New York Times headline on Tuesday that declared , \"As Guns Get Drawn at Protest Sites, Demonstrators Fear a Volatile New Phase.\" The Times frames months of protests and street violence nationwide as \"largely between protesters and the police, with the conflict playing out in tear gas volleys and lobbed projectiles.\"\n\nIn this telling, the deadly clashes in Portland and Kenosha represent \"a more perilous turn\" because of the arrival of \"right-wing activists\" with firearms who are \"bent on countering the racial justice protests with an opposing vision of America\"-as if we're seeing a peaceful and benign protest movement suddenly under threat from MAGA-hat-wearing militias.\n\nAs right-wing groups increasingly move to confront protesters in U.S. cities, demonstrators are assessing how to keep themselves safe https://t.co/g8jeTXjtTG\n\n- The New York Times (@nytimes) September 1, 2020\n\nThis is gaslighting on steroids. In fact, BLM protests have been violent from the beginning, long before \"right-wing activists\" showed up with guns. The list of shootings and violent crimes committed by BLM protesters is long, and it destroys the mainstream media's false narrative that these protests have been peaceful.\n\nThere were the fatal shootings in Seattle's CHOP back in June that left two teenagers dead and one wounded. There was the man who was burned to death inside a pawn shop during riots in Minneapolis in May. There's all the footage of BLM activists attacking people in the streets, like the Portland man who was dragged from his truck and beaten unconscious by a mob last month. And of course, there's been the persistent and widespread looting and mayhem in cities like Chicago, Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis, and elsewhere.\n\nThere has also been plenty of gunplay at these so-called protests, and any claim to the contrary is utterly divorced from reality. What follows is a partial list, just for the record.\n\nBLM Gunman Reportedly Shoots Driver In Provo, Utah\n\nIn late June, 33-year-old Jesse Taggart was arrested in Provo, Utah, after police say he ran up to an SUV that drove past a BLM protest and shot the driver through the passenger-side window . The driver, a 60-year-old Provo resident, was not part of the protest or any counter-protest, but just happened to be driving by.\n\nAfter he allegedly shot the man, Taggart reportedly ran after the vehicle as it was speeding away and fired another round, while another \"protester\" drew a weapon and pointed it at the SUV but did not fire. The driver got away but was later hospitalized.\n\nAfter the shooting, Taggart put away his firearm and continued to protest, police said. \"This same protester later approached another vehicle at 500 North and University Avenue, striking and breaking the window with the handgun.\"\n\nBLM Gunman Shot And Killed In Austin, Texas\n\nOn July 25 in Austin, Texas, BLM protester Garrett Foster was shot and killed after allegedly pointing his AK-47 at an Uber driver , later identified as U.S. Army Sgt. Daniel Perry, whose car had been surrounded by BLM protesters.\n\nAccording to Perry's attorneys, Perry mistakenly turned onto a street where a BLM march was taking place after dropping off Uber passengers. Perry, who has not been arrested or charged with a crime, told police that protesters surrounded his vehicle and began pounding on it, then Foster approached his vehicle and pointed an AK-47 at him. That's when Perry fired on Foster, striking him multiple times.\n\nPerry then drove away and called the police to report what happened. After Perry fired, a second gunman in the crowd fired a volley of shots at his vehicle as he drove away. Police are still investigating the shooting and calling for eyewitnesses to come forward.\n\nBLM Gunman Arrested For Firing At Jeep In Aurora, Colorado\n\nDuring a BLM protest in Aurora, Colo., in late July, 23-year-old Samuel Young allegedly shot at a Jeep that was trying to get through a crowd of protesters on the interstate. Young missed the Jeep but police say he hit two fellow protesters.\n\nOne of the victims was rushed to the hospital with serious injuries, the other was grazed by what police say was Young's bullet. Young was later arrested and charged with four counts of attempted first-degree homicide and four counts of first-degree assault.\n\nBLM Protesters Allegedly Fire Shotgun At Police Officer Outside His Home\n\nIn early August, a group of about 60 protesters gathered outside the home of a police officer in Wauwatosa, Wis., who is on paid administrative leave after fatally shooting a 17-year-old in February, a case that's still under investigation. During the ensuing confrontation, one of the protesters allegedly fired a shotgun at the officer as he retreated into his home. Three men have since been arrested and charged .\n\nAll this to say, don't believe The New York Times and the rest of the mainstream media when they try to tell you that firearms have only just been introduced to the toxic brew of BLM and Antifa mob action in our cities. If you haven't heard about some of the above incidents, it's because the media would rather pretend they never happened. They interfere with the narrative.\n\nFirearms and violence have been part and parcel of these demonstrations from the very beginning. The only difference now is that counter-protesters, having seen this violence play out for months on end with no law enforcement or elected officials acting to stop it, are also arming themselves.\n\nThe result is no doubt going to be more bloodshed and likely more death. But please, let's not pretend this didn't start with left-wing extremists. We all know it did.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

The images reportedly showed underaged girls in \"lewd exhibition\" of private parts or engaging in sexual activity, according to the Daily Sun .\n\nAn investigation into DeVries began after police obtained a search warrant based on information that Snapchat provided to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\n\nIn the plea and sentencing hearings, County Attorney Michaela Andruzzi called for 15 to 30 years in prison for DeVries, while one of his attorneys, Mark Sisti, argued for a year in jail plus some other sanctions.\n\n\"I think the state's request is excessive given these charges,\" said Superior Court Judge Amy Ignatius, noting, \"What the defense has asked for is too minimal ... These are incredibly serious crimes. ... This is not a victimless crime by any means.\"\n\nIgnatius said the children depicted in the photos are victimized every time they are uploaded to the internet.\n\nDeVries began his prison sentence on December 27, after being allowed to live with his wife in Sweden, Maine while out on bail.\n\nAccording to the Daily Sun , one year could be taken off his sentence if he completes sex offender treatment. His sentence includes 7 and a half to 15 years in prison suspended for five years, a $4,000 fine, and he must register as a sex offender and comply with probation.\n\nBefore DeVries has handed his sentence, he reportedly spoke to express his \"remorse, shame and guilt.\"\n\n\"He said his behavior impacted himself, his family and community. One reason he chose not to go to trial is so the photos in evidence would not have to be viewed again,\" the Daily Sun reported.\n\n\"I know I wouldn't be here today being charged with these crimes if innocent children were not victimized at some point, and I live with that as a father, a loving father,\" said DeVries. \"I am honestly horrified to be in this position.\"\n\nAndruzzi said DeVries took responsibility for his actions only because he got caught.\n\n\"He's here as a Hail Mary,\" said Andruzzi. \"He's hoping that this court will be more merciful than the state was willing to be and certainly more merciful than he was willing to be to those little girls in those pictures.\"\n\nWhile living in Conway, DeVries served on the Municipal Budget Committee from 2015-17, and had no prior criminal record.\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

The women, visiting from Texas, later claimed they were racially profiled.\n\nVaccine verification to enter many establishments in New York City is a requirement of Mayor Bill de Blasio's executive order 225 .\n\nJess Banks, the owner of the famed Italian restaurant on Manhattan's Upper West Side, made it clear that the women were denied service due to the de Blasio's vaccination requirement and shot down claims that the hostess racially profiled them.\n\n\"This turned into a mess. And from there, it's inexcusable, ridiculous,\" Banks said, adding that Carmines will now have to hire a security person to avoid similar problems in the future. De Blasio's order came with fines for businesses that do not enforce the order, but demands that businesses employ their own means of enforcing it on patrons.\n\n\"Our employee, thankfully, is safe right now.

Carmines are fascist,\" the crowd of demonstrators chanted in a chaotic scene at the restaurant.\n\nProtestors confronted a woman outside the restaurant, calling her a \"Karen.\"\n\nThe hostess, who had just started working at Carmine's several weeks ago, was up being punched, slapped and had her jewelry ripped off during the encounter, according to the New York Police Department.\n\nThe worker was left with bruises and scratches to her face and arms, authorities said. Two waiters were also reportedly hurt in the scuffle before being able to oust the unruly Texas trio.\n\nThe attack happened just days after the executive order went into full enforcement effect on September 13, requiring places of business like restaurants, bars, gyms, theaters, and most other non-retail settings to check for proof of vaccination before allowing potential customers indoors, or else risk a $1,000 fine. The city has provided no enforcement and instead relies on businesses to enforce the order for them.\n\nSimilar \"vaccine passports\" are currently in effect in the cities of San Francisco, New Orleans , and Los Angeles, and other local jurisdictions such as Seattle are considering implementing similar measures in the near future .\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.
