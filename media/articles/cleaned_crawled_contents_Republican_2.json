      "text": "Chaos as Montana GOP kicks 9 senators out of the Republican Party\n\nThe Montana Republican Party has censured nine state senators and will no longer consider them to be Republicans - but the senators say they hold firm to the conservative mantle and the party should not insert itself into legislative business.\n\nIn a press release sent April 4, the party's executive committee announced it had censured the nine senators for their \"repeated alignment with Senate Democrats\" this legislative session and for \"undermining Republican priorities and leadership.\"\n\nThe censure calls out the nine's \"unprecedented alliance\" with Senate Democrats as a \"coordinated scheme\" to undermine the GOP leadership, including alleging ethical violations by Senate President Matt Regier, found to be unsubstantiated by the Legislative Auditor .\n\nThe committee unanimously voted for the censure on March 27 to the surprise Friday of at least four of the nine.\n\n\"I'm dumbfounded,\" said Sen. Russ Tempel, R-Chester. \"I've been a Republican longer than ( state GOP Executive Director Tyler) Newcombe's been alive.\"\n\nIn an extensive letter to the head of the state GOP, obtained by the Daily Montanan, Sen. Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, said his responsibility is to the people of Montana, \"not party bosses like you.\"\n\nThe letter was an attempt to argue against the potential censure, and Kassmier emailed it to GOP Chairman Don Kaltschmidt on March 27.\n\nHowever, Kassmier said he learned Friday that Kaltschmidt did not receive the letter; Newcombe also said neither he nor Kaltschmidt have seen the letter, but they made attempts to meet with the nine.\n\nNone of the nine showed up to the executive committee meeting on March 27; several cited conflicts while others said they had never received invitations.\n\nIn the letter, Kassmier said he is a conservative who supports the agenda of Republican President Donald Trump . Kassmier also accuses Senate President Regier, R-Kalispell, of \"playing political games\" to undermine Gov. Greg Gianforte's agenda and of working with Democrats.\n\n\"I support the conservative tax plans endorsed by Gov. Gianforte. I oppose the liberal tax plans pushed by President Regier,\" the letter said. \" ... The governor's tax plans are consistent with the Montana Republican Party Platform. The tax plans pushed by President Regier are not.\"\n\nRegier said Friday he had not seen the letter. However he responded to the censure of the senators by saying it was basically an acknowledgement of the status quo in the Senate.\n\n\"It's been a very frustrating session for Republicans from the first day,\" Regier said.\n\nThe division between Senate Republicans began at the start of the 69th Legislature , when the nine - Kassmier, Tempel, Jason Ellsworth, Wendy McKamey, Gayle Lammers, Butch Gillespie, Gregg Hunter, Denley Loge, and Shelley Vance - joined all Democrats to change the chamber's rules, going against GOP leadership.\n\nThat coalition, in essence a working majority, has repeatedly flexed its muscles over the last three months to pass big pieces of legislation, change committees and at times effectively run the Senate floor, as well as block attempts to expel one of their members, Ellsworth, for ethics violations. Ellsworth has since been censured by the Senate .\n\nPreviously, the state GOP executive committee issued a statement \"strongly rebuking\" the senators, saying additional steps would follow if the group did not stop its actions against the party.\n\n\"Despite multiple calls for unity and adherence to Republican principles, the senators have chosen to align with Democrats, undermining Republican priorities and leadership,\" the statement about the censure said. \"...These Senators have undermined the Republican majority leadership and disregarded the will of Montana Republican voters.\"\n\nThe executive board also voted to withhold any political funding for the nine in future elections and said the nine shouldn't be considered to speak for the party.\n\nSen. Hunter, however, said his duty is to his constituents.\n\n\"The GOP central committee didn't elect me,\" Hunter said. \"I don't know what they're using as a litmus test or not, but if you look at the Montana conservative scorecard, I'm more conservative than most Republicans.\"\n\nSen. Wendy McKamey, R-Great Falls, said she's \"as Republican as they come,\" and the state GOP was mischaracterizing the senators' actions.\n\n\"We aren't voting with the Democrats. The Democrats are voting with us to support the governor - not doing what other Republicans are doing to fight the governor,\" McKamey said. \"We're doing the kinds of things good Republicans do.\"\n\nMcKamey also said she was recently notified that she is receiving an award from the Republican National Committee for her conservatism.\n\nIn his letter, Kassmier wrote that his \"strong conservative values\" helped him defeat state GOP Vice Chairperson Lola Sheldon-Galloway in the 2024 primary for his Senate seat.\n\nKassmier also presents himself as a fiscal conservative and alleges Regier is working with Democrats in the House and is \"a true liberal\" spending taxpayer money on things like lawyers and new office furniture.\n\n\"A real conservative would never dream of spending money like President Regier,\" Kassmier said in the letter. \"When it comes to spending taxpayer money, President Regier is not a leader I follow.\"\n\nFrom the start of the session, however, Regier has repeatedly expressed frustration with the size of the governor's budget and an interest in taking a closer look at spending in the state.\n\nThe censure Friday and allegations in the letter from Kassmier bring the split among Senate Republicans to the fore again as the legislature closes in on its last few weeks of work.\n\nHowever, Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, said he will continue to work with all 32 Republicans and talk with them daily given the limited time left in the session.\n\n\"I'd like us to see us come together and get as much good legislation as we can out of here. So I'm not disowning anybody,\" McGillvray said. \"... I cannot look at a group of Republicans and say, 'You don't belong to us anymore.'\n\n\"That's exactly a way to destroy what we need to accomplish for the good of Montana people.\"\n\nKassmier said he echoed the sentiment toward unity. \"We got a lot of work to do.\"\n\nDaily Montanan is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

John Thune with House Speaker Mike Johnson on November 14, 2024 (H ouse Speaker Johnson's Office/X.com )\n\nMany economists, from former New York Times columnist Paul Krugman to the University of Michigan's Justin Wolfers , are warning that President Donald Trump's steep new tariffs will cause a wide range of imported goods - from food to computers to building materials - to become much more expensive. And according to Krugman, tariffs may be one of the Trump policies that pushes the United States into a recession.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), are scathing critics of Trump's tariffs. And some GOP lawmakers are anti-tariffs as well, including Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) and former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky).\n\nBut in an article published by Politico on April 4, reporters Jordain Carney and Meredith Lee Hill note that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) are reluctant to criticize Trump's tariffs - even with a sharp downturn on Wall Street.\n\n\"Many Republican lawmakers are privately anxious about President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs,\" Carney and Hill explain . \"A handful of them have even expressed their alarm publicly. Their top leaders, however, are holding the line. Two days into Trump's stunning trade war, Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune are showing no sign they will pressure the (Trump) Administration to change course despite a 10 percent drop in the stock market and stark warnings from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\"\n\nThe reporters continue , \"Instead, the two top leaders say they plan to give the Trump Administration time to find more solid economic footing. That's despite their own free-trade-friendly views and unease they are hearing privately from their members.\"\n\nThune and Johnson, Carney and Hill note , are facing a \"blunt political reality\": They \"need Trump and MAGA-aligned lawmakers to get the GOP's legislative agenda through their chambers, and there are few advantages to breaking with him.\"\n\nPaul told Politico , \"People are skittish. They're all worried about it. But they are putting on a stiff upper lip to act as though nothing is happening and hoping it goes away.\"\n\nRead Politico's full article at this link ."

      "text": "Analysis shows why this 'rock-ribbed Republican' stronghold may spell trouble for Trump\n\nIn the past, Florida had a reputation for being a volatile swing state that could go either Republican or Democrat in statewide elections. GOP ex-President George W. Bush carried Florida in both 2000 and 2004 before Democratic former President Barack Obama won the Sunshine State in 2008 and 2012. Then, in the 2018 midterms, Florida's gubernatorial race was a real nail-biter, with now-Gov. Ron DeSantis narrowly defeating the Democratic nominee, former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum.\n\nBut in 2022, the far-right DeSantis was reelected by 19 percent. And in 2024's presidential election, Donald Trump defeated Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by 13 percent compared to his single-digit wins in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Wisconsin. Florida, according to political strategists, didn't act like a swing state in 2022 or 2024, but like a state that is now deep red.\n\nAccording to Politico's Charlie Mahtesian , however, the election results of Tuesday, April 1 indicate that the MAGA movement's domination of Florida politics may not be as strong as it seems.\n\nOn special elections for U.S. House seats held on Tuesday, April 1, GOP candidates enjoyed double-digit victories. Republican Jimmy Patronis defeated Democrat Gay Valimont by roughly 14 percent, and Republican Randy Fine defeated Democrat Josh Weil by 14 percent.\n\nEven so, Mahtesian stresses , their margins weren't that strong given how deep-red their congressional districts are.\n\n\"There were two special House elections in Florida Tuesday, both in comfortably Republican districts where Democrats typically don't have a prayer,\" Mahtesian explains in post-elections analysis . \"It was clear going in that Democrats were poised to overperform in each of them - a result of grassroots rage toward Trump and the party's frequent advantage in special and off-year elections. The Democratic nominees in both districts indeed ran better than expected - far better than in 2024 - but in the end, the GOP held both seats. Yet the Republican victory in Florida's Panhandle-based 1st District obscured a troubling harbinger that appears to be connected to (Elon) Musk - a loss in Pensacola's Escambia County.\"\n\nThe results in a \"rock-ribbed Republican\" U.S. House district, according to Mahtesian , indicate that billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk's \"political blast radius could be a problem for the GOP going into the 2026 midterm elections.\"\n\nEscambia County, according to Mahtesian , is \"more Deep South than South Florida.\"\n\n\"It's a place that voted for Barry Goldwater in 1964, George Wallace in 1968, delivered a nearly 20-point victory to Trump in 2024 and also voted for polarizing former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz by big margins - even after the sex scandal allegations,\" Mahtesian notes . \"On Tuesday, however, Escambia County broke with habit and narrowly voted for Democrat Gay Valimont over Republican Jimmy Patronis. In 2024, when Valimont was also the Democratic nominee, she lost there by 14 points. In fact, across the four counties that make up the 1st District, Valimont lost by 32 points in 2024. On Tuesday, that margin was cut in half - she lost by 15.\"\n\nCharlie Mahtesian's full article for Politico is available at this link ."

      "text": "Swing state Republican literally phones it in to town hall as voters express fear\n\nAs Republicans face increasingly critical crowds in town halls or avoid them altogether, Rep. Scott Perry (R-10) held a telephone town hall to answer constituents' questions.\n\nPerry's event came a week after a Democratic state Senate candidate won a special election in a Trump+15 District in Lancaster County, not far from his own congressional district. And on Tuesday, a liberal candidate for Wisconsin's state Supreme Court beat a conservative opponent. It was  a race widely seen as a referendum on Trump's agenda, and in particular the role of billionaire megadonor Elon Musk, who poured millions into the contest.\n\nPerry expressed both praise and skepticism of Musk and his role as the figurehead of the Department of Government Efficiency, which has led the Trump administration's efforts to slash tens of thousands of federal jobs and cancel contracts across federal agencies - usually without warning.\n\nThe Republican lawmaker also answered questions on the sweeping tariffs announced by President Donald Trump earlier in the day, efforts to thwart federal judges who have blocked parts of Trump's agenda, and concerns that Republicans will cut programs like Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThe town hall came after weeks of demands for Perry to communicate directly with constituents. He faced some tough questions, but not the rowdy crowds that met other Republicans who held events in person.\n\nAs Trump came into office and quickly began slashing federal spending and cutting tens of thousands of jobs, voters in the 10th Congressional District demanded their representative's ear. Beginning in February, there were protests outside of his district offices. And last month, labor leaders and other advocates held a town hall in his absence at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Conference Center in Swatara Township, Dauphin County, that drew around 150 constituents.\n\nPraise and skepticism of Elon Musk\n\nMultiple callers asked Perry about Musk, who has become one of the most prominent and controversial figures in the Trump administration's orbit.\n\nPerry, who has echoed many of Musk's claims of fraud and waste on social media, expressed both praise and skepticism of the entrepreneur-turned-presidential advisor.\n\nUltimately, he said that it's been a source of \"frustration\" that Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has not been more transparent about their claims that their sweeping cuts have saved tens of billions of dollars.\n\nHis statement was in response to a question about why lawmakers had to raise the debt ceiling, despite Musk's claimed spending cuts.\n\n\"I will tell you, I have a personal frustration,  and we have asked, 'Let's see the details on DOGE,'\" Perry said. \"We can't see granularly at this point. I know there's a website and it says, 'We have eliminated this contract' or 'We have eliminated this spending.' But we have to put that in a frame of reference in the appropriations bill to see where that came from.\"\n\nMusk's DOGE has come under fire practically since it started operating, in part because of false or exaggerated claims of savings . Following media fact checks, the New York Times reported that DOGE made changes to its website which made it harder to independently verify claims of savings.\n\nThough that has not stopped Perry from sharing Musk's unverified claims of finding fraud on social media.\n\nBut, he also praised DOGE, and their work identifying inefficiencies in the government's record-keeping systems. Perry noted those systems are too numerous and struggle to communicate with one another, opening them up to fraud. He also said that he'd like to see DOGE operatives look at how to cut spending in the Medicare and Medicaid programs\n\n\"Washington's been on a reckless spending spree for way too long,\" Perry claimed at the top of the call. \"That's why we have to codify many of the cuts proposed under the Department of Government Efficiency, ensuring that we actually reduce the waste and reign in the federal overreach once and for all. Quite honestly, the waste is simply breathtaking.\"\n\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\n\nSupport for Trump's Tariffs\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump unveiled his long-promised plan to place tariffs, which will affect more than 100 nations and trading partners.\n\nAsked for his thoughts on the issue, Perry was generally supportive. Though he noted he had not had advanced notice of the details of the tariff plans and was still reviewing them. He also said that he would like to see exemptions for products like coffee and cocoa that generally can not be grown the U.S.\n\nSince Trump promised to announce the sweeping tariffs on Wednesday, U.S. and foreign markets fell. Prices on a broad range of products are also expected to rise, and consumer confidence reached a four-year low.\n\nYet the hope for tariff supporters is that the move will bolster the consumption of American made products, and incite companies to move manufacturing into the U.S. - instead of importing products produced with cheaper labor elsewhere.\n\n\"I know there's going to be some market adjustments, but I also know that prior to the national income tax, our country was basically funded by tariffs,\" Perry said.\n\nWhile tariffs were a primary source of income for the United States for decades, they were largely phased out following World War II, the introduction of income tax, and the increase of global trade.\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\nConstituents express fears of cuts to social programs\n\nMultiple people asked Perry about whether there will be cuts to benefit programs like Medicaid and Social Security.\n\nAll but one House Republican voted in February on a broad outline of a plan that would cut $2 trillion in federal spending. Perry was quick to point out that the fine points of how that spending will be cut haven't been worked out.\n\n\"That's what we call the top line, and these are the targets to get to,\" Perry said.\n\nDemocrats have warned that the only way to make those cuts possible would be by eating into the funding of social programs. But, Perry noted that Senate Republicans were not likely to agree to such large cuts, and that they would ultimately have to compromise.\n\nThe congressman acknowledged that, in order to reduce the deficit, lawmakers will have to take a hard look at these programs.  He expressed optimism that cuts could be made by eliminating alleged fraud.\n\n\"There's fraud and abuse and that and improper payments,\" Perry said about Social Security. \"We're finding out that people have abused these systems to the tune of hundreds of millions, and maybe billions and billions, of dollars. We can't continue down that road. At a minimum, we should make sure that that stuff is stopped, so that the people that have paid in can get out what they're expecting.\"\n\nA recent audit of the Social Security program found billions in improper payments between 2020 and 2023, but those makes up a small fraction - less than 1% - of all payments made by the multi-trillion dollar program. And not all of those overpayments were due to fraud.\n\nPerry also said he'd be open to making fewer Americans eligible for Medicaid.\n\n\"Working adults have become the largest subgroup of Medicaid because of the way it's been expanded,\" Perry said. \"The real problem ... is that we can't afford it, because we have just a huge amount of spending where we never had it before ... It wasn't what it was designed for.\"\n\nMedicaid was vastly expanded under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Since then, virtually all American citizens who haven't aged into Medicare, and can't obtain comparable insurance through an employer or spouse, can get on a federally-funded plan. Though what the government's share of that cost is depends on a recipient's income.\n\n\"The expanded population is 90% of [what the] federal government is paying, and so it's actually diverting the resources away from the truly needy people,\" Perry said. \"We've got to take a look at it to make sure that the eligibility requirements are being met for the truly needy\"\n\nAnother constituent asked about the impact of cuts to the Social Security Administration's workforce, and whether it would make it more difficult to access services.\n\nPerry said while people may be experiencing difficulty getting a golf of Social Security employees since workforce cuts to federal agencies, the issue isn't new.\n\n\"I'm not for cutting the staff if the staff is necessary,\" Perry said.  \"But we've dealt for a long time with Social Security in our office, because people could not get timely answers. And unfortunately for us, that's not a new circumstance.\"\n\n\"I don't know if it's becoming more acute,\" Perry added.\n\nMedicaid sign at U.S. Senate Democrats' press conference on Feb. 19, 2025. (Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)\n\n\"Activist judges\"\n\nPerry was asked by a Trump-supporting constituent what he hoped to do about judges that have blocked some of the administration's policies from taking effect. That includes his ban on birthright citizenship, his efforts to strip deportation protections from Venezuelans, and blocking federal funding for institutions that provide gender-affirming care for youth.\n\n\"We have these activist judges just right and left impeding him every step they go,\" the caller said. \"Why isn't funding being pulled?\"\n\nInjunctions with nationwide effects ordered by federal judges have drawn the ire of numerous Republicans lawmakers. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), has warned that lawmakers may take action, including defunding or restructuring federal courts.\n\nPerry, however, took a more measured approach.\n\n\"We do control the power of the purse, but I don't know that there really is any way to single out individual judges,\" Perry said. \"We would be essentially forced to cut the entire portion of some judiciary and I don't think that's probably responsible when there's one or two bad actors.\"\n\nPerry also said he does not believe impeachment is wise. He said it could \"bog down\" Congress, and would almost certainly fail in the Senate where a two-thirds vote is required.\n\nBut Perry was asked specifically about a resolution introduced by Arizona Republican Rep. Andy Biggs, which contends that judges can be removed with a simple majority vote by taking advantage of a constitutional loophole.\n\nThe Constitution states that judges \"shall hold their offices during good behavior,\" and Biggs' resolution argues that Judge James E. Boasberg, who attempted to block Trump from deporting hundreds of alleged gang members to El Salvador, has violated it. Though it would likely face legal challenges, the resolution is an effort to skirt the two-thirds vote requirement of impeachment.\n\nPerry warned against the tact.\n\n\"There's oftentimes activism on both sides,\" Perry said. \"When Republicans are in the Executive branch, then there might be activists on the Democrat side, and vice versa. So you've gotta understand that things cut both ways.\"\n\nPennsylvania Capital-Star is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nBob Ward, partner with Fabrizio Ward, the firm of veteran GOP pollster Tony Fabrizio, said that the idea that the Republican Party is going to take away people's health insurance will be a \"political problem\" for the party.\n\n\"I think you'd find support for getting rid of waste and fraud,\" Ward said. \"But the whole idea that we're going to take away people's health insurance and that's not going to be a political problem for us, I don't know where that comes from,\" he told Politico in an interview published Monday.\n\n\"There's really not a political appetite out there to go after Medicaid to pay for tax cuts,\" the GOP pollster said, acknowledging that Medicaid has made a difference in peoples' lives. \"People have made up their minds about what they don't want to see cut,\" he continued.\n\nFabrizio Ward is owned by Tony Fabrizio, who was Trump's 2024 campaign pollster. A new polling from the firm said a majority of people who voted for Trump oppose potential moves from congressional Republicans to cut Medicaid funding.\n\nApproximately two-thirds of swing voters expressed their disapproval of cutting the safety-net health program in the context of the GOP's broader initiative to implement a partisan package that includes tax cuts, enhanced border security, and increased defense expenditures.\n\nThese numbers from Fabrizio Ward, the firm responsible for the survey, emerge as some Republicans voice their opposition to Medicaid cuts intended to fund that package. However, they may have limited alternatives, considering the significant deficit reduction goals lawmakers are facing.\n\nOn Saturday, several House Republican lawmakers pledged to oppose the comprehensive budget proposal that Senate Republicans had approved earlier.\n\nReps.

REUTERS/Nathan Howard\n\nOne House Republican in a swing district is now publicly rebuking President Donald Trump's administration after one of his budget cuts directly impacted his constituents.\n\nActing Social Security Administration (SSA) head Leland Dudek recently announced that he would be not be renewing the lease on the agency's office in White Plains, New York when it comes up on May 31, and that he was rejecting a bipartisan effort by Reps. George Latimer (D-N.Y.) and Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) to keep it open. Dudek attributed the closure to persistent mold issues in the building that the General Services Administration (GSA) had been unable to address.\n\nIn a letter to Dudek, both Latimer and Lawler emphasized that the White Plains office was the only one serving residents in the Lower Hudson Valley, and that closing it would make it that much harder for their constituents to be able to attend hearings that will determine their benefits. He tweeted : \"Concerns about mold don't justify abandoning folks in the Lower Hudson Valley.\"\n\n\"The decision to close the only Social Security Hearing Office in the Hudson Valley is a slap in the face to thousands of my constituents who rely on these services,\" Lawler stated . \"This office handles over 2,000 backlogged cases and conducts hundreds of in-person hearings every year. Telling my constituents that they now have to travel hours to Lower Manhattan, New Haven, the Bronx or Goshen is completely unacceptable.\"\n\nAccording to South African centibillionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the lease on the White Plains office is approximately $511,000 per year . And that lease is one of nearly two dozen cancelled for the SSA across multiple states. Similar to Reps. Latimer and Lawler, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) has cautioned against closing the White Plains office , stressing that the building is vital for thousands of New Yorkers who rely on SSA benefits.\n\n\"As the only hearing office in the lower Hudson Valley region, it's closure will negatively impact thousands of constituents who reside in these seven counties,\" Gillibrand wrote in a February letter. \"If SSA does not open an alternative site, beneficiaries will be required to travel between 24 and 135 miles to be serviced by the closest office in New York City, Albany, New Jersey and Connecticut.\"\n\nLawler's public stance against one of Trump's budget cuts is particularly noteworthy, given that he recently lauded the administration's efforts to cut out \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government agencies during a tele-town hall. The New York Republican didn't specifically talk about DOGE's cuts to the SSA, but he did tell constituents: \"There are things they're doing that I think are beneficial. There are other things where I think they're going very fast, and they need to dot their i's and cross their t's before pulling the trigger.\""

More recently, the party fought legislation signed by former President Joe Biden to cap prescription drug prices.\n\nBut as Trump begins his second term, many of the voters who sent him back to the White House welcome more robust government action to rein in a health care system many Americans perceive as out of control, polls show.\n\n\"That idea that government should just keep its hands off, even when things are tough for people, has kind of lost its sheen,\" said Andrew Seligsohn, president of Public Agenda, a nonprofit that has studied public attitudes about government and health care.\n\n\"We're wandering around the country with a set of old, outdated frameworks about what ordinary Democrats and ordinary Republicans like,\" he said.\n\nRepublican voters strongly back federal limits on the prices charged by drug companies and hospitals, caps on patients' medical bills, and restrictions on how health care providers can pursue people over medical debt.\n\nEven Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program that Republican congressional leaders are eyeing to dramatically cut, is viewed favorably by many GOP voters, like Ashley Williamson.\n\nWilliamson, 37, a mother of five in eastern Tennessee who voted for Trump, said Medicaid provided critical assistance when her mother-in-law needed nursing home care. \"We could not take care of her,\" Williamson said. \"It stepped in. It made sure she was taken care of.\"\n\nWilliamson, whose own family gets coverage through her husband's employer, said she would be very concerned by large cuts in Medicaid funding that could jeopardize coverage for needy Americans.\n\nFor years, Republican ideas about health care reflected a broad skepticism about government and fears that government would threaten patients' access to physicians or lifesaving medicines.\n\n\"The discussions 10 to 15 years ago were all around choice,\" said Christine Matthews, a Republican pollster who has worked for numerous GOP politicians, including former Maryland governor Larry Hogan. \"Free market, not having the government limit or take over your health care.\"\n\nMatthews and fellow pollster Mike Perry recently convened and paid for several focus groups with Trump voters, including Rouse and Williamson, which KFF Health News observed.\n\nSkepticism about government lingers among rank-and-file Republicans. And ideas such as shifting all Americans into a single government health plan, akin to \"Medicare for All,\" are still nonstarters for many GOP voters.\n\nBut as tens of millions of Americans are driven into debt by medical bills they don't understand or can't afford, many are reassessing their inclination to look to free markets rather than the government, said Bob Ward, whose firm, Fabrizio Ward, polled for Trump's 2024 campaign.\n\n\"I think most people look at this and say the market is broken, and that's why they're willing for someone, anyone, to step in,\" he said. \"The deck is stacked against folks.\"\n\nIn a recent national survey , Fabrizio Ward and Hart Research, which for decades has polled for Democratic candidates, found that Trump voters were more likely to blame health insurers, drug companies, and hospital systems than the government for high health care costs.\n\nSarah Bognaski, 31, an administrative assistant in upstate New York, is among the many Trump voters who say they resent profiteering by the health care industry. \"I don't think there is any reason a lot of the costs should be as high as they are,\" Bognaski said. \"I think it's just out of pure greed.\"\n\nHigh health care costs have had a direct impact on Bognaski, who was diagnosed four years ago with Type 1 diabetes, a condition that makes her dependent on insulin. She said she's ready to have the government step in and cap what patients pay for pharmaceuticals. \"I'd like to see more regulation,\" she said.\n\nCharles Milliken, a retired auto mechanic in West Virginia, who said he backed Trump because the country \"needs a businessman, not a politician,\" expects the new president to go even further.\n\n\"I think he's going to put a cap on what insurance companies can charge, what doctors can charge, what hospitals can charge,\" said Milliken, 51, who recently had a heart attack that left him with more than $6,000 in medical debt.\n\nThree-quarters of Trump voters back government limits on what hospitals can charge, Ward's polling found.\n\nAnd about half of Trump voters in a recent KFF poll said the new administration should prioritize expanding the number of drugs whose price is set through negotiation between the federal Medicare program and drug companies, a program started under the Biden administration.\n\nPerry, who's convened dozens of focus groups with voters about health care in recent years, said the support for government price caps is all the more remarkable since regulating medical prices isn't at the top of most politicians' agenda. \"It seems to be like a groundswell,\" he said. \"They've come to this decision on their own, rather than any policymakers leading them there, that something needs to be done.\"\n\nOther forms of government regulation, such as limits on medical debt collections, are even more popular.\n\nAbout 8 in 10 Republicans backed a $2,300 cap on how much patients could be required to pay annually for medical debt, according to a 2023 survey by Perry's polling firm, PerryUndem. And 9 in 10 favored a cap on interest rates charged on medical debt.\n\n\"These are what I would consider no-brainers, from a political perspective,\" Ward said.\n\nBut GOP political leaders in Washington have historically shown little interest in government limits on what patients pay for medical care. And as Trump and his allies in Congress begin shaping their health care agenda, many Republican leaders have expressed more interest in cutting government than in expanding its protections.\n\n\"There is oftentimes a massive disconnect,\" Ward said, \"between what happens in the caucuses on Capitol Hill and what's happening at family tables across America.\"\n\nNOW READ: That Trump 'backlash' may not be real - here's why\n\nWe'd like to speak with current and former personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services or its component agencies who believe the public should understand the impact of what's happening within the federal health bureaucracy.

Cindy Hyde-Smith previously secured $250,000 for a group that works to prevent child abuse in her home state of Mississippi and GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski requested more than $5 million to help fund homeless shelters and prevent child abuse in Alaska.\"\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement that the legislation \"is a power grab for the White House and further allows unchecked billionaire Elon Musk and President Trump to steal from the American people.\"\n\nDeLauro continued:\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, echoed DeLauro's criticism of the Republican bill, calling it a \"a slush fund continuing resolution that would give Donald Trump and Elon Musk more power over federal spending-and more power to pick winners and losers, which threatens families in blue and red states alike.\"\n\n\"Instead of turning the keys over to the Trump administration with this bill,\" said Murray, \"Congress should immediately pass a short-term CR to prevent a shutdown and finish work on bipartisan funding bills that invest in families, keep America safe, and ensure our constituents have a say in how federal funding is spent.\"\n\nIn a fact sheet released over the weekend, Murray's office noted that full-year government funding bills typically provide \"scores of specific funding directives for key programs and priorities\" that constrain the executive branch.\n\nBut under the GOP continuing resolution, the fact sheet observes, \"hundreds of those congressional directives fall away,\" giving the Trump administration broad discretion to \"reshape spending priorities, eliminate longstanding programs, pick winners and losers, and more.\"\n\n\"Under this CR, the Trump administration could-for example-decide not to spend funding previously allocated for combatting fentanyl, the SUPPORT Act, and other substance abuse and mental health programs, or specific NIH priorities like Alzheimer's disease and vaccine research-and instead steer funding to other priorities of its choosing,\" the document states. \"It could also pick and choose which Military Construction, Army Corps, or transit improvement and expansion projects to fund without direction from Congress.\"\n\nA similar fact sheet released by DeLauro warns that the CR \"provides a blank check to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the amount of $4 billion, enabling Elon Musk to direct contracts to Starlink and SpaceX (companies owned by Musk) at a time when unvetted and unchecked SpaceX employees have burrowed in the FAA (the same Federal agency that regulates SpaceX), with no requirement for public transparency, fair competition, or congressional approval.\"\n\n\"This continuing resolution is a blank check for Elon Musk and creates more flexibility for him to steal from the middle class, seniors, veterans, working people, small businesses, and farmers to pay for tax breaks for billionaires,\" said DeLauro.\n\nThe Republican bill is expected to get a House vote as soon as Tuesday evening. In a post to his social media platform on Saturday, Trump praised the CR as \"very good\" and demanded lockstep unity from his party, which has willfully ceded the power of the purse in the opening weeks of the president's second White House term.\n\nTrump's call for \"no dissent\" from Republicans stems from the party's narrow majorities in the House and Senate. In the latter chamber, the bill will need at least seven Democratic votes to pass.\n\nNOW READ: How the corporate media has normalized Trump to the point of absurdity"

Although countless medical professionals have attacked Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaxxer views as dangerous to public health, Senate Republicans confirmed him as director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nOnly a few Senate Republicans - namely, Maine's Susan Collins and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski - have been willing to join Democrats in rejecting any of Trump's nominees.\n\nIn a biting article published by the conservative website The Bulwark ,  \"Senate Republicans Perfect the Art of Appeasement,\" on February 26, journalist John Avlon (best known for his work with CNN and, before that, the Daily Beast) argues that Senate Republicans are failing badly when it comes to their role in the United States' system of checks and balances.\n\n\"Senators have voted to advance individuals like Pete Hegseth, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, and Kash Patel - people who are, by any objective standard, not only experientially unqualified for the positions to which they had been nominated, but repeatedly advanced beliefs that are contrary to fact, science, and America's national interest,\" Avlon laments . \"No matter. Senators who expressed rational concerns early on folded at the critical moment. I have been told by a member of the U.S. Senate that any Republicans who suggested they might vote against Donald Trump's nominees were threatened with a primary, paid for by Elon Musk.\"\n\nAvlon continues , \"That's not the worst of it. According to Vanity Fair's Gabriel Sherman, Sen. Thom Tillis told colleagues of 'credible death threats' reported by the FBI when he was considering a vote against Pete Hegseth. The threats appeared to have their effect: Tillis voted 'yes,' and Hegseth was confirmed, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.\"\n\nAvlon emphasizes that when GOP senators are willing to confirm nominees they consider woefully unqualified, that \"submission to threats\" is very bad for \"American democracy.\"\n\n\"This is not consistent with the American tradition,\" Avlon warns , \"but it's a pattern that history recognizes all too well. It is the advancement of an agenda through fear. It is the appeal to greed. It is the belief that might makes right.\"\n\nAvlon continues , \"It never ends well, but in the short run, the logic is self-serving. Don't speak out. Don't stand up. Don't apply your principles consistently. Just go along with the party, and you'll keep your job. This is a dereliction of duty by a Senate required under the Constitution to give advice and consent before a president's Cabinet nominations can be sworn in. It is evidence of cowardice by people in power.\"\n\nJohn Avlon's full article for The Bulwark is available at this link ."

(AP Photo/Butch Dill)\n\nA guest looks over the program for Donald Trump Jr.'s visit to speak at the Alabama Republican Party's Trump Victory Celebration, Thursday, April 3, 2025, in Birmingham, Ala. (AP Photo/Butch Dill)\n\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - On a day when stock markets around the world dropped precipitously, Alabama Republican Party Chairman John Wahl led a celebration of the president whose global tariffs sparked the sell-off.\n\nWith no mention of the Wall Street roller coaster and global economic uncertainty, Wahl declared his state GOP's \"Trump Victory Dinner\" - and the broader national moment - a triumph. And for anyone who rejects President Donald Trump , his agenda and the \"America First\" army that backs it all, Wahl had an offer: \"The Alabama Republican Party will buy them a plane ticket to any country in the world they want to go to.\"\n\nWahl's audience - an assembly of lobbyists and donors, state lawmakers, local party officials and grassroots activists - laughed, applauded and sometimes roared throughout last week's gala in downtown Birmingham, the rare Democratic stronghold in one of the nation's most Republican states. The president's son Donald Trump Jr. elicited perhaps the most enthusiasm with an unapologetically partisan pitch, even repeating the lie that his father won the 2020 election over Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nYet beyond the cheerleading, there were signs of a more cautious optimism and some worried whispers over Trump's sweeping tariffs, the particulars of his deportation policy and the aggressive slashing by his Department of Government Efficiency .\n\nThat doesn't mean Trump or Republicans are in danger of losing their grip in Alabama, where the GOP holds all statewide offices, dominates the Legislature and has won every presidential electoral vote since 1980. But it's a notable wrinkle in a place where there's long been tension between relying on the federal government for funding and jobs, and an embrace of the kind of anti-Washington, anti-establishment populism that has twice propelled Trump to the Oval Office. And any cracks for Trump in Alabama - where he got 65% of the vote in 2024 - could portend trouble elsewhere, as the effects of a seismic shift in U.S. policy reach across the economy and society.\n\n\"There are some concerns, some conversations,\" said John Merrill, a former secretary of state, over just what Trump's agenda will mean on the ground. Alabama, he acknowledged, has \"been a net recipient\" of the very federal government and economic model Trump is upending, meaning it receives more money back from Washington than its taxpayers send the federal government.\n\n\"It's a big risk,\" said Merrill, who sported a Trump 45-47 pin on his lapel, a nod to the president's two terms.\n\nBlocks to the south of the complex where Republicans convened sits the multibillion-dollar University of Alabama at Birmingham health system, a regional gem where research depends on grants from the National Institutes of Health .\n\nRepublican Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, listed as a \"Silver Sponsor\" of the gala, didn't join the Democratic attorneys general suing the Trump administration to stop the cancellation of certain research funding streams Congress already has approved.\n\nMost of the medical services provided at UAB and many other hospitals throughout the state are covered by Medicare and Medicaid , two of the largest federal outlays. Alabama, because its per-capita income ranks among the lower tier among states, has one of the most generous federal match rates for Medicaid funding.\n\nA short drive west toward Tuscaloosa sits a gargantuan Mercedes-Benz complex , one of the earliest examples of foreign auto manufacturers coming to the American South, where state laws are hostile to organized labor . The plants have provided jobs at wages higher than the local norms but in some cases lower than in union shops of the Great Lakes region around Detroit. Many suppliers have followed in the South, but not so many that the assembly plants don't still import many parts that now will be subject to Trump's tariffs .\n\nTerry Martin, a county GOP committeeman in Tallapoosa County, said he supports the tariffs as leverage. Trump has \"something to bargain with,\" Martin said. But, \"the parts that are coming from overseas ... it's going to pop it up\" in price, he said, at least in the short term.\n\nAgriculture, meanwhile, is still a dominant Alabama industry. Meat processing plants in the North and row crop farms in the South depend on migrant labor that Merrill, the former secretary of state, said involves workers who are in the U.S. both legally and illegally. Alabama, he recalled, passed its own strict immigration bill during Barack Obama's presidency only to roll it back after industry leaders complained of a depleted workforce.\n\nWahl, in an interview after the gala, took a more nuanced approach than he did at the podium.\n\n\"It is possible to secure our border and still take into account migrants who deserve to be here,\" he said. \"This has to be a two-pronged approach.\"\n\nBack in Birmingham, Interstate 65 splits the city. The aging, increasingly congested artery is a local priority for widening. The proposal has support from Alabama's two Republican senators, Tommy Tuberville and Katie Britt. U.S. interstate projects, though, are typically a 90-10 split, meaning 90% of the money comes from Washington, 10% from the state.\n\nThat funding - along with money for schools, Medicaid and other areas - could be at risk with Trump adviser Elon Musk and DOGE carrying Trump's blessing to slash spending. GOP lawmakers who control Congress have supported Trump's agenda, which also includes dismantling the Education Department .\n\nTallapoosa County GOP Chair Denise Bates said \"absolutely\" there's a possibility DOGE could go too far. \"I hope there are guardrails,\" she said, noting she was once a local school board member.\n\n\"Am I 100% for getting rid of the Department of Education? I can't say that I am,\" she said, adding a phrase similar to Merrill's description of the state as a whole. \"You know, we're a net receiver.\"\n\nYet for all the caveats offered in one-on-one conversations, the GOP crowd cheered when Tuberville, the former football coach turned Trump acolyte on Capitol Hill , offered a plainspoken defense of Musk and his pop-up agency, telling the crowd, \"We're dead broke.\" And they roared as he addressed tariffs.\n\n\"It's past time we level the playing field and tell the rest of the world to get off their ass and start paying their fair share,\" Tuberville said.\n\nBates argued that Alabama's embrace of Trump's \"America First\" push is not simply loyalty to the president. She said it reflects generations of voters watching the steel industry decline in Birmingham and, after the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted in 1994, the textile industry leaving for Mexico and, eventually, Southeast Asia.\n\n\"We just want jobs,\" she said.\n\nStill, state Sen. Jabo Waggoner, the longest-serving member of the Alabama Legislature, made clear Trump's visceral appeal, declaring him \"the most popular president here since Ronald Reagan, hands down.\"\n\nWahl recalled Trump's first massive outdoor rally as a presidential candidate: 30,000 people at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama, in August 2015.\n\nWahl, who owns a butterfly farm outside Huntsville, said perhaps the best way to understand Trump and Alabama and this moment of uncertainty is to see a president who, at least to his supporters in the state, has earned the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\"He's going to let everybody know he's serious,\" the chairman said. Trump is \"going to bring people to the bargaining table. We're actually going to see the negotiator conduct business.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - As stock markets tumble in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs , Republicans in Congress were watching with unease and talking of clawing back their power to levy tariffs - but almost none seemed ready to turn their words into action.\n\nThe Republican president is upending longstanding GOP principles like support for free trade, yet despite clear misgivings and a Constitutional mandate to decide tariffs, most lawmakers were not ready to cross Trump. Instead, they were focusing all their attention on advancing the president's \" big, beautiful bill \" of tax breaks and spending cuts, even as tariffs - in essence, import taxes - threatened to raise consumer prices across the board and push the global economy into a recession.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., joined by Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., the GOP whip, left, talks to reporters ahead of announcements by President Donald Trump on tariffs, at the Capitol, in Washington, Tuesday, April 1, 2025. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nAs the fallout from Trump's announcement reverberated around global markets, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who has made it clear he is no fan of tariffs, told reporters that he would give Trump \"the benefit of the doubt\" in hopes that the announcement was just a scare tactic to prod foreign leaders into negotiating better trade deals with the U.S.\n\n\"The president is a dealmaker if nothing else, and he's going to continue to deal country by country with each of them,\" said Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who is no. 2 in GOP Senate leadership. He added that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had told Senate Republicans this week that the tariffs announced by Trump would be a \"high level mark with the ultimate goal of getting them reduced\" unless other countries retaliate.\n\nBut countries like China are already retaliating with tariffs of their own, and while the president has signaled he is open to negotiations, he was mostly sounding a defiant tone Friday, saying on social media that \"MY POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE\" while claiming that foreign investors were lining up to invest in U.S. industries. He was on the golf course Friday near his Mar-a-Lago private club in Florida.\n\nCongress, however, was jittery.\n\nA handful of Republicans have rebuked Trump's strategy as a foolhardy path that will burden U.S. households. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longtime Senate leader who was the standard-bearer for past generations of Republicans, released a lengthy statement saying, \"As I have always warned, tariffs are bad policy, and trade wars with our partners hurt working people most.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., attends a news conference discussing the Republican-backed budget plan at the Capitol, in Washington, Thursday, April 3, 2025. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nMcConnell and three other Republicans joined with Democrats this week to help pass a resolution that would nullify Trump's tariffs on Canada, sending a rebuke to the president just hours after his \"Liberation Day\" announcement. But House Speaker Mike Johnson quickly indicated he has no interest in giving the resolution a vote.\n\nLawmakers' struggle to act showed the divide among Republicans on trade policy, with a mostly younger group of Republicans fiercely backing Trump's strategy. Rather than heed traditional free trade doctrine, they argue for \"America First\" protectionism and hope it will revive U.S. manufacturing.\n\nRepublican Sen. Josh Hawley said that workers in his home state of Missouri were \"absolutely thrilled\" with the tariffs. \"We've been losing jobs left and right. Farmers want to see a fair deal for our products, both in Canada and in Mexico and from the (European Union),\" he added.\n\nFor their part, Democrats slammed Trump's tariffs as a reckless maneuver meant to do nothing more than raise funds for the tax breaks Trump and Republicans are trying to pass.\n\n\"Why would he raise the costs on American families by $5,000, as it's estimated? Simply because his very wealthy billionaire friends want a greater tax break,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech Friday.\n\nOther Democrats challenged more Republicans to stand up to Trump. \"If they truly believe in capitalism, they need to put their votes where capitalism is and that is that competition works, our world relationships work,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., at a news conference.\n\n\"Donald Trump is taking us backwards to the Great Depression,\" she added.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who holds libertarian economic views, has been highly critical of the tariffs, warning they create the same economic problems that exacerbated the Great Depression. He is calling for Congress to reject Trump's plans with legislation that would require congressional approval for taxes on imports.\n\nOther Republicans were looking for roundabout ways to check the president's power on trade policy. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a senior Republican from Iowa, introduced a bipartisan bill Thursday that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire.\n\nAlthough Grassley emphasized that he had long been working on the idea, the timing of the bill was notable. It gave Republicans a chance to talk about their distaste for import taxes and raised the prospect of Congress clawing back some of its power over tariffs. The Constitution gives Congress the responsibility of setting taxes and tariffs, but over the last century, lawmakers have ceded much of their power over import taxes to the president.\n\nA handful of Republicans said they were favorable to Grassley's proposal, though the idea of directly defying Trump seemed to squelch potential for quick action.\n\n\"I don't want to do it in a politically charged environment,\" said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican. \"But I absolutely agree. This was set up by the Founding Fathers to be Congress's role. And, I think we're way past the point of what the Founding Fathers ever wanted to have happen.\"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Brian Schatz seized on the hesitation from Republicans, saying on social media Friday that the Senate would overwhelmingly repeal or constrain tariff authority \"if every Senator voted their conscience and their state's interest.\"\n\n\"Mostly everyone hates this, they are just too afraid of the Mad King at the moment,\" Schatz added.\n\nSen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, also predicted the bill would never pass \"because of the voting requirements in the Senate.\"\n\nBut he was still taking to social media to offer a folksy bit of advice: \"Tariffs are like whiskey: A little whiskey, under the right circumstances, can be refreshing - but too much whiskey, under the wrong circumstances, can make you drunk as a goat.\"\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nRepublicans have retained control of the U.S. House of Representatives maintaining the majority in the chamber over Democrats following a fierce 2024 election for a few dozen House seats.\n\nFILE - The Capitol is seen in Washington, Nov. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Republicans have won enough seats to control the U.S. House, completing the party's sweep into power and securing their hold on U.S. government alongside President-elect Donald Trump .\n\nA House Republican victory in Arizona, alongside a win in slow-counting California earlier Wednesday, gave the GOP the 218 House victories that make up the majority. Republicans earlier gained control of the Senate from Democrats.\n\nWith hard-fought yet thin majorities, Republican leaders are envisioning a mandate to upend the federal government and swiftly implement Trump's vision for the country .\n\nLee esta historia en español .\n\nThe incoming president has promised to carry out the country's largest-ever deportation operation , extend tax breaks, punish his political enemies, seize control of the federal government's most powerful tools and reshape the U.S. economy. The GOP election victories ensure that Congress will be onboard for that agenda, and Democrats will be almost powerless to check it.\n\nWhen Trump was elected president in 2016, Republicans also swept Congress, but he still encountered Republican leaders resistant to his policy ideas, as well as a Supreme Court that was ideologically divided. Not this time.\n\nWhen he returns to the White House, Trump will be working with a Republican Party that has been completely transformed by his \"Make America Great Again\" movement and a Supreme Court dominated by conservative justices, including three that he appointed.\n\nTrump rallied House Republicans at a Capitol Hill hotel Wednesday morning, marking his first return to Washington since the election.\n\n\"I suspect I won't be running again unless you say, 'He's good, we got to figure something else,'\" Trump said to the room full of lawmakers who laughed in response.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, who with Trump's endorsement won the Republican Conference's nomination to stay on as speaker next year, has talked of taking a \"blowtorch\" to the federal government and its programs, eyeing ways to overhaul even popular programs championed by Democrats in recent years. The Louisiana Republican, an ardent conservative, has pulled the House Republican Conference closer to Trump during the campaign season as they prepare an \"ambitious\" 100-day agenda.\n\n\"Republicans in the House and Senate have a mandate,\" Johnson said earlier this week. \"The American people want us to implement and deliver that 'America First' agenda.\"\n\nTrump's allies in the House are already signaling they will seek retribution for the legal troubles Trump faced while out of office. The incoming president on Wednesday said he would nominate Rep. Matt Gaetz , a fierce loyalist, for attorney general.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Jim Jordan, the chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, has said GOP lawmakers are \"not taking anything off the table\" in their plans to investigate special counsel Jack Smith, even as Smith is winding down two federal investigations into Trump for plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate .\n\nStill, with a few races still uncalled the Republicans may hold the majority by just a few seats as the new Congress begins. Trump's decision to pull from the House for posts in his administration - Reps. Gaetz, Mike Waltz and Elise Stefanik so far - could complicate Johnson's ability to maintain a majority in the early days of the new Congress.\n\nGaetz submitted his resignation Wednesday, effective immediately. Johnson said he hoped the seat could be filled by the time the new Congress convenes Jan. 3. Replacements for members of the House require special elections, and the congressional districts held by the three departing members have been held by Republicans for years.\n\nWith the thin majority, a highly functioning House is also far from guaranteed. The past two years of Republican House control were defined by infighting as hardline conservative factions sought to gain influence and power by openly defying their party leadership. While Johnson - at times with Trump's help - largely tamed open rebellions against his leadership, the right wing of the party is ascendant and ambitious on the heels of Trump's election victory.\n\nThe Republican majority also depends on a small group of lawmakers who won tough elections by running as moderates. It remains to be seen whether they will stay onboard for some of the most extreme proposals championed by Trump and his allies.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile, is trying to keep Democrats relevant to any legislation that passes Congress, an effort that will depend on Democratic leaders unifying over 200 members, even as the party undergoes a postmortem of its election losses.\n\nIn the Senate, GOP leaders, fresh off winning a convincing majority, are already working with Trump to confirm his Cabinet picks. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota won an internal election Wednesday to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longest serving party leader in Senate history.\n\nThune in the past has been critical of Trump, but praised the incoming president during his leadership election bid.\n\n\"This Republican team is united. We are on one team,\" Thune said. \"We are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump's agenda.\"\n\nThe GOP's Senate majority of 53 seats also ensures that Republicans will have breathing room when it comes to confirming Cabinet posts, or Supreme Court justices if there is a vacancy. Not all those confirmations are guaranteed. Republicans were incredulous Wednesday when the news hit Capitol Hill that Trump would nominate Gaetz as his attorney general. Even close Trump allies in the Senate distanced themselves from supporting Gaetz, who had been facing a House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.\n\nStill, Trump on Sunday demanded that any Republican leader must allow him to make administration appointments without a vote while the Senate is in recess. Such a move would be a notable shift in power away from the Senate, yet all the leadership contenders quickly agreed to the idea. Democrats could potentially fight such a maneuver.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's social media supporters, including Elon Musk, the world's richest man, clamored against picking a traditional Republican to lead the Senate chamber. Thune worked as a top lieutenant to McConnell, who once called the former president a \"despicable human being\" in his private notes .\n\nHowever, McConnell made it clear that on Capitol Hill the days of Republican resistance to Trump are over.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that the Supreme Court was ideologically divided, not with a liberal majority, when Donald Trump was elected president in 2016.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Chris Jackson, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Republicans have taken control of the U.S. Senate and are fighting to keep their majority in the U.S. House, which would produce a full sweep of GOP power in Congress alongside President-elect Donald Trump in the White House.\n\nA unified Republican grip on Washington would set the course for Trump's agenda . Or if Democrats wrest control of the House, it would provide an almost certain backstop, with veto power over the White House.\n\nTrump, speaking early Wednesday at his election night party in Florida, said the results delivered an \"unprecedented and powerful mandate\" for Republicans.\n\nHe called the Senate rout \"incredible.\" And he praised House Speaker Mike Johnson , who dashed from his own party in Louisiana to join Trump. \"He's doing a terrific job,\" Trump said.\n\nFrom the U.S. Capitol, Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell , privately a harsh Trump critic, called it a \"hell of a good day.\"\n\nVote counting in some races could go on for days, and control of the House is too early to call.\n\nThe rally for Republicans started early on election night in West Virginia, when Jim Justice, the state's wealthy governor, flipped the seat held by retiring Sen. Joe Manchin. From there, the Republicans marched alongside Trump across the Senate map.\n\nRepublicans toppled Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, the first incumbent senator to fall, with GOP luxury car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno. They chased Democrats in the \"blue wall\" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where Vice President Kamala Harris strained to carry the party forward, though Democrats avoided a total wipeout as Elissa Slotkin won an open Senate seat in Michigan and Sen. Tammy Baldwin was reelected in Wisconsin.\n\nDemocratic efforts to oust firebrand Republicans Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida collapsed. The unexpected battleground of Nebraska pushed Republicans over the top. Incumbent GOP Sen. Deb Fischer brushed back a surprisingly strong challenge from independent newcomer Dan Osborn .\n\nIn one of the most-watched Senate races, in Montana, Democrat Jon Tester, a popular three-term senator and \"dirt farmer\" in the fight of his political career, lost to Trump-backed Tim Sheehy, a wealthy former Navy SEAL, who made derogatory comments about Native Americans, a key Western state constituency.\n\nAll told, Senate Republicans have a chance to scoop up a few more seats, potentially delivering their most robust majority in years - a coda to outgoing GOP Leader McConnell , who made a career charting a path to power, this time by recruiting high-wealth Republicans aligned with Trump.\n\nHe told reporters at a Capitol news conference that a Senate under Republican control would \"control the guardrails\" and prevent changes in Senate rules that would end the filibuster.\n\nMcConnell declined to answer questions about his past stark criticism of Trump or about the prospects of potential nominees in a new administration. He also said he viewed the election results as a referendum on the Biden administration.\n\n\"People were just not happy with this administration and the Democratic nominee was a part of it,\" McConnell said.\n\nThe fight for control of the House became a state-by-state slog, much of which unfolded far from the presidential race.\n\nHouse races are focused in New York and California , where Democrats are trying to claw back some of the 10 or so seats where Republicans have made surprising gains in recent years.\n\nOther House races are scattered around the country, with some of the most contentious in Maine, the \"blue dot\" around Omaha, Nebraska, and in Alaska.\n\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said the House \"remains very much in play.\"\n\nTo gain control of the House, Democrats need to flip four seats from Republicans, while holding all of their own, a tall task especially in congressional districts where Trump has won.\n\nIt could come down to just a handful of seats, or as little as one, to determine House control.\n\nJohnson voiced confidence, posting on X: \"Republicans are poised to have unified government in the White House, Senate, and House.\"\n\nHarris ignited enthusiasm for her party when Biden dropped out of the race, and she stepped in atop the ticket, a head-spinning development barely 100 days from the election. But Democrats watched their own hopes for a sweep of Washington fizzle.\n\nVoters said the economy and immigration were the top issues facing the country, but the future of democracy was also a leading motivator for many Americans casting ballots in the presidential election.\n\nAP VoteCast, an expansive survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide, found a country mired in negativity and desperate for change as Americans faced a stark choice between Trump and Harris .\n\nThis is the first presidential election since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, when Trump sent a mob of his supporters to \"fight like hell\" against the 2020 election. Many Republicans in Congress voted against President Joe Biden's victory. Congress will again be called on next year to certify the 2024 election.\n\nEven still, the election followed one of the most chaotic congressional sessions in modern times as the Republican-led House kicked out its speaker, Kevin McCarthy, threatened government shutdowns and had difficulty conducting the basic operations of governance.\n\nJohnson has said Republicans in the House and Senate have been working on an \"ambitious\" 100 day-agenda - cutting taxes, securing the U.S. border and taking a \"blowtorch\" to federal regulations - if they sweep the White House and Congress.\n\nTrump himself has promised mass deportations and retribution on his perceived enemies. Republicans want to push federal agencies out of Washington and restaff the government workforce, Johnson said, to bring the federal government \"to heel.\"\n\nTrump is \"thinking big\" about his legacy, Johnson said.\n\nSeveral states will send history-makers to the new Congress.\n\nVoters elected two Black women to the Senate , Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware and Democrat Angela Alsobrooks, who defeated Republican Larry Hogan, the former governor, in Maryland. Just three Black women have served in the Senate, and never before have two served at the same time.\n\nAnd in New Jersey, Andy Kim became the first Korean American elected to the Senate. The seat opened when Bob Menendez resigned this year after his federal conviction on bribery charges.\n\nIn the House, candidate Sarah McBride , a Democratic state lawmaker from Delaware who is close to the Biden family, became the first openly transgender person elected to Congress.\n\nWhat's still unclear is who will lead the new Republican Senate, as longtime leader McConnell prepares to step down from the post.\n\nSouth Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican, and Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who previously held that post, are the front-runners to replace McConnell in a secret-ballot election scheduled for when senators arrive in Washington next week.\n\nBillions of dollars have been spent by the parties, and outside groups, on the narrow battleground for both the 435-member House and 100-member Senate.\n\nIf the two chambers do in fact flip party control, as is possible, it would be rare.\n\nRecords show that if Democrats take the House and Republicans take the Senate, it would be the first time that the chambers of Congress have both flipped to opposing political parties.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves, Kevin Freking and Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - After one of the most chaotic and least productive sessions in modern history, voters made a surprising choice in elections for the U.S. House -- they overwhelmingly stuck with the status quo.\n\nHouse Republicans will hold onto a thin majority , and while the chamber's exact partisan divide is still to be determined as votes are tallied in a handful of states, the results of 435 House races nationwide have produced hardly any change to the makeup of the chamber.\n\nIn fact, it's more like a stalemate: Republicans and Democrats have each flipped seven seats, while just eight incumbents nationwide have lost their races.\n\nThe results show just how entrenched the political dynamics have become in a legislative chamber that is meant to closely reflect the will of the people. Neither Donald Trump's sweep of swing states nor a record of two years marked by infighting among GOP House members seemed to weigh much on House election results. Instead, the contest for control of the chamber boiled down to just a couple dozen politically divided districts and fewer truly close races even as House candidates nationwide spent a combined $1.5 billion, according to Open Secrets, which tracks political spending.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries called it \"bitterly disappointing\" to see his party's bid to retake the House fall short by just a few seats. But he also made sure to note, \"Notwithstanding the adverse political environment that happened with a Trump wave sweeping every single battleground state in America, Democrats will actually have increased the number of seats in the new Congress.\"\n\nStill, that hasn't stopped Republican leaders from taking a victory lap and talking of a mandate to implement a conservative agenda.\n\n\"On Election Day, Americans sent a clear message to reject the consequences of Democratic control,\" said Rep. Richard Hudson, the chair of the GOP's House campaign committee, adding, \"That's why voters delivered House Republicans a majority and sent Donald Trump to the White House in a landslide.\"\n\nTrump is on track to win the popular vote for the first time, but it will likely be a narrow victory once all ballots are counted, reflecting how politically deadlocked the country has become. In the House, the margins will also be close, particularly after Trump chose several House Republicans for roles in his administration.\n\n\"Every single vote will count,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson . \"Because if someone gets ill, or has a car accident or a late flight on their plane, then it affects the votes on the floor.\"\n\nJohnson's party held onto the majority largely thanks to two seats the party flipped in Pennsylvania, as well as three more that were redistricted by the GOP-controlled North Carolina General Assembly to favor their party.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, did best in New York - Jeffries' home state - where they flipped three seats. They also picked up two redistricted seats, in Louisiana and Alabama, that were ordered by courts to ensure fair representation for Black voters.\n\nBut as the congressional map becomes clear after the latest redistricting cycle following the 2020 census, some democracy advocates are concerned about the small number of House districts that are in play.\n\nWhile Republicans for years won more congressional seats than expected through gerrymandered districts, Democrats have battled back by shaping districts to their advantage and essentially evened out the playing field.\n\n\"The consequences are that the people's House barely reflects the will of the people. Voters have very little possibility to shift the balance of power in the House even when their moods change,\" said David Daley, who has written about gerrymandering and is a senior fellow at FairVote, an organization that advocates for voting reforms.\n\nFairVote estimates that 85% of House seats are now safe for one party - the highest percentage it has tracked in two decades. Political polarization also plays a role in that trend, and Daley said it has resulted in a dynamic where House members are less likely to work across the aisle and are more worried about facing a primary opponent who criticizes them for not being partisan enough.\n\nSeveral of the incumbents who lost reelection, such as Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo of Colorado or Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro of New York, were some of the most willing to work on bipartisan legislation.\n\nBut now that Republicans hold the House, Senate and White House, there is little talk of working with Democrats. Instead, they hope to use a special budget process to implement partisan legislation aimed at extending tax breaks, bolstering immigration enforcement at the southern border and dismantling federal regulations.\n\nTo do that, they will also have to overcome the infighting that has hampered them the last two years - and cracks are already showing in their unity.\n\nIn an internal vote this week, Johnson received his party's nomination to remain speaker when the new Congress starts Jan. 3. But lawmakers are still haggling over whether to keep in place rules that allowed a small group of conservatives to trigger the ouster of Johnson's predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy .\n\nWith a razor-thin majority, almost any Republican can block legislation from moving forward, as the conservative bloc has done periodically.\n\n\"As usual, it's going to be very difficult for Congress to get anything done,\" said Rob Speel, a political science professor at Penn State Behrend.\n\n__\n\nThis story was first published on Nov. 16, 2024.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nDORAL, Fla. (AP) - President Donald Trump regaled House Republicans on Monday with a rhetorical highlight reel from his first week in office, and he urged them to support his immigration crackdown and border security proposals.\n\n\"We have no apologies and we're moving very fast,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I really focus on the border more than anything else,\" he said, downplaying the importance of inflation , an issue that fueled his candidacy last year but one that he has less control over as president.\n\nSpeaking at House Republicans' annual policy retreat, Trump made clear his political ambitions as he rallied lawmakers to advance their conservative agenda.\n\n\"We're forging a new political majority that's shattering and replacing Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal coalition, which dominated American politics for over 100 years,\" he said.\n\nThe conference is being held at Trump National Doral Miami, a posh resort with four golf courses owned by the billionaire president. Although Republicans are euphoric over election victories that have given them total control in Washington, they're also facing difficult negotiations in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThey need to find consensus on a spending bill before a March 14 deadline, when funding for the federal government expires.\n\nIn addition, Republicans are working on a budget blueprint that would set the stage for their broader plans, including tax cuts, fossil fuel development and border security. With thin majorities in the House and Senate, they will need near-unanimity to pass their proposals without Democratic support.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, set the first week of February for the House Budget Committee to pass the blueprint that is key to the whole process.\n\n\"That will be where the lion's share of these campaign promises we made are fulfilled,\" Johnson said. \"And that's what all the hard work here is, in the room with all of us negotiating and coming to consensus.\"\n\nPolitical capital is almost always at its peak at the start of a new presidential term, even more so because this is Trump's second and he is prevented under the Constitution from a third.\n\nHowever, that didn't stop Trump from joking Monday about running again.\n\n\"I think I'm not allowed to run again,\" Trump said as he turned to Johnson. \"Am I allowed to run again, Mike?\"\n\nJohnson is trying to lump many of the Republican priorities into one massive catch-all bill that Senate Democrats cannot filibuster, but many Republican senators think it would be better to do two bills - the first focused on border security and defense, and the second on extending and expanding upon the tax cuts passed in Trump's first term.\n\n\"Whether it's one bill, two bills, I don't care,\" Trump said in Doral.\n\nRepublicans are also eyeing potential changes to key safety net programs, such as work requirements for those participating in Medicaid, to help offset the cost of enacting their priorities. Trump has pushed expensive ideas like exempting tipped wages and Social Security checks from income taxes.\n\nHouse Republicans said they expect more specifics to be announced after the retreat in Doral. Until then, they were highlighting Trump's first week in office, particularly reveling in the showdown Trump had with Colombia this past weekend over accepting flights of deported migrants from the U.S.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Colombia agreed to all of Trump's terms, \"including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay.\"\n\n\"Think about it, President Trump, I don't even think had finished the front nine before he successfully forced the Colombian president to take back their illegal immigrants,\" said Rep. Lisa McClain , R-Mich. \"The days of America being walked all over are long gone thanks to President Trump.\"\n\nOn the budget fight to come, Democrats are already casting it as one that would primarily benefit the wealthy at the expense of others, with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries labeling the Republican effort a \"contract against America.\"\n\n\"It will hurt working families, hurt the middle class, hurt our children, hurt our seniors and hurt our veterans,\" Jeffries said.\n\nRepublicans are warning that if Congress does not act quickly to extend tax relief, capital will remain on the sidelines and families next year would see child tax credits and a guaranteed tax deduction greatly reduced, upping their federal tax bill.\n\nOne of Trump's parting admonitions to lawmakers in the room was to stick together because \"we have a chance to win like never before.\"\n\n\"There's nothing we cannot achieve as long as the Republican Party remains united. I hope you can remain united,\" Trump said.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

She is fighting the establishment. And that, to me, is enough,\" said Bob Hunt, a Republican in Tucson who attended a Lake rally this summer.\n\nMcCain, who died in 2018, never lost a race in his home state. But his maverick brand of Republicanism is in retreat after election-denying allies of the former president swept GOP primaries this month from governor and U.S. Senate down to the state Legislature.\n\nKelli Ward, the primary challenger McCain trounced in his last re-election campaign, was elected state GOP chair in 2019. She broke with precedent for party leaders and campaigned openly for Trump's slate of candidates ahead of the primary this year.\n\nIt is in some ways a return to roots for Republicans in Arizona, a state with a long history as a crucible for emerging strands of conservatism.\n\nBarry Goldwater, an Arizona senator from the 1950s through the 1980s, pushed the GOP in a new direction, laying the groundwork for conservative and libertarian movements. He gave voice to anti-elite grievances and racial anxieties that have contributed to Trump's appeal.\n\nMcCain replaced Goldwater in the Senate, representing an Arizona reshaped by decades of migration. Young families flocked to affordable neighborhoods in and around Phoenix, and retirees escaping the snow settled in new golf communities attracting seniors.\n\nMcCain eventually built a national profile as a fiscal conservative unafraid - even eager - to buck GOP leadership. He helped pass campaign finance reform legislation and worked on unsuccessful immigration reform and climate change legislation. In one of his last defiant decisions, he gave a dramatic thumbs down vote to kill legislation that would have repealed former President Barack Obama's health care law.\n\nMcCain won over independents and some Democrats to overwhelmingly win reelection. But the apostasies that appealed to more moderate voters made him a pariah to many within his own party.\n\nDemocrats think this year's slate of Trump-backed nominees gives them a fighting chance to win some of the top offices on the ballot. If the Republicans win, officials who refuse to accept Trump's defeat in the 2020 election will hold the levers of power with the ability to set election laws and certify results in a state that plays an important role in determining control of Congress and the presidency.\n\nIdeological factions are always at tension within political parties, and Arizona Republicans have long hosted a particularly raucous tug-of-war. Pro-business, limited government conservatives - such as McCain, former Sen. Jeff Flake and termed-out Gov. Doug Ducey - are derided as \"Republicans in name only\" by a base eager to fight culture war battles.\n\nStill, a large chunk of Republican voters like the establishment brand. Lake had a tough primary race against Karrin Taylor Robson, a conservative businesswoman and longtime donor to mainstream candidates from both parties. Lake, Finchem and the other successful Trump allies all won their primaries with less than 50% of the vote in multi-candidate fields.\n\n\"The people we put up are not conservative,\" said Kathy Petsas, a Republican activist who backed mainstream Republicans in the primary. \"There's nothing conservative about lying about the results of the 2020 election. When we undermine our democratic institutions, there's nothing conservative about that.\"\n\nBut rarely have the insurgents been as dominant as they are now in Arizona. The GOP nominees for nearly all statewide offices push lies about the 2020 election.\n\nLake incessantly went after Ducey, McCain, Flake and others she labeled \"Republicans in name only\" on her way to winning the GOP nomination for governor. She joined with Mark Finchem, who won the primary for secretary of state, in a lawsuit seeking to require hand-counting of ballots; they lost, but filed an appeal this week.\n\nU.S. Rep. Paul Gosar was censured by the House and lost his committee assignments for posting a video depicting violence against Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe primary winners represent those who control the Arizona Republican Party today and are fiercely loyal to Trump, who was just the second Republican since the 1940s to lose Arizona.\n\nLast year, the party censured McCain's widow, Cindy McCain, for endorsing Joe Biden's presidential campaign, along with Flake and Ducey. Flake decided not to run for re-election in 2018 after his criticism of Trump infuriated the base and promised a fierce primary battle.\n\n\"Unfortunately, all these election deniers were successful here in Arizona, in a swing state,\" said Bill Gates, the Republican chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, which has faced vitriolic backlash for defending the 2020 election against Trump's false claims of fraud. \"So we'll see if those folks are able to win in the general election. I think that will give us a feel on where this party is headed in the future.\"\n\nGates was censured by Legislative District 3 Republicans last month for saying election-denying GOP candidates may have to lose for the party to find its way.\n\nRusty Bowers, the staunchly conservative speaker of the state House, also has found himself ostracized by his party for taking a stand against Trump's lies. He lost the primary in his bid to move to the state Senate.\n\nBowers last month said Trump has \"thrashed our party\" and that the Arizona GOP faces a \"hard reckoning\" if it continues to bully those who don't fall in line with the former president's demands.\n\nFor now, the far-right wing of the party is ascendant and sees no need to moderate.\n\nDays after Lake won the primary for governor, her campaign shared a video of Goldwater's speech accepting the 1964 Republican nomination for president.\n\n\"I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,\" he said. \"And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.\"\n\nThe crowd erupted. Goldwater went on to win just six states in the second most lopsided defeat in a presidential race in U.S. history, but he remained a hero to many in his home state.\n\nLake's official campaign Twitter account said a united party would bring \"a Conservative revival\" to the state in the general election: \"The Party of Goldwater has risen like a Phoenix.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "The GOP's Fears About Musk Are Growing\n\nSome Republicans are starting to worry about what DOGE could mean for them and their constituents.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nRepresentative Richard Hudson has a bold prediction for how Donald Trump and Elon Musk's purge of the federal government will play out for his party in next year's elections. \"I think voters are going to reward us,\" the North Carolina Republican told me. \"The Democrats have made a huge miscalculation by establishing themselves as the party defending waste, fraud, and abuse.\"\n\nAs chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), Hudson is tasked with keeping the GOP in power, and his enthusiasm suggests that the party leadership won't be backing away from Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency anytime soon. When I asked Hudson whether he had any concerns about DOGE or its billionaire leader, he replied quickly and unequivocally: \"Not at all.\"\n\nSome of Hudson's Republican colleagues aren't so sure. They've seen the polls showing how unpopular Musk and DOGE are. They've heard from angry voters at town-hall meetings who are worried about the loss of jobs and government services. And now they've begun registering their own complaints with the White House and DOGE staffers, both in private and in group meetings that Musk has attended.\n\nRead: DOGE is courting catastrophic risk\n\nThe GOP's fears about DOGE appear to be growing, based on conversations I had with a dozen House Republicans this week. Several of them suggested to me that the Trump administration's campaign to slash the federal workforce could threaten not only their constituents but also their party's chance to retain its narrow majority.\n\n\"There needs to be more of a strategic approach,\" Representative Dan Newhouse, a sixth-term Republican from Washington State, told me. \"A lot of the directives seem to be arbitrary.\" Newhouse said he had expressed concerns to the White House about agricultural cuts in his district and told the administration that DOGE shouldn't ignore Congress. \"It can't be just one entity\" making spending decisions, he said.\n\nRepresentative Pete Sessions of Texas, a former chair of the NRCC, told me that DOGE's leadership had failed to adequately communicate to the public what the agency is doing and why. \"It's been controversial,\" Sessions said. \"There's a lot of good that has come from it, but it needs to be more organized, better explained.\"\n\nIn gently criticizing DOGE, Republicans seem to be weighing their desire to reduce the government's size and scope-which they have campaigned on for decades-against their unease with the way the administration is going about it. Musk has gloated about feeding entire agencies \"into the wood chipper,\" and neither he nor Trump has expressed much interest in consulting the branch of government that putatively controls federal spending. (Some Republicans did tell me, however, that in private, Musk has become more receptive to their concerns.) \"What people say is Be professional ,\" Representative Austin Scott of Georgia told me when I asked him what he was hearing about DOGE from his constituents. He repeated the message: \" Be professional .\"\n\nRead: DOGE's plans to replace humans with AI are already under way\n\nEven Hudson has sent signals to Republicans that might give them reason to doubt his stated confidence about DOGE's popularity: Last week he privately urged House Republicans to avoid in-person town halls in favor of teleconferences, which they could more easily control. In our interview, Hudson defended the directive by accusing Democratic activists of \"hijacking\" public forums in GOP districts. His advice to Republican lawmakers: \"If the real people in the district are upset, yeah, you need to take it to heart.\"\n\nSo far, the Republican gripes about DOGE fall far short of a revolt. Indeed, a revolt hardly seems likely in today's GOP. In his second term, the president has demanded complete loyalty from Republicans in Congress-\"NO DISSENT,\" Trump warned on the eve of a vote this week on government funding-and with few exceptions, his party has complied.\n\nWhen a single House Republican, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, defected on the funding vote, Trump called for him to face a primary challenger and said he'd meet the same fate as former Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who lost her seat after turning on Trump. The next day, The New York Times reported that Musk wanted to contribute $100 million to a group backing Trump's agenda-a sign that Musk might be willing to use his wealth to help the president keep his party in line.\n\nSome of the Republicans I spoke with were all in on DOGE, especially those from districts that Trump easily carried. Representative Andy Harris, the chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told me that voters in his Maryland district \"don't want their taxpayer dollars paying for fraud, waste, and abuse.\" \"They want the administration to get to the bottom of it,\" Harris said. \"They appreciate the efforts that are being made.\"\n\nYet because of its proximity to Washington, D.C., Harris's district includes one of the highest percentages of federal workers of any area represented by a Republican in Congress. I asked him what he'd say to a constituent who had lost their job because of DOGE's cuts. \"I say the same thing to people who are laid off from private industries that have become bloated and inefficient: Look, that's the way the American economy works,\" Harris replied.\n\nSome Republicans began our conversation by voicing unqualified support for Trump and Musk-and ended by contemplating the dangers that DOGE poses to their districts. \"I can't tell you the amount of people that came up to me saying, Keep it up. We want this. We need it. The government has been growing so much ,\" Representative Juan Ciscomani of Arizona told me. Unlike Harris, who won his reelection easily last year, Ciscomani prevailed only narrowly in one of the nation's most competitive House races.\n\nBut when I asked about his constituents whose jobs could be jeopardized by federal cuts, Ciscomani's tone shifted. The southeast corner of Arizona that he represents includes the state's largest passport-processing center as well as a large number of military veterans, who rely on-and in some cases work at-the Veterans Affairs facilities located in his district. Ciscomani would prefer that Trump and Musk not touch those areas. \"I will stand the line on that and defend that,\" he told me. Ciscomani said he represents nearly 25,000 federal employees; for comparison, he won reelection last year by only about 10,000 votes. \"I've got a lot of stake in this, a lot of skin in the game for my district to make sure that we protect these areas,\" he said.\n\nTo the frustration of Democrats, some senior Republicans who communicated their concerns to the White House have won reprieves for federal facilities in their districts that the administration wanted to close. And many GOP lawmakers welcomed Trump's statement last week indicating that Cabinet secretaries, not Musk, would be in charge of staffing reductions at their agencies-an announcement that followed a reported clash between the DOGE chief and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nRead: Is DOGE losing steam?\n\nEven though Republicans are starting to feel more backlash over DOGE, they declined a key opportunity this week to wrest back their spending power. On Tuesday, the GOP House majority passed a six-month government-funding bill that did little to restore (or codify) the cuts that Trump and Musk are making. Republican negotiators also rejected Democratic demands to add language to the legislation that would restrain DOGE. As a result, Democrats said the bill further empowers the Trump administration to make cuts unilaterally-an argument that GOP leaders themselves then used to win the support of conservative hard-liners.\n\nIn some respects, the spending bill is an odd proposal for Republicans to rally around. It would extend Biden-era funding levels through the first eight months of the GOP governing trifecta. Republicans have, in effect, voted to keep spending money on agencies, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, that the Trump administration has all but shut down. GOP leaders say the move buys the party time to develop a budget that locks in the cuts that Musk has identified and, in many cases, already made. But it also prevents Republicans from having to take politically difficult votes that they've dodged in the past. When I asked Andy Harris why Republicans wouldn't vote to cut spending on USAID-an agency that no longer exists, thanks to Musk's wood chipper-he replied, \"We don't have to.\"\n\nHudson said the decision to forgo major cuts in this funding bill was a matter of prudence. \"We can't just cut blindly,\" he told me. \"We have to know what we're cutting.\" It's a message that some House Republicans wish he would deliver to Elon Musk."

      "text": "Confessions of a Republican Exile\n\nA longtime conservative, alienated by Trumpism, tries to come to terms with life on the moderate edge of the Democratic Party.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nP olitically, I'm a bit of a wanderer . I grew up in a progressive family and was a proud democratic socialist through college. Then, in the Reagan-Thatcher era of the 1980s, after watching the wretched effects some progressive social policies had on poor neighborhoods in Chicago, I switched over to the right-and then remained a happy member of Team Red for decades. During the era of social thinkers like James Q. Wilson, Allan Bloom, Thomas Sowell, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Irving Kristol, the right was just more intellectually alive. But over time I've become gradually more repulsed by the GOP-first by Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay, then by the Tea Party and the Freedom Caucus, and now, of course, by Donald Trump.\n\nSo these days I find myself rooting for the Democrats about 70 percent of the time. I've taken up residence on what I like to call the rightward edge of the leftward tendency, and I think of myself as a moderate or conservative Democrat. But moving from Red World to Blue World is like moving to a different country. The norms, fashions, and values are all different. Whenever you move to a new place or community or faith, you love some things about it but find others off-putting. So the other 30 percent of the time a cranky inner voice says, \"Screw the Democrats, I'm voting for the GOP.\"\n\nFor context, let me explain a little more about my political peregrinations. I think of myself as a Whig, part of a tradition that begins with Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Party in the 18th century, continues through the Whig Party of Henry Clay and then the early Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln in the 19th, and then extends to the Republican Party of Theodore Roosevelt in the 20th. Whigs put social mobility at the center of our politics. If liberals prioritize equality and libertarians prioritize individual freedom, Whigs ask: Which party is doing the most to expand opportunity, to help young people rise and succeed in our society? Which party is doing the most to cultivate energy, ambition, creativity, and daring in the citizenry?\n\nToday, Whigs don't have a permanent home. During the Reagan-Thatcher years, Republicans were the party of dynamism, but now they have become backward looking and reactionary. At the Democratic National Convention, I watched Michelle Obama talk about the generations of mothers who sacrificed so their children could rise and realize their full potential. Those are the people that Whigs like me want the American government to support. So here I find myself, almost all the way to joining Team Blue.\n\nRead: The Democrats aren't on the high road anymore\n\nBut my new suit is ill-fitting. I'm still not fully comfortable as a Democrat. And given that there are many other former Republicans who have become politically homeless in the Age of MAGA, I thought it might be useful to explain, first, what it is about the left that can make a wannabe convert like me want to flee in disgust-and then to explain why, ultimately, I've migrated in that direction despite sometimes having to suppress my gag reflex.\n\nP rogressive aristocrats could accept these realities and act like a ruling class that has responsibilities to all of society. But the more they dominate the commanding heights of society, the more aggressively progressive aristocrats posture as marginalized victims of oppression. Much of what has come to be called \"wokeness\" consists of highly educated white people who went to fantastically expensive colleges trying to show the world, and themselves, that they are victims, or at least allied with the victims. Watching Ivy League students complain about how poorly society treats them is not good for my digestion.\n\nElites then use progressivism as a mechanism to exclude the less privileged. To be a good progressive, you have to speak the language: intersectionality, problematic, Latinx, cisgender . But the way you learn that language is by attending some expensive school. A survey of the Harvard class of 2023 found that 65 percent of students call themselves \"progressive\" or \"very progressive.\" Kids smart enough to get into Harvard are smart enough to know that to thrive at the super-elite universities, it helps to garb yourself in designer social-justice ideology. Last spring, when the Washington Monthly surveyed American colleges to see which had encampments of Gaza protesters , it found them \"almost exclusively at schools where poorer students are scarce and the listed tuitions and fees are exorbitantly high.\" Schools serving primarily the middle and working classes, in contrast, had almost no encampments.\n\nThis privilege-progressivism loop is self-reinforcing. A central irony of the progressive aristocracy is that the most culturally progressive institutions in society are elite universities-but the institutions that do the most to reinforce social and economic inequality are ... those same elite universities. Sure, they may assign Foucault and Fanon in their humanities classes, but their main function is to educate kids who grew up in the richest, most privileged households in America and launch them into rich and privileged adult lives.\n\nAfter college, members of the progressive aristocracy tend to cluster in insular places like Brooklyn or Berkeley where almost everybody thinks like them. If you go to the right private school, the right elite college, and live in the right urban neighborhood, you might never encounter anyone who challenges your worldview. To assure that this insularity is complete, progressives have done a very good job of purging Republicans from the sectors they dominate, like the media and the academy.\n\nRead: The campus-left occupation that broke higher education\n\nThe progressive aristocracy's assumption that all sophisticated people think like them, its tendency to opine about the right without ever having seriously engaged with a single member of that group, the general attitude of moral and intellectual superiority-in my weaker moments, all of it makes me want to go home and watch a bunch of Ben Shapiro videos.\n\nA second trait that's making it hard for me to fully embrace the Democratic Party is its tendency toward categorical thinking. People in Blue World are much more conscious of categories than people in Red World are. Among the Democrats, the existence of groups like White Dudes for Harris, or Asians for Harris, is considered natural and normal.\n\nThis kind of identity-politics thinking rests on a few assumptions: that a person's gender, racial, or ethnic identity is the most important thing about them; that we should emphasize not what unites all people but what divides them; that history consists principally of the struggle between oppressor and oppressed; that a member of one group can never really understand the lived experience of someone in another group; and that the supposedly neutral institutions and practices of society-things like free speech, academic standards, and the justice system-are really just tools the dominant groups use to maintain their hegemony.\n\nRead: Kamala Harris and the Black elite\n\nThese assumptions may or may not be correct (some of them are, at least to a degree), but they produce a boring way of thinking. When I'm around people with the identitarian mindset, I usually know what they are going to say next. Blue World panel discussions put less emphasis on having a true diversity of views represented than on having the correct range of the approved identity categories.\n\nBut the real problem is that categorical thinking makes it harder to see people as individuals. Better to see a person first as a unique individual, with their own distinctive way of observing and being in the world, and then to see them also as a member of historic groups, and then to understand the way they fit into existing status and social structures. To see a person well, you've got to see them in all three ways.\n\nAt its worst, identitarian thinking encourages the kind of destructive us-versus-them thinking-the demonization and division-human beings are so prone to. Identitarianism undermines pluralism, the key value that diverse societies need if they are to thrive. Pluralism is based on a different set of very different assumptions: Human beings can't be reduced to their categories; people's identities are complex and shifting; what we have in common matters more than what we don't; politics is less often a battle between good and evil than it is a competition among partial truths; societies cannot always be neatly divided into oppressor and oppressed; and politics need not always be a Manichaean death struggle between groups but sometimes can consist of seeking the best balance among competing goods.\n\nI find it more pleasant to live in a culture built on pluralistic assumptions than on identitarian ones-which is why I sometimes have to grit my teeth when I visit an elite-university campus or the offices of one of the giant foundations.\n\nT he final quality keeping me from fully casting my lot with Blue World is, to borrow from the title of the classic book by the late historian and social critic Christopher Lasch, its Culture of Narcissism . In Red World, people tend to take a biblical view of the human person: We are gloriously endowed and made in the image of God- and we are deeply broken, sinful, and egotistical.\n\nAccording to this way of thinking, people are most likely to thrive and act wisely when they are formed by a moral and social order. In the absence of one, they are likely to act selfish and shortsighted. This is why conservatives spend a lot of time worrying about the cohesion of families, the health of the social order, and the coherence of the moral community; we need these primeval commitments and moral guardrails to help us lead good lives.\n\nIn 2021, the conservative Christian writer Alan Noble published a book called You Are Not Your Own -a title that nicely sums up these traditional conservative beliefs. You belong to God; to your family; and to the town, nation, and civilization you call home. Your ultimate authority in life is outside the self-in God, or in the wisdom contained within our shared social and moral order.\n\nIn Blue World, by contrast, people are more likely to believe that far from being broken sinners, each of us has something beautiful and pure at our core. As the philosopher Charles Taylor put it in The Ethics of Authenticity , \"Our moral salvation comes from recovering authentic moral contact with ourselves.\" In this culture you want to self-actualize, listen to your own truth, be true to who you are. The ultimate authority is inside you.\n\nBut unless your name is Aristotle, it's hard to come up with an entire moral cosmology on your own. Too often, people in a \"culture of authenticity\" fall into emotivism-doing whatever feels right. If you live in the world of autonomy and authenticity, you have the freedom to do what you want, but you might struggle to enjoy a sense of metaphysical belonging, a sense that your life fits into a broader scheme of meaning and eternal values.\n\nIf you lack metaphysical belonging, you have to rely on social belonging for all your belonging needs, which requires you to see your glorious self reflected in the attentions and affirmations of others. This leads to the fragile narcissism that Lasch saw coming back in 1979: \"The narcissist depends on others to validate his self-esteem. He cannot live without an admiring audience. His apparent freedom from family ties and institutional constraints does not free him to stand alone or to glory in his individuality. On the contrary, it contributes to his insecurity.\"\n\nThis might be why mental-health problems are so much worse in Blue World than in Red World. In one recent study, 34 percent of conservative students say they report feeling in poor mental health at least half the time. That's pretty bad. But among very liberal students, 57 percent report poor mental health. That's terrible.\n\nSpending time in Blue World makes me realize how socially conservative I am. I don't mean socially conservative in the way that term gets used to describe certain stances on hot-button cultural matters like gay marriage or trans issues. (On those topics, I hold what would be considered progressive positions.) Rather, I am a social conservative in believing that the universe has a moral order to it, that absolute right and wrong exist, and that we are either degrading our souls or elevating our souls with every little thing we do. I also believe that the strength of our society is based on the strength of our shared moral and social foundation. And I believe that any nation's moral culture comes before politics and economics, and when the moral culture frays everything else falls apart. This places me in a conservative tradition that goes back to Edmund Burke and David Hume.\n\nA t this point you might be wondering why I don't just stay in Red World. After all, maybe once Donald Trump's desecration of the Republican Party ends, the GOP can once again be reconstituted as the most congenial home for a wandering Whig like me. But in the meantime, despite everything that sometimes drives me away from Blue World, there's more that's drawing me toward it.\n\nFor starters, it has a greater commitment to the truth. This may sound weird, but I became a conservative because of its relationship to knowledge and truth. In the 1980s, I looked around at all those progressive social-engineering projects, like urban renewal, that failed because they were designed by technocratic planners who didn't realize that the world is more complicated than their tidy schemes could encompass. Back then, the right seemed more epistemologically humble, more able to appreciate the wisdom of tradition and the many varied ways of knowing.\n\nBut today the Republican relationship to truth and knowledge has gone to hell. MAGA is a fever swamp of lies, conspiracy theories, and scorn for expertise. The Blue World, in contrast, is a place more amenable to disagreement, debate, and the energetic pursuit of truth. As Jonathan Rauch has written , \"We let alt-truth talk, but we don't let it write textbooks, receive tenure, bypass peer review, set the research agenda, dominate the front pages, give expert testimony or dictate the flow of public dollars.\" The people who perform those roles and populate the epistemic regime are mostly Democrats these days, and they're the ones more likely to nurture a better, fairer, more fact-based and less conspiracy-deranged society.\n\nSecond, I've come to appreciate the Democrats' long-standing tradition of using a pragmatic imagination. I like being around people who know that it's really hard to design policies that will help others but who have devoted their lives to doing it well. During the Great Depression, FDR recognized that bold experimentation was called for, which led to the New Deal. During the financial crisis of the late 2000s, I watched the Obama administration display pragmatic imagination to stave off a second depression and lift the economy again. Over the past four years, I've watched the Biden administration use pragmatic imagination to funnel money to parts of America that have long been left behind.\n\nRecently, I watched a current Democratic mayor and a former one talk about how to design programs to help homeless people. The current mayor had learned that moving just one homeless person into a shelter doesn't always work well. It's better to move an entire encampment into a well-run shelter, so people can preserve the social-support systems they'd built there. Listening to the mayors' conversation was like listening to craftspeople talk about their trades. The discussion was substantive, hopeful, and practical. You don't hear much of this kind of creative problem-solving from Republicans-because they don't believe in government action.\n\nAnother set of qualities now drawing me toward the Democrats: patriotism and regular Americanness. This one has surprised me. Until recently, these qualities have been more associated with flag-waving conservatives than cosmopolitan members of the progressive aristocracy. And I confess that I went to the Democratic convention in August with a lot of skepticism: If Democrats need to win the industrial Midwest, why are they nominating a progressive from San Francisco with a history of left-wing cultural and policy positions? But the surging displays of patriotism; the string of cops, veterans, and blue-collar workers up onstage; the speeches by disaffected former Republicans; Kamala Harris's own soaring rhetoric about America's role in the world-all of this stood in happy contrast to the isolationist American-carnage rhetoric that has characterized the GOP in the Trump era. I've always felt more comfortable with the \"Happy Warrior\" Democratic Party of Al Smith, Hubert Humphrey, and Barbara Jordan than the Democratic Party of the Squad, and at the convention that old lineage seemed to be shining through.\n\nBut ultimately what's pulling me away from the Republican Party and toward the Democrats is one final quality of Blue World: its greater ability to self-correct. Democrats, I've concluded, are better at scrutinizing, and conquering, their own shortcomings than Republicans are.\n\nRed World suffers today from an unfortunate combination of a spiritual-superiority complex and an intellectual-inferiority complex. It's not intellectually self-confident enough to argue with itself; absent this self-scrutiny, it's susceptible to demagogues who tell it what to think. Blue World is now home to a greater tradition of and respect for debate. Despite what I said earlier about the rigid orthodoxy of the progressive aristocracy, the party is bigger than that, and for every Blue World person who practices identity politics, there is another who criticizes it. For every Blue World person who succumbs to the culture of narcissism, another argues that it's shallow and destructive. For every Blue World person who thinks we should have universal basic income, another adduces evidence suggesting that the UBI saps people's incentives to work and steers them toward playing video games on the couch.\n\nIn Blue World, I find plenty of people who are fighting against all the things I don't like about Blue World. In Red World, however, far fewer people are fighting against what's gone wrong with the party. (There's a doughty band of Never Trump Republicans, but they get no hearing inside today's GOP.) A culture or organization is only as strong as its capacity to correct its mistakes.\n\nAll of this leaves me on the periphery of Team Blue, just on the edge of the inside, which is where I believe the healthiest and most productive part of American politics now lives.\n\nI'm mostly happy here. My advice to other conservatives disaffected by MAGA is this: If you're under 45, stay in the Republican Party and work to make it a healthy, multiracial working-class party. If you're over 45, acknowledge that the GOP is not going to be saved in your lifetime and join me on the other side. I don't deny that it takes some adjustment; I find it weird being in a political culture in which Sunday brunch holds higher status than church. But Blue World is where the better angels of our nature seem lately to have migrated, and where the best hope for the future of the country now lies."

      "text": "The Long Unraveling of the Republican Party\n\nThree books explore a history of fractious extremism that predates Donald Trump.\n\nIn 1992, Pat Buchanan made a campaign stop at the San Diego-Tijuana border. As a few white-power activists who had tagged along milled in the background, he called for the United States to build a wall-a 200-mile-long physical boundary between the U.S. and Mexico. At the time, Buchanan was seeking the Republican nomination for the presidency, the first of two consecutive efforts that were rebuffed by party voters and leaders alike. Buchanan and his politics seemed to be on the verge of being drummed out of the GOP altogether. (When he made one last try for the White House, in 2000, he ran on the Reform Party ticket.) From the start of the 1990s, his hostility toward free trade and NATO, his extremist proposals on immigration, and his jeremiads against cultural decline marked him as an outlier. Communism was over, the stock market was rising, Silicon Valley was just taking off, and few were interested in Buchanan's grim vision of a looming \"illegal invasion.\"\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nThree decades later, Buchanan's ideas may still seem fringe, but they are no longer marginal. His call for a barrier at the border has become a staple of Republican platforms, as have his denunciations of cultural decadence , his skepticism about free trade , and his warnings about the dangers of the \"global elite\" and of immigrant incursions. As the midterms approach, Donald Trump's conspiracy-laced version of those views shows no sign of flaming out, which forces the question: Is this ethno-nationalism and pugnacious stance toward cultural \"elites\" going to be the signature of the Republican Party from now on? And if so, what happened? Not all that long ago, the GOP was the party of Big Business, free markets, \"traditional\" family values, and anti-communism. Now it has become the party of election denial and the Wall.\n\nWhen Trump first surfaced as a 2016 presidential candidate, his dizzying ascendance, seemingly out of nowhere, fueled the sense that he was hijacking a GOP theretofore rooted in the confident optimism that had come out of the Reagan era. Historians have considered Ronald Reagan's presidency, and the adoption by the Democratic Party (especially under Bill Clinton) of Reagan's end-of-big-government-and-big-labor-and-high-taxes ideology, as the formative development of the last quarter of the 20th century-the vision that laid out the parameters for American politics in the new millennium.\n\nYet the recent trajectory of the Republican Party, and its turn against many of the key precepts of Reaganism, calls for a reassessment of this perspective. That is precisely what the historian Nicole Hemmer offers in Partisans: The Conservative Revolutionaries Who Remade American Politics in the 1990s . She is joined in rethinking the evolution of conservatism by two journalists who approach the subject from different places on the political spectrum. Dana Milbank, the author of The Destructionists: The Twenty-Five-Year Crack-Up of the Republican Party , is a liberal Washington Post columnist. Matthew Continetti, the author of The Right: The Hundred-Year War for American Conservatism , arrived at The Weekly Standard as a 22-year-old in 2003 and is now a Never Trumper at the American Enterprise Institute and a contributing editor to National Review . All three books portray a conservatism that was fraught with tensions long before Trump's emergence. Their goal is to explain why the current incarnation of the GOP shouldn't come as a surprise. In showing the deep roots of our present crisis, their analyses also suggest the limits of any politics focused on a dream of salvaging the Republican Party.\n\nThe consensus among political historians of the post-World War II years is that the conservative movement of the period was driven by two connected concerns: the desire to constrain the welfare state and the labor unions that had been created during the New Deal, and the imperative to fight international communism. In pursuit of both goals, conservatives embraced the ideology of the free market-as articulated, most notably, by Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman-and rejected the isolationism and \"America First\" mentality that had prevailed among many on the right prior to the war. This was, as Continetti argues, a major political shift: In the 1920s, the American right had been split between open elitists in the intellectual world, such as the journalist H. L. Mencken, who warned in a 1919 essay that \"all government ... is a conspiracy against the superior man,\" and the grassroots mobilization of the Second Ku Klux Klan, which strove through mass rallies and political campaigns to maintain the purity of \"the old pioneer stock.\"\n\nDuring the 1930s, '40s, and '50s, the fight against the New Deal and the Soviet Union gave the right a new energy. Under the broad umbrella of opposing socialism and communism and defending freedom, all kinds of policies that might otherwise have appeared narrowly self-interested-free-market economics, anti-tax measures, opposition to unions, an aggressive interventionism in Vietnam and elsewhere-acquired an idealistic gloss. Even the ugliest aspects of postwar conservatism, such as its opposition to the civil-rights movement, could be portrayed as a principled defense of localism, or even as part of the anti-communist project: Some conservatives suspected that key advisers of Martin Luther King Jr. were secretly in league with Moscow, and that the entire civil-rights movement was riddled with communist sympathizers.\n\nBut this brand of conservative politics-while garnering substantial support, especially from midsize-business owners and prosperous suburbanites, as well as southerners-failed to gain enough traction to win national elections in the '50s and '60s. Victories came only in the '70s, as postwar economic growth faltered and the conservative coalition expanded. Now it included working-class white voters in the North and South animated by resentment, fear, and racism in the aftermath of civil-rights successes. The movement also tapped into a new wave of organizing among evangelical churches , which were able to make common cause with anti-government conservatives in opposing such policies as the IRS denial of tax-exempt status for Christian schools found to be racially discriminatory. For their part, conservatives signed on to much of the evangelicals' cultural crusade against abortion access and gay rights.\n\nRead: How the GOP surrendered to extremism\n\nYet these new recruits and the business-oriented conservative establishment, all three authors argue, never fully merged. The New Right, which gathered momentum in the '70s, remained at arm's length from the elite intellectual organizations of conservatism, such as the American Enterprise Institute and the libertarian Cato Institute. Its key activists lacked the establishment's intense focus on economic issues, and were angry that their own zealous focus on cultural issues (strictly limiting abortion, banning gay teachers from public schools ) wasn't shared. The schism and the fractious extremism at the core of the party, in tone as well as policies, were masked, however, by Reagan's cheerful persona-that of an avuncular, old-school movie-star gentleman whose politics embraced, Hemmer writes, \"flexibility and optimism, making movement conservatism genuinely popular for the first time in the Cold War era.\"\n\nNot that Reagan, despite the unifying power of his presidency, was a moderate. He had a long history of warning against the \" encroaching control \" of the liberal state, and his administration's harsh attacks on welfare policies, unions, and busing were extreme; so was his support for his \"Star Wars\" defense initiative and for violent anti-communists in Central America . But anti-communist internationalism on the right also helps explain Reagan's comparatively genial stance on immigration. As he put it during his 1980 campaign, \"You don't build a nine-foot fence along the border between two friendly nations.\" An early draft of the speech went further still: \"We cannot erect a Berlin Wall across the southern border.\"\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union and decline of communism in the early '90s shook the political world of the right. Suddenly, the lack of common ground between religious and cultural conservatives on the one hand and the libertarian-leaning establishment on the other was exposed. Already, anti-communist hard-liners had denounced Reagan for meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, and evangelicals had been chafing at his failure to do more to outlaw abortion. In the 1988 presidential race, Hemmer reminds us, the television host Pat Robertson had challenged George H. W. Bush in a campaign that tapped into conservative dissatisfaction with Reagan.\n\nDespite the apparent triumph of capitalism in the Cold War, many conservatives in the 1980s and early '90s were gripped by what Continetti calls a \"deep-seated pessimism.\" They had managed to take control of the White House for eight years, yet were unable to shrink the state, had trouble holding Congress, and felt unwelcome in Hollywood and academia. A gloomy, bitter conservatism began to spread, from above and from below. Its rhetoric was tinged with loss and preoccupied with themes of masculinity, race, and immigration, a far cry from Reagan's upbeat invocations of freedom and morning in America. The journalist Peter Brimelow's 1995 best seller, Alien Nation , for example, opened with the suggestion that the country had been defined by a \"specific ethnic core\" that \"has always been white\"-and was now in danger of being replaced.\n\nFrom the March 2018 issue: Boycott the Republican Party\n\nThe transformation on the right was stylistic as well as substantive. It's hard to imagine Reagan leading cheers of \"Lock her up!\" or inventing Trump-style nicknames for his enemies. But this jeering patois would have been familiar to followers of Rush Limbaugh, whose nationally syndicated conservative talk-radio program started broadcasting on AM stations in 1988. Limbaugh was a college dropout who had read Pat Buchanan's newspaper columns when he was growing up in Missouri and then found his way to radio, getting his break when Morton Downey Jr. was fired for using openly racist language on the air. Limbaugh immediately began to develop his own style, one that anticipated the bullying sarcasm of Twitter: Rather than harangue his audience or engage in high-minded exegeses of Friedrich Hayek or other conservative thinkers, he set out to \"ridicule the left,\" as Hemmer puts it. Limbaugh routinely insulted Democratic politicians-Ted Kennedy was \"The Swimmer\"; Robert Byrd was \"Sheets\" (referring to his Ku Klux Klan past)-and when critics phoned in to his show, he would cut them off with what he referred to as a \"caller abortion\" (a loud vacuum-cleaner noise followed by a scream before the line went dead).\n\nA similar shift took place on Capitol Hill, where a program of tax cuts and deregulation was supplemented by constant hyperbolic invective. Newt Gingrich's crusade to rally congressional Republicans to build their base by explicitly embracing political language that demeaned their political opponents is well known. Even so, the intensity of some of this rhetoric-and the ways in which it foreshadowed the style on the right today-remains surprising. Milbank describes the 1990 memo that Gingrich's political-action committee circulated to Republican candidates. Titled \"Language: A Key Mechanism of Control,\" it instructed them in how to \"speak like Newt,\" using words such as sick , corrupt , bizarre , pathetic , destroy , and decay when characterizing Democrats. Gingrich himself deployed this strategy incessantly, describing Democratic politicians as the \"enemy of normal Americans\" and calling for a \"war\" against the left to be fought with \"a scale and a duration and a savagery that is only true of civil wars.\"\n\nMeanwhile, conspiracy theories acquired new salience in the movement, having long proliferated in less public ways on the right. (The John Birch Society, for example, specialized in anti-communist paranoia and continued to attract members well after it was repudiated by William F. Buckley and National Review in the 1960s.) Stoking doubts about whether Vince Foster, who had been deputy White House counsel to President Clinton, had really died by suicide in 1993 proved popular. Helen Chenoweth, the three-term Idaho representative in the '90s, catered to militia supporters and the far right with claims that the United Nations was secretly plotting to institute a \"one world\" government, a mission enabled by federal agents in \"black helicopters\" flying over Idaho.\n\nHemmer and Continetti make the case that the Republican establishment still held sway as late as the George W. Bush years. Hemmer calls Bush \"the last Reaganite,\" intent on pursuing free-trade agreements and tax cuts, while Continetti describes Bush as adopting a principled \"freedom agenda\" in the War on Terror and notes his efforts at immigration reform. Milbank, by contrast, sees the entire Republican establishment lurching to the right over those same Bush years. In his account, gerrymandering, campaign-finance scandals, and the \"Brooks Brothers Riot\" in Florida after the 2000 election (in which Republican operatives in suits mobbed the office where a recount was taking place, shouting \"Stop the count! Stop the fraud!\") all anticipate the naked power grabs of the contemporary right. Milbank himself became the target of Karl Rove's rage after writing a 2002 article headlined \"For Bush, Facts Are Malleable,\" about the administration's efforts to stoke support for the Iraq War; after it appeared, Rove telephoned Milbank's boss and requested that he be removed from the White House beat.\n\nAs the authors get closer to the present and to Trump-era chaos, the reading experience becomes disorienting. One source of overwrought, outlandish outrage is rapidly overtaken by the next; any given departure from evidence-based rational assessment is topped by another, as denial of Barack Obama's American citizenship is joined by climate-change denial, COVID denial, and 2020 election denial, while the base declares faith in QAnon and ivermectin. Each dispiriting set of characters gives way to a yet more demoralizing array. Glenn Beck is followed by Tucker Carlson; Ann Coulter and Sarah Palin by Elise Stefanik; the Tea Party by the Oath Keepers. One moment Lou Dobbs is insisting that he's \"just asking questions\" about Obama's birth certificate; the next, he's been thrown aside for being insufficiently anti-immigrant. Revolutions \"devour their own children,\" goes the truism (credited to a skeptic of the French Revolution)-but among conservatives today, the journey from hero to apostate seems to happen at warp speed. So, among almost all the Republicans in the legislative branch, did the journey from momentarily denouncing Trump, on January 6, to swearing fealty once again.\n\nWill the Republican Party continue to move ever further to the right? And if so, what does this portend for American politics? Taking the longest view, Continetti sees the current struggles on the right as the latest manifestation of a 100-year battle between the \"forces of extremism\" and those who have sought mainstream acceptance for conservative ideas-the establishment wing to which he has devoted his life. One imagines that he is looking for models when he approvingly refers to Senator Margaret Chase Smith's 1950 castigation of Joseph McCarthy, and her warning that \"certain elements of the Republican Party\" had chosen to manipulate their way to \"victory through the selfish political exploitation of fear, bigotry, ignorance, and intolerance.\"\n\nBut reading these books together does not inspire confidence. For one thing, as Continetti is honest enough to admit, the distinctions between the extremists and the respectable right have never been all that clear-cut. The postwar conservative movement was entwined with opposition to the civil-rights movement from the outset. Such luminaries as Buckley used National Review in its early days to argue against federal troops going to Little Rock, Arkansas, to protect Black schoolchildren; he did so on the grounds not only that the \"Southern dilemma\" was a matter for local control but that white people remained the \"advanced race\" and thus should be able to discriminate. Given this history, which predates the 1990s by decades, resurrecting an American conservatism free of the taint of racism-and deeply committed to democratic political engagement-is a formidable challenge.\n\nNor is it so easy to absolve \"classical liberalism\" and Reagan's free-market policies of responsibility for our current travails. What you won't find in these accounts, focusing as they do on the ideas and programs of conservatives in positions of power in politics and the media, is much sense of the social history of the United States over the past three decades, as the legacies of the Reagan years became clear. The radical tax cuts, hostility toward labor, and deregulation that marked the 1980s facilitated the rapid deindustrialization of American cities and the rise of finance and services as the motors of economic life in the United States. The unionized jobs that had provided meaningful upward mobility for many in the postwar years all but disappeared.\n\nReagan promoted these shifts, even if they did not originate with him. And as Clinton's presidency went on to demonstrate, the laissez-faire economic agenda of the 1980s and '90s became a largely bipartisan one: It promised a vision of a newly dynamic, globally plugged-in America rescued from boom-and-bust economics by low tax rates and the light hand of regulation. Pursued with a blithe insistence that all would be better in this best of all possible worlds, that agenda helped seed the social chaos and despair that have been such fertile ground for the right.\n\nIt has also helped create an economic elite with little connection to the rest of American society. Having benefited from low taxes and tax evasion, this elite has also been well served by the weakening of the public sector and the labor movement, and has every interest in the continued erosion of both. Tracing the history that illuminates Trump's success in commanding popular attention and support is important, even if evidence of a wholesale shift of working-class voters to the Republican Party is far from conclusive. Yet more surprising, in certain ways, is watching those factions of the political and economic elite that have thrown in their lot with Trump and the broader agenda he represents. They have been willing to do more than back candidates who are openly skeptical of democracy, and to continue funding election deniers after promising to cut off support. Abandoning traditional corporate imperatives, especially the desire for stability, some in these circles have relied on the least democratic features of our system (the Supreme Court, the filibuster, the Electoral College) to advance their ends, and made this reactionary politics far more dangerous in so doing.\n\nHow best to counter the politics of a Republican Party in thrall to Trump is not obvious. Milbank pleads with the republic to vote (presumably for Democrats), suggesting that the Republican project is an antidemocratic one that speaks for a declining rural white minority and will inevitably be defeated. Continetti rallies conservatives not to flee the scene but to stay and fight for the principles of classical liberalism. Only Hemmer proposes that the Democratic Party might also bear some culpability for the transformation of the partisan landscape-which implies that an overhaul of moral and political vision is crucial.\n\nOne of the challenges of our moment is that so many forces seem poised to drive people out of what remains of public life. At some point, arguing with opponents galvanized by a completely different political calculus becomes enervating. It feels like shadowboxing, at a time when the issues our society confronts-the pandemic, climate change, the international role of the United States, stark economic inequality-have never been more pressing. The way forward is daunting because it calls for a new kind of politics that can generate the courage and strength to push back against a politics of fear and demonization. With all due respect to Margaret Chase Smith, the path doesn't lie in trying to reconstruct the old order that helped open the door to our current crisis.\n\n*Lead image: Illustration by Paul Spella.

      "text": "Why Republican Politicians Do Whatever Trump Says\n\nThe former president's stories of business dominance were often exaggerated. With Republican politicians, he's found a group he can control.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThe story Donald Trump tells about himself-and to himself-has always been one of domination. It runs through the canonical texts of his personal mythology. In The Art of the Deal , he filled page after page with examples of his hard-nosed negotiating tactics. On The Apprentice , he lorded over a boardroom full of supplicants competing for his approval. And at his campaign rallies, he routinely regales crowds with tales of strong-arming various world leaders in the Oval Office.\n\nThis image of Trump has always been dubious. Those boardroom scenes were, after all, reality-TV contrivances; those stories in his book were, by his own ghostwriter's account , exaggerated in many cases to make Trump appear savvier than he was. And there's been ample reporting to suggest that many of the world leaders with whom Trump interacted as president saw him more as an easily manipulated mark than as a domineering statesman to be feared.\n\nThe truth is that Trump, for all of his tough-guy posturing, spent most of his career failing to push people around and bend them to his will.\n\nThat is, until he started dealing with Republican politicians.\n\nFor nearly a decade now, Trump has demonstrated a remarkable ability to make congressional Republicans do what he wants. He threatens them. He bullies them. He extracts from them theatrical displays of devotion-and if they cross him, he makes them pay. If there is one arena of American power in which Trump has been able to actually be the merciless alpha he played on TV-and there may, indeed, be only one-it is Republican politics. His influence was on full display this week, when he derailed a bipartisan border-security bill reportedly because he wants to campaign on the immigration \"crisis\" this year.\n\nDavid Frum: The GOP's true priority\n\nSam Nunberg, a former adviser to Trump, has observed this dynamic with some amusement. \"It's funny,\" he told me in a recent phone interview. \"In the business world and in the entertainment world, I don't think Donald was able to intimidate people as much.\"\n\nHe pointed to Trump's salary negotiations with NBC during Trump's Apprentice years. Jeff Zucker, who ran the network at the time, has said that Trump once came to him demanding a raise. At the time, Trump was making $40,000 an episode, but he wanted to make as much as the entire cast of Friends combined: $6 million an episode. Zucker countered with $60,000. When Trump balked, Zucker said he'd find someone else to host the show. The next day, according to Zucker, Trump's lawyer called to accept the $60,000. (A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nContrast that with the power Trump wields on Capitol Hill-how he can kill a bill or tank a speakership bid with a single post on social media; how high-ranking congressmen are so desperate for his approval that they'll task staffers to sort through packs of Starbursts and pick out just the pinks and reds so Trump can be presented with his favorite flavors.\n\n\"I just remember that there'd be a lot of stuff that didn't go his way,\" Nunberg told me, referring to Trump's business career. \"But he has all these senators in the fetal position! They do whatever he wants.\"\n\nWhy exactly congressional Republicans have proved so much more pliable than anyone else Trump has contended with is a matter of interpretation. One explanation is that Trump has simply achieved much more success in politics than he ever did, relatively speaking, in New York City real estate or on network TV. For all of his tabloid omnipresence, Trump never had anything like the presidential bully pulpit.\n\nFrom the January/February 2024 issue: Loyalists, lapdogs, and cronies\n\n\"It stands to reason that [when] the president and leader of your party is pushing for something ... that's what's going to happen,\" a former chief of staff to a Republican senator, who requested anonymity in order to candidly describe former colleagues' thinking, told me. \"Take away the office and put him back in a business setting, where facts and core principles matter, and it doesn't surprise me that it wasn't as easy.\"\n\nBut, of course, Trump is not the president anymore-and there is also something unique about the sway he continues to have over Republicans on Capitol Hill. In his previous life, Trump had viewers, readers, fans-but he never commanded a movement that could end the careers of the people on the other side of the negotiating table.\n\nAnd Trump-whose animal instinct for weakness is one of his defining traits-seemed to intuit something early on about the psychology of the Republicans he would one day reign over.\n\nNunberg told me about a speech he drafted for Trump in 2015 that included this line about the Republican establishment: \"They're good at keeping their jobs, not their promises.\" When Trump read it, he chuckled. \"It's so true,\" he said, according to Nunberg. \"That's all they care about.\" (Nunberg was eventually fired from Trump's 2016 campaign.)\n\nThis ethos of job preservation at all costs is not a strictly partisan phenomenon in Washington-nor is it new. As I reported in my recent biography of Mitt Romney , the Utah senator was surprised, when he arrived in Congress, by the enormous psychic currency his colleagues attached to their positions. One senator told Romney that his first consideration when voting on any bill should be \"Will this help me win reelection?\"\n\nFrom the November 2023 issue: What Mitt Romney saw in the Senate\n\nBut the Republican Party of 2015 was uniquely vulnerable to a hostile takeover by someone like Trump. Riven by years of infighting and ideological incoherence, and plagued by a growing misalignment between its base and its political class, the GOP was effectively one big institutional power vacuum. The litmus tests kept changing. The formula for getting reelected was obsolete. Republicans with solidly conservative records, such as House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, were getting taken out in primaries by obscure Tea Party upstarts.\n\nTo many elected Republicans, it probably felt like an answer to their prayers when a strongman finally parachuted in and started telling them what to do. Maybe his orders were reckless and contradictory. But as long as you did your best to look like you were obeying, you could expect to keep winning your primaries.\n\nAs for Trump, it's easy to see the ongoing appeal of this arrangement. The Apprentice was canceled long ago, and the Manhattan-real-estate war stories have worn thin. Republicans in Congress might be the only ostensibly powerful people in America who will allow him to boss them around, humiliate them, and assert unbridled dominance over them. They've made the myth true. How could he possibly walk away now?"

      "text": "Trump's Wholesale Renovation of the Republican Party\n\nTim Alberta gives an inside look at the Republican National Convention following the assassination attempt of Donald Trump\n\nThe Republican Party gathers in a triumphal mood in Milwaukee. Polls favor the GOP in 2024. The long-awaited vice-presidential pick has been made. And Donald Trump prepares to accept the nomination again, just as President Joe Biden faces calls across his party to step away from another run. Four months before the election, the contrast between the two parties is stark.\n\nAtlantic staff writer Tim Alberta is in Wisconsin for the Republican National Convention and sees a confidence there unlike anything he's witnessed in his years covering the GOP. It is now the party of Trump, and as Alberta has reported, his campaign is planning for a landslide win . But after two prior runs, what is different about the Trump campaign of 2024?\n\nOn this episode of Radio Atlantic , Alberta joins guest host Adam Harris from the convention hall to give an inside view of the party. Listen to their conversation here:\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nAdam Harris: What a week in American politics. The Republican Party has gathered in Wisconsin to renominate Donald Trump for president. The convention follows a near-miss assassination attempt on Trump and the announcement of Ohio Senator J. D. Vance as his pick for VP. All the while, President Biden faces calls from within the Democratic Party for him to step aside.\n\nI'm Adam Harris, and this is Radio Atlantic . Hanna Rosin is still away, working on a special project. For this episode, I'm hoping to understand what's different about Trump's 2024 campaign, and what, if anything, Saturday's assassination attempt has changed. To do this, I'm joined by staff writer Tim Alberta from the RNC convention hall. Hey, Tim.\n\nTim Alberta: Adam. What's happening, man?\n\nHarris: Not too much. Thanks for coming on. You've covered Republican politics for a while now. You're currently in Milwaukee covering the RNC. What's the feeling there?\n\nAlberta: The feeling here is like an Election Night victory party that started four months early. I've been to a lot of Republican conventions. I've spent a lot of years covering Republican politics, and I can safely say I have never been around a more confident-even cocky-bunch of people who are just entirely convinced that this campaign is already over and that they are marching to victory in November, the only question being: How big of a victory is it?\n\nHarris: You know, leading into this week, we all thought that the big news was going to be the announcement of Trump's VP pick. So what was the reaction to Trump picking Ohio Senator J. D. Vance?\n\nAlberta: You know, from what I can see, the reception has been pretty enthusiastic. You know, this is a really self-selecting group here in Milwaukee. I mean, the party as an institution has been completely remade by Donald Trump from the top down.\n\nYou know, Donald Trump picking someone who is seen as kind of an heir apparent to this populist, America First empire that Trump has created is, of course, going to be received really well in a place like this. The question obviously is, for folks who exist more in the center-right-you know, moderate, establishment, business-friendly lane of the Republican Party-there is, I think, some hesitancy, some doubt about J. D. Vance, particularly not just even from the moderate wing but from the defense-hawk wing of the party.\n\nAnd the J. D. Vance pick is a pretty concrete signal that, to the extent there's been a civil war inside the Republican Party-over foreign policy, national-security issues, the fights over funding Ukraine, obviously, in this past year-I think that those questions and those criticisms do exist here, but they're very much on the margins, because this is, at the end of the day, Trump's party.\n\nHarris: Yeah. Coming into this national convention was a little bit different, right? There was always something that was looming over it, and that is the events of Saturday. And so what impact has the assassination attempt on Trump had on Republicans?\n\nAlberta: The thing that is most striking, Adam, is there's sort of an added layer of invincibility to Trump. If you thought that the party was already sort of a cult of personality and that there were already some of these kind of subtle undertones of a messianic complex attached to Donald Trump, then certainly the events of Saturday-and, you know, specifically the sort of getting up, bleeding from the assassin's bullet, defiantly pumping the fist, and saying to fight -I think it's created this sense of Trump as invincible, Trump as immortal, Trump as, you know, You can't kill Trump. They tried. Right?\n\nLike, so there is almost an added supernatural dimension to the conversation. And we've heard that from some of the speakers this week: People, you know, stating very plainly that God has his hands on Trump, that God wants Trump alive, that God kept Trump alive, and that he has a plan for him. So I would say that is a pretty discernible shift in tone and sort of an escalating of the ways in which Trump is sort of lionized by the party faithful at an event like this.\n\nHarris: Yeah. You know, you've covered conventions before. How does that kind of cockiness compare to conventions that you've covered in the past or that you've seen in the past?\n\nAlberta: There's really no comparison. If you think back to 2008 and then 2012, Republicans did not think they were going to beat Barack Obama. I mean, especially in '08 but then even in '12, there was just really-there was some enthusiasm around Romney, but there wasn't a lot of swagger there. There wasn't really any discernible confidence.\n\nAnd then 2016, look, Donald Trump-half the people at the convention in Cleveland in 2016 were anti-Trump. They were delegates who were bound to cast their votes for Trump because of how he had performed in their states, but they were not happy about it. And they had come to the convention, some of them, to make a stink about it and really were hoping for a floor fight to try to even stop Trump from becoming the nominee.\n\nSo, certainly, the idea that he was going to go on to win, that was just kind of fantasy at that point, much less go on to win and be renominated in '24 and become the face of the party. Nobody could have imagined that.\n\nSo I think what feels different about this moment is not just the confidence but the wholesale renovation of the Republican Party to become such a distinctly Trumpian entity. And I think the confidence, in some ways, flows from that. It flows from a sense of, like, We know who we are as a party now. We weren't entirely sure with McCain or with Romney or even with Trump in '16. But now, with his third time being nominated, we know who we are .\n\nAnd I think probably more importantly, Adam, they know who they're facing. And they're facing Joe Biden, who is just, objectively speaking, a very vulnerable and diminished candidate from the man that Donald Trump faced just four years earlier.\n\nHarris: Considering where Biden is in his campaign at the moment, what are Trump's people thinking as they sort of watch the drama unfold around him?\n\nAlberta: The great source of confidence inside of the Trump campaign has much more to do with Joe Biden than it has to do with Donald Trump. The fact is: Joe Biden is, in many ways, sort of a dream opponent for Donald Trump to run against because some of Trump's own glaring deficiencies-his, at times, incoherent ramblings from the stage, his age, his own visible decline-are sort of neutralized and almost forgotten because, relative to Biden, Trump looks young and sprightly and energetic.\n\nI think there's also a fundamental contrast-a visual contrast-that the Trump campaign, from day one, has been deeply invested in drawing out, which is strength versus weakness. This is really what animates everything they talk about in the campaign and everything they do. From the voters that they're targeting to the digital content that they're creating, the mailers that they're going to be sending out, everything the Trump campaign is doing is meant to focus on this contrast of strength versus weakness.\n\nAnd they just believe that when you're talking about the Southern border, when you're talking about dealing with the geopolitical craziness happening in the world, when you're talking about inflation-whatever it may be-that Donald Trump is perceived as sort of an alpha, even to people who don't like him, and that Biden is perceived as feeble, even to people who like him.\n\nAnd so all of that, Adam, I have to emphasize: All of that was the theory of the case before the debate, when Joe Biden looked like he had one foot in the grave already, and it was before the assassination attempt of Donald Trump. And so what the Trump campaign now has are the two most vivid moments of this campaign.\n\nBoth of them are directly in service of this contrast that they've been trying to push. And so the Trump people, now all they can do is cross their fingers and say their prayers and hope that Joe Biden remains their opponent because, from their vantage point, there's no way he can win.\n\nHarris: What would they think if he dropped out of the race?\n\nAlberta: It would be a fire drill. They have spent the past year and a half engineering this campaign to run a very specific race against a very specific opponent in Joe Biden. And listen, the people running Trump's operation will say, You know what? Doesn't matter. Bring them on, whoever it is, that, you know, any Democrat is going to be saddled with Joe Biden's baggage.\n\nBut that's not true. And they know it's not true. They recognize that if Biden were to step down, and if someone else were to be at the top of the ticket, it would, in some fundamental ways, send them back to the drawing board and force them to reimagine the messaging, reimagine the targeting, reimagine how they think about the contrasts in this campaign.\n\nIt would also represent sort of a reset moment for a Democratic Party that has been in a sort of free fall of late. And Republicans are entirely content to sit back and pop some popcorn and enjoy the show. They feel like there's nothing that they need to do right now, because the Democrats are doing the hard work for them. But if Biden were to suddenly get out, then that changes everything.\n\nHarris: You know, you recently wrote a deep dive on the campaign with the headline, \" Trump Is Planning for a Landslide Win .\" So what is different about Trump's 2024 operations and strategy?\n\nAlberta: Boy, where do I even start? Look, Adam, Trump in 2016 didn't even have a campaign. I mean, sure, I suppose technically he did but, like, there was no real infrastructure. There was no real organization. It was just a couple of guys who were sort of making it up as they went along. And it was kind of almost an elaborate prank, in some ways. I mean it was sort of the reality-TV-show experiment of a campaign for the presidency.\n\nAnd when Donald Trump became the nominee, that's really when the Republican National Committee, which was led at the time by Reince Priebus, basically stepped in and ran the campaign for him because Trump didn't have any sort of a get out the vote. You know, it was a totally nonexistent political operation in 2016.\n\nAnd then in 2020, you know, Trump's the incumbent president. So he's got a lot of money and, on paper, they're building something out that looks more professional and more conventional, something that we're used to seeing, but it was a horribly run campaign. They burned through tons of money. And the campaign wasn't run by very experienced people, and they paid a price for it.\n\nThis time around, you've got some of the shrewdest and sharpest and most-cutthroat people in the Republican Party who are in charge of the campaign, and they have, from day one, stressed efficiency. They're really sort of focusing on some of the core competencies of the campaign.\n\nAnd I think the most important thing, Adam, that this campaign has been able to do is that Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, who are the co-architects of the campaign-and they are managing it together as a partnership-they've really been able to move Trump to a better place, in terms of his own capabilities, his own actions as a candidate.\n\nHe is embracing mail voting. He is overseeing a campaign now that is actually using some pretty cutting-edge technology to solicit absentee votes. Whereas four years ago, he was forbidding his own Republican voters from using the mail. So there are a lot of ways in which this campaign is just sort of light years beyond either the 2020 or the 2016 operations.\n\nHarris: And, you know, one of the reasons why, in that last campaign, Trump was effectively saying that, you know, We don't want mail voting. We don't want absentee voting , was because Republicans have kind of viewed it as a gamble, right? When there's more early voting, it typically favors Democrats.\n\nSo is that a sort of gamble that they're taking in this election by emphasizing mail voting, absentee voting? What sort of gamble are they taking with this new approach to the Trump campaign?\n\nAlberta: Well, here's the thing: We have become very accustomed, those of us who cover politics, to thinking that if turnout is high, that automatically benefits Democrats, because the lower-propensity voters, the lower-engagement voters-and we're talking about young people; we're talking about particularly young Black men, young Latino men-we talk about certain demographics that are just traditionally far less likely to turn out and vote.\n\nAnd the assumption has always been, Well, if you see higher turnout, that means that those people are coming out to vote, and those people are traditionally Democratic constituencies. Therefore, it's bad for the Republican Party . This election, I think, could really be remembered as a bit of a watershed, Adam, because what we see in all of the publicly available data, as well as what we're told is in a lot of the private data-the polling being done by both parties right now-is that, for the first time that anyone can remember, a lot of these low-engagement and low-propensity voters are breaking heavily in favor of Donald Trump, breaking heavily in favor of the Republican Party.\n\nAnd if that bears out come November, I think it's going to force the Democratic Party to sort of fundamentally reassess and recalibrate their approach to a whole host of issues but primarily just to this question of: How could it be that Donald Trump, the guy who would seemingly be the least likely to penetrate key pieces of the Democratic coalition and steal them away, how could it be that he's the one who does this? And to be clear, Adam, there are still some skeptics, both in the Republican Party and in the Democratic Party, people who look at the polling and who say, I just don't buy it. I don't buy that Trump is going to wind up winning, you know, 20 to 25 percent of the Black vote. I don't believe it , right?\n\nAnd until we see it, some of that skepticism is certainly warranted. But I think part of the reason that the Trump campaign has been so confident in making this play-and in emphasizing the vote by mail and the absentee [voting] and trying to connect and engage with some of these voters who have a history of using nontraditional voting means-is because their modeling, they feel like it's airtight.\n\nTheir modeling shows that these people who have been reliably Democratic in the past, that if they vote, they're voting for Trump. And there's just no overstating what a sea change that would represent in our politics.\n\nHarris: All right, we're going to take a short break. We'll have more with Tim Alberta in a moment.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nHarris: You know, early on, coming into the campaign, we knew who the candidates kind of were, right? The primary felt like it was already predestined, preordained, that you would have another Trump versus Biden. And Trump was the one coming in with the baggage, right? It's hard to talk about him without talking about the cases that were looming over him, without talking about the conviction.\n\nBut on Monday, just as the RNC began, the federal judge in Florida overseeing his classified-documents trial dismissed the case . What do you make of that news, and what impact will Trump's legal issues have on this campaign?\n\nAlberta: Well, first of all, I'm sure that the timing was totally coincidental, right? I'm sure that Judge Cannon had no idea that it was the first day of the Republican National Convention.\n\nYou know, it's interesting, Adam, because this thing that was perceived to be a great vulnerability, potentially the albatross around his neck that could prevent him from winning the presidency, it suddenly feels almost like a nonissue. I mean, between some of the court cases getting bumped and bumped and bumped back again to help him scheduling-wise, this one being dismissed, you know, the conviction in Manhattan creating a financial windfall that had actually pushed him ahead of Joe Biden in the fundraising race-and just to pause on that point for a minute, Adam.\n\nTrump was getting trounced financially for the first year of this campaign. He was way, way, way behind, and his cash reserves were really depleted because they had to keep paying all these legal bills. Well, suddenly, he gets convicted in Manhattan, and he raises these record-setting sums of money in the two or three days that follow.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it? We checked the FEC filings, and Trump is entering the month of July with more cash in the bank than Biden is. So it's really remarkable how, again, this thing that was supposed to be his greatest liability has sort of evaporated and, if anything, almost seems to very strangely have become an asset.\n\nThere's been this long-simmering sense among Trump's lieutenants that he is a target, that he is persecuted, that he is an enemy of the state, and that they won't stop at anything to take him down.\n\nHarris: You know, that language of persecution is important here, because I want to ask you about something you've written a great deal about, that we've talked about at length. That's this sort of intersection of faith and politics.\n\nYou wrote a book about your journey as an evangelical Christian and as the son of a pastor. And in this election cycle, you've warned about how the forces of Christian nationalism are on the rise, both inside the church and inside the Republican Party.\n\nSo from your view at the epicenter of the party this week, how do you expect those forces to affect the Trump campaign?\n\nAlberta: You know, this is a really interesting historical moment we're approaching because this is our first post- Roe v. Wade presidential election. For 50 years, you've had single-issue voters-you know, conservative Catholics, evangelical Christians-who really don't have any appetite for partisan politics and who would otherwise be inclined to just ignore all the noise come every 4th November. But they have been convinced that because presidents appoint Supreme Court justices, and because the Supreme Court-and only the Supreme Court-can ultimately strike down Roe v. Wade , that you have to vote in a presidential election, and you have to vote for the Republican.\n\nI think what we're about to find out is what number of those single-issue, highly committed, pro-life advocates suddenly find themselves recognizing that the issue is now defederalized, that it's no longer a presidential issue, it's no longer a Supreme Court issue and decide that they're going to stay home because they can't stomach voting for Donald Trump again.\n\nSo I think that is kind of a question mark, Adam, looming over the proceedings here that's gotten very little attention. But it's something that I'm going to be really focusing on in the months ahead, especially in light of the changes to the Republican platform that were, I think, obviously very upsetting to some in the social-conservative movement, effectively stripping out what had been the traditional language around the abortion issue.\n\nAnd also it shouldn't go ignored, stripping out the language around marriage being between one man and one woman. So there's a feeling among some of the evangelical activist leaders that they are sort of being pushed to the side. And that's because they are , in some sense, Adam.\n\nHere's the thing: Donald Trump and his campaign, they have made a calculation that these folks, the evangelicals, they're not going anywhere. What, are they going to go vote for Joe Biden? Right? Like, that's the level of confidence that they have. And so I think some of these decisions, at least at a tactical level, are riskier than I think many people realize. And if this winds up being a close election, there really could be a price to pay for some of these maneuvers that have been made here.\n\nAnd, Adam, let's be clear: If Trump is elected, he is going to have some people in his administration, in his cabinet, in his West Wing who are self-described Christian nationalists. I mean, there's just no question about it. So I don't think that the threat that I've been writing about is diminished in any way or any less relevant.\n\nI just think that the Trump folks are actually pretty smart and savvy in recognizing that the Christian-nationalist menace that has been sort of drawn into the public's attention, that it is a huge liability for them politically. You know, you see the Handmaid's Tale memes that go around the internet, right? Like, I think the Trump folks recognize that they need to head that off, and they need to distance themselves from any of that narrative. But that doesn't mean that it won't loom large and play a really critical role in his administration.\n\nHarris: So yeah, thinking further about Trump and the Christian right, he's leaned into an image of himself as a persecuted martyr, and now he's nearly been killed. What impact do you think the assassination attempt will have for people on the Christian right? Or what impact has it already had for people on the Christian right?\n\nAlberta: You know, it's hard to say, because this is all moving so quickly. Just being here in Milwaukee this week, Adam, I mean, it's apparent. And you're hearing it from the stage. You're hearing it from delegates on the floor. You're hearing it just in casual conversations with people, like, in the line for coffee. There's definitely a sense of the sort of supernatural presence and this divine intervention that has spared Donald Trump and made him into even more powerful a figure than he was just a week ago.\n\nYou sense that from others. My big question is will we get it from Trump himself? I have spent as much time as any reporter in America at Trump rallies, listening to him, dissecting his words, kind of studying any evolution in his thinking, even his just one-off riffs, trying to understand, you know, how he might be approaching things in a new or different manner.\n\nI've got to say that this acceptance speech he'll be giving at the Republican convention is, to me, probably the most significant speech he'll ever give. Because if, in fact, there is any real change in the man based on the events of last week, if some of his advisors are to be believed, he has been talking in kind of strangely spiritual terms and has been invoking God in ways that he has really never been known to do privately.\n\nIf there is some kind of meaningful change in Donald Trump himself-forget about the grassroots; forget about the party officials, all of his supporters-I mean, that could have, I think, really significant implications, politically and otherwise, for the party and for the country. So I think that's the biggest piece of the puzzle here that everyone in Milwaukee is sort of waiting on and wondering: Are we going to hear from the same guy who we've been hearing from all these years, or is this going to be something a little bit different?\n\n[ Music ]\n\nHarris: Absolutely. And we'll be watching for that. Tim, thank you so much for talking with me today, and good luck at the convention.\n\nAlberta: Adam. My pleasure, man.\n\nHarris: This episode was produced by Kevin Townsend and edited by Claudine Ebeid. It was engineered by Rob Smierciak and fact-checked by Yvonne Kim. Claudine Ebeid is the executive producer of Atlantic audio, and Andrea Valdez is our managing editor. Hanna Rosin is the host of Radio Atlantic and will return in a couple of weeks.\n\nUntil then, I'm Adam Harris, and thank you for listening.\n\ngd2md-html: xyzzy Thu Jul 18 2024"

On Washington Week With The Atlantic , panelists joined to discuss the voters who propelled Donald Trump's win, Democrats' reactions, and expectations for Trump's second term.\n\nMuch of Trump's win can be understood by looking at the seven key battleground states in this election. In many of these areas, Trump was able to turn out significantly more votes than he had in either the 2016 or 2020 election, especially among low-propensity voters, Tim Alberta explained last night.\n\n\"We're not just talking about persuading erstwhile Democrats to flip and go Republican, we're talking about turning out voters who had never been registered to vote before,\" Alberta said. \"Whether or not they will remain a durable piece of the Republican coalition remains to be seen, but in this election, that proved to be the difference.\"\n\nMeanwhile, panelists discussed how, for some of these voters, especially a base of young men, their consumption of news related to Trump came primarily from online media spaces such as podcasts, as Helen Lewis explained last night. \"For those younger people who are used to listening to TikTok, Instagram ... they're used to people talking to them face-to-face and being very open about their political views and trying to sell them things,\" she said. As opposed to the mainstream media's coverage of the election, these young voters were drawn to \"people who just go, 'Yeah, I'm for Trump.'\"\n\nJoining the editor in chief of The Atlantic , Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more: Tim Alberta, a staff writer at The Atlantic ; Susan Glasser, a staff writer at The New Yorker ; Asma Khalid, a White House correspondent for NPR and a political contributor for ABC News; and Helen Lewis, a staff writer at The Atlantic .\n\nWatch the full episode here ."

      "text": "The Great Republican Revolt\n\nThe GOP planned a dynastic restoration in 2016. Instead, it triggered an internal class war. Can the party reconcile the demands of its donors with the interests of its rank and file?\n\nThe angriest and most pessimistic people in America aren't the hipster protesters who flitted in and out of Occupy Wall Street. They aren't the hashtavists of #BlackLivesMatter. They aren't the remnants of the American labor movement or the savvy young dream ers who confront politicians with their American accents and un-American legal status.\n\nThe angriest and most pessimistic people in America are the people we used to call Middle Americans. Middle-class and middle-aged; not rich and not poor; people who are irked when asked to press 1 for English, and who wonder how white male became an accusation rather than a description.\n\nYou can measure their pessimism in polls that ask about their expectations for their lives-and for those of their children. On both counts, whites without a college degree express the bleakest view. You can see the effects of their despair in the new statistics describing horrifying rates of suicide and substance-abuse fatality among this same group, in middle age.\n\nWhite Middle Americans express heavy mistrust of every institution in American society: not only government, but corporations, unions, even the political party they typically vote for-the Republican Party of Romney, Ryan, and McConnell, which they despise as a sad crew of weaklings and sellouts. They are pissed off . And when Donald Trump came along, they were the people who told the pollsters, \"That's my guy.\"\n\nThey aren't necessarily superconservative. They often don't think in ideological terms at all. But they do strongly feel that life in this country used to be better for people like them-and they want that older country back.\n\nYou hear from people like them in many other democratic countries too. Across Europe, populist parties are delivering a message that combines defense of the welfare state with skepticism about immigration; that denounces the corruption of parliamentary democracy and also the risks of global capitalism. Some of these parties have a leftish flavor, like Italy's Five Star Movement. Some are rooted to the right of center, like the U.K. Independence Party. Some descend from neofascists, like France's National Front. Others trace their DNA to Communist parties, like Slovakia's governing Direction-Social Democracy.\n\nThese populists seek to defend what the French call \"acquired rights\"-health care, pensions, and other programs that benefit older people-against bankers and technocrats who endlessly demand austerity; against migrants who make new claims and challenge accustomed ways; against a globalized market that depresses wages and benefits. In the United States, they lean Republican because they fear the Democrats want to take from them and redistribute to Americans who are newer, poorer, and in their view less deserving-to \"spread the wealth around,\" in candidate Barack Obama's words to \"Joe the Plumber\" back in 2008. Yet they have come to fear more and more strongly that their party does not have their best interests at heart.\n\nA majority of Republicans worry that corporations and the wealthy exert too much power. Their party leaders work to ensure that these same groups can exert even more. Mainstream Republicans were quite at ease with tax increases on households earning more than $250,000 in the aftermath of the Great Recession and the subsequent stimulus. Their congressional representatives had the opposite priorities. In 2008, many Republican primary voters had agreed with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who wanted \"their next president to remind them of the guy they work with, not the guy who laid them off.\" But those Republicans did not count for much once the primaries ended, and normal politics resumed between the multicultural Democrats and a plutocratic GOP.\n\nThis year, they are counting for more. Their rebellion against the power of organized money has upended American politics in ways that may reverberate for a long time. To understand what may come next, we must first review the recent past.\n\nN ot so long ago, many observers worried that Americans had lost interest in politics. In his famous book Bowling Alone , published in 2000, the social scientist Robert Putnam bemoaned the collapse in American political participation during the second half of the 20th century. Putnam suggested that this trend would continue as the World War II generation gave way to disengaged Gen Xers.\n\nBut even as Putnam's book went into paperback, that notion was falling behind the times. In the 1996 presidential election, voter turnout had tumbled to the lowest level since the 1920s, less than 52 percent. Turnout rose slightly in November 2000. Then, suddenly: overdrive. In the presidential elections of 2004 and 2008, voter turnout spiked to levels not seen since before the voting age was lowered to 18, and in 2012 it dipped only a little. Voters were excited by a hailstorm of divisive events: the dot-com bust, the Bush-versus-Gore recount, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Iraq War, the financial crisis, the bailouts and stimulus, and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPutnam was right that Americans were turning away from traditional sources of information. But that was because they were turning to new ones: first cable news channels and partisan political documentaries; then blogs and news aggregators like the Drudge Report and The Huffington Post ; after that, and most decisively, social media.\n\nPolitics was becoming more central to Americans' identities in the 21st century than it ever was in the 20th. Would you be upset if your child married a supporter of a different party from your own? In 1960, only 5 percent of Americans said yes. In 2010, a third of Democrats and half of Republicans did. Political identity has become so central because it has come to overlap with so many other aspects of identity: race, religion, lifestyle. In 1960, I wouldn't have learned much about your politics if you told me that you hunted. Today, that hobby strongly suggests Republican loyalty. Unmarried? In 1960, that indicated little. Today, it predicts that you're a Democrat, especially if you're also a woman.\n\nMeanwhile, the dividing line that used to be the most crucial of them all-class-has increasingly become a division within the parties, not between them. Since 1984, nearly every Democratic presidential-primary race has ended as a contest between a \"wine track\" candidate who appealed to professionals (Gary Hart, Michael Dukakis, Paul Tsongas, Bill Bradley, and Barack Obama) and a \"beer track\" candidate who mobilized the remains of the old industrial working class (Walter Mondale, Dick Gephardt, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Hillary Clinton). The Republicans have their equivalent in the battles between \"Wall Street\" and \"Main Street\" candidates. Until this decade, however, both parties-and especially the historically more cohesive Republicans-managed to keep sufficient class peace to preserve party unity.\n\nNot anymore, at least not for the Republicans.\n\nThe Great Recession ended in the summer of 2009. Since then, the U.S. economy has been growing, but most incomes have not grown comparably. In 2014, real median household income remained almost $4,000 below the pre-recession level, and well below the level in 1999. The country has recovered from the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. Most of its people have not. Many Republicans haven't shared in the recovery and continued upward flight of their more affluent fellow partisans.\n\nIt was these pessimistic Republicans who powered the Tea Party movement of 2009 and 2010. They were not, as a rule, libertarians looking for an ultraminimal government. The closest study we have of the beliefs of Tea Party supporters, led by Theda Skocpol, a Harvard political scientist, found that \"Tea Partiers judge entitlement programs not in terms of abstract free-market orthodoxy, but according to the perceived deservingness of recipients . The distinction between 'workers' and 'people who don't work' is fundamental to Tea Party ideology.\"\n\nIt's uncertain whether any Tea Partier ever really carried a placard that read keep your government hands off my Medicare . But if so, that person wasn't spouting gibberish. The Obama administration had laid hands on Medicare. It hoped to squeeze $500 billion out of the program from 2010 to 2020 to finance health insurance for the uninsured. You didn't have to look up the figures to have a sense that many of the uninsured were noncitizens (20 percent), or that even more were foreign-born (27 percent). In the Tea Party's angry town-hall meetings, this issue resonated perhaps more loudly than any other-the ultimate example of redistribution from a deserving \"us\" to an undeserving \"them.\"\n\nYet even as the Republican Main Street protested Obamacare, it rejected the hardening ideological orthodoxy of Republican donors and elected officials. A substantial minority of Republicans-almost 30 percent-said they would welcome \"heavy\" taxes on the wealthy, according to Gallup. Within the party that made Paul Ryan's entitlement-slashing budget plan a centerpiece of policy, only 21 percent favored cuts in Medicare and only 17 percent wanted to see spending on Social Security reduced, according to Pew. Less than a third of ordinary Republicans supported a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants (again according to Pew); a majority, by contrast, favored stepped-up deportation.\n\nAs a class, big Republican donors could not see any of this, or would not. So neither did the politicians who depend upon them. Against all evidence, both groups interpreted the Tea Party as a mass movement in favor of the agenda of the Wall Street Journal editorial page. One of the more dangerous pleasures of great wealth is that you never have to hear anyone tell you that you are completely wrong.\n\nI t was Mitt Romney who got the first post-Tea Party presidential nomination, and he ran on a platform of Conservatism Classic: tax cuts, budget cuts, deregulation, free trade-all lightly seasoned with some concessions to the base regarding stricter immigration enforcement. The rank and file did not like it. But they could not stop it. The base kept elevating \"not Romneys\" into first place, and each rapidly failed or fizzled; Romney, supported by a cumulative total of $139 million in primary funds by March 2012, trundled on.\n\nRomney ultimately lost the presidential election, of course, to the surprise and dismay of a party elite confident of victory until the very end. One might have expected this shock to force a rethink. The Republicans had now lost four out of the past six presidential elections. Another election had been won only in the Electoral College, despite the loss of the popular vote. Even their best showing, 50.7 percent of the vote in 2004, represented the closest escape of any incumbent president who won reelection since the first recorded popular vote.\n\nAnd yet, within hours of Romney's defeat, Republican donors, talkers, and officials converged on the maximally self-exculpating explanation. The problem had not been the plan to phase out Medicare for people younger than 55. Or the lack of ideas about how to raise wages. Or the commitment to ending health-insurance coverage for millions of working-age Americans. Or the anthems to wealth creation and entrepreneurship in a country increasingly skeptical of both. No, the problem was the one element of Romney's message they had never liked anyway: immigration enforcement.\n\nOwners of capital assets, employers of low-skill laborers, and highly compensated professionals tend to benefit economically from the arrival of immigrants. They are better positioned to enjoy the attractive cultural and social results of migration (more-interesting food!) and to protect themselves against the burdensome impacts (surges in non-English-proficient pupils in public schools). A pro-immigration policy shift was one more assertion of class interest in a party program already brimful of them.\n\nNobody expressed the party elites' consensus view more assuredly than Charles Krauthammer. \"Ignore the trimmers,\" he wrote in his first postelection column. \"There's no need for radical change. The other party thinks it owns the demographic future-counter that in one stroke by fixing the Latino problem. Do not, however, abandon the party's philosophical anchor ... No reinvention when none is needed.\"\n\n\"We've gotta get rid of the immigration issue altogether,\" Sean Hannity told his radio audience the day after the election. \"It's simple for me to fix it. I think you control the border first, you create a pathway for those people that are here, you don't say, 'You gotta go home.' And that is a position that I've evolved on.\"\n\nA co-owner of Fox News-Krauthammer and Hannity's TV network-agreed: \"Must have sweeping, generous immigration reform,\" tweeted Rupert Murdoch on November 7, 2012. \"It would be inhumane to send those people back, to send 12 million people out of this country,\" the casino mogul and Republican donor Sheldon Adelson told The Wall Street Journal in December of that year. \"We've got to find a way, find a route, for those people to get legal citizenship.\" The Republican National Committee made it all official in a March 2013 postelection report signed by party eminences. The report generally avoided policy recommendations, with a notable exception: \"We must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.\" To advance the cause, Paul Singer, one of the most open-pocketed GOP donors, made a six-figure contribution to the National Immigration Forum that spring.\n\nIf all of this sounds like a prescription for a Jeb Bush candidacy for president ... well, perhaps that was not an entirely unintended consequence.\n\nAlmost as soon as the new Congress convened in 2013, Senate Republicans worked to strike a deal over immigration issues. A bipartisan \"Gang of Eight,\" including Florida's ambitious young Marco Rubio, agreed on a plan that would create a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants and substantially increase legal-immigration limits for both high- and low-skilled workers. Otherwise, the party yielded on nothing and doubled down on everything. No U-turns. No compromises.\n\nThe new strategy soon proved a total and utter failure. George W. Bush's tax cuts for high earners expired in 2013, and Republicans could not renew them. The drive to cut the deficit ended in budget sequestration, whose harshest effect fell on the military. The Gang of Eight deal never came to a vote in the House. All the while, Republicans' approval ratings slipped and slid. Instead of holding on to their base and adding Hispanics, Republicans alienated their base in return for no gains at all. By mid-2015, a majority of self-identified Republicans disapproved of their party's congressional leadership-an intensity of disapproval never seen by the Republican majority of the 1990s nor by Democrats during their time in the majority after the 2006 midterm elections.\n\nIn fact, disapproval had flared into an outright revolt of the Republican base in the summer of 2014. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the No. 2 man in the Republican caucus, had emerged as a leader of the new line on immigration. Up for reelection in Virginia's Seventh District, Cantor was challenged that year by a conservative Christian professor of economics, Dave Brat. During Obama's first term, Tea Party insurgents had toppled incumbents and defeated party favorites in primaries from Delaware to Nevada. Those challenges had ended badly in the general election, for the most part: Tea Party Republicans lost at least five Senate seats that might plausibly have been won. Party leaders believed the lesson had been learned and expected their voters to be more tractable in future elections.\n\nCantor's loss to Brat jolted House leaders. Immigration reform slipped off their agenda. Marco Rubio repudiated his own deal. But Republican elites outside Congress did not get the message. They rationalized Cantor's defeat as a freak event, the sad consequence of a nationally minded politician's neglect of his district. They continued to fill the coffers of Jeb Bush and, to a lesser extent, Rubio and Scott Walker, all reliable purveyors of Conservatism Classic. Last February, three of the party's most important moneymen-the fast-food executive Andrew Puzder, the health-care investor Mike Fernandez, and the national finance chair of Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, Spencer Zwick-publicly urged the GOP to push ahead toward more-open immigration. \"America should be a destination for hardworking immigrants from all over the world,\" said Puzder, an advocate of importing more low-skilled laborers to meet the needs of his high-turnover industry. Zwick said that any presidential candidate who wanted to be taken seriously had better \"be in a similar place\" to Jeb Bush on the immigration issue.\n\nM aybe it was not a good idea for Jeb Bush's allies to describe his fund-raising strategy as \"shock and awe.\" Perhaps the Iraq War reference stirred painful memories, even among Republicans. Still, Bush's fund-raising genuinely inspired awe. In his financial disclosure for the second quarter of 2015, Bush reported raising $11.4 million for his formal campaign and another $103 million for his super PAC . These funds were provided by a relatively small number of very wealthy people. Of Bush's presidential-campaign dollars, only 3 percent arrived in amounts of $200 or less. Almost 82 percent arrived in the maximum increment of $2,700. Nearly 80 percent of Bush's super- PAC take arrived in increments of $25,000 or more; about a quarter of the haul was made up of donations of $1 million or more.\n\nYet seldom in the history of fund-raising has so much bought so little, so fleetingly. Between December 2014 and September 2015, Jeb Bush plunged from first place in the Republican field to fifth. Between late September and mid-October, he purchased 60 percent of all political spots aired in New Hampshire. That ad barrage pushed his poll numbers in the state from about 9 percent to about 8 percent.\n\nAs the governor of Florida, Bush had cut taxes and balanced budgets. He'd challenged unions and championed charter schools. At the same time, Bush passionately supported immigration liberalization. The central event in his life history was his reinvention as an honorary Latino American when he married a Mexican woman, Columba Garnica de Gallo. He spoke Spanish at home. He converted to Catholicism. He sought his fortune with a Cuban American business partner. In his most quotable phrase, he described illegal immigration as an \"act of love.\"\n\nBush's update of Conservatism Classic had made him a hit with the party's big donors. He had won accolades from Karl Rove (\"the deepest thinker on our side\") and Arthur Brooks, the president of the American Enterprise Institute (\"a top-drawer intellect\"). Yet within five weeks of his formal declaration of candidacy on June 15, Bush's campaign had been brutally rejected by the GOP rank and file.\n\nFrom Jupiter Island, Florida, to Greenwich, Connecticut; from Dallas's Highland Park to Sea Island, Georgia; from Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to California's Newport Beach, the baffled question resounded: What went wrong?\n\nBig-dollar Republican favorites have run into trouble before, of course. Rudy Giuliani imploded in 2007-08; Mitt Romney's 2012 nomination was knocked off course as Republicans worked their way through a series of alternative front-runners: Rick Perry, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, and finally Rick Santorum. But Giuliani lost ground to two rivals equally acceptable to the donor elite, or nearly so: Mitt Romney and John McCain. In 2011-12, the longest any of the \"not Romneys\" remained in first place was six weeks. In both cycles, resistance to the party favorite was concentrated among social and religious conservatives.\n\nThe mutiny of the 2016 election cycle has been different. By the fall of 2015, a majority of Republicans favored candidates who had never been elected to anything: Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina. Fiorina's campaign was perhaps not so unusual. A former CEO, she appealed to the same business-minded Republicans who might have voted for Romney in 2012. Carson appealed to the same religious conservatives that candidates like Mike Huckabee and Santorum had appealed to in prior presidential cycles. What was new and astonishing was the Trump boom. He jettisoned party orthodoxy on issues ranging from entitlement spending to foreign policy. He scoffed at trade agreements. He said rude things about Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers. He reviled the campaign contributions of big donors-himself included!-as open and blatant favor-buying. Trump's surge was a decisive repudiation by millions of Republican voters of the collective wisdom of their party elite.\n\nWhen Trump first erupted into the Republican race in June, he did so with a message of grim pessimism. \"We got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems ... We're dying. We're dying. We need money ... We have losers. We have people that don't have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain ... The American dream is dead.\"\n\nThat message did not resonate with those who'd ridden the S&P 500 from less than 900 in 2009 to more than 2,000 in 2015. But it found an audience all the same. Half of Trump's supporters within the GOP had stopped their education at or before high-school graduation, according to the polling firm YouGov. Only 19 percent had a college or postcollege degree. Thirty-eight percent earned less than $50,000. Only 11 percent earned more than $100,000.\n\nTrump Republicans were not ideologically militant. Just 13 percent said they were very conservative; 19 percent described themselves as moderate. Nor were they highly religious by Republican standards.\n\nWhat set them apart from other Republicans was their economic insecurity and the intensity of their economic nationalism. Sixty-three percent of Trump supporters wished to end birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants born on U.S. soil-a dozen points higher than the norm for all Republicans. More than other Republicans, Trump supporters distrusted Barack Obama as alien and dangerous: Only 21 percent acknowledged that the president was born in the United States, according to an August survey by the Democratic-oriented polling firm PPP. Sixty-six percent believed the president was a Muslim.\n\nTrump promised to protect these voters' pensions from their own party's austerity. \"We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.\"\n\nHe promised to protect their children from being drawn into another war in the Middle East, this time in Syria. \"If we're going to have World War III,\" he told The Washington Post in October, \"it's not going to be over Syria.\" As for the politicians threatening to shoot down the Russian jets flying missions in Syria, \"I won't even call them hawks. I call them the fools.\"\n\nHe promised a campaign independent of the influences of money that had swayed so many Republican races of the past. \"I will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people. Before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me. And that's a broken system.\"\n\nHe promised above all to protect their wages from being undercut by Republican immigration policy.\n\nI t cannot last, can it? \"The casino does not always win,\" Stuart Stevens, Mitt Romney's lead strategist during the 2012 campaign, quipped to me in September. \"But that's the way to bet.\" The casino won in 2012, and will very likely win again in 2016.\n\nAnd yet already, Trump has destroyed one elite-favored presidential candidacy, Scott Walker's, and crippled two others, Jeb Bush's and Chris Christie's. He has thrown into disarray the party's post-2012 comeback strategy, and pulled into the center of national discussion issues and constituencies long relegated to the margins.\n\nSomething has changed in American politics since the Great Recession. The old slogans ring hollow. The insurgent candidates are less absurd, the orthodox candidates more vulnerable. The GOP donor elite planned a dynastic restoration in 2016. Instead, it triggered an internal class war.\n\nThe contest for the presidency turns on external events as much as-or more than-internal party politics. George W. Bush's team believed that the last-minute revelation of a 1976 drunk-driving arrest cost him the popular vote in the 2000 election. Jimmy Carter blamed his 1980 defeat on the debacle of the attempted rescue of American hostages in Iran. So anything can happen. But that does not mean anything will happen. Barring shocks, presidential elections turn on the fundamentals of economics, demography, and ideology.\n\nThe puzzle for the monied leaders of the Republican Party is: What now? And what next after that? None of the options facing the GOP elite is entirely congenial. But there appear to be four paths the elite could follow, for this campaign season and beyond. They lead the party in very different directions.\n\nThe premise of the past few thousand words is that the Republican donor elite failed to impose its preferred candidate on an unwilling base in 2015 for big and important reasons. But maybe that premise is wrong. Maybe Jeb Bush has just been a bad candidate with a radioactive last name. Maybe the same message and platform would have worked fine if espoused by a fresher and livelier candidate. Such is the theory of Marco Rubio's campaign. Or-even if the donor message and platform have troubles-maybe $100 million in negative ads can scorch any potential alternative, enabling the donor-backed candidate to win by default.\n\nAnd if not Rubio, maybe the core donor message could still work if joined to a true outsider candidacy: Ben Carson's, for example. Carson is often regarded as a protest candidate, but as The Weekly Standard 's Fred Barnes enthused back in January 2015: \"One thing not in doubt is Carson's conservatism. He's the real deal, an economic, social, and foreign policy conservative.\" Carson may say wacky things, but he does not say heterodox things.\n\nYet even if the Republican donor elite can keep control of the party while doubling down, it's doubtful that the tactic can ultimately win presidential elections. The \"change nothing but immigration\" advice was a self-flattering fantasy from the start. Immigration is not the main reason Republican presidential candidates lose so badly among Latino and Asian American voters, and never was: Latino voters are more likely to list education and health care as issues that are extremely important to them. A majority of Asian Americans are non-Christian and susceptible to exclusion by sectarian religious themes.\n\nSo ...\n\nPerhaps some concession to the disgruntled base is needed. That's the theory of the Cruz campaign and-after a course correction-also of the Christie campaign. Instead of 2013's \"Conservatism Classic Plus Immigration Liberalization,\" Cruz and Christie are urging \"Conservatism Classic Plus Immigration Enforcement.\" True, Cruz's carefully selected words on immigration leave open the possibility of guest-worker programs or other pro-employer reforms after a burst of border enforcement. But Cruz and Christie have seen the reaction to Donald Trump's message, and appear to appreciate the need to at least seem to do something to redress the grievances of the Republican base.\n\nMuch of the donor elite could likely be convinced that while Jeb Bush's idea of immigration reform would be good to have, it isn't a must-have. Just as the party elite reached a pact on abortion with social conservatives in the 1980s, it could concede the immigration issue to its Main Street base in the 2010s.\n\nYet a narrow focus on immigration populism alone seems insufficient to raise Republican hopes. Trump shrewdly joins his immigration populism to trade populism. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders's opposition to open borders is logically connected to his hopes for a Democratic Socialist future: His admired Denmark upholds high labor standards along with some of the world's toughest immigration rules. Severed from a larger agenda, however-as Mitt Romney tried to sever the issue in 2012-immigration populism looks at best like pandering, and at worst like identity politics for white voters. In a society that is and always has been multiethnic and polyglot, any national party must compete more broadly than that.\n\nWhich brings us to ...\n\nAdmittedly, this may be the most uncongenial thought of them all, but party elites could try to open more ideological space for the economic interests of the middle class. Make peace with universal health-insurance coverage: Mend Obamacare rather than end it. Cut taxes less at the top, and use the money to deliver more benefits to working families in the middle. Devise immigration policy to support wages, not undercut them. Worry more about regulations that artificially transfer wealth upward, and less about regulations that constrain financial speculation. Take seriously issues such as the length of commutes, nursing-home costs, and the anticompetitive practices that inflate college tuition. Remember that Republican voters care more about aligning government with their values of work and family than they care about cutting the size of government as an end in itself. Recognize that the gimmick of mobilizing the base with culture-war outrages stopped working at least a decade ago.\n\nSuch a party would cut health-care costs by squeezing providers, not young beneficiaries. It would boost productivity by investing in hard infrastructure-bridges, airports, water-treatment plants. It would restore Dwight Eisenhower to the Republican pantheon alongside Ronald Reagan and emphasize the center in center-right .\n\nTo imagine the change is to see how convulsive it would be-and how unlikely. True, center-right conservative parties backed by broad multiethnic coalitions of the middle class have gained and exercised power in other English-speaking countries, even as Republicans lost the presidency in 2008 and 2012. But the most-influential voices in American conservatism reject the experience of their foreign counterparts as weak, unprincipled, and unnecessary. In parliamentary democracy, winning or losing is starkly binary: A party either is in power or is the opposition. In the American system, that binary is much blurrier. Republicans can, of course, exert some control over government as long as they hold any one of the House, Senate, or presidency.\n\nWhich brings us finally to ...\n\n\"The filibuster used to be bad. Now it's good.\" So Fred Thompson, the late actor and former Republican senator, jokingly told an audience on a National Review cruise shortly after Barack Obama won the presidency for the first time. How partisans feel about process issues is notoriously related to what process would benefit them at any given moment. Liberals loved the interventionist Supreme Court in the 1960s and '70s, hated it in the 1990s and 2000s-and may rotate their opinion again if a President Hillary Clinton can tilt a majority of the Supreme Court their way. It's an old story that may find a new twist if and when Republicans acknowledge that the presidency may be attainable only after they make policy changes that are unacceptable to the party elite.\n\nThere are metrics, after all, by which the post-2009 GOP appears to be a supremely successful political party. Recently, Rory Cooper, of the communications firm Purple Strategies, tallied a net gain to the Republicans of 69 seats in the House of Representatives, 13 seats in the Senate, 900-plus seats in state legislatures, and 12 governorships since Obama took office. With that kind of grip on state government, in particular, Republicans are well positioned to write election and voting rules that sustain their hold on the national legislature. The president may be able to grant formerly illegal immigrants the right to work, but he cannot grant them the right to vote. In this light, instead of revising Republican policies to stop future Barack Obamas and Hillary Clintons, maybe it's necessary to revise only the party rules to stop future Donald Trumps from confronting party elites with their own unpopularity.\n\nThe inaugural issue of The Weekly Standard , the conservative magazine launched in 1995, depicted then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich swinging into action, a submachine gun blazing in his left hand, under the headline \"Permanent Offense.\" But that was then. Maybe the more natural condition of conservative parties is permanent defense-and where better to wage a long, grinding defensive campaign than in Congress and the statehouses? Maybe the presidency itself should be regarded as one of those things that is good to have but not a must-have, especially if obtaining it requires uncomfortable change.\n\nWhat happens to an elite whose followers withdraw their assent? Does it self-examine? Or does it take refuge in denial? Does it change? Or does it try to prevent change? Does it challenge itself to build a new political majority? Or does it seize the opportunities the American political system offers to compact and purposeful minorities? When its old answers fail, will it think anew? Or will it simply repeat louder the dogmas that enthralled supporters in the past? Americans love the crush of competition, the hard-fought struggle, the long-slogging race. But much more than the pundit's \"Who will win?,\" it is these deeper questions from the election of 2016 that will shape the future of American politics."

      "text": "Boycott the Republican Party\n\nIf conservatives want to save the GOP from itself, they need to vote mindlessly and mechanically against its nominees.\n\nA few days after the Democratic electoral sweep this past November in Virginia, New Jersey, and elsewhere, The Washington Post asked a random Virginia man to explain his vote. The man, a marketing executive named Toren Beasley, replied that his calculus was simply to refuse to calculate. \"It could have been Dr. Seuss or the Berenstain Bears on the ballot and I would have voted for them if they were a Democrat,\" he said. \"I might do more analyses in other years. But in this case, no. No one else gets any consideration because what's going on with the Republicans-I'm talking about Trump and his cast of characters-is stupid, stupid, stupid. I can't say stupid enough times.\"\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nCount us in, Mr. Beasley. We're with you, though we tend to go with dangerous rather than stupid . And no one could be more surprised that we're saying this than we are.\n\nWe have both spent our professional careers strenuously avoiding partisanship in our writing and thinking. We have both done work that is, in different ways, ideologically eclectic, and that has-over a long period of time-cast us as not merely nonpartisans but antipartisans. Temperamentally, we agree with the late Christopher Hitchens: Partisanship makes you stupid. We are the kind of voters who political scientists say barely exist-true independents who scour candidates' records in order to base our votes on individual merit, not party brand.\n\nThis, then, is the article we thought we would never write: a frank statement that a certain form of partisanship is now a moral necessity. The Republican Party, as an institution, has become a danger to the rule of law and the integrity of our democracy. The problem is not just Donald Trump; it's the larger political apparatus that made a conscious decision to enable him. In a two-party system, nonpartisanship works only if both parties are consistent democratic actors. If one of them is not predictably so, the space for nonpartisans evaporates. We're thus driven to believe that the best hope of defending the country from Trump's Republican enablers, and of saving the Republican Party from itself, is to do as Toren Beasley did: vote mindlessly and mechanically against Republicans at every opportunity, until the party either rights itself or implodes (very preferably the former).\n\nOf course, lots of people vote a straight ticket. Some do so because they are partisan. Others do so because of a particular policy position: Many pro-lifers, for example, will not vote for Democrats, even pro-life Democrats, because they see the Democratic Party as institutionally committed to the slaughter of babies.\n\nWe're proposing something different. We're suggesting that in today's situation, people should vote a straight Democratic ticket even if they are not partisan, and despite their policy views. They should vote against Republicans in a spirit that is, if you will, prepartisan and prepolitical. Their attitude should be: The rule of law is a threshold value in American politics, and a party that endangers this value disqualifies itself, period. In other words, under certain peculiar and deeply regrettable circumstances, sophisticated, independent-minded voters need to act as if they were dumb-ass partisans.\n\nFor us, this represents a counsel of desperation. So allow us to step back and explain what drove us to what we call oppositional partisanship.\n\nTo avoid misunderstanding, here are some things we are not saying. First, although we worry about extremism in the GOP, that is not a reason to boycott the party. We agree with political analysts who say that the Republicans veered off-center earlier and more sharply than the Democrats-but recently the Democrats have made up for lost time by moving rapidly leftward. In any case, under normal circumstances our response to radicalization within a party would be to support sane people within that party.\n\nNor is our oppositional partisanship motivated by the belief that Republican policies are wrongheaded. Republicans are a variegated bunch, and we agree with many traditional GOP positions. One of us has spent the past several years arguing that counterterrorism authorities should be granted robust powers, defending detentions at Guantánamo Bay , and supporting the confirmations of any number of conservative judges and justices whose nominations enraged liberals . The other is a Burkean conservative with libertarian tendencies and a long history of activism against left-wing intolerance . And even if we did consistently reject Republican policy positions, that would not be sufficient basis to boycott the entire party-just to oppose the bad ideas advanced by it.\n\nOne more nonreason for our stance: that we are horrified by the president. To be sure, we are horrified by much that Trump has said and done. But many members of his party are likewise horrified. Republicans such as Senators John McCain and Bob Corker and Jeff Flake and Ben Sasse, as well as former Governors Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush, have spoken out and conducted themselves with integrity. Abandoning an entire party means abandoning many brave and honorable people. We would not do that based simply on rot at the top.\n\nS o why have we come to regard the GOP as an institutional danger? In a nutshell, it has proved unable or unwilling (mostly unwilling) to block assaults by Trump and his base on the rule of law. Those assaults, were they to be normalized, would pose existential, not incidental, threats to American democracy.\n\nFuture generations of scholars will scrutinize the many weird ways that Trump has twisted the GOP. For present purposes, however, let's focus on the party's failure to restrain the president from two unforgivable sins. The first is his attempt to erode the independence of the justice system. This includes Trump's sinister interactions with his law-enforcement apparatus: his demands for criminal investigations of his political opponents, his pressuring of law-enforcement leaders on investigative matters, his frank efforts to interfere with investigations that implicate his personal interests, and his threats against the individuals who run the Justice Department. It also includes his attacks on federal judges, his pardon of a sheriff convicted of defying a court's order to enforce constitutional rights, his belief that he gets to decide on Twitter who is guilty of what crimes, and his view that the justice system exists to effectuate his will. Some Republicans have clucked disapprovingly at various of Trump's acts. But in each case, many other Republicans have cheered, and the party, as a party, has quickly moved on. A party that behaves this way is not functioning as a democratic actor.\n\nThe second unforgivable sin is Trump's encouragement of a foreign adversary's interference in U.S. electoral processes. Leave aside the question of whether Trump's cooperation with the Russians violated the law. He at least tacitly collaborated with a foreign-intelligence operation against his country-sometimes in full public view. This started during the campaign, when he called upon the Russians to steal and release his opponent's emails, and has continued during his presidency, as he equivocates on whether foreign intervention occurred and smears intelligence professionals who stand by the facts. Meanwhile, the Republican Party has confirmed his nominees, doggedly pursued its agenda on tax reform and health care, and attacked-of course-Hillary Clinton.\n\nWe don't mean to deny credit where it is due: Some congressional Republicans pushed back. Last year, pressure from individual Republicans seemed to discourage Trump from firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and probably prevented action against Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Moreover, Republicans as a group have constrained Trump on occasion. Congress imposed tough sanctions on Russia over the president's objections. The Senate Intelligence Committee conducted a serious Russia investigation under the leadership of Richard Burr. But the broader response to Trump's behavior has been tolerant and, often, enabling.\n\nThe reason is that Trump and his forces have taken command of the party. Anti-Trump Republicans can muster only rearguard actions, which we doubt can hold the line against a multiyear, multifront assault from Trump and his allies.\n\nIt is tempting to assume that this assault will fail. After all, Trump is unpopular, the Republican Party's prospects in this year's midterm elections are dim, and the president is under aggressive investigation. What's more, democratic institutions held up pretty well in the first year of the Trump administration. Won't they get us through the rest?\n\nPerhaps. But we should not count on the past year to provide the template for the next three. Under the pressure of persistent attacks, many of them seemingly minor, democratic institutions can erode gradually until they suddenly fail. That the structures hold up for a while does not mean they will hold up indefinitely-and if they do, they may not hold up well.\n\nEven now, erosion is visible. Republican partisans and policy makers routinely accept insults to constitutional norms that, under Barack Obama, they would have condemned as outrageous. When Trump tweeted about taking \"NBC and the Networks\" off the air (\"Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked\"), congressional Republicans were quick to repudiate ... left-wing media bias. In a poll by the Cato Institute, almost two-thirds of Republican respondents agreed with the president that journalists are \"an enemy of the American people.\" How much damage can Trump do in the next three years? We don't know, but we see no grounds to be complacent.\n\nThe optimistic outcome depends to some degree on precisely the sort of oppositional partisanship we are prescribing. For Trump to be restrained going forward, key congressional enablers will need to lose their seats in the midterm elections to people who will use legislation and oversight to push back against the administration. Without such electoral losses, the picture looks decidedly grimmer.\n\nFinally, we might not be talking about just three more years. Trump could get reelected; incumbent presidents usually do. In any event, he is likely, at a minimum, to be renominated for the presidency.\n\nThat's because Trump has won the heart of the Republican base. He may be unpopular with the public at large, but among Republicans, nothing he and his supporters said or did during his first year in office drove his Gallup approval ratings significantly below 80 percent. Forced to choose between their support for Trump and their suspicion of Russia, conservatives went with Trump. Forced to choose between their support for Trump and their insistence that character matters, evangelicals went with Trump.\n\nIt's Trump's party now; or, perhaps more to the point, it's Trumpism's party, because a portion of the base seems eager to out-Trump Trump. In last year's special election to fill a vacant U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, Republican primary voters defied the president himself by nominating a candidate who was openly contemptuous of the rule of law-and many stuck with him when he was credibly alleged to have been a child molester. After initially balking, the Republican Party threw its institutional support behind him too. In Virginia, pressure from the base drove a previously sensible Republican gubernatorial candidate into the fever swamps. Faced with the choice between soul-killing accommodation and futile resistance, many Republican politicians who renounce Trumpism are fleeing the party or exiting politics altogether. Of those who remain, many are fighting for their political lives against a nihilistic insurgency.\n\nSo we arrive at a syllogism:\n\nIf the syllogism holds, then the most-important tasks in U.S. politics right now are to change the Republicans' trajectory and to deprive them of power in the meantime. In our two-party system, the surest way to accomplish these things is to support the other party, in every race from president to dogcatcher. The goal is to make the Republican Party answerable at every level, exacting a political price so stinging as to force the party back into the democratic fold.\n\nThe off-year elections in November showed that this is possible. Democrats flooded polling places, desperate to \"resist.\" Independents added their voice. Even some Republicans abandoned their party. One Virginia Republican, explaining why he had just voted for Democrats in every race, told The Washington Post , \"I've been with the Republicans my whole life, but what the party has been doing is appalling.\" Trump's base stayed loyal but was overwhelmed by other voters. A few more spankings like that will give anti-Trump Republicans a fighting chance to regain influence within their party.\n\nWe understand why Republicans, even moderate ones, are reluctant to cross party lines. Party, today, is identity. But in the through-the-looking-glass era of Donald Trump, the best thing Republicans can do for their party is vote against it.\n\nWe understand, too, the many imperfections of the Democratic Party. Its left is extreme, its center is confused, and it has its share of bad apples. But the Democratic Party is not a threat to our democratic order. That is why we are rising above our independent predilections and behaving like dumb-ass partisans. It's why we hope many smart people will do the same.\n\nThis article appears in the March 2018 print edition with the headline \"Boycott the GOP.\""

Statehood\n\nRIP\n\nUpdated at 9:20 a.m. ET on June 17, 2021.\n\nWhen residents of Washington, D.C., got the chance to vote in the 1956 presidential primaries, their first opportunities to vote since Reconstruction, it was at the behest of a Republican president, Dwight Eisenhower, who phrased his support in conservative terms: \"In the District of Columbia the time is long overdue for granting national suffrage to its citizens and also applying the principle of local self-government to the Nation's Capital.\" When the district gained electoral votes under the Twenty-Third Amendment in 1961, the charge was led by Senator Kenneth Keating, a New York Republican. In 1970, Republican President Richard Nixon signed legislation giving the district a nonvoting delegate in the House. And when another amendment sought to give D.C. full congressional representation in 1978, the Republican Edward Brooke, of Massachusetts, introduced the measure in the Senate.\n\nThis largely forgotten history is surprising today, when the GOP is dead set against statehood for the district-something many Democrats portray as an almost-existential necessity. But representation for Washington was once a matter of bipartisan agreement, and as recently as 15 years ago, Mike Pence was in favor of it. The Republican path from support to furious opposition is a microcosm of the GOP's broader shift toward a much more restrictive approach to voting rights. This is partly a story about realignments within the two major parties, but it is also a story about the entrenchment of winner-takes-all politics.\n\n\"The issue of representation for the people of D.C. has not changed at all,\" says Perry O'Brien, the organizing director of Common Defense and a member of the Defend American Democracy coalition, who has compiled a history of past GOP support for various proposals on the issue . \"What has changed is if the Republican Party was ever seriously concerned about preserving our basic democratic institutions, they clearly are not any longer.\"\n\nChris Myers Asch and George Derek Musgrove: Don't fall for the D.C. retrocession 'okey-doke'\n\nAt one time, though, the GOP clearly was concerned. From 1956 to 1976, both the Democratic and Republican platforms called for congressional representation for D.C., according to the historian George Derek Musgrove , with the exception of the 1964 GOP platform. The District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment had bipartisan support when it passed Congress in 1978. Among its backers was Senator Strom Thurmond, the notoriously racist Dixiecrat turned Republican from South Carolina, whose support helped sway other GOP votes.\n\n\"It is just not fair that in the year 1978, more than 700,000 American citizens do not have the right to elect representatives to Congress,\" Thurmond said. \"No one in 1790, when the District was created, could have imagined the rapid growth and changes that were to take place in the District of Columbia.\"\n\nBarry Goldwater, the very conservative though sometimes idiosyncratic senator from Arizona, agreed. \"The right to vote in federal elections is a right that flows directly from the Constitution to each citizen of the United States. This right is one belonging to national citizenship and it arises out of the very nature and existence of the nation itself,\" he said during Senate debate . \"It is the right thing to do.\"\n\nAnne Applebaum: A real place deserves real rights\n\nAfter the DCVRA passed Congress, however, the conservative movement that had sprung from Goldwater's presidential campaign began an effort to prevent the amendment from being ratified in the states, fearing (probably correctly) that representation for D.C.'s majority-black, solidly Democratic population would boost liberal priorities such as the Equal Rights Amendment and more sweeping affirmative action.\n\nThe coalition succeeded not only in stopping the DCVRA, but also snuffing out most Republican support for D.C. representation up to the present. (Because of constitutional limitations, there are really just two ways to provide congressional representation to D.C.: either a constitutional amendment like the DCVRA, or else statehood, which would automatically grant representation without requiring an amendment.)\n\nBy 1993, when D.C. statehood came up in Congress, only a single Republican voted in favor in the House, though a few Republicans have backed the idea of representation in the years since. In 2007, the conservative legal luminary (and former Whitewater independent counsel) Ken Starr told Congress :\n\nA republican, that is representative, form of government, is a foundational cornerstone in the Constitution's structure; the denial of representation was one of the provocations that generated the Declaration of Independence and the War that implemented it. Article I creates the republican form of the national government, and Article IV guarantees that form to its people, regardless of whether they reside in a District or a State.\n\nThen-Representative Mike Pence also spoke in favor of the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007. \"The fact that more than half a million Americans live in the District of Columbia and are denied a single voting representative in Congress is clearly a historic wrong, and justice demands that it be addressed,\" he said . (Pence did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nRead: D.C. statehood is more urgent than ever\n\nThe bill never passed, and few Republicans have spoken that way since. Some have couched their opposition to statehood in constitutional terms or embraced deflections such as retrocession . By 2020, the president whom Pence served as vice president was ruling it out flatly.\n\n\"D.C. will never be a state,\" Donald Trump told the New York Post in May 2020 . \"You mean District of Columbia, a state? Why? So we can have two more Democratic-Democrat senators and five more congressmen? No thank you. That'll never happen.\" (How Trump came up with five is unclear; based on current population, D.C. would likely have a single representative.)\n\nIn this interview, Trump made explicit what other Republicans were unwilling to say quite so openly, as he often did: Fairness isn't the point. Winning elections is the point, and that means keeping the \"wrong\" people from voting.\n\nRead: Jeff Sessions's agenda for the civil-rights division\n\nThat transformation dates to the same period when conservative activists killed the DCVRA. As late as the 1960s, the Republican Party was integral to federal efforts to protect and expand voting rights. The Senate Republican leader Everett Dirksen co-sponsored the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the bill passed-despite the opposition of many southern Democrats-because Republicans supported it.\n\nBut the same coalition that helped kill the DCVRA also helped elect Ronald Reagan as president in 1980. During that campaign, Reagan spoke in favor of \"states' rights,\" and as president he tried to seriously water down the Voting Rights Act, though he was largely unsuccessful . In Alabama, a young U.S. attorney whom Reagan appointed, Jeff Sessions, pursued voting-rights activists . The recent Republican consensus that Democrats can win elections only by fraud is new, but it is the product of decades of falsely claiming that American voting systems are plagued by widespread fraud. At the state level, Republicans around the country are seeking to make voting more difficult.\n\nMeanwhile, the makeup of the parties has changed. Where both once had liberal and conservative wings, the Democratic Party is now solidly liberal and the GOP uniformly conservative. The former is now heavily reliant on Black votes, while the latter is a largely white coalition. The United States is not only polarized but also so closely divided that small differences in the vote can produce big differences in the winners of elections, control of Congress, and governance. In this environment, there's no chance that the Republican Party as a whole would agree to grant more power to D.C. residents, and any individual member who stuck his or her neck out would risk opprobrium not just from voters but from colleagues.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The damage of Trump's voter-fraud allegations can't be undone\n\nDemocrats' motives in the D.C.-statehood battle are not exactly altruistic either. Although the party has long been on the record as supportive of statehood, that hasn't always turned into action. During his 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton endorsed statehood, but when it came up for a vote in 1993, Clinton declined to press the issue, and the bill was handily defeated . Barack Obama also disappointed advocates with his tepid, infrequent remarks about statehood.\n\nNow Democrats have strong political motivations to be more aggressive. They barely control the Senate and the House and are in danger of losing both in 2022. In general, the current shape of politics puts Democrats at a structural disadvantage , so gaining a voting House seat and especially two Senate seats would strengthen their chances at controlling Congress in the near future. Unfortunately for the party, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has already signaled his opposition to statehood, likely dooming the effort.\n\nNevertheless, the Senate will hold a hearing next Tuesday to discuss D.C. statehood. \"I am more confident than ever that we can make D.C. statehood a reality this Congress,\" Senator Tom Carper, the Delaware Democrat, said last month . But every major grant of power to the district over the past seven decades has come with the support of Republicans. If Carper wants to make statehood happen today, however, he'll have to find a way to do it without Republican votes."

Based on an average of polls between July and September, the pollster found that 48 percent of U.S. adults say they at least lean toward the Republican Party, whereas only 45 percent say the same for the Democratic Party. The result comes a little over a month out from what is shaping up to be a hard-fought presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris . \"Party affiliation and voting are strongly predictive of individuals' vote choices, with the vast majority of identifiers and leaners voting for the candidate of their preferred party,\" Gallup noted in its report. They also added that, historically, Democrats have won the White House when a larger proportion of Americans identified with their party. For instance, in 1992, when Democrat Bill Clinton won the presidency, 52 percent of Americans associated themselves with his party, compared to 40 percent for the Republicans. The gap was closer in 2000-with 48 percent Democrats and 43 percent Republicans-when GOP nominee George W. Bush landed in the White House.\n\nNews Reporter\n\nliam.archacki@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Top Republican Takes Rachel Maddow's Advice on Trump's Tariffs\n\nNight News Reporter\n\nOne of the Senate's most powerful Republicans seemed to take a page out of Rachel Maddow's playbook Thursday by attempting to claw back some of Congress' power over tariffs.\n\nChuck Grassley, the 91-year-old senior Republican senator from Iowa, jointly introduced a measure Thursday with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington to ensure Congress has a say in the president's tariff decisions. He is the president pro tempore of the chamber, making him the presiding officer and second-in-command behind the vice-president.\n\nThe measure lists that Congress would need to be notified \"no later than 48 hours\" of a tariff imposition or increase by the president. Moreover, Trump would also need to submit an \"explanation of the reasoning for imposing or increasing the duty\" and an assessment of the imposition's impact.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCongress would then have 60 days to approve any new tariffs, and would also have the power to end any tariff when necessary.\n\n\"Congress has a constitutional role through the Commerce Clause on trade matters, and we should reassume that role,\" Grassley told reporters in a press call Tuesday, according to Politico . Meanwhile Republican Senator Thom Tillis similarly told reporters Thursday that Congress should have more of a say in Trump's tariff decisions and said, \"I think there's something to be said for having congressional review.\"\n\nThe proposal came just hours after MSNBC host Rachel Maddow laid out a similar plan during her monologue Wednesday night, urging Congress to reassert control over the country's tariff decisions.\n\n\"The actual way to stop this dictatorship mid-catastrophe, the way to stop this part of Trump's one-man wrecking-ball operation against the U.S. economy is for Congress to do something very simple, for Congress to simply declare with a simple majority vote that actually there isn't an emergency,\" Maddow said, referring to how Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 while announcing tariffs on global trade partners Wednesday.\n\n\"Yes, Trump proclaimed an economic emergency. That's how he gave himself these emergency powers,\" Maddow continued. \"But Congress could simply just say, 'Actually, no, there isn't an economic emergency. So no, he no longer has these powers. He is no longer empowered to singlehandedly drunk-drive our country into this particular wall.' They could do that.\"\n\nMaddow's plan was partially employed by the Senate Wednesday after four Republican senators -Susan Collins, Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, and Rand Paul-joined Democrats to pass a resolution rescinding the White House's emergency declaration on Canada.\n\nThe anchor acknowledged however that the plan is likely to not come to fruition, as House Speaker Mike Johnson moved to prevent a floor vote that would have ended the many national emergencies Trump has employed to impose tariffs.\n\n\"In other words, there is a cure to this disease. There is a readily available, dramatically effective, proven legal antidote to this poison, and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson grabbed it out of our hands and flushed it down the toilet to make sure we can never take it, so Donald Trump can keep doing this to the economy,\" Maddow said. \"Are you tired of all the winning?\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on several of the United States' biggest trading partners, including the European Union and China. Several countries have since announced retaliatory tariffs, with the prospect of a full-scale, global trade war quickly becoming a reality.\n\nNight News Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

Tim Kaine (D-VA), the resolution aimed to rescind the emergency declaration the White House issued in February to place tariffs on Canada. The Trump administration has repeatedly cited the distribution of fentanyl across the border as a reason for the emergency declaration.\n\nThe vote Wednesday ended up passing 51-48, with Republican senators Susan Collins, Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, and Rand Paul crossing the bipartisan line despite the president's angry rant earlier that day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the Democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday.\n\n\"They are playing with the lives of the American people, and right into the hands of the Radical Left Democrats and Drug Cartels,\" he continued.\n\n\"What is wrong with them, other than suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, commonly known as TDS? Who can want this to happen to our beautiful families, and why? To the people of the Great States of Kentucky, Alaska, and Maine, please contact these Senators and get them to FINALLY adhere to Republican Values and Ideals,\" Trump added, quipping that the four GOP senators \"have been extremely difficult to deal with.\"\n\nThe president also explicitly declared that \"the House will never approve\" the resolution and that he will \"never sign it\" when it inevitably comes to his desk.\n\nOn Monday night, Collins said imposing tariffs on Canada would be a \"huge mistake\" that would result in substantial \"disruption in the economies of both countries.\"\n\nMeanwhile, McConnell told The Hill in a statement: \"With so much at stake globally, the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against China's predatory and unfair trade practices.\"\n\nThe Senate vote concluded a mere few hours after Trump announced sweeping tariffs on several of the country's biggest trading partners including the European Union and China.\n\n\"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers, and other forms of cheating. And because we are being very kind ... We will charge them approximately half of what they charge us,\" Trump said from the Rose Garden while unveiling his new tariff plan.\n\n\"We're going to start being smart, and we're going to start being very wealthy again,\" he added, as the stock market impact saw an immediate plummet .\n\nNight News Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "GOP Senator Warns Trump Tariffs Could Spell Electoral Disaster for Republicans\n\nReporter\n\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul had a stern history lesson for President Donald Trump , saying that his latest flurry of tariffs could lead to GOP \"decimation\" in both the House and the Senate.\n\nThe Kentucky lawmaker was one of four Republicans whom Trump flamed on Truth Social Wednesday for their dissent regarding his \"Liberation Day\" levies. Undeterred, Paul repeated his concerns in a double swipe the same day, first speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill then later on in a chat with The Hill's online show \"Rising.\"\n\nTrump has previously compared himself to the 25th president, William McKinley, saying he would -like his predecessor-make \"our country very rich through tariffs.\" Paul recalled this comparison and reminded the president that McKinley's tariffs \"led to political decimation.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"When McKinley, most famously, put tariffs on in 1890, they lost 50 percent of their seats in the next election,\" he said on Capitol Hill, driving home his point by referencing tariffs imposed by Republicans Sen. Reed Smoot and Rep. Willis C. Hawley nearly 100 years ago.\n\n\"When Smoot and Hawley put on their tariff in the early 1930s, we lost the House and the Senate for 60 years. So they're not only bad economically, they're bad politically,\" he said in a clip which aired on Fox News's The Ingraham Angle .\n\nDuring the interview with \"Rising,\" he added that it is a \"fallacy\" to believe that tariffs will help the U.S. economically. \"Tariffs are a tax, and if you tax trade or if you tax anything, you'll get less of it,\" he said.\n\nPaul added that the very international trade that Trump's decision serves to stymie is what actually leads to prosperity. \"We know by looking at the history of the last-at least 70 years or so in this country, that as international trade has increased, so has the prosperity of our country,\" he said.\n\nTrump's Truth Social rebuke also included Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The president accused them of \"playing with the lives of the American people, and right into the hands of the Radical Left Democrats and Drug Cartels.\"\n\nTrump was responding after Senate Democrats advanced a resolution introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia that would block the import levies on Canada. The vote Wednesday ended up passing 51-48, buoyed by the Republican support.\n\nWhile Canada was somewhat sheltered, a whole host of other countries were slapped with tariffs in a bizarre gameshow-style press conference earlier in the day. Among the big winners were the U.K ., Chile, Colombia, Turkey, Singapore, Brazil, and Australia, suffering comparatively measly 10 percent levies. Cambodia will be charged a whopping 49 percent, while China was hit with an additional 34 percent on top of the 20 percent levy Trump is already charging Beijing.\n\nReporter\n\nGot a tip?

Chuck Edwards found himself on the receiving end of serious fury from voters over the policies Trump administration in another Republican-held town hall-gone-wrong on Thursday.\n\nThe town hall initially began fairly courteously, as the audience were warned to remain respectful ahead of Edwards' appearance in Asheville, a city in western North Carolina. But things quickly went downhill.\n\n\"The time is now to fix how Washington works,\" Edwards began. \"To that end, I was proud to vote recently for the House budget resolution which provides for a framework-\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEdwards, grinning, paused as the audience booed and yelled.\n\n\"And you wonder why folks don't want to do these town halls,\" Edwards commented, spurring various responses. One man asked him, \"Are you afraid of Trump?\" while another told him, \"Stop selling yourself.\"\n\nASHEVILLE, NC-Rep. Chuck Edwards holds an in-person town hall after GOP leaders encouraged their members to hold virtual events instead. Rep. Edwards has already been interrupted multiple times as he attempts to give legislative updates. \"Listen to us now\" pic.twitter.com/TsLbnMtgec\n\nEdwards didn't answer the former comment, continuing on with his prepared remarks.\n\nIn November, Edwards claimed victory against Democrat Caleb Rudow in the race for North Carolina's 11th Congressional District. Buncombe County , where Asheville sits, is a Democratic stronghold in Edwards' otherwise red district. In last year's presidential election, Kamala Harris won 61.7 percent of the vote in the county, compared to Trump's 36.9 percent. Trump comfortably won every other county in the district. Edwards had copped heat for debunking GOP lies surrounding the response to Hurricane Helene, but then stood side by side to Trump as he repeated those same lies, according to local reports.\n\nOther noteworthy moments from the town hall included the very first question from the crowd.\n\n\"What do you plan to do to make sure North Carolina does not get taken over by dictatorship and fascism?\" one individual asked.\n\nEdwards replied in part, \"It sounds like there's a little bias in that question.\" He added, over boos, \"We are upholding the Constitution.\"\n\nEdwards carried on, but the questions didn't get any easier for him.\n\n\"Do you represent all citizens, even though they may not have voted for you? Or do you work for Donald Trump?\" one person inquired.\n\n\"I represent all the citizens,\" Edwards replied.\n\nA person is removed from the Chuck Edwards town hall \"Do your job that you were sent there to do... to represent us all. I'm a veteran and you don't give a fuck about me\" pic.twitter.com/F9Hg6NiElf\n\n\"But let's be real. We have some differing opinions here,\" he continued.\n\n\"Every vote that I have, every opinion I have cannot possibly align with everyone's opinion. My job is to listen to the folks that I represent, to apply the principles that I have, that I told you that I would use when I went to Washington, D.C., and help make the decisions that cover the needs of more of the folks back here in western North Carolina.\"\n\nEdwards powered on, but became increasingly frustrated with the audience. When asked about staffing at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Edwards claimed the Trump administration doesn't intend on eliminating \"any job that directly provides a service to our veterans,\" yet acknowledged the existence of an internal memo obtained by the AP saying the VA is planning to cut over 80,000 jobs.\n\nOne man told Edwards bluntly, \"Do your job that you were sent there to do: to represent us all.\" He added: \"You're lying! I'm a veteran, and you don't give a f--k about me.\"\n\nThat individual was then removed from the venue by law enforcement at Edwards' direction.\n\nAt a town hall Republicans didn't want to hold, a furious Veteran called out Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-NC: \"I'm a Veteran, and you don't give a f**k about me.\" \"You need to stand up for us. You need to do what we need you to f**king do.\" THEN GOT ESCORTED OUT! pic.twitter.com/WUcImwtmOE\n\nAmid more vocal dissatisfaction by the audience, Edwards at one point remarked, \"I feel like this is not productive with everybody yelling at me.\"\n\nHe eventually closed the grating town hall by yelling, \"Hey, this has been fun.\" He added: \"I appreciate the opportunity to spend the last 89 minutes with you. I really appreciate the energy that you brought, the contradiction of opinions from time to time, the passion that I hear... and I hope that you will certainly stay engaged with my office.\"\n\nThe crowd continued to respond negatively.\n\nholy shit this question at the Rep. Chuck Edwards town hall 🔥🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/Sh1V1bKNtC\n\nEdwards took to Facebook after the event, describing the insults and boos as \"lively.\"\n\n\"We may not agree on every issue, but hearing the concerns of Western North Carolinians and answering your questions will continue to be a priority of mine. If you weren't able to join, stay tuned for information about my upcoming tele-town hall,\" he wrote.\n\nEdwards' appearance came after the Trump administration reportedly warned all Republican reps to stay away from such events.\n\nSeveral Republicans have been confronted by angry constituents in recent weeks, among them Texas Rep. Keith Self , Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall , and Georgia Rep. Rich McCormick -encounters which House Speaker Mike Johnson tried to shrug off as the work of \"paid protesters.\"\n\nAfter those events generated headlines, one House GOP leader from Edwards' state even urged his colleagues to stop having them.\n\n\"I want to give you some advice on the best way to do town halls,\" Rep. Richard Hudson said, the Daily Beast reported last week. \"Don't do town halls.\"\n\nYet last week, Edwards told Business Insider about his scheduled appearance Thursday in Asheville: \"I can make up my own mind.\"\n\n\"I've had many constituents ask me lately if I could hold another live town hall. The answer is most emphatically, yes,\" Edwards said in a statement . \"Being accessible, listening, and answering questions for the people of WNC are among my favorite activities, even if we might not always agree. That is why in my first term as a congressman, I held eight in-person town halls. I am eager to host the ninth one in Asheville.\"\n\nwilliam.vaillancourt@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Valimont's share of the vote increased by 10 percentage points over the November election, when she lost to far-right Republican Matt Gaetz, who would later be nominated by Trump as attorney general, only to resign from Congress amid a sex trafficking and drugs scandal. Patronis is Florida's chief financial officer; he previously called for public funds to be used to pay for Trump's legal defenses in his four criminal cases."

This includes Republican efforts to upend the way elections are run, by restricting who gets to vote, how voting is conducted and how votes are counted and certified. The outcome of the tight presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will hinge on the votes in a handful of swing states. From Georgia to Arizona, Nevada to Michigan, Republicans are mounting an all-out assault on the election process that journalist Ari Berman refers to as a \"five-alarm fire for democracy.\"\n\n\"It appears that Georgia Republicans are laying the groundwork not to certify the presidential election if Kamala Harris wins,\" Berman said on the Democracy Now! news hour. \"They're doing exactly what Trump wanted them to do in 2020. Trump made Georgia the epicenter of the attempt to try to overturn the election. He asked local and State Board of Elections and election officials not to certify the election. They refused to do so; they followed the law. It seems like in 2024 they're going to extraordinary lengths to try to implement the measures that failed in 2020, to try to rig the election for Trump.\"\n\nGeorgia Republicans altered how counties count and certify votes. The Democratic Party of Georgia, the Democratic National Committee, and ten Democratic county election officials from across Georgia have sued, seeking to roll back the changes. Their lawsuit argues, \"Georgia's State Election Board has passed a host of last-minute rules that threaten to sow chaos and impede the vote-canvassing process.\"\n\nBerman warns, \"These state and local election boards have been taken over, in some cases, by election deniers, by MAGA extremists...The administration of elections matters so much because you can cast a vote, you can have your vote counted, but it doesn't actually matter until votes are certified.\"\n\nIn Texas, the Republican-controlled state government has for years tried to restrict voting in districts where Democratic candidates do well. Donald Trump won Texas by over 5 percentage points in 2020, but Biden won the cities of Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Austin, El Paso as well as the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott announced this week that he has purged over one million voters from Texas voter rolls. This increasingly common tactic inevitably removes legally-registered voters, often through faulty data screens that target likely Democratic voters.\n\nMeanwhile, Texas's Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who's currently agreed to do community service to avoid a felony criminal securities fraud trial, and survived an unrelated impeachment trial in the Republican-controlled state senate, has been raiding non-profit organizations that provide services to immigrant and Latino communities.\n\nLast week, under Paxton's orders, the homes of a dozen members of LULAC , the League of United Latin American Citizens, were raided and searched by Texas authorities, including SWAT teams. One activist's door was broken down. Texas House candidate Cecilia Castellano, running for an open seat to represent Uvalde, the town devastated by one of the worst school shootings in US history, had her home raided. Government agents took her cell phone and, weeks ahead of election day, threw her campaign into chaos.\n\nLULAC said in a statement,  \"Attorney General Paxton's actions clearly aim to suppress the Latino vote through intimidation and any means necessary to tilt the electoral process in favor of his political allies.\" LULAC has called on the Justice Department to investigate Paxton over the raids.\n\nJuan Proaño, CEO of LULAC , said on Democracy Now!, \"In the last U.S. Census, they reported 12.1 million Latinos in the state of Texas. For the first time, Latinos actually outnumber non-Hispanic whites, which is at 12 million. When you take into account not just the Latino population in the state of Texas, but the African American and Asian population...the minority community in Texas now stands at over 60%. Texas is and has been a majority-minority state. So, we see these, effectively, as tactics for the Republicans to actually stay in control of the government in Texas.\"\n\nIf further evidence of Republican attempts to subvert the will of the voters were needed, Pluribus News, a non-profit news organization, reports that Republican-controlled state governments are altering language on progressive state ballot initiatives to confuse or mislead voters. Arizona, for example, inserted \"unborn human being\" in place of fetus or embryo in the ballot initiative intended to guarantee the right to an abortion. Voters in Florida and Ohio will face similar confusing language in their ballot initiatives.\n\nIn President Lincoln's final public address, three days before his assassination,  Lincoln advocated that the right to vote be granted to formerly enslaved Black men (as only men could legally vote, until 1920). The Republican Party of today, desperate to suppress the votes of people of color, could not be further from the Party of Lincoln.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

In West Virginia, Governor Jim Justice won the race to fill the seat vacated by Senator Joe Manchin, who earlier this year quit the Democratic Party and said he would not seek reelection. Justice is a wealthy heir to a coal mining fortune with a net worth estimated at over a half-billion dollars. In 2022, Justice signed a near-total ban on abortion in West Virginia. In Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy is projected to have beaten incumbent Democrat Jon Tester, flipping another Senate seat for Republicans. In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno has defeated Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, who's held the seat since 2007. Before then, Brown served in the House of Representatives, where he opposed the Iraq War, the USA PATRIOT ACT , and became an early champion of marriage equality. Brown conceded defeat late Tuesday.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown : \"We believe in the power of people over corporate special interests. We always will. We believe if you love this country, you fight for the people who make it work. We always will. This is a disappointment but is not a failure.\"\n\nSenator-elect Bernie Moreno is a multimillionaire luxury car dealer and cryptocurrency entrepreneur who benefited from $40 million in campaign cash from crypto firms. Ohio's Senate race was the most expensive such contest ever; some estimates put total spending at around a half-billion dollars. In Nebraska, Republican Senator Deb Fischer held off a challenge from independent Dan Osborn. And the Republicans could win several more Senate races. In Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick has a one-point lead over Senator Bob Casey. In Nevada, Republican Sam Brown has a slight lead over Democratic Senator Jacky Rosen. In Michigan, Republican Mike Rogers is leading Elissa Slotkin. In Wisconsin, incumbent Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin declared victory after it appeared her narrow lead over multimillionaire banker Eric Hovde will hold. In Arizona, Democrat Rubén Gallego has a lead over Republican challenger Kari Lake, a far-right election denier and Trump ally. The two are vying for Kyrsten Sinema's seat after the Democrat turned independent announced she was not seeking reelection.\n\nIn other Senate news, for the first time in history, two Black women will serve in the Senate at the same time: Angela Alsobrooks in Maryland and Lisa Blunt Rochester in Delaware, both Democrats."

      "text": "Republican senator claims video floating killing of journalists was a 'joke'\n\nOklahoma's Markwayne Mullin downplays comments suggesting lawmakers could shoot journalists over disputes\n\nThe Republican US senator and Donald Trump loyalist Markwayne Mullin has evidently sought to backtrack from comments suggesting politicians could \"handle our differences\" with journalists by shooting and killing them, insisting he was trying to make a joke.\n\nThe Oklahoma lawmaker, a former mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter, on Saturday posted to X a video of himself at a stairway in the US Capitol building recounting the tale of the newspaper columnist Charles Kincaid.\n\nIn 1890, Kincaid shot dead former Kentucky congressman William Taulbee , with whom he had been feuding.\n\n\"There's a lot we could say about reporters and the stories they write, but I bet they would write a lot less false stories - as President Trump says, fake news - if we could still handle our differences that way,\" Mullin says at the conclusion of the almost two-minute clip.\n\nOn Sunday, after his remarks were picked up and published by the Oklahoman , in a column that noted escalating verbal attacks by politicians and increasing threats of violence against journalists, Mullin downplayed them.\n\n\"Don't forget I also joked about bringing back caning to settle political disputes,\" he said in a second tweet, which contained an election map of Oklahoma showing every county red and claimed the newspaper was \"out of touch\" with the state.\n\nMullin's comments came eight months after Robert Telles, a politician in Nevada, was found guilty of murder for fatally stabbing the Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German, who wrote articles critical of his conduct in office.\n\nMullin, who served as a congressman for 10 years before winning a special election for a Senate seat in November 2022, has developed a record of making threats of physical violence during his time in Washington DC.\n\nThe former college wrestler turned MMA fighter - who claims to have won five fights during a brief professional career that ended in 2007, despite records indicating only three wins - was in the news in November 2023 for squaring up to the Teamsters union president, Sean O'Brien , during a heated session of the Senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions.\n\nMullin later insisted his aggressive conduct, which included advancing on O'Brien and yelling \"stand your butt up\", was an exhibition of \" Oklahoma values \". In return, O'Brien, who clashed with Mullin during another verbal brawl eight months earlier, accused his rival of acting \"like a 12-year-old schoolyard bully\".\n\nThe episodes gave rise to Mullin's comments about caning people he perceived as enemies, something he alluded to in his Sunday tweet.\n\n\"This isn't anything new,\" he told Fox Business in November 2023, referring to violence, or threats of it, by politicians in the capital.\n\n\"Andrew Jackson challenged nine people to a duel when he was president, and he also knocked one guy out at a White House dinner. There's been canings before in the Senate.\n\n\"Maybe we should bring some of that back, keep people from thinking they're so tough.\"\n\nThe journalism advocacy group Reporters Without Borders recorded 108 occasions in which Trump had \"insulted, attacked, or threatened the media\" during an eight-week period in the run-up to the November 2024 election that returned him to the White House for a second presidency.\n\nSince retaking office in January, the Trump administration has continued its attacks on journalists, banning the Associated Press from the Oval Office for refusing to comply with the president's executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America.\n\nTrump's assaults on press freedom have also included threats to prosecute and jail journalists who write stories that displease him - and stripping broadcast licenses of networks that air programs that are critical of him.\n\nKash Patel, the new FBI director, confirmed that the targeting of journalists would be a priority for Trump's second term during a podcast interview with Steve Bannon, a rightwing ally of the president, in December 2023.\n\n\"We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\" he said, amplifying Trump's lies that the 2020 election won fairly by Biden was stolen from Trump.\n\n\"We're going to come after you, whether it's criminally or civilly.\""

      "text": "Republican backlash to Trump tariffs grows as Senate rebels decry 'bad policy'\n\nFour GOP senators rebuke president by voting to rescind 25% Canada tariffs, prompting praise from Democrats\n\nThe first signs of an internal US political backlash against Donald Trump's declaration of a global trade war are starting to emerge amid tanking stock markets worldwide, including on Wall Street, and widespread international criticism of the move.\n\nHours after Trump unveiled a sweeping panoply of tariffs in an event he dubbed \"liberation day\", four Republican senators openly defied him by voting for a Senate resolution from Democrats demanding that the 25% tariffs on Canadian products be reversed.\n\nThe resolution lacks the force of law but its support from Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, both of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, immediately signaled the deep misgivings among some Republicans over Trump's tariff gambit, which has triggered a global sell-off.\n\nMcConnell, the former Senate majority leader, issued a scathing denunciation after Wednesday evening's vote, calling tariffs \"bad policy\" that would trigger economic hardship.\n\n\"Trade wars with our partners hurt working people most,\" he said in a statement . \"Tariffs drive up the cost of goods and services. They are a tax on everyday working Americans.\"\n\nFurther criticism came from Trump's former vice-president, Mike Pence, who called the tariffs \"the largest peacetime tax hike in US history\".\n\n\"These tariffs are nearly 10 times the size of those imposed during the Trump-Pence administration, and will cost American families over $3,500 per year,\" he posted .\n\nThe four Republicans who voted with Democrats did so despite a public appeal from Trump not to support the resolution, tabled by Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator for Virginia who was Hillary Clinton's running mate in the 2016 presidential election, which Trump won.\n\nThe resolution was aimed at curtailing the powers Trump claimed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which he has invoked to tackle the US's $1.2tn trade deficit and, in the case of Canada, cited the influx of fentanyl through its border.\n\nMcConnell pulled no punches in his attack on Trump's policy.\n\n\"Preserving the long-term prosperity of American industry and workers requires working with our allies, not against them. With so much at stake globally, the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against China's predatory and unfair trade practices,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"At a time when Americans are tightening their belts, we would do well to avoid policies that heap on the pain. We ought to strengthen our friendships abroad, and reinforce our allies as pillars of American prosperity and security.\"\n\nPaul, his fellow Kentuckian, said the tariffs were unconstitutional.\n\n\"Our constitution was very specific that taxes - tariffs are a tax - taxes originate in the House, come to the Senate and then go the president,\" he told reporters. \"They don't just go to the president and no one else. What kind of system would it be if all of our taxes and laws were passed by one person?\"\n\nHe later told Fox News: \"Trade is proportional to wealth. The last 70 years of international trade has been an exponential curve upwards, and the last 70 years of prosperity has been upwards also. We are richer because of trade with Canada, and so is Canada.\"\n\nCollins, the senator for Maine, said tariffs would damage lobstering, agriculture and the pulp and paper industries in her state, which borders Canada. She also lambasted imposing tariffs on US allies.\n\n\"The fact is, the vast majority of fentanyl in America comes from the southern border [rather than from Canada],\" she said on the Senate floor.\n\n\"One of my biggest concerns is we should be distinguishing between allies and our adversaries and not treating them the same way.\"\n\nMurkowski, a senator from Alaska, said tariffs would also hurt her state and urged Trump to \"find a better way to mutually secure our borders and address fentanyl trafficking than by starting a trade war\".\n\n\"While not all Canadian trade practices are fair, I'm keenly aware of the negative impacts in store for Alaskan families and businesses should tariffs drive up the costs of essential goods,\" she posted on X.\n\n\"In Alaska ... we share more than 1,538 miles of border with Canada. We are friends, neighbors, partners, and allies when it comes to our economies, our mutual defense, our cultures, and, yes, our trade.\"\n\nThe outspoken Republican criticism hinted at a wider unease in the party that is mostly being kept muted for fear of repercussions from Trump.\n\nThom Tillis, a Republican senator for North Carolina, warned about potential \"irreparable damage\" to his farming constituents before Wednesday's announcement.\n\n\"Anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right need to talk to my farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy,\" he told CNN . \"They don't have time. So we've got to be crisp on this implementation.\"\n\nJohn Thune, the Republican Senate majority leader, tried to reconcile his concerns with loyalty to Trump. \"I've got my issue. I represent a state that is very dependent upon exports,\" he told reporters. \"But I do appreciate the president's focus on making sure we're getting better deals, and giving business an incentive to do business here in the United States.\"\n\nSuch equivocation contrasted with unambiguous condemnation from Democrats, some of whom openly lauded the Republican anti-tariff rebels.\n\n\"This is what happens when people speak up,\" posted the New Jersey senator, Cory Booker, citing images of news headlines about the four senators' votes and obliquely referencing his record-breaking Senate floor speech this week denouncing Trump's policies.\n\nChuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, posted \"54% tariffs on China, 10% tariffs on Iran, 0% tariffs on Russia\" alongside a puzzled emoji.\n\nBrian Schatz, a Hawaii senator and the Democrats' chief whip, posted : \"I've never seen a president ruin the economy on purpose.\"\n\nResponding, Chris Murphy, the outspoken Connecticut senator who has emerged as an articulate advocate of the need for a Democratic anti-Trump fightback, wrote : \"This is the thing to understand. It's all on purpose. Creating chaos and crisis.\""

      "text": "Alarm as Republicans in Congress back Trump and Musk's attacks on US judges\n\nMike Johnson and Jim Jordan echo president and key ally as experts express fears for 'bedrock constitutional principles'\n\nAs Donald Trump and Elon Musk widen their radical attacks on US judges who have stalled some of Trump's executive orders and Musk's slashing of federal agencies, they're gaining backing from top House Republicans and other politicians, including some to whom the tech billionaire made big campaign donations.\n\nThe House speaker, Mike Johnson, and judiciary panel chairman Jim Jordan have echoed some of Trump's attacks on judges, and a judiciary subcommittee hearing on 1 April explored \"judicial overreach\" and ways to curb judges who have stymied some Trump orders or Musk's \"department of government efficiency\" (Doge) and its draconian cuts to the federal government.\n\nVeteran Republican consultants say the hefty campaign-spending muscle of Musk, the world's richest person, who spent about $300m helping Trump win last year, is likely to boost many Republican candidates in 2026 races, increasing pressures on members from Trump and Musk to accelerate efforts to rein in dissident judges.\n\n\"Republicans on Capitol Hill expect Musk to make a lot of donations to them in 2026,\" said longtime Republican consultant Charlie Black. \"But it's likely that such donations will be coordinated with the president's preferences.\"\n\nThe verbal assaults on judges by Trump and his allies have been fueled by multiple rulings adverse to some Trump executive orders, including major court decisions in March that sought to halt deporting Venezuelan immigrants and blocking penalizing law firms that Trump deemed political enemies.\n\nWashington DC judge James Boasberg incurred Trump's wrath for trying to halt the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans to an El Salvador prison with a nationwide injunction challenging the tenuous legal basis for the administration action. Boasberg's ruling spurred Trump to falsely label him a \"radical left lunatic\", urge his impeachment, and then call for him to be disbarred.\n\nMusk has repeatedly used X, the social media platform he owns and on which he has over 200 million followers, to urge impeaching judges whose rulings he doesn't like. \"The only way to restore rule of the people in America is to impeach judges,\" he said on 25 February.\n\nLegal scholars say Trump and Musk's radical threats of impeachment or disbarment for judicial rulings that stall or block administration moves undermine the rule of law.\n\n\"Trump and Musk are playing with fire,\" said retired Massachusetts judge Nancy Gertner, who is now a lecturer at Harvard Law School. \"They're undermining bedrock constitutional principles.\"\n\nShe added: \"You can't shut down a court just because you disagree. The judges have done nothing wrong or inconsistent with their oaths, and nothing outside their judicial roles.\"\n\nTrump's call for impeaching Boasberg drew a sharp and broad rebuke from supreme court chief justice John Roberts, who last month said that \"for more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision\".\n\nFurther, contrary to Trump's baseless charges against Boasberg, the judge's rulings have hardly been one-sided. One example: Boasberg sided with Trump in 2017 to stop the IRS from sharing his tax returns which a long-shot lawsuit sought.\n\nBesides Boasberg, three other Washington DC judges last month ruled against Trump executive orders targeting law firms he viewed as political foes for retribution, which the judges argued were on dangerous or dubious legal ground.\n\nAmong other things, the Trump orders seek to take away security clearances for some of the law firms and sharply curtail their government business.\n\nTo ratchet up pressures on judges, after judge Beryl Howell issued a decision in March to temporarily block Trump from penalizing the law firm Perkins Coie, the justice department, in a rare move, tried to have Howell removed from the case, alleging she was biased.\n\nIn a blistering response, Howell wrote: \"This strategy is designed to impugn the integrity of the federal judicial system and blame any loss on the decision-maker rather than fallacies in the substantive legal arguments presented.\"\n\nTwo other DC judges in March backed law firms Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, which sued the administration on first amendment grounds to block executive orders aimed at hurting the firms financially for their separate ties to key lawyers who led a special counsel inquiry into how Russia worked to help elect Trump in 2016.\n\nJudge John Bates, an appointee of George W Bush who issued a restraining order blocking Trump's sanctions against Jenner & Block, called Trump's punitive move \"disturbing\" and \"troubling\", noting the order targets the firm's and its lawyers' rights under the first amendment, and due process.\n\nLegal scholars and former judges are raising alarms about the rising dangers to the rule of law and the physical safety of judges sparked by the attacks from Trump and his congressional allies.\n\n\"While the threats to impeach federal judges based on their decisions are largely performative, they are also designed to foment disrespect for the judiciary and the rule of law,\" said former federal judge John Jones, who is now the president of Dickinson College.\n\n\"In addition, many of the calls for impeachment are accompanied by the unconscionable disclosure of personal information about individual judges that jeopardize the personal safety of those judges and their family members.\"\n\nOther legal experts worry that Trump's judicial attacks, which some congressional allies are parroting even though the odds of impeaching judges are long, could spark violence.\n\n\"The real risk comes not from Congress, but the fringe elements in Trump's camp, who might be stirred up to threaten or actually inflict harm on the targeted judges,\" said former federal prosecutor and Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n\"Judges are rightly worried about their safety, and the measures in place to protect them may prove inadequate if the dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric from the Trump camp continues.\"\n\nDespite such fears, many of Trump's hardcore loyalists in Congress are jumping on board to further fuel Trump's attacks on judges, while benefiting from Musk's campaign largesse.\n\nAt least seven Republican members, including Andy Ogles of Tennessee and Brandon Gill of Texas, who echoed Trump's call for impeaching Judge Boasberg, or advocated other \"action\" against judges who ruled against Trump orders, received checks from Musk for $6,600, the maximum he could donate.\n\nAlthough Republican leaders have suggested that impeachment of judges won't happen because they don't have the votes, their public efforts to bolster Trump's war on judicial independence has been accelerating, with allies exploring other avenues to curb judges.\n\nJohnson turned up the heat on judges on 25 March when he vowed that \"desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act\". One option eyed by Trump's Republican allies came up at a judiciary subcommittee hearing last week that focused on banning nationwide injunctions by judges. A House bill to ban such injunctions is expected to pass in coming weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, Charles Grassley, the senator who leads his chamber's judiciary committee and has received a donation from Musk, held a hearing that also explored bans on nationwide injunctions by judges; Grassley in March introduced a bill that would end the \"practice of universal injunctions\", but Senate passage is deemed a long shot.\n\nSome former Republican congressmen are highly critical of Trump's congressional allies for amplifying his attacks on judges, and predict that the House GOP will try to \"monetize\" Trump's fury at a growing number of judges.\n\n\"The investigation into judges by Chairman Jordan, and calls by Gill and Ogles for the impeachment of judges who have ruled against Trump, are more examples of blind loyalty to Trump by a bunch of sycophants,\" said former Michigan member Dave Trott.\n\n\"It would not be such a big deal except for the fact that their conduct is helping create a crisis involving the constitution they swore to uphold.\"\n\nTrott added: \"And just in case these sycophants suddenly decide to stand up to Trump, Elon is using his billions to help Republicans get re-elected. This will ensure the GOP stays in line. The concentration of great wealth and power is a problem that will have serious consequences for our country.\"\n\nOther ex-Republican members voice similar concerns.\n\n\"I think this is a talking point and a fundraising tool,' said Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, adding that members will attack judges for \"impeding Trump's agenda, and they'll try to monetize it for campaign purposes\".\n\nSome former prosecutors say the judicial attacks by Trump and his GOP allies jibe with Trump's broader blitz to expand his powers\n\n\"Trump has, believe it or not, a strategic plan to disable all opposition,\" said former prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig.\n\nPart of that plan \"involves eliminating internal oversight, like inspectors general, and cowing external opposition, by threatening law firms. The final piece is to eliminate the last independent check on his authority - judges. To do this he is falsely accusing them of bias and enlisting his sycophantic supporters, like Mike Johnson and Jim Jordan, in the effort.\""

      "text": "Senate approves Republican plan for trillions in tax breaks and spending cuts\n\nVote fell mostly along party lines and now goes to the House, where it could be voted on as soon as next week\n\nSenate Republicans plugged away overnight and into early Saturday morning to approve their multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts framework, hurtling past hardened Democratic opposition toward what Donald Trump calls the \"big, beautiful bill\" that is central to his agenda.\n\nThe vote, 51-48, fell along mostly party lines, but with sharp dissent from two prominent GOP senators. It could not have come at a more difficult political moment. The US economy is churning after the president's vast tariff scheme sent stocks plummeting , and experts are warning of soaring costs for consumers at home and threats of a potential recession. Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky both voted against the bill.\n\nBut with a nod from Trump, GOP leaders held on, determined to march ahead. Approval paves the way for Republicans , in the months ahead, to try to power a tax cut bill through both chambers of Congress over the objections of Democrats, just as they did in Trump's first term with unified party control in Washington.\n\n\"Let the voting begin,\" the Republican Senate majority leader, John Thune of South Dakota, said on Friday night.\n\nThe evening kicked off what's called \"vote-a-rama\" as Democrats were intent on making the effort as politically painful as possible, with action on about two dozen amendments to the package that GOP senators will have to defend before next year's midterm elections.\n\nAmong them were proposals to ban tax breaks for the super-wealthy, end Trump's tariffs, clip his efforts to shrink the federal government, and protect Medicaid, social security and other services. One, in response to the Trump national security team's use of Signal, sought to prohibit military officials from using any commercial messaging application to transmit war plans. They all failed, though a GOP amendment to protect Medicare and Medicaid was accepted.\n\nDemocrats accused Republicans of laying the groundwork for cutting key safety net programs to help pay for more than $5tn in tax cuts they say disproportionately benefit the rich.\n\n\"Trump's policies are a disaster,\" said the Democratic Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, as is Elon Musk 's \"department of government efficiency\". \"Republicans could snuff it out tonight, if they wanted.\"\n\nThe Republicans framed their work as preventing a tax increase for most American families, arguing that unless Congress acts, the individual and estate tax cuts that Republicans passed in 2017 will expire at the end of this year.\n\nThe Senate package pulls in other GOP priorities - including $175bn to bolster Trump's mass deportation effort, which is running short of cash, and another $175bn for the Pentagon to build up the military - from an earlier budget effort.\n\nJohn Barrasso of Wyoming, the No 2 ranking Republican senator, said voters gave his party a mission in November, and the Senate budget plan delivers.\n\n\"It fulfills our promises to secure the border, to rebuild our economy and to restore peace through strength,\" Barrasso said.\n\nThe framework now goes to the House, where the speaker, Louisiana Republican Mike Johnson, could bring it up for a vote as soon as next week as he works toward a final product by Memorial Day.\n\nThe House and Senate need to resolve their differences. The House Republicans had already approved their version, with $4.5tn in tax breaks over 10 years and about $2tn in budget cuts pointed at changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other programs, and some have panned the Senate's approach.\n\nOne crucial challenge ahead will be for the House to accept the way the Senate's budget plan allows for extending the tax cuts under a scoring method that treats them as not adding to future deficits, something many House Republicans reject. A new estimate from the joint committee on taxation projects the tax breaks will add $5.5tn in debt over the next decade when including interest, and $4.6tn not including interest.\n\nOn top of that, the senators added an additional $1.5tn that would allow some of Trump's campaign promises, such as no taxes on tips, social security benefits and overtime, swelling the overall the price tag to $7tn."

      "text": "New House Republican proposal seeks to exempt many toxic Pfas from review\n\nTwo lawmakers introduced a resolution to repeal a 2024 Biden rule that closed a 'low volume exemption' loophole\n\nA new Republican plan would exempt many new toxic Pfas or \"forever chemicals\" from health and safety review, a move criticized by opponents because it would allow the dangerous man-made substances to be used and sold with little effective scrutiny.\n\nTwo House Republican lawmakers introduced a resolution under the Congressional Review Act that would repeal a 2024 Joe Biden rule that closed the \"low volume exemption\" loophole for Pfas . The loophole allowed Pfas and chemicals produced in small enough quantities to be sent to the marketplace with virtually no review from federal regulators.\n\nBut Pfas are so highly toxic that even small amounts are considered dangerous, said Michael Youhana, an attorney with the Earthjustice non-profit that has litigated over the loophole.\n\nPfas are a class of about 15,000 chemicals typically used to make products that resist water, stains and heat. They are called \"forever chemicals\" because they do not naturally break down. They can accumulate in humans and the environment, and are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders, birth defects and other serious health problems.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency safety data sheets for Pfas that were approved under the exemption included one that's \"lethal if inhaled\" and \"corrosive to the skin\". Several present a \"severe health hazard\". Brief contact with those chemicals may cause \"irreversible injury\", while \"life-threatening, permanent, or major injury\" can arise from \"a single or repeated exposure\".\n\nThe attempt to reopen the loophole and approve these chemicals with little oversight is \"insane\", Youhana said.\n\n\"Even small releases or small bits of exposure to Pfas can cause devastating effects to the environment and human beings, and that's why this doesn't make sense,\" he added.\n\nThe exemption had been in place for decades and allowed Pfas and other chemicals to be sent to market in fewer than 30 days with little scrutiny if less than 22,000lbsof a chemical was produced annually, which would not present an \"unreasonable risk\" to workers, the public or environment. Chemicals that meet the definition's threshold of \"unreasonable risk' require full regulation.\n\nThe exemption became a preferred route for industry to push highly toxic chemicals through with virtually no regulation - over 600 were approved this way between 1985 and 2020, and more often during the first Trump administration . An attorney from Keller and Heckman, an industry law firm, wrote in a 2011 blog post that the low volume exemption essentially provided a regulatory bypass.\n\n\"It is an attractive option for high-toxicity substances,\" the attorney wrote.\n\nThe Biden EPA informally closed the loophole early in the administration, stating that Pfas are \"too complex to approve\" under the exemption, so there was a dramatic fall off in applications. Only eight were submitted in recent years and those were rejected.\n\nEven so, the Biden EPA fast-tracked Pfas via other channels for the semiconductor industry.\n\nStill, chemical-makers want the loophole reopened. If a majority of Congress approves the resolution to repeal the Biden action proposed by Clay Higgins, who represents a district in Louisiana that's home to many of the nation's chemical producers, then chemical Pfas will again be approved with almost no oversight."

      "text": "Republican backlash to Trump tariffs grows as Senate rebels decry 'bad policy'\n\nFour GOP senators rebuke president by voting to rescind 25% Canada tariffs, prompting praise from Democrats\n\nThe first signs of an internal US political backlash against Donald Trump's declaration of a global trade war are starting to emerge amid tanking stock markets worldwide, including on Wall Street, and widespread international criticism of the move.\n\nHours after Trump unveiled a sweeping panoply of tariffs in an event he dubbed \"liberation day\", four Republican senators openly defied him by voting for a Senate resolution from Democrats demanding that the 25% tariffs on Canadian products be reversed.\n\nThe resolution lacks the force of law but its support from Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, both of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, immediately signaled the deep misgivings among some Republicans over Trump's tariff gambit, which has triggered a global sell-off.\n\nMcConnell, the former Senate majority leader, issued a scathing denunciation after Wednesday evening's vote, calling tariffs \"bad policy\" that would trigger economic hardship.\n\n\"Trade wars with our partners hurt working people most,\" he said in a statement . \"Tariffs drive up the cost of goods and services. They are a tax on everyday working Americans.\"\n\nFurther criticism came from Trump's former vice-president, Mike Pence, who called the tariffs \"the largest peacetime tax hike in US history\".\n\n\"These tariffs are nearly 10 times the size of those imposed during the Trump-Pence administration, and will cost American families over $3,500 per year,\" he posted .\n\nThe four Republicans who voted with Democrats did so despite a public appeal from Trump not to support the resolution, tabled by Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator for Virginia who was Hillary Clinton's running mate in the 2016 presidential election, which Trump won.\n\nThe resolution was aimed at curtailing the powers Trump claimed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which he has invoked to tackle the US's $1.2tn trade deficit and, in the case of Canada, cited the influx of fentanyl through its border.\n\nMcConnell pulled no punches in his attack on Trump's policy.\n\n\"Preserving the long-term prosperity of American industry and workers requires working with our allies, not against them. With so much at stake globally, the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against China's predatory and unfair trade practices,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"At a time when Americans are tightening their belts, we would do well to avoid policies that heap on the pain. We ought to strengthen our friendships abroad, and reinforce our allies as pillars of American prosperity and security.\"\n\nPaul, his fellow Kentuckian, said the tariffs were unconstitutional.\n\n\"Our constitution was very specific that taxes - tariffs are a tax - taxes originate in the House, come to the Senate and then go the president,\" he told reporters. \"They don't just go to the president and no one else. What kind of system would it be if all of our taxes and laws were passed by one person?\"\n\nHe later told Fox News: \"Trade is proportional to wealth. The last 70 years of international trade has been an exponential curve upwards, and the last 70 years of prosperity has been upwards also. We are richer because of trade with Canada, and so is Canada.\"\n\nCollins, the senator for Maine, said tariffs would damage lobstering, agriculture and the pulp and paper industries in her state, which borders Canada. She also lambasted imposing tariffs on US allies.\n\n\"The fact is, the vast majority of fentanyl in America comes from the southern border [rather than from Canada],\" she said on the Senate floor.\n\n\"One of my biggest concerns is we should be distinguishing between allies and our adversaries and not treating them the same way.\"\n\nMurkowski, a senator from Alaska, said tariffs would also hurt her state and urged Trump to \"find a better way to mutually secure our borders and address fentanyl trafficking than by starting a trade war\".\n\n\"While not all Canadian trade practices are fair, I'm keenly aware of the negative impacts in store for Alaskan families and businesses should tariffs drive up the costs of essential goods,\" she posted on X.\n\n\"In Alaska ... we share more than 1,538 miles of border with Canada. We are friends, neighbors, partners, and allies when it comes to our economies, our mutual defense, our cultures, and, yes, our trade.\"\n\nThe outspoken Republican criticism hinted at a wider unease in the party that is mostly being kept muted for fear of repercussions from Trump.\n\nThom Tillis, a Republican senator for North Carolina, warned about potential \"irreparable damage\" to his farming constituents before Wednesday's announcement.\n\n\"Anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right need to talk to my farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy,\" he told CNN . \"They don't have time. So we've got to be crisp on this implementation.\"\n\nJohn Thune, the Republican Senate majority leader, tried to reconcile his concerns with loyalty to Trump. \"I've got my issue. I represent a state that is very dependent upon exports,\" he told reporters. \"But I do appreciate the president's focus on making sure we're getting better deals, and giving business an incentive to do business here in the United States.\"\n\nSuch equivocation contrasted with unambiguous condemnation from Democrats, some of whom openly lauded the Republican anti-tariff rebels.\n\n\"This is what happens when people speak up,\" posted the New Jersey senator, Cory Booker, citing images of news headlines about the four senators' votes and obliquely referencing his record-breaking Senate floor speech this week denouncing Trump's policies.\n\nChuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, posted \"54% tariffs on China, 10% tariffs on Iran, 0% tariffs on Russia\" alongside a puzzled emoji.\n\nBrian Schatz, a Hawaii senator and the Democrats' chief whip, posted : \"I've never seen a president ruin the economy on purpose.\"\n\nResponding, Chris Murphy, the outspoken Connecticut senator who has emerged as an articulate advocate of the need for a Democratic anti-Trump fightback, wrote : \"This is the thing to understand. It's all on purpose. Creating chaos and crisis.\""

A new poll found that 54% of all registered voters think Hegseth should leave his role as head of the Pentagon, with 22% believing he should remain and 24% not sure.\n\nA total of 38% of Republican voters agree that Hegseth should quit, compared to just a third who think he should retain his job. A majority of independents, at 54%, also think he should resign, according to the poll, which was released on Friday and conducted by JL Partners on behalf of the Daily Mail .\n\nThe blundering group chat discussed the merits and deadly outcome of an air attack upon Houthi rebels in Yemen, as well as embarrassingly disparaging remarks about Europe by Vance and Hegseth.\n\nTrump has so far declined to fire any of those involved, with the president dismissing it as a \"glitch\" and instead attacking Goldberg. Waltz, meanwhile, said that Goldberg's number was somehow \"sucked in\" to his phone and added to the Signal group chat.\n\nGoldberg has rejected this explanation. \"I don't know what he's talking about there,\" the journalist told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday . Referring to a science fiction movie about humans unknowingly living in a simulated reality, Goldberg said: \"This isn't 'The Matrix'. Phone numbers don't just get sucked into other phones.\n\n\"You know, very frequently in journalism, the most obvious explanation is the explanation. My phone number was in his phone because my phone number is in his phone.\"\n\nThe Signal group chat controversy follows a difficult start to the Trump administration for many of the president's cabinet picks, who faced criticism from Democrats over their lack of experience or extreme views.\n\nPolling conducted before this latest controversy showed that a majority of American voters are disappointed with Trump's cabinet members, registering a record level of dissatisfaction in the last four presidential administrations in which NBC has taken such polling ."

      "text": "First Black Republican congresswoman honored in Utah memorial service\n\nMourners gather for former lawmaker and daughter of Haitian immigrants, Mia Love, who died aged 49\n\nFamily and friends of the former US congresswoman Mia Love gathered Monday in Salt Lake City to honor the life and legacy of the first Black Republican woman elected to Congress after she died of brain cancer last month aged 49.\n\nThe former lawmaker from Utah , a daughter of Haitian immigrants, had undergone treatment for an aggressive brain tumor called glioblastoma and received immunotherapy as part of a clinical trial. She died on 23 March at her home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, weeks after her daughter announced she was no longer responding to treatment.\n\nHundreds of mourners entered her service from a walkway lined with American flags at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Institute of Religion on the University of Utah campus. Long tables displayed framed family photos and bouquets of red and white flowers.\n\nLove served only two terms in Congress before suffering a razor-thin loss to Democrat Ben McAdams in the 2018 midterm elections as Democrats surged. Yet she left her mark on Utah's political scene and later leveraged her prominence into becoming a political commentator for CNN.\n\nShe was briefly considered a rising star in the GOP, but her power within the party fizzled out as Donald Trump took hold. Love kept her distance from the US president and called him out in 2018 for vulgar comments he made about immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and some African nations.\n\nJason Love, her husband, drew laughter from the somber crowd at Monday's service when he told stories of his wife's \"superpowers\".\n\nHe described discovering her influence after he tried to return the many toasters the couple received as wedding gifts and failing because he didn't have receipts. His wife then entered the store and came out three minutes later with cash in hand.\n\n\"I thought: 'Wow, I have married a Jedi knight,'\" he said with a laugh.\n\nHer motherhood, he said, was her greatest superpower.\n\n\"She was an extraordinary mother, and she believed that the most important work she would do within her life was within the walls of her own home with her children,\" Jason Love said. \"She always made it a special place for each of them to feel loved and to begin to achieve their full potential.\"\n\nA choir of Love's friends sang some of her favorite hymns, as well as Ed Sheeran's Supermarket Flowers. Her children, Alessa, Abigale and Peyton, read an op-ed their mother published in the Deseret News shortly before she died in which she shared her enduring wish for the country to become less divisive.\n\nLove's sister Cyndi Brito shared childhood memories, including how Love used to rehearse all day and night for starring roles in her school plays. She was always the best at everything she did and made everyone around her feel important, her sister said.\n\nBrito read an excerpt of a speech her third-grade daughter gave at a recent school assembly for Black History Month honoring Love's legacy.\n\n\"Mia Love played many roles and had many titles, but the most important role and the most important title that Mia Love played in my eyes was auntie,\" Brito recalled her daughter, Carly, telling classmates.\n\nLove did not emphasize her race during her campaigns, but she acknowledged the significance of her election after her 2014 victory. She said her win defied naysayers who suggested a Black, Republican, Mormon woman could not win a congressional seat in overwhelmingly white Utah.\n\nOn Sunday evening, state leaders and members of the public visited the Utah capitol to pay their respects at Love's flag-covered coffin behind ropes in the building's rotunda.\n\nLove, born Ludmya Bourdeau, was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2022 and said her doctors estimated she had only 10 to 15 months to live, which she surpassed. With aggressive treatments, Love lived for nearly three years after receiving her diagnosis.\n\nHer close friend, Utah's lieutenant governor, Deidre Henderson, told the audience on Monday that Love had asked her friends and family to rally around her like a campaign team when she was diagnosed.\n\n\"'I'm in fight mode,' she told us, 'and what I need from you all, more than anything, is to help me fight it. This is a campaign, and we are going to win,'\" Henderson recalled.\n\nLove entered politics in 2003 after winning a city council seat in Saratoga Springs, 30 miles (48km) south of Salt Lake City. She was elected as the city's mayor in 2009, becoming the first Black woman to serve as a mayor in Utah.\n\nIn 2012, after giving a rousing speech at the Republican national convention, she narrowly lost a bid for the US House against the Democratic incumbent. She ran again two years later and won."

Those involved in the fake electors schemes in several states have been charged. In Arizona, the fake electors are under investigation by the Democratic attorney general, her office has confirmed. Kern also attended the 6 January 2021 rally at the US Capitol.\n\nThe senate concurrent resolution says that the \"sole authority to appoint presidential electors\" should fall to the legislature. It calls on the legislature to stay in session during presidential election years for this purpose. As a concurrent resolution, the proposal does not require the governor's signature and does not have the force of law; it functions more to state the legislative body's position on an issue.\n\nSuch a change would be a dramatic departure from today's democratic process, where voters elect a candidate for president and states allocate electors according to whoever won the popular vote in their state as part of the electoral college process.\n\nAs a key swing state, Arizona's elections will again take center stage in 2024. The state's Republicans have remained gripped by election fervor, with prominent lawmakers and candidates insisting the 2020 election was stolen and seeking changes to laws that could limit voters' power."

      "text": "Republicans Once Again Show No Understanding Of 'Family Values'\n\nAfter a Maryland father was mistakenly deported to an El Salvadoran prison famous for its abuses, the Trump administration admitted that it was an error - but refused to do anything to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia back.\n\nIn fact, government officials scoffed at the notion that Abrego Garcia deserved to return from the Salvadoran supermax prison the Trump administration has been busy deporting people to. The institution is known for disturbingly harsh conditions and lack of contact: Last month, the administration shared a glossy propaganda video of immigrant men getting their heads shaved and marched into cells, held bent-double by two masked guards each.\n\n\"You're acting like he's father of the year,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a press briefing on Wednesday when questioned about Abrego Garcia.\n\nVice President JD Vance echoed her comments during an interview on Fox News. \"He had committed some traffic violations. He had not shown up for some court dates,\" Vance said. \"This is not exactly father of the year here.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia was arrested at an Ikea parking lot in front of his 5-year-old son, his lawyers say - even though he was granted protection from deportation by a judge in 2019. On Friday, a federal judge ordered the U.S. to return the 29-year-old by 11:59 p.m. Monday. When reached for comment, the White House pointed HuffPost to comments Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin made on Fox News on Friday.\n\n\"The American people should know who this individual is,\" she said. \"He's not some Maryland father, he's actually a member of MS-13.\" There is no evidence that Abrego Garcia is in a gang, his attorneys say.\n\nWhile Abrego Garcia's family awaits his fate, his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg says the amount of attention the case has gotten has left them rattled, enough so that they have fled their home to escape it. \"I'm also really worried about right-wing vigilante violence,\" he told HuffPost.\n\nDeportations aren't just about any one person: the impacts spread through their family and the wider community.\n\nApproximately 5 million children have at least one undocumented parent at home. The children left to deal with the aftermath of a parent's deportation may experience increased anxiety and other mental health issues that can last long after the initial event, according to the National Immigration Law Center . There's an economic angle, too - studies have shown that deportations can plunge a family into poverty after the sudden loss of income.\n\n\"It's incredibly destabilizing,\" Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, senior policy counsel at the National Immigration Law Center, told HuffPost. \" Deportations are like a nuclear bomb: First there's the immediate impact and then life-long effects.\"\n\nFor decades - since Ronald Reagan was able to woo the evangelical Christian voting bloc - the Republican Party has positioned itself as the party of traditional and family values. The words \"family\" or \"families\" appear 18 times in the 17 pages of their 2024 party platform : \"Republicans will promote a Culture that values the Sanctity of Marriage, the blessings of childhood, the foundational role of families, and supports working parents. We will end policies that punish families,\" the platform proclaims. The Republican National Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, despite being twice divorced with five children by three women, has championed traditional family values. \"We will again stand proudly for families and for life,\" Trump told anti-abortion protesters at the March For Life back in January.\n\nBut too often, these proclamations come up sharp against the actual results of the other policies the party espouses, like the fact that their anti-immigrant, pro-deportation stance is splitting up families , just as it did during Trump's first term . \"Family values\" was always a softening cover for what was otherwise a pro-capitalist, anti-equality agenda .\n\nJust look at this past week - when the so-called pro-family party has, it turns out, made quite a few anti-family moves.\n\nAmong them, moves that will hurt families trying to expand. The Trump administration's foray into pretending to care about infertility treatments started last year when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos produced from in vitro fertilization are unborn children - meaning they could now be treated as people under the law. The ruling opened up clinics to lawsuits if an embryo is damaged or destroyed, as well as raised questions of what would happen to unused embryos - all thorny legal issues that clinics were unprepared to deal with or defend. Clinics in the state were forced to pause treatments indefinitely, leaving hopeful parents in limbo and prompting a massive public outcry.\n\nIn response, the Republican-controlled Alabama legislature passed a law to ensure that IVF clinics would be shielded from lawsuits over the damage or destruction of embryos. Republicans set out to prove that just because they considered embryos and fetuses to be children when it came to abortion, they certainly weren't willing to use that argument to prevent people from having kids.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump began saying he would make the government pay for IVF treatments , which can cost tens of thousands of dollars. When he returned to the White House, he signed an executive order that would supposedly bring down the costs of IVF treatments, but reproductive rights advocates said the order was not specific about how it would actually accomplish that.\n\nTrump has even started referring to himself as the \"fertilization president.\" \"We're going to have tremendous, tremendous goodies in the bag for women, too, the women between the fertilization and all of the other things that we're talking about,\" he said at a Women's History month White House event last week. \"I'll be known as the fertilization president, that's not bad, that's not bad.\"\n\nBut just one week after declaring himself President Fertilization, his Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., laid off a small but highly specialized team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that studied IVF, as part of the sweeping cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe six-person Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance team had tracked how well IVF is working and researched topics like how to make the procedure less expensive. Without them, experts warn, hopeful parents will be cut off from valuable resources that can help them make important decisions about their treatment.\n\nInfertility experts were stunned. \"This is a big handicap for the administration as they embrace IVF and want to expand coverage,\" Barbara Collura, CEO of Resolve: The National Infertility Association, told NBC News . \"These are the right people to have at your side.\"\n\nOops?\n\nEven GOP politicians themselves haven't been immune from the conflict between their stated priorities and actual agenda. A debate over a bill meant to help parents serving in Congress caused a party rift this week that prompted one member to leave a right-wing caucus.\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who had a child in 2023, proposed a bill that would allow new parents in the U.S. House to vote by proxy for up to 12 weeks and has been lobbying for bipartisan support. But a small group of Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, were aghast at the suggestion. Even though many of them voted by proxy during COVID lockdowns, they balked at the idea of affording the same flexibility to new parents.\n\nThings came to a head when Johnson, however, declined to let a committee have a hearing on the proposal this week. So Luna used a different approach. Through what's called a \"discharge\" petition, she got enough signatures from her colleagues to force her bill to the floor.\n\nInstead, Johnson took his ball and went home, canceling votes for the rest of the week. In response, Luna abruptly quit the House Freedom Caucus, the far-right faction of Congress, saying their opposition to her \"family-centered bill\" was a \"betrayal of trust.\"\n\nIn a letter , Luna accused some of her Republican colleagues of smearing her by tying her proposal to a bill that would require proof of citizenship to vote.\n\n\"The intent was clear: to misrepresent me and the members supporting this pro-life, pro-family initiative-one of the most significant in congressional history-as obstructing the President and opposing election integrity,\" Luna wrote.\n\n\"Republicans should stop lecturing people on being pro-family when they're opposing this uniformly,\" Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) told reporters about the situation.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "How Republicans Could Stop Donald Trump's Tariffs\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is crashing the global economy with arbitrary tariffs against countries around the world, but it doesn't have to be this way.\n\nCongress could stop the tariffs at any time.\n\nThe Constitution gives Congress the power to control tariffs, but lawmakers have over the decades ceded their power to the White House with laws expanding the president's trade powers, including authorities to impose duties in cases of emergency.\n\nTrump has claimed fentanyl and international trade itself are emergencies to justify taxes of 10% or higher not just on every U.S. trading partner but on friendly neighbors like Canada and even on uninhabited islands home to only seals or penguins.\n\nAlready, members of Congress have introduced legislation to roll back the president's tariff power. But Republican leaders have given no indication they will allow the bills to become law, as they work instead on passing trillions of dollars in tax cuts.\n\nStill, several rank-and-file Republicans have refused to go along with Trump's crazed napkin-math trade agenda that assumes the U.S. has been \"looted, pillaged, raped and plundered\" by any country where the value of its exports exceeds its imports from the U.S.\n\nIn the Senate, a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Chuck Grassley of Iowa last week introduced legislation to reassert Congress' role over trade policy. That bill has the support of seven GOP co-sponsors, enough to overcome a filibuster. It's unclear whether Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) will ever bring it up for a vote since that would almost certainly anger Trump.\n\n\"I am a Republican. I am a supporter of Donald Trump. But this is a bipartisan problem,\" Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) explained in a Senate floor speech last week. \"I don't care if the president is a Republican or a Democrat. I don't want to live under emergency rule. I don't want to live where my representatives cannot speak for me and have a check and balance on power.\"\n\nThe White House has threatened to veto the legislation, which would require tariffs be approved by Congress within 60 days.\n\n\"This bill would dangerously hamper the President's authority and duty to determine our foreign policy and protect our national security,\" the White House said in a statement on Monday.\n\nIn the House, Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) said Sunday he would introduce a companion bill and that the legislation could become viable if the stock market keeps tanking for several weeks.\n\n\"It's time that Congress restores its authorities here,\" Bacon said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"And the Constitution is clear, the House and the Senate, Congress has the power of tariffs and taxes. And we gave some of that power to [the] executive branch. And I think, in hindsight, that was a mistake.\"\n\nGOP leaders snuck a provision into last month's government funding bill disallowing a privileged vote in the House on a measure overturning the tariffs, so lawmakers would need to force one via a so-called discharge petition, another obstacle to getting a bill to Trump's desk.\n\nAny bill that Congress passes reasserting its authority over tariffs would likely need a large, veto-proof majority, or a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate.\n\nThere's no indication yet that nervous Republicans will bail on Trump's tariff regime, but that could change if financial markets continue melting down. Billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman, a top Trump ally, warned Sunday that the world is on the precipice of \"self-induced, economic nuclear winter\" and urged the president to take a 90-day \"time out\" with his tariffs.\n\n\"What CEO and what board of directors will be comfortable making large, long-term, economic commitments in our country in the middle of an economic nuclear war?\" he asked in a post on social media.\n\nBut Trump has refused to back down, defending his policies.\n\n\"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something - and we have been treated so badly by other countries,\" Trump told reporters on Sunday after a weekend of golfing at his Florida estate.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Republican Rips 'This Is NOT Normal' Sign Away From Protesting Democrat\n\nReporter\n\nIn a silent protest during President Trump's Tuesday night address to Congress, Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) held up a sign that said \"This is NOT normal\" as Trump entered the House chamber.\n\nMoments later, Rep. Lance Gooden (R-Texas) nabbed the paper out of Stansbury's hand, HuffPost's Arthur Delaney reported . Gooden then threw Stansbury's paper into the air, which led to it landing next to Trump.\n\nTrump's contentious session was riddled with Democrat protests, despite the House Freedom Caucus , which is composed of far-right Republicans , claiming that Democrats who \"use noisemakers, make threats, throw things or otherwise disrupt\" will face repercussions.\n\n(It's worth noting that Gooden's decision to throw Stansbury's paper went against the House Freedom Caucus's statement earlier on Tuesday warning Democrats specifically not to \"throw things.\")\n\nAlong with Stansbury, some other Democrats displayed matching black, circular signs attached to sticks that said \"Musk steals,\" \"Save Medicaid\" and \"Protect veterans.\"\n\nSome of those democrats would switch the signs to the opposite side, which said \"False,\" when Trump lied throughout the speech.\n\nDemocrats also wore various colors in protest as well, including pink, blue and yellow.\n\nIn another instance of dissent, Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) caused his own disruption at the start of Trump's speech, leading to his removal.\n\n\"You have no mandate to cut Medicaid,\" Green shouted at the president while waving his cane before he was escorted out.\n\nSeveral others, including Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.), walked out of the address as Trump continued to speak.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "'Spinning Our Wheels': Republican Agenda Struggles To Get Off The Ground\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON - It wasn't supposed to be like this.\n\nCongressional Republicans were hoping to quickly approve Donald Trump's domestic policy agenda and confirm his Cabinet nominees within days of him taking office, helping to fulfill his many campaign promises and lay the foundation for an ambitious second term.\n\nWith Trump's inauguration quickly approaching, however, Republicans in the House and Senate are still bickering over how to proceed in crafting legislation for border security, the military, the energy industry and a massive package of tax cuts. In the House, 218 votes are required to pass legislation and the GOP currently has 219 sitting members, making passage of any major budget bill a headache.\n\nMeanwhile, several of Trump's nominees to top administrative positions face uncertain prospects of getting confirmed by the Senate, while others are facing delays that threaten to spoil the president-elect's demands for a flurry of confirmations on Day 1 of his presidency.\n\nWhen it comes to lawmaking, the big question for Republicans is whether to pass a quick border and energy bill that would give Trump some early legislative wins or take more time and pass one giant bill that includes tax cuts, which are more complicated and politically trickier.\n\nNo Republican - including Trump himself - seems to want to make the call, leading to frustration from some GOP senators who believe the party is wasting time fussing.\n\n\"I'm for accomplishing our goal and we're not even working on it right now,\" Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told HuffPost. \"We're just spinning our wheels.\"\n\nAsked about one idea floated by some Republicans of starting to work on one giant legislative package and reverting to splitting it into two pieces if the party members can't agree on it, Cornyn was dismissive, calling it a \"recipe for failure.\"\n\nTrump, for his part, seems bored by the debate, and wants congressional Republicans to figure it out.\n\n\"Whether it's one bill or two bills, it's going to get done one way or the other,\" Trump said Wednesday during a visit to the Capitol. \"I think there's a lot of talk about two and there's a lot of talk about one, but it doesn't matter. The end result is the same. We're going to get something done that's going to be reducing taxes and creating a lot of jobs and all of the other things.\"\n\nIn order to unlock the special \"budget reconciliation\" process that will allow them to make law without facing a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, Republicans need to pass a budget resolution in both the House and Senate outlining their tax and spending numbers. That means they have to know at the outset whether taxes are part of the package. After both chambers adopt the resolution, then they can get to work on writing the actual legislation.\n\nThe most outspoken advocate for the one-bill approach has been House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.), the overseer of tax policy in the House, where there are several Republicans from Democratic states demanding a higher limit on federal tax deductions for state and local tax payments, also known as the SALT cap - a potential major sticking point for a tax bill. Accommodating those members could make the tax bill even more expensive than the trillions of dollars it's already expected to cost.\n\n\"We have to find some kind of reasonable cap, because we cannot lose one member in the House of Representatives,\" Smith said on Fox Business this week. \"And I'll tell you, there's a whole lot more than one member that cares about the SALT cap.\"\n\nIf the tax bill is combined with border security and energy deregulation, it could be harder for those pushing for a higher limit on the SALT cap to hold things up.\n\nSen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), the point man on taxes for Senate Republicans, told HuffPost he hasn't taken sides on whether to lump taxes in with everything else. He said he understands arguments for each approach, including the idea of getting \"wins on the table\" with a border bill and addressing taxes later.\n\n\"It's phenomenally complicated,\" Crapo said of the tax code.\n\nTrump is likely to have some early successes with several of his top Cabinet nominees, who are likely to be confirmed during his first week in office. Those include nominations with bipartisan support like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to lead the State Department, John Ratcliffe to lead the CIA, and Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Other nominees with less bipartisan support could also be confirmed within days of Trump's swearing-in, including for the posts of attorney general, deputy attorney general and FBI director.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Kennedy Jr., Trump's controversial picks to serve as director of national intelligence and secretary of health and human services, respectively, could be in trouble. Both nominees face skeptical GOP senators who have yet to announce their support for the confirmations.\n\nUnder pressure from Trump to confirm as many nominees as possible this month, some Republican committee chairs have scheduled confirmation hearings before key documents like a background check or an ethics report has been submitted to the Senate. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), the chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, for example, this week posted notices of hearings for two Trump nominees over the objections of panel Democrats, who said they had not yet received their paperwork.\n\n\"What are Republicans trying to hide when they don't want their nominees to have background checks and don't want to have full information about them?\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) asked on Thursday.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Republican Leaders Tell Members To Avoid Town Halls, 'Professional Protesters'\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON - House Republican leaders on Tuesday told rank-and-file lawmakers not to hold public meetings to avoid getting yelled at by their constituents.\n\nRepublicans have been stung by voters at town halls complaining about billionaire Elon Musk's attacks on federal agencies and Republican proposals to cut Medicaid benefits.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) claimed the angry constituents at Republican town halls over the weekend and during a recess last month are not actually constituents, but rather paid provocateurs.\n\n\"Democrat activists who don't live in the district very often will show up for these town hall events, and they'll go in an hour early and fill all the seats, and so the constituents and the people from the community that are actually represented don't even get the seat,\" Johnson said at a press conference Tuesday.\n\n\"T here are people who do this as a profession. They're professional protesters,\" Johnson said. \"So why would we give them a forum to do that right now?\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that in a party meeting before the press conference, National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) had told Republican lawmakers that none of them should be doing town halls.\n\nRep. Rich McCormick (R-Ga.), who faced hecklers at a town hall in January, told HuffPost last week that senior lawmakers had advised him not to hold such events but that there hadn't been a formal directive from party leadership.\n\nIt's unlikely that anybody protests at town hall events as an actual profession, but it's true that liberal groups like Indivisible and MoveOn can organize people to attend town hall meetings. Indivisible co-director Ezra Levin told HuffPost that if Republicans don't hold town halls, local Indivisible chapters will organize their own \"empty chair\" events in lawmakers' honor.\n\nLevin and Republicans themselves agreed the spectacle of town hall protests recalls the anti-Trump backlash that occurred in 2017, the first year of Trump's first term, which preceded a Democratic takeover of the House in the following year's midterm elections.\n\nJohnson said Republicans should still meet with constituents, just not in person.\n\n\"We've been encouraging our members to communicate directly with their constituents,\" Johnson said. \"There's lots of different ways and forums to do it. If you can do it in telephone town halls, you can have small subgroups of people in different industries and segments of the community. We find that to be very, very productive and more productive than if you just go to an open forum right now.\"\n\nResponding to the GOP directive online, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) called it a shame.\n\n\"If your Republican representative won't meet with you because their agenda is so unpopular, maybe a Democrat will. Hell, maybe I will,\" Walz wrote . \"If your congressman refuses to meet, I'll come host an event in their district to help local Democrats beat 'em.\"\n\nViet Shelton, spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, mocked the town hall avoidance plan.\n\n\"So House Republicans' political strategy is 'see no families nor workers,' 'hear no protesters', 'speak to no one' and hope everyone gets less angry at them when they rip away Americans' health care?

      "text": "House Adopts Republican Budget That Calls For Medicaid Cuts\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON - House Republicans unified around their budget plan on Tuesday, delivering a significant win to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and President Donald Trump.\n\nThe House adopted the resolution by a vote of 217 to 215, with all Democrats and one Republican against.\n\nThe budget resolution calls for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. It received criticism from far-right lawmakers who said the spending cuts were too small and from moderate Republicans who said they were too big.\n\nAt first, it appeared the measure lacked support, as Johnson initially delayed the vote and then canceled it altogether, only to reverse course minutes later and call members back into the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans seemed taken aback by voters complaining in town halls last week about the budget's plans to cut Medicaid spending. Johnson downplayed the Medicaid cuts outlined in the resolution, saying they would only target waste, fraud and abuse.\n\n\"We can eliminate all these fraudulent payments and achieve a lot of savings,\" Johnson said Tuesday at a press conference.\n\nThe budget doesn't envision enough savings for Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), the one Republican who voted no, pointing to the fact that the resolution would add trillions to the national debt because the tax cuts are bigger than the spending cuts.\n\n\"The only way they get to this magic thing where it's not going to kill our country is five years from now, they imagine that 2.5% growth accumulates,\" Massie told reporters before the vote, describing party leaders' argument that the tax cuts would pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth.\n\nPresident Donald Trump personally lobbied some of the holdouts with phone calls on Tuesday, including Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) , who withheld his vote until it was already clear the House would adopt the measure without him.\n\nThe budget lays the procedural groundwork for Republicans to later pass the single \"big, beautiful bill\" that's supposed to be the centerpiece of Trump's second-term agenda, including an extension of temporary tax cuts he enacted in his first term and the savings he's promised from a more efficient federal government.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "41% Of Republican Voters Agree That GOP's Anti-Trans Rhetoric Is 'Sad And Shameful'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump 's campaign has spent more than $21 million on political advertisements attacking Vice President Kamala Harris this election cycle over her support of transgender rights - and stoking fears about transgender people's presence in public life.\n\nIn an ad that has run nationally and in swing states and is circulating widely online, the Trump campaign takes aim at Harris' prior support of gender-affirming care for people in prisons. It ends with the tagline: \"Kamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you.\"\n\nA new report from Data for Progress out Thursday shows that voters across party lines believe these ads have gotten out of hand - and that they think Democrats are better equipped to handle LGBTQ+ issues than Republicans .\n\nThe progressive polling firm surveyed 1,216 likely U.S. voters about candidates' stances on transgender rights. Respondents were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with a series of statements.\n\nAsked if they viewed Republican candidates' use of anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric in their campaigns as \"sad and shameful,\" 41% of Republicans and 58% of independent voters agreed. That compares to 38% of Republicans and 25% of independents who do not think it's \"shameful.\"\n\nThe survey also found that 80% of all voters polled, across party lines, agreed that the two major parties should spend more time talking about the economy and inflation than issues related to transgender people. And 52% of voters trust the Democratic Party more than the GOP to handle trans issues, including a 39% plurality of independents.\n\nThis new data is consistent with other polling from Data for Progress earlier this year. In January, the firm asked a similar number of likely U.S. voters to rank issues most important to them. The economy and employment were at the top of the list, followed by climate change and health care. LGBTQ+ issues ranked last.\n\nTrump and Republicans have made big bets this year that anti-trans rhetoric will not only help the top of the ticket, but will help them clinch several competitive races for seats in the House and Senate in what is projected to be the most expensive election of all time.\n\nRepublican expenditures targeting a minority group that by some counts makes up as little as 0.5% of the U.S. population have not borne fruit in the past. During the midterm elections in 2022, Republican candidates who ran campaigns heavy on anti-trans rhetoric, who used hateful language to describe transgender people or who called into question the science of gender-affirming care overwhelmingly lost . By contrast, LGBTQ+ candidates won at record-setting numbers, according to the Victory Institute , which works to elect LGBTQ+ candidates.\n\nOver each of the last two years, Republican-led state legislatures across the country have filed more than 500 bills targeting the LGBTQ+ community. They often have a particular focus on transgender children, limiting their access to certain sports teams and bathrooms, restricting LGBTQ+ topics in school curricula and banning gender-affirming care like puberty blockers and hormone therapy for minors.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Trump Is Governing Like A Traditional Republican\n\nWashington Bureau Chief, HuffPost\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON ― Donald Trump was supposed to be a different type of Republican. He's frequently switched political parties , won over some traditionally Democratic voters and attacked well-regarded members of the GOP. Many establishment Republicans disavowed him, while others hoped his heterodox views ― antithetical to many pro-business elites ― could reshape politics.\n\nBut as president, Trump has mostly governed as a traditional Republican leader. His rhetoric may sound different, but his biggest accomplishments and policy initiatives are, at the end of the day, almost completely in line with an orthodox GOP agenda ― with more of an emphasis on nationalist policies.\n\nTrump didn't execute some hostile takeover of the party; he was readily welcomed by many in the rank and file as its chief, and his administration has already fulfilled many items on its wishlist.\n\n\"President Trump has absolutely governed as a Republican,\" said Boris Epshteyn, a former Trump aide who is now chief political analyst at Sinclair Broadcast Group. \"The president has had success on a wide range of fronts which are key to the Republican and conservative agenda, including deregulation, tax reform, decimating ISIS, repealing [Obamacare's] individual mandate, reforming immigration, etc.\"\n\n\"It is also important to note how involved the president has been in supporting Republican candidates throughout the country and working to keep GOP majorities in the House and the Senate,\" he added.\n\nThe most significant accomplishments under Trump have as much to do with Congress as they do with the president. Legislatively, Trump's biggest win was the tax cut law that delivered a massive permanent reduction for corporations. While Trump aides helped craft the legislation, it was something that congressional Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) have been preparing for years ― long before Trump ran for president.\n\n\"In many ways Trump is governing as a traditional Reaganite - less government regulation, less taxes and a stronger military.\"\n\nTrump also nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, ensuring that conservatives continue to hold the majority on the bench. But the reason Trump was able to choose a justice at all was thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who refused to let the chamber vote on President Barack Obama 's nominee when Antonin Scalia's death created a vacancy in early 2016.\n\nAnd in filling the high court vacancy and others in lower federal courts, Trump has leaned heavily on recommendations from the Federalist Society, which has a deep network of conservative legal talent.\n\nWhile Trump came in promising to \"drain the swamp,\" his lack of political experience has allowed the swamp to thrive. Lobbyists , special interest groups and even foreign nations have been able to find ways into the administration.\n\nTrump initially appointed a number of outsiders to his cabinet and top staff. Recently, however, he has begun turning to Republican insiders and former GOP officials who are more ideologically aligned with the party establishment. Larry Kudlow, his new top economic adviser, is a long-time free trade and tax cut advocate. John Bolton, his new national security adviser, previously served as United Nations ambassador under President George W. Bush and is one of the most hawkish voices in American foreign policy who has fiercely defended the Iraq War.\n\nA policy area where Trump has most radically broken with Republicans is on trade. Trump's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as additional steep tariffs on China, has spooked markets and sparked fears of an impending trade war.\n\nWhile congressional Republicans have warned about the negative effects of Trump's tariffs, few have indicated they will support legislation to nullify them. China, meanwhile, retaliated against the U.S. on Monday by imposing tariffs on 120 types of commodities, which is expected to primarily affect American farmers.\n\n\"In many ways Trump is governing as a traditional Reaganite ― less government regulation, less taxes and a stronger military,\" Trump confidante and Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy said. \"Even on trade, Reagan was a hawk and Trump tapped his key trade [representative], Bob Lightizer. Trump often stakes out positions more extreme than Reagan, but observers should see this as a negotiating tactic for him. With Trump, always look at results and the bottom line; they tend to be quite reasonable and good.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) agreed with the Reagan comparison, but said Trump put more emphasis on \"things that have changed.\"\n\n\"I think he would approve of Trump's nationalism about controlling immigration and focusing on merit based immigrants,\" Gingrich said. \"Reagan had defense, economic growth and the deficit in that order and the recent Trump signature of the spending bill followed the Reagan pattern. Trump's aggressive trade policy would have been understandable to Reagan because the world has changed. When the director of national intelligence in 2015 said China had stolen $460 billion in intellectual property in one year you clearly have to rethink your trader policies.\"\n\nThe George W. Bush wing of the party, in contrast, was \"more globalist and more anti-deficit.\"\n\nTrump often gives members of his party heartburn when he praises Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. But he recently listened to his staff and agreed to expel 60 Russian spies and diplomats, the largest such expulsion in U.S. history. The move drew rare praise from lawmakers of both parties.\n\n\"This fits the pattern of our policy toward Russia in the Trump administration,\" John Herbst, a Russia scholar at the Atlantic Council, told The Washington Post. \"If you just look at policy, this administration has taken steps the Obama administration was not willing to, such as supplying antitank missiles to Ukraine. The president's heart doesn't seem to be in it, but for whatever reason, he's willing to go along with his advisers .\"\n\nImmigration is perhaps the top issue that animates Trump's base ― and therefore himself ― but he's hardly the first GOP politician to use it to appeal to voters. During his 2010 re-election bid, for example, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) starred in a memorable ad in which he walked along the U.S. border with Mexico and urged then-Sheriff Paul Babeu to \"complete the danged fence.\" In 2012, GOP presidential contender Mitt Romney urged undocumented immigrants to \"self-deport.\" And just last week, Romney said as a Senate candidate in Utah that undocumented immigrants who came into the country as children shouldn't be allowed to obtain legal status at all .\n\nTrump recently signed a $1.3 trillion government funding bill into law that will greatly increase the federal deficit by raising spending for domestic and military programs. During the Obama administration, Republicans railed against the federal deficit and called for cutting spending. But the fact that the omnibus sailed through was less a result of Trump being a new type of president then the reality that Republicans no longer need to make the deficit a political issue now that they have a GOP president.\n\nOn gun policy, Trump stunned lawmakers earlier this year when he publicly embraced several gun control measures and shot down GOP priorities like concealed carry reciprocity. He even, shockingly, said he would be fine taking away people's guns without their permission, and told members of Congress that they should be willing to stand up to the National Rifle Association.\n\nShortly thereafter, however, order in Trump's Washington was restored: The Republican president had realigned himself with conservative priorities and abandoned talk of pushing lawmakers to pass broader gun control proposals.\n\nAnd on social policy, Trump has continued to restrict abortion access and block advancements for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, staying in the space where Republicans have traditionally fallen.\n\n\"On most of the issues, the policies of this administration have fallen under traditional Republican policy,\" GOP strategist and former Republican National Committee spokesman Doug Heye said. \"This is seen not only in the measures advanced by the administration ... but also in the personnel that the administration has brought on board.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Since October, Sen. John Fetterman Has Been Building a Roster of Republican Donors\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\n\"Yes I'm a Republican and I exclusively supported John through the Jewish community for his principled actions supporting Israel.\"\n\nWhile Democrats and independents make up the bulk of support for Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., his campaign is attracting new Republican donors as he has hardened his stance in support of Israel since the Hamas attacks on October 7.\n\nAt least 14 registered Republicans have contributed to Fetterman's campaign since October, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. A 15th Fetterman donor listed as a registered Republican told The Intercept he recently switched his party registration to Democrat to vote for George Latimer in the Democratic primary against Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y. Three of the donors gave to Fetterman's last campaign for Senate.\n\nWhile the donations haven't been big enough to change Fetterman's overall numbers, they point to both a shift in the public perception of Fetterman, who once identified as a progressive, and the shifting politics on Israel in the U.S.\n\nWhere support for Israel was once subject to bipartisan consensus , Israel's rightward lurch in recent decades has been mirrored in U.S. politics, where its staunchest supporters are increasingly aligned with the Republican Party. Among Democrats, progressives have been generally more critical of human rights abuses in Israel while centrists and mainstream liberals, especially in party leadership, show more robust unconditional support for Israel.\n\n\"It's shameful that Sen. Fetterman is choosing to align himself with the GOP and its enthusiasm for the mass death of Palestinians in Gaza over the majority of Americans who want to see a ceasefire and equality and Justice for Palestinians and Israelis,\" said Eva Borgwardt, national spokesperson for IfNotNow, a Jewish American group that opposes support for Israeli apartheid. (Fetterman's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nAs his roster of GOP supporters slowly grew, Fetterman has, in recent weeks, stridently criticized President Joe Biden from the right on Israel policy. He bashed Biden for not vetoing a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and spoke out against the administration for discouraging an Israeli offensive in Rafah, a beleaguered corner of the Gaza Strip clogged with refugees in dire conditions .\n\nWhile the Pennsylvania senator was explicit about his unconditional support for Israel during his 2022 Senate campaign , some of his supporters have expressed frustration as his rhetoric has veered to the right of other pro-Israel Democrats, all as the death toll among Palestinians in Gaza climbed to more than 30,000.\n\nFetterman has also faced progressive disapproval for taunting pro-Palestine veterans demonstrating at the U.S. Capitol and doubling down on his position that there should be no conditions on aid to Israel. Three of Fetterman's top communications staffers have left the office since October, when more than a dozen of his former campaign staffers wrote an open letter calling on him to support a ceasefire.\n\nIn addition to the 14 Republicans and one recent conversion, some of Fetterman's non-GOP campaign contributors have themselves increased donations to Republicans since October. More than a dozen other Democratic and independent Fetterman donors who've given to Fetterman's campaign in the last six months have also given to Republican candidates and causes.\n\nSeveral Fetterman donors have also contributed to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which is targeting Democratic members of Congress who've called for a ceasefire in Gaza and to end U.S. military support for Israel. Other Fetterman donors have given to candidates backed by AIPAC to challenge members of the progressive Squad in Democratic primaries, including Latimer in New York, Bhavini Patel in Pennsylvania , and Don Samuels in Minnesota.\n\nFetterman has raised $4.7 million this cycle, including at least $1.6 million since October, and 83 percent of those recent contributions came from outside Pennsylvania, a figure similar to the proportion of out-of-state contributions that fueled his 2022 campaign.\n\nWhile Fetterman has raised the bulk of his contributions from Democrats, registered Republicans have given at least $18,900 to Fetterman's campaign since October. Several were first-time donors to a federal campaign.\n\nNew York Republican Joshua Landes said he supported Fetterman because of his stance on Israel. \"Yes I'm a Republican and I exclusively supported John through the Jewish community for his principled actions supporting Israel now during this Israel Gaza war,\" Landes said in an email to The Intercept.\n\nEdward Neiger, a Fetterman donor and attorney in New York, said he recently switched parties from Republican to Democrat to vote in the Democratic primary against Bowman . Neiger said he's a libertarian at heart and that Fetterman's \"moral clarity\" on Israel has been a breath of fresh air. He's given $3,000 to Fetterman's campaign since November.\n\nFormer Meridian Capital CEO Ralph Herzka, a registered Republican in New York, gave $2,500 to Fetterman's campaign in November. Herzka, like several other Republican Fetterman donors, declined to comment.\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nSeveral of the donors who are registered Democrats or haven't declared a party affiliation have also given heavily to Republicans. The recipients included former President Donald Trump; former Republican presidential primary candidates Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis; Republican House Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y.; Republican Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dave McCormick; and the Lincoln Project, a group of anti-Trump Republicans.\n\nEliezer Scheiner, whose voter registration does not list a party affiliation, has given a total of $5,000 to Fetterman. A nursing home operator who gave more than $750,000 to Trump's failed 2020 reelection campaign , Scheiner also contributed this cycle to campaigns for Democrats including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries; Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y.; and New Jersey Senate candidate Tammy Murphy.(Scheiner did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nScott Barshay, partner at the law firm Paul Weiss, gave $3,300 to Fetterman's campaign in January. Barshay has given to both Democrats and Republicans, and has contributed this cycle to Haley; Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C.; as well as Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y. Barshay also gave $5,000 in March to No Labels, the centrist group that recently suspended its bid to field a primary candidate to run against Biden after raising tens of millions of dollars.\n\nOriginal reporting.

Retiree Clyde Robbins has given mostly to Democrats as well as to the leadership PAC for former Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney. Robbins gave Fetterman's campaign $1,000 in March, and $1,200 to his 2022 campaign.\n\nAnother Republican donor. Kathleen Forest, an 82-year-old vineyard owner in Pennsylvania, gave $500 to Fetterman's campaign in March. Her contribution to his 2022 campaign was her first listed federal contribution since 1994. (Barshay, Robbins, and Forest did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nWhile Republican donors gave Fetterman contributions between $500 and $3,300, Fetterman has continued to pull in donations from small-dollar donors. More than 40 percent of Fetterman's contributions last quarter came from donations under $200.\n\nThe Pennsylvania senator has also received support from Palantir CEO Alexander Karp , who gave the maximum contribution of $3,300 to Fetterman's campaign in January. Karp has given to several Republicans this cycle. (Karp did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nNo Labels co-founder John Avlon , who is currently running in the Democratic primary in New York's 1st Congressional District, gave Fetterman $1,000 in February. (Avlon did not respond to a request for comment.) Avlon denounced No Labels's effort to recruit a candidate to challenge Biden and said he hasn't been involved with the group since 2013.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "House GOP Moves to Ram Through Bill That Gives Trump Unilateral Power to Kill Nonprofits\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nDozens of Democrats still support the bill - giving the Republican-controlled House plenty of breathing room to pass it next week.\n\nA controversial \"nonprofit killer\" bill is back on track after it was blocked earlier this week.\n\nA majority of Democrats in the House of Representatives rejected the bill on Tuesday out of fear that it could grant President-elect Donald Trump the legal tools with which to target his ideological foes, but Republicans are swiftly pressing ahead.\n\nThe Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act, which would empower the secretary of the Treasury to designate any nonprofit as a \"terrorist supporting organization\" and revoke its tax-exempt status, is set to go before the Committee on Rules on Monday for a hearing that could tee up the bill for a new floor vote.\n\nThe hearing was announced Thursday evening, just two days after 144 Democrats and one Republican voted against the bill as part of a fast-track parliamentary procedure that required a two-thirds majority.\n\nThe bill, also known as H.R. 9495, has come under withering criticism from a broad coalition of organizations that say its sponsors are pushing it as a means of cracking down on free speech - particularly speech in support of Palestine. In a joint statement earlier this week, a coalition of Arab American and Muslim organizations pledged to continue to fight the bill.\n\n\"This bill was designed to criminalize organizations and activists who oppose the U.S.'s unconditional support of Israel's genocide of Palestinians and the slaughter of Lebanese civilians,\" read the statement , which was signed by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, American Muslims for Palestine, and others. \"We will continue to stand firm in protecting all organizations' freedom to speak and operate without fear of political retribution.\"\n\nOffices for the chair and ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, through which the bill must pass, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWith pro-Israel groups lobbying for the bill, it gained popularity among House Democrats, in part due to a provision providing tax relief to Americans held hostage abroad.\n\nThe reelection of Trump, however, galvanized opponents, including Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, who led the charge to reject the bill on Tuesday. Doggett doubled down on Thursday after learning of the newly scheduled Rules Committee hearing.\n\n\"In this mislabeled bill, House Republicans are hiding behind hostages,\" Doggett said in a statement to The Intercept. \"Their rush to reconsider this bill is solely to offer Trump more and more power, while Trump's nominees for key national security posts this week indicate how he will be using it.\"\n\nDoggett and fellow Democratic opponents of the bill face an uphill battle to halt the legislation for good. They were able to block it on Tuesday only because H.R. 9495 was put to a House vote under suspension of the rules, a maneuver allowing for legislation to be fast-tracked by limiting debate and barring the addition of new amendments in exchange for the requirement of a two-thirds majority to pass.\n\nUltimately, 144 Democrats voted no, along with Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., barely meeting the threshold to block the bill from fast-track passage. Voting in favor were 204 Republicans and 52 Democrats. The narrow loss - with so many Democrats supporting the bill, opponents had no votes to spare - provoked outrage from supporters of the bill like Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., who had spoken in favor of it prior to the vote.\n\n\"This shameful partisan play only sets back efforts to halt the abuse of America's tax code by terrorist organizations,\" Smith said in a statement published Wednesday by the House Ways and Means Committee. \"Going forward, I encourage our Democrat colleagues to put the defense of our nation and the needs of American taxpayers first.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nCivil liberties groups that had long opposed the bill hailed the vote to block it as a victory, albeit a fleeting one.\n\nThe bill is slated for a hearing on Monday known as a markup session, in which committee members may briefly discuss the legislation and propose amendments. If a majority of committee members approve of the bill, whether in its original or amended form, it would move on to another vote on the House floor.\n\nThis time, it would likely be put to a simple majority vote. With Republicans in control of the chamber and around 52 Democratic lawmakers showing support by voting for it on Tuesday, the bill would almost certainly pass.\n\nDoggett, however, remained determined: \"We Democrats can either post a Yield Right of Way sign or push back to make every effort to protect civil society and our freedoms.\"\n\nWAIT!

Victoria Spartz, one of the most outspoken DOGE supporters, to rein in Elon Musk.\n\nIt was the town hall that wasn't supposed to happen.\n\nFor the better part of two hours Friday night, pissed-off Hoosiers jeered, chanted, and booed at Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., one of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency's most fervent supporters in Congress.\n\nIt was a case in point for why senior Republican leaders have advised their members against holding such events at all.\n\nSpartz, however, is often at odds with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. She plowed through the taunts as a crowd outside shouted, \"Do your job!\" Inside, the crowd roared in anger at mentions of Elon Musk and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nWith GOP members dodging in-person town halls, the meeting offered a rare window into the depths of disgust in red districts over DOGE. Spartz represents a conservative district in a state that broke for Donald Trump over Kamala Harris by 59 percent to 40 percent.\n\nBrian Jonasen, an Air Force veteran who has helped organize protests at the Indiana Statehouse, said, \"The one thing we hope that maybe she takes back with her is that the people are mad. They are angry.\"\n\n\"We are not paid to do this,\" said Jonasen, the protest organizer.\n\nJohnson, the House Speaker, has claimed, baselessly, that the crowds are full of paid protesters.\n\nEarlier this month, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee told members to stop holding them, according to Politico .\n\nThey may have been hoping to avoid spectacles like the one that unfolded Friday at a packed conference center in Westfield, about 20 miles north of downtown Indianapolis.\n\nThe at-capacity crowd of 500 people at first listened respectfully as Spartz, a CPA who has made deficit reduction her signature issue, presented her concerns about federal debt.\n\nThen Spartz started talking about DOGE - and the crowd erupted. As Musk's name was mentioned, the crowd began shouting.\n\n\"Do your job!\" audience members repeatedly chanted, urging her to rein in Musk and DOGE.\n\nWithin 15 minutes of starting, the town hall was so contentious that Spartz sounded a note of regret.\n\n\"I'll be honest with you; I wanted to have a conversation. But if you want a screaming match, we don't have to do town halls,\" she said.\n\nSpartz sidestepped a question about Trump's belief that he can impound federal funds appropriated by Congress, calling it a question for the Supreme Court. She suggested that in the long term, she hopes to pass Musk's chainsaw changes to the federal government into law.\n\n\"My job is working with them to make sure we can pass proper legislation,\" she said.\n\nDOGE wasn't the only question lobbed at Spartz. One attendee asked if Spartz would stick up for due process, in light of the Trump administration's attempts at mass deportation.\n\n\"There is no due process if you come here illegally, because you violated the law,\" Spartz said. The crowd erupted in boos.\n\nThe loudest jeers of the night came in response to one audience member's question about whether Spartz would call for the resignation of members of the Signal group chat that divulged sensitive information about a strike on Yemen to an Atlantic editor.\n\n\"Will you demand the immediate resignation of Pete Hegseth?\" one questioner asked.\n\nThe crowd rose to its feet and roared, with scattered shouts of \"Lock him up!\"\n\n\"No, I will not demand their resignation,\" Spartz said . \"You should talk to the senators. Hopefully they'll have town halls.\"\n\nSpartz's unusual decision to hold a town hall reflected her eccentric tenure in the House.\n\nThe first Ukrainian-born member of Congress, she supported funding for the Ukrainian war effort before falling in line with Trump to oppose it.\n\nHer office has been roiled by high turnover and allegations of bullying, leading one group to deem her Congress's \"worst boss.\" She was caught trying to carry a handgun onto a flight to Europe. She has alienated Republicans in her home base.\n\nMore recently, there may be no House member who has staked her reputation on DOGE quite like Spartz.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism.

She has persistently been one of the small group of GOP lawmakers threatening to tank Johnson's budget bills.\n\nLast month, with Spartz on the bubble about whether to support a six-month continuing resolution, the outlet Puck reported that Trump yelled at her over the phone to convince her to vote for the bill. Spartz denied that account. She voted for the measure.\n\nSpartz got kudos from critics on Friday for facing them. Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., sent boxes of donuts to troll one constituent-organized town hall. Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., dodged another.\n\n\"She has more intestinal fortitude than the two of those,\" Jonasen said. \"She's Ukrainian, and Ukrainians are tough.\"\n\nStill, Jonasen said, her often-defiant stance has not resulted in significant breaks with Trump, pointing to her vote on the continuing resolution.\n\n\"We are not seeing the results,\" he said.\n\nAs Republicans resort to carefully vetted tele-town halls, progressives have sensed an opening.

      "text": "GOP Platform Doesn't Mention the Word \"Climate\" Once - Even After Hottest Year on Record\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Trump-led 2024 Republican platform instead calls for an American Iron Dome and the largest deportation operation ever.\n\n2023 was the hottest global year on record; data so far suggests that 2024 will match the trend. This week, more than 130 million Americans are under heat alerts, with numerous cases of death and illness being attributed to the sweltering heat. And amid it all, the 2024 Republican platform does not mention the word \"climate\" once.\n\nThe basic inanity underscores the malign interest driving one of two major American political parties: $300 million of donations to lawmakers from energy and natural resource interest groups (namely, fossil fuel companies) since 1990 - more than double the amount directed to Democrats during that same period.\n\nOn Monday, the Republican National Convention announced its platform, which affirmed that the party is wholly Donald Trump's. \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" the 16-page document's headline read .\n\nThe document paid no mind to environmental protection, never mind the 130 million Americans currently trudging through oppressive heat. But it did call to \"BUILD A GREAT IRON DOME MISSILE DEFENSE SHIELD OVER OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY,\" a reference to Israel's U.S.-funded defense system, and to \"CARRY OUT THE LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\"\n\nThat the Trump-led, Republican agenda doesn't mention \"climate\" is not surprising. In his first term, the former president overturned some 100 environmental regulations, pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement, and weakened the Environmental Protection Agency. In April, Trump reportedly promised oil tycoons that he would reverse some of Joe Biden's climate policies in exchange for a $1 billion campaign contribution. Meanwhile, three of his Supreme Court justices just helped corporate America get even further off the hook from having to respect environmental regulation by overturning the Chevron doctrine , a decades-old legal precedent that directed courts to defer to federal agencies' interpretation of unambiguous statues.\n\n\"Trump can't mention it because every last one of his policies would make it worse. He's essentially running on heating the planet even more,\" Bill McKibben, environmentalist and founder of climate groups Third Act and 350.org, told The Intercept.\n\nIn an exchange with a young climate activist on the day the GOP's platform was released, Republican Sen. Katie Britt - framed by the party as \"America's mom\" before her memorable \"State of the Union\" response speech - embodied her party's dismissive response to the burning of our planet.\n\nHey @SenKatieBritt , you can run away from climate youth activists but can't escape the reality of climate change. Climate change intensifies extreme weather events. In Alabama, the state you represent, the sea level along the coast might rise 18 inches to 4 feet in the next... pic.twitter.com/ISwQ5mGQJ4\n\n\"Oh you, look at how dishonest that was. You asked if you could take a selfie and now you're asking questions,\" Britt said to a voter who asked her about money she receives from the oil and gas lobby. Britt proceeded to ask what the voter's issue was with \"Big Oil.\"\n\n\"I think that the climate crisis is here and getting worse, and you're being funded by the people who are making that happen,\" the activist said.\n\nThe senator from Alabama responded evasively, seeming to cheer on more toxic drilling. \"Listen, we've got to be not only energy independent, but energy dominant. We do it better than anybody.\"\n\nBritt did not respond to questions about her plan to address climate change and environmental protection, or about the $197,037 she has received from the oil and gas industries since joining Congress in 2022.\n\nOriginal reporting.

In 2021, Rep. John Curtis, R-Utah, launched the Conservative Climate Caucus in 2021 to educate Republicans on climate policies and legislation. \"Don't be too tough on us, but watch us. I am totally ready to be judged a year from on how much impact we've had on the debate,\" he said at the time of the group's founding.\n\nAs it turns out, the effort, which has received favorable media coverage since its inception, has not had much tangible impact. The group's members have attacked environmental regulations, undermined or simply refused to vote for bills like the Inflation Reduction Act, and taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fossil fuel industry.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "The Vicious Things Republicans Have Said About Palestinians Since October 7\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\n\"The costs of saying things that are undeniably and horrifically dehumanizing toward Palestinians are so low.\"\n\nMichigan Republican Rep. Tim Walberg recently declared at a town hall that the U.S. \"shouldn't be spending a dime on humanitarian aid,\" in Gaza. Instead, he posed, \"it should be like Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Get it over quick.\"\n\nAfter the shocking statement went viral, his office tried to soften the blow. It provided a full transcript of Walberg's comments to CNN, which reported that Walberg had also said that a similar logic could be applied to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \"Defeat Putin quick. Instead [of] 80% in Ukraine being used for humanitarian purposes, it should be 80-100% to wipe out Russia, if that's what we want to do.\"\n\nWalberg then attempted to walk the comment back in a statement , in which he said he was not suggesting that nukes be used to end either war. Yet there's no denying that he invoked horrifying instances of the U.S. dropping atomic bombs in reference to Gaza - just the latest vicious, warmongering statement by a Republican lawmaker since October 7.\n\nWhile Walberg's comments received a fair amount of critical media coverage, the response from his congressional colleagues was muted - underscoring a stark double standard in the public treatment of those who advocate for Palestinian rights, and those who dehumanize them.\n\nMembers of Congress like Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; and Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., have long been pilloried - and even censured - by their colleagues for speaking out against Israel's brutal treatment of Palestinians, while the media class has spilled boats-worth of ink on bad-faith interpretations of the progressive Democrats' statements. Republicans who belittle, or even encourage, Palestinian suffering have typically generated no such equal, let alone proportional, response.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries did not respond to questions about what party leadership is doing in response to lawmakers' callous comments about Palestinians, especially as the death toll in Gaza continues to rise.\n\nYousef Munayyer, a political analyst and senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC, noted that the cost of misspeaking - or having comments misconstrued - on Israel is unparalleled.\n\n\"The social and political costs of stepping on the taboos of saying anything that could be even possibly misconstrued as antisemitic are so high,\" Munayyer told The Intercept. \"And yet the costs of saying things that are undeniably and horrifically dehumanizing toward Palestinians are so low. I don't know of a double standard as extreme as that on any other issue.\"\n\nRepublicans' hunger for violence began just days after Hamas's attack against Israel on October 7. \"We are in a religious war here, I'm with Israel,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., declared on October 11, in an appearance on Fox News. \"Do whatever the hell you have to do to defend yourself. Level the place.\" (Graham later said that no amount of civilian casualties in Gaza would prompt him to scrutinize Israel's conduct.)\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., echoed Graham's bloodlust on Fox in mid-October. \"As far as I'm concerned, Israel can bounce the rubble in Gaza,\" said the senator who famously called for the Trump administration to sic the military on protesters at the height of the George Floyd uprising. \"Anything that happens in Gaza is the responsibility of Hamas. Hamas killed women and children in Israel last weekend,\" he added. In the months to come, Israel would go on to kill over 25,000 Palestinian women and children.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Republicans have taken glee in fantasizing about Palestinian suffering.\n\nOn October 11, Ohio Rep. Max Miller lambasted Tlaib for planting a Palestinian flag outside her congressional office. He refused to recognize Palestine as a state, calling it \"a territory that's about to probably get eviscerated and go away here shortly, as we're going to turn that into a parking lot.\"\n\nA few days later, Miller's colleague Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., took the unusual step of donning the military garb of a foreign country in the halls of the Congress - wearing an Israel Defense Forces uniform he earned while volunteering for the country's military in 2015. Shortly thereafter, he introduced an amendment that would slow down humanitarian aid to Gaza. \"Any assistance should be slowed down - any assistance,\" Mast said in a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on the bill. \"Because I would challenge anybody in here to point to me, which Palestinian is Hamas, and which one is an innocent civilian? ... It should absolutely be every effort made to slow down any perceived assistance that's going there.\"\n\nMast later tripled down. \"I would encourage the other side to not so lightly throw around the idea of 'innocent Palestinian civilians,' as is frequently said,\" Mast said on the House floor. \"I don't think we would so lightly throw around the term 'innocent Nazi civilians' during World War II.\"\n\nIn late January, when asked about the babies Israeli forces have killed in Gaza, Mast responded coldly: \"These are not innocent Palestinian civilians.\" Confronted with the idea that Israel has destroyed more infrastructure in Gaza than was destroyed in Dresden during World War II, Mast said, \"There's more infrastructure that needs to be destroyed,\" repeated the line, and promised \"there will be more that gets destroyed.\" Finally, he vowed to do everything he could to stop the government from supporting the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. Mast described the creation of UNRWA as \"moronic\"; last month, Congress voted to defund the agency for a full year, even as a widespread famine looms over Gaza.\n\nIn late February, Tennessee Republican Andy Ogles vilely dismissed protesters who took issue with their taxes going toward killing children.\n\n\"I've seen the footage of shredded children's bodies - that's my taxpayer dollars going to bomb those kids,\" a protester said.\n\n\"You know what, so, I think we should kill 'em all,\" Ogles responded. \"If that makes you feel better.\"(His spokesperson later claimed to The Tennessean that he \"was not referring to Palestinians, he was clearly referring to the Hamas terrorist group.\")\n\nThe protesters cited Israeli forces starving women and children, killing over 300 health care workers, and \"sniping Christian women in churches\" as war crimes. Ogles, however, instead responded only to being called an \"AIPAC zombie\" with \"Death to Hamas.\"\n\nPRO-PALESTINE ACTIVIST: \"I've seen ?of shredded children's bodies. That's my tax money bombing those kids.\" @AndyOgles : \"I think we should kill em all, if that makes you feel better.\" ACTIVIST: \"Do you even have a heart?\" OGLES: \"Death to Hamas.\" A disturbing Ogles exchange. pic.twitter.com/Dpnjqzw43n\n\nIn early March, a flustered Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, also of Tennessee, yelled at a Palestinian American protester from Gaza, who has now lost over 100 family members in Israel's war.\n\n\"They are not guilty of genocide,\" the Republican said of Israel, which the world's highest court and a U.S. district court have both said is plausibly committing genocide in Gaza. \"You can tell the Palestinians - I will never support them!\"\n\n\"I am a Palestinian myself,\" a protester responded.\n\n\"Then I will tell you, I will never support you,\" Fleischmann screamed back. \"I will tell you to your face: Goodbye to Palestine!\"\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nAfter months of this behavior from Republicans, not one has been censured by their colleagues, not one has been savaged by the media for days on end, not one been cast as a poster child of the virulent anti-Palestinian racism flowing through American institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, last year, Jayapal was pilloried by Republicans and thrown under the bus by fellow Democrats for suggesting that Israel - which has for decades committed human rights abuses, engaged in land dispossession and home demolition, and maintained separate systems of law and a militarized police state against Palestinians - is a \" racist state .\"\n\nJayapal walked back her comments after the pile-on, singling out Benjamin Netanyahu's government for its racist practices instead. Still, Ogles and his colleagues Randy Weber and Jeff Duncan filed a resolution seeking to censure Jayapal for what they said was antisemitism, though the resolution did not name a single instance of Jayapal saying anything negative about Jewish people.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe attacks were familiar. Tlaib - the only Palestinian member of Congress - was attacked last year for supporting an event raising awareness about the Nakba, the series of events beginning in 1948 that led to the mass displacement of Palestinians. The smears massively escalated as she was censured - with the help of 22 Democrats - in November, after she criticized the Israeli government and called for Palestinian liberation.\n\nOmar, likewise, has been subject to constant scrutiny by her own party for her criticism of Israel , accused of antisemitism for allegedly singling Israel out - even though she has been a consistent critic of other human rights-violating governments, from Saudi Arabia and China to El Salvador and Russia. Those attacks paved the way for Republicans to boot her from the Foreign Affairs Committee last February, after they retook control of the House.\n\n\"Democrats too often are willing to go along with what are obviously bad-faith smears against other Democrats, whereas Republicans simply don't give a shit. And that creates this situation where you can easily bait Democrats into this issue repeatedly,\" Munayyer said. \"That's a choice that Democrats are making, and they don't have to make that choice.\"\n\nThat's not to mention the Democrats who have made anti-Palestinian remarks themselves, from Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Ill., accusing a Palestinian American of \"trying to kill every Jew,\" to Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., discounting the death toll of children killed in Gaza. Beyond Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman's continued insistence on supporting Israel's mass civilian killing campaign unconditionally, he has repeatedly dismissed and mocked protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza or mobilizing voters against Biden's Gaza policy.\n\nLara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, said that the question of acceptable language on Israel and Palestine often comes down to whether the orator is supportive of Israel or not: \"It's never really about what any of them say.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Centrist Democratic PAC's Sole Funder Is a Republican Megadonor\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Moderate PAC, created to go after progressive primary challengers, received all its money from one source: Republican megadonor Jeffrey Yass.\n\nA cadre of moderate Democrats and Republicans are joining together to revamp a political action committee to fight against progressive primary challengers to establishment Democrats.\n\nWith President Joe Biden's former campaign manager as the PAC's only consultant and a defense contractor executive as its treasurer, the Moderate PAC - not to be confused with the older Moderate Democrats PAC - stands to be an exemplar of the Democratic Party's corporate-friendly, centrist wing. Its financial heft, though, comes from the other side of the aisle: So far, Republican megadonor Jeff Yass, the richest man in Pennsylvania, is virtually the only one putting money into the group.\n\n\"The corporate-backed establishment will stop at nothing to prevent more bartenders, nurses, principals, community organizers, and regular people from entering the Democratic Party in Congress,\" Justice Democrats Executive Director Alexandra Rojas said in a statement to The Intercept. \"They would rather buy elections than let working-class progressives even run. They will do everything in their power to make themselves richer at the expense of robbing poor and working-class Americans.\"\n\nAxios reported last week that the PAC planned to raise $20 million to fight off Democratic primary challengers in 2024 and \"scare off\" progressive groups like Justice Democrats that have backed several successful primary challengers and helped create a growing squad of progressive lawmakers in Congress. The article did not mention the group's ties to the Biden campaign and the defense industry, nor the Republican funder.\n\nAs the number of progressives in Congress has continued to grow since 2018, the revamped PAC is one of several organizations launched in recent years to target progressive Democratic primary challengers and protect centrist incumbents. (The Moderate PAC did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nTy Strong, the Moderate PAC president and founder, worked for a decade as a financial and business management analyst at Booz Allen Hamilton before joining a smaller financial firm in Pennsylvania in 2020 that closed abruptly the following year. He joined the Moderate PAC in October 2021. The committee's treasurer, Marysue Strong, is chief financial officer at ProSync Technology Group, a defense contractor that provides IT services to the federal government. (Ty Strong did not respond to questions about his political experience or whether he and Marysue are related, though public records suggest that they are.)\n\nIn an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal last January, Ty Strong criticized what he called a \"Democratic circular firing squad\" and \"progressive purity tests\" that have threatened the political careers of centrist Democrats like Sens. Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona. If Democrats in purple states can't find a way to \"pivot back to the center and avoid death by circular progressive firing squad,\" Strong wrote, \"get ready for Republican control of both houses of Congress in 2023.\" Less than a year later, Sinema announced that she was leaving the Democratic Party to become an independent.\n\nOriginal reporting.

Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe Moderate PAC has raised just over $1 million since last year, all from a single donor: Yass.\n\nYass, co-founder and managing director of a Philadelphia-based investment firm, gave the PAC $1 million in July. (The Democratic leadership's house campaign arm, House Majority PAC, gave the Moderate PAC results from a poll in September 2022, which is recorded in disclosures, though no money changed hands.)\n\nA vice chair at the Cato Institute, Yass has come under fire for using creative money-moving structures to avoid some $1 billion in taxes, according to ProPublica . Yass, most recently registered as a libertarian, occasionally gives to centrist local and national Democrats, but the overwhelming balance of his political contributions go to GOP candidates.\n\nWhile Yass has recently expanded his focus to national politics and spent $47 million backing Republicans in federal elections last year, he has been most politically active in his home state of Pennsylvania. He backed Republican candidates up and down the ballot during last year's midterm elections in the Keystone State.\n\nYass's Commonwealth Foundation , a group based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, advocates to take the state's public policy \"back to its roots.\" The group has drawn criticism for pushing policies that Yass's critics say help him continue to accumulate wealth while avoiding taxes, like cutting funding for schools and public services. In addition to funding Republicans, Yass has funded state-level Democrats who align with his conservative objectives: He put money into the campaigns of Democratic officials in Pennsylvania who played a key role in the charge last year to try to impeach progressive Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner.\n\nAs Yass has expanded his focus beyond Pennsylvania politics toward the national stage, his critics raised the alarm and warned both parties not to accept his money.\n\n\"Yass is a threat to democracy in Pennsylvania,\" six organizers wrote in an op-ed last week titled \"A deep-pocketed donor from Pa. is moving onto the national stage. That's a problem.\"\n\nYass has amassed his wealth in part by successfully avoiding paying taxes and used his financial influence to push candidates and policies for his own benefit, they wrote. \"We need to call Yass' donations what they are: money from a billionaire seeking to buy power,\" the organizers wrote. \"No one in public office should take money from billionaire Jeffrey Yass - Democrat or Republican.\"\n\nCorrection: January 25, 2023, 8:00 p.m. ET This story has been updated to reflect that, in 2023, Arizona Sen.

As he accepted the nomination, the crowd erupted in chants of \"Trump, Trump, Trump!\" This week on Deconstructed, Ryan Grim speaks to Emily Jashinsky, his co-host on \"Counter Points,\" on Thursday afternoon, before Trump's acceptance speech. Jashinsky joins from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They discuss Trump's vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance; the \"New Right\" taking hold of the Republican Party; and what the New Right's vision is for the country, from tariffs to immigration, and LGBTQ+ rights, foreign policy, and education policy.\n\nTranscript\n\nRyan Grim: I'm Ryan Grim. Welcome back to Deconstructed.\n\nFirst thing: a programming note. As you guys may have heard, I am no longer with The Intercept, but I'm still obviously hosting Deconstructed, which is made possible in part by a grant from The Intercept. So, thank you to them for that.\n\nI am now over with Jeremy Scahill at the news organization that we founded called Drop Site News. Check it out: dropsitenews.com.\n\nOn today's program, I'm joined by my Counterpoints cohost, Emily Jashinsky, who is now a correspondent over at UnHerd. Emily is joining us from Milwaukee, where she's been covering the Republican National Convention.\n\nEmily, thanks so much for joining me here on Deconstructed.\n\nEmily Jashinsky: I'm excited to be here. I'm a fan and a listener of the podcast myself. So, thanks for having me, Ryan.\n\nRG: Amazing, thank you for that.\n\nSo, for people who don't watch the show and don't know the shtick of it, it's that one of the hosts is left wing, one of the hosts is right wing. And we debate and argue, every now and then but, in general, we kind of each give our perspectives on a particular Issue of the day, and then we move on to the next news item, without doing the \"Crossfire\" choke-each-other style.\n\nAnd the reason I wanted to bring Emily on today was for her take on not just how the RNC is unfolding, but also to educate us about this new populist right. Which I think a lot of people in the progressive space have not invested much energy trying to understand because, for a very long time, there's been a sense that it's mostly fake, and why bother studying something if it's just some propaganda aimed at gullible workers, and not actually a kind of structural change going on with it inside the Republican Party.\n\nI don't agree with that, I think it does represent something serious going on. I think it's part of the political and economic realignment that we've talked about on this show over the last many years at this point. And so, I think it is actually worth understanding, and nobody better to talk about it than Emily, who's been kind of a part of that whatever you want to call it - movement, tendency, element - of the party for this long. To have J.D. Vance now elevated to vice president, to me, really puts an exclamation mark on the growth of that faction within the Republican Party.\n\nSo, first of all, Emily, what would you call it? What is the name that people who are of the J.D. Vance variety prefer to call themselves? Or are there multiple names, and we could pick from a couple?\n\nEJ: Well, as we're recording this, there was a new name, a powerful suggestion for a new name actually floated this morning by Sohrab Ahmari, who has been at the center of the discourse over what the new right is, [and/or] if there needs to be a new right, ever since he wrote a viral article against David French, who was, at the time, a National Review columnist, and has since been elevated to New York Times columnist. And Sohrab said, \"It's not the new right; it's the new center.\"\n\nAnd I find that very interesting, because the new right, I think, comes with a lot of cultural baggage; and I say that as somebody who's probably part of the cultural baggage, who is staunchly antiabortion, and has deeply held conservative religious beliefs. And I think New Right has come with that. And J.D. Vance is a convert to Catholicism, like a lot of intellectuals in the right wing space are. He's a student of René Girard, who is Peter Thiel's favorite philosopher, and is big in those venture capitalist Silicon Valley circles.\n\nSo, what we saw from J.D. Vance at the convention, I think Sohrab accurately describes as a new center, as opposed to a new right, because when you attach Trump to the new right, I think you lose some of the cultural baggage. And the new right that just convened at the National Conservatism Conference a week before the Republican National Convention kicked off should consider that, I think. And I also think the left should consider that, because all of this undermining of Project 2025 and J.D. Vance - I shouldn't say undermining, I should say fearmongering about it - is missing. That there are some genuinely interesting shifts on labor and on trade in these spaces. But perhaps it's incumbent on Republicans and new right movement people to figure out how to deal with that cultural baggage.\n\nRG: From a marketing perspective, trying to claim the center is actually quite smart. I mean, most people out there who are not politics junkies tend to think of themselves as in the center. Whether they are or not, they kind of think, well, my views are the sensible ones. That's why they hold those views, because they believe they are sensible. And the directions of left and right almost by their nature are self-marginalizing. So, that that is kind of an interesting attempt to gather people around this new center idea.\n\nBut what is the new center? What would you say are the things that characterize it, and how does it rank its hierarchy of issues that it cares about?\n\nEJ: That reminds me; one thing I like about what we get to do, Ryan, is that, right before I started taping with you, I was interviewing Kevin Roberts, who is the president of the Heritage Foundation, a friend of J.D. Vance's, asking him about Project 2025. And I asked him about Sohrab Amari referring to the new center instead of the new right, and he said, basically, I don't like labels. Kevin Roberts is somebody who has spoken at NatCon and said, I'm not inviting you into the conservative movement, I'm here as the conservative movement to tell you, you are the conservative movement.\n\nI think he and J.D. Vance - now that J.D. Vance is kind of firmly ensconced in Trump world - would describe it mostly in terms of populist economics, but would also probably bring into it the parents' right kind of movement that sprung up after COVID. You know, you should have the right to know what's being taught in classrooms. They probably wouldn't frame it in the terms of, like - You hear a lot about pornography, and you hear a lot about LGBT issues. They would probably say parental rights. Glenn Youngkin is being feted here at the RNC, everyone's very excited about that.\n\nSo, I think that's how they would attach cultural issues to the suite of economic issues. For example, the 10 percent tariff - Or, I'm sorry, the hundred percent tariff, right? What's Trump on now? I was just reading his interview with Bloomberg. But they would talk about protectionism, vis-à-vis China, they would talk about industrial policy when it comes to chips manufacturing, when it comes to the defense industry. They would talk about ending forever wars; foreign policy is a huge component of the new right. There are basically no supporters of the Iraq war left anywhere. Even in the Republican Party, I went back and looked at the speeches from the 2004 Republican convention just last night. It was all about the Iraq war.\n\nRG: Oh, that whole thing was organized around \"stay the course.\" That was Bush's entire argument, stay the course.\n\nSo, where did the cultural issues that Republicans were rising on the last 10-20 years fit in? Whether it's trans issues, briefly you had this little kind of reactionary move against marriage equality. Did those take something of a backseat there, despite the fact that Vance himself is a Catholic convert who has some pretty strong personal views on abortion? Where do they fit in? Is it more, is it more of an economic trade and foreign policy type of tendency, or is it married to the cultural stuff? How do we think about that?\n\nDo they want to put it in the backseat? Is it leading? Like, what is the positioning there?\n\nEJ: I think that is the question that bubbled to the surface in the proverbial smoke-filled backrooms this week, when Donald Trump just went for it, went full-send and picked J.D. Vance as his running mate. And Vance wasn't someone who was at the top of the list; a lot of people expected Tim Scott or Doug Burgum, Marco Rubio was on the short list.\n\nBut when he went with J.D. Vance, I think right now, as Trump is trying to figure out post-assassination attempt how to be a unifier - we've heard the word \"unity\" all the time at the RNC- what does that look like? Is that new center or new right? And that's why abortion has basically been absent from this RNC. The trans issue has been front and center at the RNC, because Republicans feel like that is a real winning issue now, but you haven't heard a lot about pornography in schools, you haven't heard a lot about marriage, you haven't heard a lot about some of those red meat issues that, even as they fell out of fashion with the broader public, were still very much in vogue with the Republican party. The other huge component we're leaving out is immigration. That's big.\n\nAnd so, right now, I think, as we are speaking, people in the Republican party and the Trump circles are trying to figure out how to sell J.D. Vance's populism - and Trump's populism, honestly - as a unifying centrist message. And, obviously, there are some pretty clear ways to do that, there's a lot of consensus on immigration, but being directionally opposed to the Biden immigration policy does not make you in favor of J.D. Vance's immigration policy as it has been articulated, or Trump's in the past.\n\nSo that, I think, is literally in the process. The sausage is being made right now, as we're speaking.\n\nRG: And how do unions fit into this? Because my read of how this unfolded is, in the beginning, you had the new right. Pro-worker, but with a lot of almost anti-union elements. And they would be anti-union and say that it was because the right to work; pro worker, but anti-union? It feels like over time they are now becoming a little bit more explicitly pro-union.\n\nAnd you had Sean O'Brien showing up at the RNC this week. How was he received? And what is the posture of this new right towards organized labor now?\n\nEJ: He was received uncontroversially, which is fascinating. You've been covering this longer than I have, you remember the Tea Party years, the scourge of big labor union bosses telling you, the working man, what to do. That was utterly unsympathetic to anybody that might have needed the support of big labor or organized labor, period, and intentionally so. It was a public relations message that we are against the Democratic-aligned big labor bosses, union bosses. It's just a complete 180.\n\nAnd what's been on my mind all week as I'm watching Sean O'Brien get applause here railing against corporations is: what does this look like in 2028? What does this look like at the RNC in 2032?\n\nAnd J.D. Vance in his speech last night - I don't know if you caught this line - he said something like, we stand with workers, pro-union or anti-union, whether they're in a union or not. And that was interesting to me, because I don't think you would have heard J.D. Vance say that a month or two ago. I think that was something that, when Trump basically gave Rupert Murdoch the finger by not going with Doug Burgum - and not just Rupert Murdoch, a lot of corporate people wanted him to pick Doug Burgum - maybe it was like a conciliatory gesture. Maybe when J.D. Vance said that this is a party of, quote, \"big tent,\" which is a word that new right people detest.\n\nRG: Hmm. Why is that?\n\nEJ: Because it signifies to them that 2012 Republican autopsy that Reince Priebus and others put together that said, we need to moderate on immigration, we need to moderate on LGBT issues. And that was four years before Trump came along [who] everyone said proved that totally wrong, at least in the short term. You know, he didn't win the popular vote, he won the electoral college, and then he lost both in 2020, so I don't know how legitimate that argument is, but the new right absolutely hates it.\n\nAnd so, for J.D. Vance to drop that so casually in the speech, and make a gesture towards union workers and non-union workers, it just seems to me, like- And I've heard some concern among people in these circles, people who know J.D. Vance, that the Trump team will kind of coopt him directionally towards wherever Trump wants him to be, and will block out any new right people that want to be in those circles, making decisions and helping him.\n\nRG: Now, before J.D. Vance was in the Senate - because he was elected in 2022, if I'm remembering correctly - the American Rescue Plan was passed in 2021, and that included, basically, a bailout for the Teamsters. It's complicated, but basically 300,000 Teamsters retirees had their pensions saved by the American Rescue Plan. And every Republican voted against it and every Democrat voted for it, which has Democrats even angrier that Sean O'Brien would then, the next election, show up at the Republican convention.\n\nBut that's why a lot of Democrats still hope that the Teamsters will actually in the end endorse, because 300,000 of their members are deeply grateful for that bailout, which Republicans at the time were calling, big labor bailout.\n\nHow angry would Trump be, how angry would the J.D. Vance wing be if Teamsters in the end do endorse Democrats? So, in other words, how comfy is this relationship at this point?\n\nEJ: This is such a better question for you but, from my perspective at least, this week felt like a test run. Let's see how Sean O'Brien is received at the RNC, let's see how J.D. Vance is received overall as the nominee. And Trump is all about relationships. If you come to the RNC physically and speak, that means you probably also schmoozed a little bit with Trump, and the Trump insiders, and Trump world. So, if Sean O'Brien and the Teamsters were to then turn around and endorse the Democrats, because maybe Biden's not on the ballot by the time that happens, I think Trump would be furious. I think it would inspire a flurry of True Social posts about \"dopey Sean O'Brien,\" or \"bald Sean,\" or whatever he ends up calling him.\n\nAnd that's where this whole relationship, this whole, quote, \"realignment\", I really feel could blow up. And then you watch where J.D. Vance goes from there if his boss is super anti-union. I would think J.D. Vance would still be making overtures - whether it's publicly or privately - to organized labor, because he's smart enough to know politically that it's been beneficial for him to make those overtures to regular workers. And so, he would want to continue doing that.\n\nHe's a smart guy, he's politically really smart. A lot of those new right candidates lost their races when they ran for House and Senate. He won. Blake Masters lost. Blake Masters will probably win a congressional seat, but he lost his Senate race, and J.D. Vance won.\n\nSo, I just think  there's so many early conclusions. That the Republican Party is now the party of the working class, and the Republican Party is now the party of organized labor. It's like, this could blow up. With a bad relationship with Trump, he could suddenly turn on big labor, and everyone else is just waiting to take their cues from him\n\nRG: And Trump still has enormous number of oligarchs in his ear. Trump is susceptible to pressure, whoever talked to him last, what have you. So much depends on who Trump picks as chief of staff. In a Trump presidency - let's assume, for the sake of this question, that he wins - so much depends on who he picks as chief of staff, and how he staffs up and approaches things in the beginning.\n\nWhat's your sense of what the Trump circle is now? And where on the base scale or on the J.D. Vance scale his inner circle is? How solidified is it, how fluid is it? Like, what's your read of that world, that has now had eight or nine years to kind of develop an ecosystem that was nascent when it first shocked everybody, including himself, by winning?\n\nEJ: I mean, there was nothing, and you remember this. There was a Heritage Foundation that was raking in money from big tech alongside the American Enterprise Institute, alongside this suite of Koch-Brothers-funded thinktanks that were staunchly anti-labor, and had been the backbone of the Tea Party movement. So, there really was absolutely nothing.\n\nAnd now, what's sprung up are groups like American Compass and a couple of others. But what's interesting about those groups - and this is what's fascinating about Trump in general - is that it's a mix, ideologically, because the primary litmus test ideologically is whether you're on board with Donald Trump. And that sounds like a line that is kind of tired, like \"elite media spaces,\" but there's actually some truth to it.\n\nLike, they're doing this vetting process for personnel in a potential Trump administration, and their litmus test is loyalty to Donald Trump himself. Nobody's looking for what maybe you said about policy five years ago. You could be Anthony Scaramucci, you could be - Let's take our favorite example: Stephanie Ruhle. If you had been nice to Donald Trump and said good things about him, you could have those politics. You can be Art Laffer or Larry Kudlow and have Donald Trump's ear in the same way that J.D. Vance does, in the same way that people in those circles - Marco Rubio. You know, it's just really a mix, because the primary litmus test is loyalty to Donald Trump.\n\nNow, people who have loyalty to Donald Trump tend to be those people that are also on board with the new right policy agenda. You know, Peter Navarro, Bob Lighthizer, people who are sort of, quote, \"based on trade,\" protectionist on trade. Obviously, you're not going to see John Bolton in another Trump administration, but you might see Mike Pompeo, who is here at the RNC this week, talking about how Trump will ultimately control J.D. Vance; I think is a quote, I'm paraphrasing a quote he gave to RealClearPolitics. But it's just about loyalty to Trump.\n\nAnd Trump is floating, what, Jamie Dimon as his treasury secretary? It's about him. And so, that tends to be more new right than not but, also, a lot of the really powerful people in his ear - to your point, Ryan - are oligarchs, or oligarch-adjacent.\n\nRG: What do these new right people think about Democrats? I saw this kind of funny quote from J.D. Vance recently where he said, \"The only part of the Democratic coalition I have any patience for is the Bernie bros,\" [or] something along those lines.\n\nWhy is that? How do they view the Democrats or the progressive coalition broadly?\n\nEJ: There's been an interesting rehabilitation of Chomsky.\n\nRG: Like, on the right in general?\n\nEJ: Yeah, and writers in that space. And even - You know Glenn Greenwald well. Glenn is very popular, and I'm sure he lost some people and subscribers and stuff when the Israel issue came to a head, and I'm sure other people can speak to that as well. But he's saying things that are going over very well with a lot of people on the right, because they found, in the Bernie bros, kindred spirits, when it comes to how elites are screwing everyday Americans.\n\nAnd there's also something, I think, psychological, and I don't know if you've seen this around Washington, but the right has always felt ostracized from circles of culture; so, art circles, entertainment circles, that kind of world. And anytime they get attention from, say, a Russell Brand, psychologically, there's something about being included, and suddenly feeling like you're at the cool kids' table when you hang out in those spaces. That's also weirdly powerful. I don't know if that makes sense, but it's there.\n\nBernie had a lot of support from Hollywood, actually - so did Hillary, obviously - but Bernie's kind of cool, and there's something about being on the left that's generally been seen by our culture as being cool. There's no, like, left-wing Patrick Bateman character. It's, like, cool, but not really.\n\nRG: Yes. Whenever you see the acts at the RNC versus the acts at the DNC, the Spotify plays are going to be orders of magnitude different, for sure.\n\nEJ: Yeah. Lee Greenwood is here. So.\n\nRG: Yes, I'm sure Kid Rock is holding it down.\n\nEJ: There's a rumor that Jason Aldean is coming, and that's someone who's actually a pretty big superstar.\n\nRG: Yeah, there you go.\n\nEJ: But, other than that, yeah. No.\n\nRG: Doing better.\n\nSo, you also did a couple of interviews - I mean, you've been doing endless interviews, but you sent us a couple. So, let's roll a few of these. You sent us three folks at the RNC that you spoke to, representative of different views. Let's play these, then I want to get your assessment of them.\n\nEmily Jashinsky: All right. So, what's it like here so far?\n\nRNC Attendee 1: The energy down here is just amazing. It's so awesome to be a part of this event.\n\nEmily Jashinsky: Some reporting is that not everyone is excited about the J.D. Vance pick, but you feel good about it.\n\nRNC Attendee 2: I do. I think J.D. represents the future of the party, and Trump has great policies that represent the working man, and J.D. Vance is going to continue those, and help to put those into place once Donald Trump wins the White House.\n\nEmily Jashinsky: What are you hoping to hear from J.D. Vance?\n\nRNC Attendee 3: I'm hoping that he talks a lot about families, and getting back to being able to support a family off of one income. Encouraging people to protect their kids. Talking about what this next administration and their legacy is going to be when it comes to fighting it back against this corrupted, progressive, woke culture that we find ourselves in. America is not a great place to raise children, and I would know; I have seven kids myself, right?\n\nRG: So, Emily, a lot of upbeat-ness, it feels like? Like, people are feeling pretty good Wednesday night at the RNC, and maybe some of the other nights as well. I'm trying to think. The crowd seemed playful, in a way. I had never seen Republicans before - Like, Republicans are not known for their senses of humor, and they're chanting kind of funny stuff, like \"J.D.'s mom, J.D.'s mom.\"\n\nI think at one point J.D. Vance said that they were a great crowd, and they started chanting, \"Yes, we are,\" which is kind of cute and funny. I'm like, all right, that's cringe, a little bit, but it's authentic. It's like there's something real about it that is different than the kind of staged - It's like a playfulness that you wouldn't expect.\n\nSo, where is this happiness coming from? Is it the situation they find themselves in, where they're like, man, if we can just get Joe Biden to hold on to this nomination and get our man through without getting shot it's in the bag? What's your sense of where the unusual lightness is coming from?\n\nEJ: Well, I think it's exactly what you just said. There's so much confidence after Trump survived an assassination attempt, got up off the stage, raised his fist, implored them to fight, fight, fight, and was back at it the next day. That has been Galvanizing.\n\nAnd so, I think he has raised his status to mythical. And it may have already been there, but it's on another level. Like, there's levels of mythical gods; he's got to be at the highest. I don't know how it can get much higher than that at this point.\n\nAnd the split screen with Democrats panicking over Joe Biden is just so powerful, you know? And they're making all of their arguments against Biden, by the way. Tim Carney described that as like a ghost, or they're arguing against a ghost all week? Because pretty soon, maybe by the time this airs, Joe Biden will be off the ticket. But, yeah. I think it's that.\n\nRG: That has me worried in some ways, and I think there's a chance by the time we post this episode - it's now Thursday afternoon - that he might be off the ticket. You know, they're floating that he might be off by this weekend. I don't think that Trump is as much of a lock as he seems to think he is. The J.D. Vance pick suggested some extreme confidence, like you said, the body language and the joy in Milwaukee suggests they're spiking the football.\n\nBut there's this Eagles player DeSean Jackson. People can go Google \"DeSean Jackson fumble.\" He did this in college, and then he did it again as a pro. About to score a touchdown, clear in front of everybody, he spiked it at the two-yard line, but you have to go all the way into the end zone. Now, there was video, and it was fair. It's like, DeSean, you didn't cross the goal line, so you lose the ball, and the other team recovered it. It won't be that clean if Democrats beat Republicans on election day.\n\nAnd so, I'm curious, from your perspective, imagine a world in which Democrats do come back from this, and do legitimately beat Republicans on election day, how will the Republican base metabolize that? If 2020 broke their brains, and there wasn't actually evidence of ballots in the rivers in Pennsylvania swinging the election or whatever. This time, I feel like they will just not be able to handle that. Or am I not giving them enough credit?\n\nWhat happens if Democrats come back and win? Is the country just going to lose its mind?\n\nEJ: While you're on the topic, I heard a guy come up and introduce himself to Mike Lindell, of My Pillow fame, and Mike Lindell asked him where he's from, and he said he was from Venezuela, but Mike Lindell heard \"Pennsylvania.\" And when it was clarified that he was from Venezuela, Mike Lindell immediately launched into, well, you guys had the experience with the voting machines first, so you must really know.\n\nSo, there's still those hangers-on.\n\nRG: For our lawyers: Mike Lindell's claim is false, etc., etc., etc. Go ahead.\n\nEJ: Yes. Yes. But, actually, the point that you just made with the disclaimer, I think if Democrats pull this off, which I still think is a really good chance - our cohost Krystal Ball made this point when we were talking recently - that the polls haven't moved all that much since the assassination attempt. Like they've been bad for Biden after the debate, they've been catastrophic for Biden after the debate, but when you replace him with someone else, it's not an abject disaster. It's nothing that Democrats can't bounce back from, if you suddenly see the media rehabilitating Kamala Harris reputation. Because there are now fully on the Dem Flight 93 existential election bandwagon with a lot of the donors, which is why they're comfortable, I think, going after Biden post-debate.\n\nSo, I think the way Republicans would react to it is potentially with civil unrest. I keep feeling like we're sleepwalking into an extended period of civil unrest. It might not look like one January 6, but it might look like a bunch of smaller January 6ths at state court houses. There's just no faith in the integrity of elections anymore, and that's really, really, really dangerous. It's something we took for granted. It's a seed that was planted with the left in 2000. So, it is bipartisan.\n\nI'm sure Ryan, that you still talk to people on the left - like, on the left-left - people who listen to this podcast who, after 2000, just felt as though these elections were being decided by oligarchs, essentially. And when you start to have a chunk of people on a bipartisan basis thinking those things, if Donald Trump loses, I don't see the right metabolizing it. Like, the people on January 6 were everyday Americans, normal Americans - I talked to a lot of them there. They were just there because they really didn't have any faith, sincerely. So, I don't see how you bounce back from that super-easily if Trump loses.\n\nRG: The one saving grace for Democrats might be - I'm curious for your take on this - that my sense on the right is that there's so much paranoia about the feds that they're pretty much incapable of organizing mass rallies of any substantial number of people, because anybody who organizes it immediately gets accused of being a fed and setting a trap for people.\n\nAnd I think the prison sentences - whatever you want to say about them - that were doled out had a significant deterrent effect, because now people understand, like, oh, I could actually do years in prison if things go south at this demonstration that I'm going to. This is not a value judgment at all, just a statement of fact.\n\nAm I right that the ability of the right to organize in the streets in the way that they so effectively did on January 6 and previous to that, bringing numbers of people out in the streets that were making the left quite jealous, has that been kind of stripped naked by the paranoia that is shot through? And the paranoia doesn't have to be necessarily unfounded. Like, there are a bunch of FBI people and others.\n\nEJ: I was going to say, I agree and I disagree. I agree in the sense that it is genuinely different because there were- I mean, to your point, there turned out to be a whole lot of feds in groups like the Proud Boys, and the Oath Keepers, and the Gretchen Whitmer plot, which, I mean, that actually is a real thing that happened.\n\nAnd so, on the one hand, I think those groups in particular, some of the actual organized fringe groups - and Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were absolutely still fringe on the right, even if Marjorie Taylor Greene is not, those groups really are still relegated to the fringe - I think those groups are absolutely hampered in their ability to organize. Having covered January 6, I think it still would have happened without any organization on the behalf of those people, because what I saw was just unadulterated rage from normal people. I saw school moms jumping over barricades without being goaded into it. In fact, I saw them goading other people into it. You know, PTA moms, basically. And so, on the one hand, yes. I think the organized coalitions actually have really been hampered in their ability to organize.\n\nOn the other hand, I think that there's such personal affection and loyalty to Donald Trump with so many average Americans that there's still significant risk of things like that happening. Because they would be spontaneous, honestly.\n\nRG: So, last thing then. A lot of progressives are deeply concerned that - and you'll hear [it] from Democrats - if Trump wins in 2024, that's the last election. What is the most serious thing that, from your perspective, Republicans will try to do to lock in power, in ways that they failed to do in 2020? Like, what lessons did they learn, and what are they going to do differently this time? And what should progressives be scared about? And what do you think is overblown that they shouldn't be scared about?\n\nAnd, obviously, nobody's going to believe you because, you know, you're in there. But I'm curious for your sense of that, where the real threats are and what the completely overblown ones are.\n\nEJ: Actually, I've never had that question posed that way. Like, I've never thought of it myself. What is something that would, A, just personally be most terrifying about a potential Trump return.\n\nMy answer to that would be, first of all, his personal beefs know no bounds, and I think that's always frightening. Because it ends up going into foreign policy. We've had the madman theory tested successfully in the United States, at least arguably, with foreign policies of respective madmen who have had some successes. You know, we haven't gotten into nuclear war yet, but we're not even a century into that experiment. So, that's one thing that personally has always bothered me a lot about Donald Trump, and I think I speak on behalf of millions of people when I say that.\n\nBut in terms of an actual threat to the progressive movement, the gutting of the administrative state will happen immediately. It may have court battles, but it will happen right away. Trump told, I think, Bret Baier that he wouldn't be a dictator, except for on, quote, \"Day one.\"\n\nRG: Yeah. And you hear that a lot. What do you think he meant by that?\n\nEJ: He meant firing of a vast swath of the administrative state. Like, thousands of people, tens of thousands of people. And the mounting consensus in new right circles that actually are working to staff his administration at places like the Heritage Foundation, and American Moment, and those groups, is that the single impediment to any other policy goal is personnel. And so, you can't do anything else without Schedule F, and however else it's supplemented. I think Stephen Miller and Russ Vogt have ideas for that, the Center for Renewing America and America First Legal. But that is the thing.\n\nIf you go to Conservative Partnership Institute, you talk to those people, it is the administrative state. The sense is, you can't do anything else until - you can't do foreign policy, let alone immigration policy, let alone anything else - unless you take care of the vast administrative state. Otherwise, all of your policy preferences will be undermined by the bureaucrats who slow-walk them. And so, I think that is the top day-one priority, and they won't even be able to work on other things, is how they see it, until that is accomplished.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's tens of thousands of jobs and decades of regulatory muscle memory on the line.\n\nRG: Yeah.

      "text": "Proton Mail Says It's \"Politically Neutral\" While Praising Republican Party\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe \"privacy-first\" company surprised its user base when CEO Andy Yen lauded Trump on social media.\n\nProton, the company behind the eponymous email provider Proton Mail, has won itself a loyal fanbase of dissidents, investigative journalists, and others skeptical of the prying eyes of government or Big Tech. Headquartered in Switzerland, the service describes itself as \"a neutral and safe haven for your personal data, committed to defending your freedom.\"\n\nSo it came as a surprise last month when Proton CEO Andy Yen praised the Republican Party in a post on X , declaring that \"10 years ago, Republicans were the party of big business and Dems stood for the little guys, but today the tables have completely turned.\" When the tweet went viral , Proton's official Reddit account posted a now-deleted comment stating that \"Until corporate Dems are thrown out, the reality is that Republicans remain more likely to tackle Big Tech abuses.\"\n\nWithin hours, Proton deleted its response across social media accounts, stating that the post - which started with the words \"Here is our official response\" - was in fact \"removed because it was not actually an official statement.\" The reply went on to say: \"Our policy is that official accounts cannot be used to express personal political opinions. If it happens by mistake, we correct it as soon as we notice it.\"\n\nYen further claimed that the post had been an \"internal miscommunication,\" later also writing that Proton is \"politically neutral.\"\n\nHe followed it up with a longer statement explaining that \"while we may share facts and analysis, our policy going forward will be to share no opinions of a political nature. The line between facts, analysis, and opinions can be blurry at times, but we will seek to better clarify this over time through your feedback and input.\" Yen didn't specifically address whether the deleted post had constituted opinion or analysis.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, Proton reiterated the claim that it is a \"politically neutral organization,\" then went on to state that \"regardless of one's views about the wider Republication platform, if you agree that action is needed on antitrust then the appointment of Gail Slater is a positive thing,\" referring to President Donald Trump's choice to head the Justice Department's antitrust division. Proton further stated that \"Big Tech CEOs are tripping over themselves to kiss the ring precisely because Trump represents an unprecedented challenge to their monopolistic dominance.\"\n\nYen has repeatedly described Proton as being a \" privacy-first \" company, and its homepage touts that \"With Proton, your data belongs to you, not tech companies, governments, or hackers.\" However, Proton has in the past revealed user information to authorities. For instance, Proton previously handed over an IP address at the request of French authorities made via Europol to Swiss police. Yen wrote a Twitter post at the time, stating, \"Proton must comply with Swiss law. As soon as a crime is committed, privacy protections can be suspended and we're required by Swiss law to answer requests from Swiss authorities.\"\n\nProton's information for law enforcement page states that it requires a copy of a \"police report or court order,\" albeit either a foreign or domestic one. For its part, Proton told The Intercept that \"Proton does not comply with US subpoenas, it doesn't matter if it's Biden or Trump in power.\"\n\nWhile Proton states that it \"cannot read any of your messages or hand them over to third parties,\" the same doesn't apply to email subjects; sender or recipient names and email addresses; the time a message was sent; or other information in the \"header\" section of email messages. Proton explicitly states that \"if served with a valid Swiss court order, we do have the ability to turn over the subjects of your messages.\"\n\nUnder Trump's previous term, the Department of Justice sought to clandestinely obtain \"non-content\" communications records, including phone and email records, of reporters at a variety of news outlets such as CNN and the New York Times. While the subject of an email is considered \"content,\" non-content records include metadata such as the date and time a message was sent, as well as the sender and recipient of an email.\n\nOriginal reporting.

It's a particularly important question for the types of users who have flocked to Proton - the kind fearful of exposing sensitive sources or persecuted individuals to state surveillance. (The Intercept uses Proton Mail as its email provider.)\n\n\"Platforms inherently occupy a position of trust because we want them to have users' backs when the government comes knocking for data,\" said Andrew Crocker, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's surveillance litigation director, which has published an annual \" Who Has Your Back? \" reports, which analyzed companies' acquiescence to government requests for user data.\n\n\"It's reasonable to worry that tech companies' backbone for protecting users in this way might soften when they get too politically involved with any one administration,\" Crocker said.\n\nWAIT!

Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., talks on the phone ahead of the ninth round of voting for speaker, as the House of Representatives meets for the third day to elect a speaker and convene the 118th Congress in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5, 2023.

Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., talks on the phone ahead of the ninth round of voting for speaker, as the House of Representatives meets for the third day to elect a speaker and convene the 118th Congress in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5, 2023.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, who Republican holdouts briefly tried to install as an alternative speaker this week, was also referred by the House January 6 Committee; so was McCarthy himself.\n\nThe intraparty battle for control of the House of Representatives is not a fight between pro-Trump and anti-Trump camps. There are no real anti-Trump moderates left in the Republican House caucus. This is not a matter of competing political ideologies.\n\nThe speaker's battle would make a perfect \"Seinfeld\" episode: It is a fight about nothing.\n\nAnd that's what makes it so dangerous.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nNeither the pro-McCarthy camp nor the anti-McCarthy insurgents have any real policy goals for how to make the government more effective. The goal of the insurgents is to stop the government from working at all. Yet that is true of McCarthy and his supporters as well.\n\nThe only thing they are really fighting over is personal political power. Nothing more. And that makes it very difficult for McCarthy to appease the Republicans who oppose him.\n\nIt is fitting that the battle for control of the House comes exactly two years after the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The speakership fight is a continuation of that struggle for personal power. This is an insurrection by other means.\n\nEven if the speakership is decided in the coming days, this battle shows just how paralyzed Congress will be over the next two years.\n\nThis is the paralysis that the Biden administration and the Democrats in Congress tried to prepare for in December, when the frenetic activity in the House gave off an apocalyptic vibe. Every move was hurried, with an eye on the clock and the knowledge that darkness was looming.\n\nDuring the lame-duck session, the House Ways and Means Committee released a report about Trump's long-hidden tax returns; the House January 6 Committee held its final hearing and voted to issue criminal referrals of Trump and others to the Justice Department; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed a joint session of Congress; and heavily bundled legislation that included continued funding for U.S. aid to Ukraine and new legal protections for the election of American presidents worked its way across Capitol Hill and was signed into law by Biden.\n\nNone of those things could wait any longer. The insurgents were about to take over the House.\n\nIn November, Republicans suffered some of the worst midterm results for an opposition party in modern American history, thanks to their turn toward right-wing extremism. The Republican-dominated Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade , and many Republican candidates in key races were election deniers hand-picked by Trump. The Republican Party lacked a coherent policy agenda other than \"owning the libs.\" Voters were turned off, and, despite high inflation and a worsening economy, Democrats won key races around the country, retaining control of the Senate while losing the House by the narrowest of margins.\n\nYet the great irony is that the very narrowness of the Republican margin of victory in the House is what is now giving outsized influence to the extremist forces that cost the GOP so dearly.\n\nRather than fight back, McCarthy gave in to extremism years ago, and became one of Trump's most prominent enablers. His craven willingness to appease the ex-president and the insurgents in the House means that no one fears him. He is the Neville Chamberlain of the House, and even if he ultimately becomes speaker, he will not really be calling the shots. The insurgents will be in charge, and no one else in the Republican caucus is likely to challenge them.\n\nWith de facto control over the House, they will focus on the right-wing political equivalent of performance art: a national abortion ban that will go nowhere, investigating Hunter Biden's laptop, and other \"anti-woke\" ways to own the libs. They will not focus on governing.\n\nSo if Trump's taxes, hidden throughout his presidency, were ever going to see the light of day, it had to be before the new Congress convened. It took years for the Ways and Means Committee to get the returns, and then only after a lengthy court battle, which ended in November when the Supreme Court refused to block the documents' release. Once the committee prevailed in court, it had to release Trump's taxes and related information before House Republicans had the chance to suppress them.\n\nThe committee voted to release Trump's taxes and also offered some bombshells , revealing that the Internal Revenue Service did not audit Trump during the first two years of his presidency - and didn't begin to do so until the day in 2019 when the House asked for his tax returns and questioned whether any audits of Trump had been conducted. The IRS had failed to audit the sitting president's taxes even though it was mandated to do so, and even though it audited the taxes of both presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The committee also found that Trump paid no federal income tax in 2020, while he was president.\n\nThe House January 6 Committee also had to wrap up its business during the lame-duck session or see its work shut down after Republicans took over. In fact, rather than continue to investigate the insurrection, House Republicans are vowing to investigate the January 6 committee itself.\n\nSo after issuing criminal referrals for Trump and others, the January 6 committee released a final report and handed over all its evidence to the Justice Department and the special counsel investigating Trump's efforts to overturn the election. Among the committee's final disclosures was that its star witness, former Trump aide Cassidy Hutchinson, said that her former lawyer advised her not to tell the committee the whole truth.\n\nThe threats posed by House Republicans on so many fronts help explain why many Senate Republicans joined Democrats in December to pass a $1.7 trillion omnibus spending package. That legislation included aid for Ukraine, which many right-wing House Republicans want to block or at least scale back , and changes to the electoral reform act, which governs how presidential elections are finalized and includes changes designed to make it harder for Trump or someone like him to overturn future elections.\n\nSenate Republicans voted for the legislation in the face of furious opposition from their pro-Trump counterparts in the House, perhaps a sign that at least some Senate Republicans no longer fear Trump and his minions.\n\nIn fact, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has become more openly anti-Trump since the midterms, when Trump-backed fringe candidates lost key contests and cost the GOP control of the Senate. While McCarthy was fighting for the speakership in the House this week, McConnell made a move heavy with symbolism: He appeared in Kentucky with Biden to showcase a major federal infrastructure investment in a bridge across the Ohio River.\n\nThe question now is whether Biden can count on a relatively sane Senate to check the worst impulses of the unstable House.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "It's the GOP, Stupid: How the Party Gave Us a New Mexico Pol Accused of Hiring Assassins\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThere's no distancing the Republican Party from Solomon Peña - or his alleged acts of political violence.\n\nSolomon Peña is taken into custody in Albuquerque, N.M., on Jan. 16, 2023.\n\nThe mounting forensic evidence of a direct connection between right-wing political violence and the Republican Party has a new patient zero whose case can be studied and dissected. His name is Solomon Peña.\n\nPeña's story is a case study in the close and direct links between Republicans and right-wing violence, even as party leaders try to deny them.\n\nFor those who haven't been following him, Peña ran as a Republican for a seat in the New Mexico Legislature in November but was handily defeated by his Democratic opponent. Peña received only about 26 percent of the vote in his district, yet he refused to concede, and instead, like other Republican losers around the country, mimicked Donald Trump by complaining that he was the victim of election fraud.\n\n\"Trump just announced for 2024,\" Peña tweeted on November 15, 2022. \"I stand with him. I never conceded my HD 14 race. Now researching my options.\"\n\nTrump just announced for 2024.  I stand with him.  I never conceded my HD 14 race.  Now researching my options. pic.twitter.com/sKVHhxG9Vq\n\n- Solomon Pena for NM (@SolomonPena2022) November 16, 2022\n\nPeña's \"options\" were revealed last week, when he was arrested in connection with a series of shootings at the homes of four Democratic state officials in Albuquerque, including two involved in certifying the results in his race.\n\nPeña, 39, is accused of leading a group that included four others who shot at the homes of the Democratic officials; in one case, bullets fired into the house of a Democratic state senator came close to hitting the official's 10-year-old daughter. Peña allegedly paid the four accomplices and provided them with weapons; he's also accused of personally participating in at least one of the drive-by shootings.\n\nThe Peña case is part of a surging wave of right-wing political violence that now arguably represents the biggest national security threat facing the United States. Academic researchers are finally catching up with the trend, and recording what has become obvious: The violence is overwhelmingly committed by extremists on the right rather than the left.\n\nIn 2022, an extensive historical study of acts of extremist violence, committed between 1948 and 2018, found that the likelihood that an act of violence was committed by a right-wing extremist was virtually equal to the chance that it was committed by an Islamist extremist, while the likelihood that such an act was committed by a left-wing extremist was far lower. The study, conducted by a research team co-led by University of Maryland criminology professor Gary LaFree, also analyzed global data related to acts of terrorism between 1970 and 2017, showing that attacks by left-wing extremists throughout the world were 45 percent less likely to result in fatalities than attacks by right-wing extremists.\n\nRight-wing violence seems to have increased since the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. In fact, Peña's arrest came just weeks after the two leading members of a 2020 plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer were finally sentenced, and follows the October attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as well as the August armed attack on the FBI's Cincinnati office by a pro-Trump extremist angered by the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago in connection with Trump's classified documents case.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWhat makes Peña's case significant - and clarifying - is that the defeated candidate himself may have engaged directly in the violence. In other recent cases, Republicans have sought to dismiss acts of violence by claiming that there was no proof the criminals involved were motivated by their pro-Trump, Republican ideology. Republicans and conservatives have frequently pushed conspiracy theories to falsely assert that violence was actually committed by left-wing extremists, or, alternatively, was brought on by the victims themselves. In the aftermath of the attack on Paul Pelosi, for example, prominent conservatives embraced a wide variety of conspiracy theories, including claims that the assailant was Pelosi's gay lover .\n\nBut it is not really possible to distance the Republican Party from Peña - or from his acts of violence. After all, the Republicans' own candidate for a seat in New Mexico's House of Representatives is now sitting in jail, and the evidence against him seems ironclad.\n\nThe Peña case underscores how the lies, propaganda, and conspiracy theories that now dominate the rhetoric of the Republican Party lead to violence, and that makes Peña's story even more significant than that of George Santos, the first-term House representative and serial fabulist who has garnered far more national attention.\n\nSolomon Peña, like so many others in the pro-Trump world, never succeeded at life. Demoted twice while serving in the Navy, he later was part of a group that drove cars into four different stores and robbed them, resulting in a string of smash-and-grab burglaries in Albuquerque that landed him in prison for almost seven years . He was released from prison in 2016 and remained on probation until 2021, just a year before he ran for the state legislature.\n\nPeña embraced Trump's MAGA cult and posted photos of himself on Twitter showing that he was in Washington on January 6, 2021, to support Trump's false claims that he had actually won the 2020 election.\n\nThis is one of the last pictures I have of the Jan 06 trip.  I lost that phone at the Trump rally in Phoenix, July 2021.  Make America Great Again! pic.twitter.com/EJToLrD8md\n\n- Solomon Pena for NM (@SolomonPena2022) November 14, 2022\n\nUnlike Santos, Peña's troubled past was well known during the 2022 campaign; his Democratic opponent sued to have him removed from the ballot because of his felony convictions. In September 2022, a court ruling allowed Pena to stay on the ballot, but the issue was ful ly covered in the New Mexico press.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, continued to back him, arguing that Peña deserved a second chance. \"Please support Solomon Pena,\" Michelle Garcia Holmes, a Republican congressional candidate in New Mexico, tweeted in October, after the court ruling allowing Peña to stay on the ballot. \"He is the right choice!\"\n\nOn November 9, the day after he was soundly defeated in the election, Peña tweeted : \"I dissent. I am the MAGA king.\"\n\nPolice say that, after his election loss, Peña went to the homes of the four Democratic officials and confronted them with his claims of election fraud. Soon after that, he escalated to allegedly enlisting a group of criminals to shoot at their homes.\n\nDuring this post-election period, while he was publicly claiming election fraud, Peña was still moving up in Republican circles in New Mexico. Two days before his arrest, he was elected to posts as a county ward chair and a Republican Party State Central Committee member.\n\nFollowing his arrest, the Republican caucus in the New Mexico House of Representatives issued a bizarre statement that did not mentioned Peña's statehouse candidacy, instead criticizing the government for allowing him to have guns. In a statement that seemed to turn everything about the Peña case on its head, state Republican House leader Ryan Lane said, \"This is yet another example of a convicted felon gaining access to firearms, which they are barred from owning or possessing, and using the weapon in a manner that causes public harm.\"\n\nWAIT!

Over the past four decades, GOP leaders set out to transform the party into the perfect vessel for Trumpian extremism - and they succeeded beyond their wildest nightmares.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi delivers remarks alongside Representatives Jerry Nadler and Eliot Engel, following the House of Representatives vote to impeach President Donald Trump on December 18, 2019 in Washington, DC. (Sarah Silbiger / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nDuring an appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe last fall, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned Republican lawmakers for collaborating with Donald Trump, arguing that the party had been transformed into a cult. Pelosi's censure, however, also carried with it a strangely redemptive cadence. \"One of my prayers is that the Republicans will take back their party,\" the speaker said, continuing:\n\nThe country needs a strong Republican Party. It's done so much for our country, and to have it be hijacked as a cult at this time is really a sad thing for America.... What is this? What is this about the Republicans that they don't care enough about what they believe in as a party - a legitimate party - with beliefs and their view of the role of government? [...] I pray that they would get us a Grand Old Party again.\n\nLast month, only weeks after the Trump-inspired storming of the US Capitol building, the speaker could still be heard saying much the same thing.\n\nThose praying for a return of sanity on the right have doubtless been encouraged by the barrage of reports suggesting a substantial Republican exodus in the wake of last month's events in Washington. \"Spurred by the Capitol Riot, Thousands of Republicans Drop Out of GOP,\" read an NPR headline three weeks ago, the accompanying report going on to note the more than four thousand Colorado Republicans who had changed their registration in the week after January 6 and observing a similar phenomenon elsewhere. In an article earlier this month, Chris Cillizza argued much the same, noting that the number of Republicans who have recently changed their party affiliation is vastly larger than the number of Democrats. \"The January riot,\" Cillizza concluded, \"has quite clearly tarnished the GOP brand in the eyes of at least a decent-sized chunk of those formerly aligned with the party.\"\n\nThis seems to track with other data that have recently emerged, notably a Gallup poll conducted between January 21 and February 2, which shows a precipitous drop in in the GOP's national favorability overall - a drop coming near exclusively from self-identified Republicans and linked directly in some media reports to the party's supposedly tarnished image among its own supporters following the events of January 6 and the subsequent impeachment trial.\n\nIt's a story with obvious appeal, and one very much in sync with the long-standing liberal impulse to distinguish between the evil Trumpian and (ostensibly benevolent) non-Trumpian factions of American conservatism - the latter perpetually waiting in exile to reclaim its rightful place. It's also a highly dubious one which, time and again, has proven more media phenomena than tangible reality - each and every supposedly decisive conservative repudiation of Trump seeming to do little, if anything, to slacken his hold on the Republican base.\n\nFrom the National Review 's now-infamous 2016 Never Trump issue to the abysmal failure of farcical outreach efforts like the Lincoln Project to make 2020 \"the year of the Biden Republican,\" the former president's appeal has seemed largely impregnable among the constituency whose opinion actually matters: namely, Republican voters themselves.\n\nAccording to polling from YouGov , some 90 percent of self-identified Republicans hoped for Trump's acquittal in the recent impeachment proceedings. A national survey from Quinnipiac University released last week found that some 75 percent of Republicans want him to \"play a prominent role\" in the party's future. A Gallup study from February 15, meanwhile, suggests that a plurality of Republicans (40 percent) want the GOP to move in a more conservative direction, compared with 34 percent who want it to remain as is, and only 24 percent who think it should become \"more moderate.\"\n\nAs to the thousands of conservatives supposedly leaving the GOP in disgust, the Economist 's G. Elliott Morris has offered a persuasive countervailing interpretation. For one thing, as Morris points out, the overall share of Republicans changing their affiliation remains quite small in relative terms. More importantly, though, there's a very real chance that those who are disaffiliating are doing so out of disdain for the party's current leadership rather than anger at its conduct during the Trump era's final months. The same February 15 Gallup study identified record support among Republicans for a third party, a trend which strongly suggests animus toward the GOP as a whole has more to do with pro-Trumpian sentiment than the fabled moderate conservative renaissance (Trump himself teased the idea of a new \"Patriot Party\" following his November defeat).\n\nAs an institutional formation, the Republican Party may well be in something like a crisis - party elites are struggling to navigate the rough waters of an early post-Trump era in which a huge swathe of their own rank and file remains intoxicated by the idioms and preoccupations of the past four years. What seems near certain, however, is that the possibility of a Republican Party functionally or ideologically distinct from what we now broadly call \"Trumpism\" sailed long ago. The negotiation within American conservatism, such as it is, will be more a struggle about affect and branding than a battle over first principles (in many ways, exactly this struggle has defined conservative attitudes toward Trump from the very beginning).\n\nGiven the former president's stranglehold on the American right, the extent to which what comes next explicitly bears his personal imprint remains to be seen. Though all efforts of this kind have failed so far, a sufficiently creative Republican politician may yet devise a way of rhetorically triangulating between the Trump-inflected and anti-Trump modes of conservatism (if the past few years are any indication, such a figure would probably be an instant hit with some liberals).\n\nBut make no mistake: Trump's supposed \"hijacking\" of the Republican Party was less a hostile takeover than the logical outcome of a decades-long rightward drift shepherded and applauded by conservative elites themselves. Try as they might, there is no sane, sensible party for liberals to rescue. It's long past time they stopped trying.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn recent months, Republican lawmakers in Texas and Florida have rallied behind a suite of efforts related to schools, children, issues of race, and issues of sexuality. At a glance, each represents an isolated case study in conservatism's wider cultural offensive. Taken together, however, all tell a much larger story about the Right's professed commitment to personal freedom and freedom of expression - and the inconsistency with which its partisans apply their own chosen idioms.\n\nThe past decade has seen conservatives aggressively rally around a narrative about censorious college professors and an intellectually stifled culture increasingly averse to ideas some find uncomfortable. More broadly, the Right has tended to present itself as the only reliable steward of free speech in a society which now deems certain questions out of bounds and has seen the ongoing creep of a state empowered to suppress individual expression. However you come down on what are sometimes complex debates about education or pedagogy, it's a story that's simply impossible to square with the kinds of moves Republican politicians are now willing to entertain, let alone what many are already using political power to do.\n\nRecent developments in two states are especially instructive in this respect.\n\nLast month, Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick signaled he'll push to end tenure for new hires at the state's public universities and colleges in a move to combat \"indoctrination\" and the teaching of Critical Race Theory (CRT) - also opening the door to reforming local laws so that those who currently have tenure can have it revoked if authorities decide they've engaged in wrongthink.\n\nIn Florida, which has also become a CRT battleground, the Republican-controlled house of representatives just approved a measure to prohibit discussions concerned with gender identity and sexual orientation in classrooms. Though the bill's language refers specifically to children in a specific age range, its many critics rightly point out an obvious loophole that could potentially make its implications even more expansive - the text referring to \"classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity . . . in kindergarten through grade 3\" with the caveat \"or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\" Also empowering parents to sue districts perceived to have violated the new rules, the bill is transparently a first step toward what some conservatives clearly hope will be the eventual purging of some discussions from public schools altogether.\n\nGiven the Right's espoused commitment to freedom of speech and opposition to state overreach, you might think this would be a difficult circle to square. In relation to both CRT and discussions of sexual identity, however, the favored frame has become the idea of \" parental choice \": a rhetorically useful way of packaging the agenda of social conservatism in the language of individual freedom and moral neutrality. One only needs to return to Texas to see just how hollow and selective the Right's application of this very concept actually is.\n\nIn what is easily the most grotesque of all the various efforts Republicans are currently pushing at the state level, Governor Greg Abbott last month asked the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) to launch investigations into instances of what he calls \"abusive procedures\" related to parents, children, and gender identity. Effectively, it means that the parents of transgender children can now be criminally investigated for affirming their child's identity - and that a range of licensed professionals from doctors to teachers will be required to snitch on those who do. Less than a week on from Abbott's decree, two Texan parents - one of whom is a DFPS employee - are already being investigated (and are rightly suing ).\n\nRepublican lawmakers, in short, will embrace the concept of parental autonomy in one instance and abandon it in the next. Freedom of speech is said to be under attack, but teachers and college faculty must face professional discipline if they transgress against the standards handed down by politicians. The state and its organs, it is said, should remain neutral on particular questions, but are also morally obligated to criminalize and punish certain lifestyles and viewpoints.\n\nIn one obvious sense, there's no internal consistency here - the operating principle being \"free expression for me but not for thee.\" Then again, this apparent lack of consistency may offer us a deeper clue about what's really animating the Right's wider cultural offensive. Parse the language and aims of these various efforts, and it's clear that their inspiration is nothing more nor less than a socially conservative idea of society in which individuals have prescribed roles and identities and the function of public institutions is to help bolster this natural order. Look at various polls on a range of issues, and it's very difficult to make a convincing case that anything resembling such a worldview is shared by a majority of Americans - which is probably one reason conservatives have tended to package their objectives in the bogus rhetoric of neutrality and choice.\n\nUnfortunately, as Jennifer Berkshire observed in an essay for the Nation following November's Republican victory in Virginia, liberals' embrace of instrumentalist slogans like \"College, Knowledge and Jobs\" and \"Get Skilled, Get a Job, Give Back\" has left Democrats ill-equipped to mount the more principled and holistic defense of public education that the Right's current onslaught demands. Since the 1990s, America's liberals have increasingly seen the state as little more than a vehicle for facilitating markets and individual opportunities within them. Conversely, the Right understands that education potentially has much a thicker role to play and is more than happy to make heavy-handed use of the state to impose its minoritarian value system on public schools - and beyond.\n\nGiven the creeping privatization of education and the punishing nature of higher ed tuition fees, it's hardly possible for mainstream liberals to claim their politics have helped foster a vibrant culture of free inquiry or expression. Nevertheless, the kinds of measures at play in places like Florida and Texas are clearly irreconcilable with the binary fable of censorious liberals and freedom-loving conservatives through which the Right has increasingly framed recent debates.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

In reality, he has long championed right-wing causes from school privatization to government deregulation.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg attends a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on January 31, 2024, in Washington, DC. (Matt McClain / Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nUntil pretty recently, if you thought of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, you'd probably come up with a flesh-and-blood automaton whose mission to connect the world turned into the upending of political systems and poisoning of our information environment - not to mention that weird metaverse side project. Accusations that his platform helped get Donald Trump elected in 2016 led to a series of scandals that the company struggled to effectively respond to - at least until another billionaire rose to take his crown.\n\nBy July 2023, some of Zuckerberg's detractors were ready to give him a pass because they'd found a new enemy. That month, Meta launched Threads, its competitor to an increasingly right-wing and conspiracy-filled X/Twitter. Zuckerberg's opportunistic move to take advantage of Twitter's struggles under its new owner was recast by some of Elon Musk's newfound critics as a political move to show that Meta was different. All of a sudden, a company with one of the worst reputations in tech was being positioned as something of a liberal darling.\n\nZuckerberg's new fans wanted to see him as Musk's foil - the better social media baron - despite history showing that they were two sides of the same coin. The billionaires even played into the supposed rivalry by suggesting they were going to physically fight each other, as robotic Zuckerberg morphed into a mixed martial arts enthusiast. When he unveiled a more muscular build, alongside baggy shirts and gold chains a little later, segments of social media went wild, and it seemed like his days of being one the most hated corporate executives in Silicon Valley were behind him . But Zuckerberg was never who those newfound Musk haters wanted him to be.\n\nIn 2023, Meta had lifted its ban on Donald Trump, before rolling back the final restrictions on July 12, 2024. The following day, Trump suffered an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. Zuckerberg called Trump to say he was \"praying\" for him, and less than a week later he said Trump was a \"badass,\" although he made sure to clarify that this wasn't an explicit endorsement. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg refused to renew his support for local electoral efforts after it had been criticized by Republicans, and Meta continued rolling back policies it had implemented to safeguard elections.\n\nFor some, Zuckerberg's recent decision to ditch fact-checkers in exchange for community notes, open the floodgates to hate speech, and begin ditching diversity and trans-inclusive initiatives might feel like a betrayal. But for those who didn't fall for the expertly orchestrated public relations campaign that accompanied his makeover, it was hardly a surprise.\n\nZuckerberg spent years taking figurative punches before stepping into the ring to take some real ones. He was called out by the political right for supposed suppression of conservative speech - a dubious accusation - but faced real regulatory pressure from Democrats, especially when they returned to power in 2021. However, his response to that political scrutiny has changed over time.\n\nIn the 2010s, it seems quite clear that Zuckerberg wanted to appear socially progressive like many other tech leaders, despite the libertarianism that dominates the politics of Silicon Valley. He was outspoken on issues like immigration, even as his company helped push the opposite narrative where it was profitable, and he funded philanthropic efforts supposedly aimed at addressing those causes. That included a big donation to promote school privatization to try to distract from the release of The Social Network .\n\nWhen the political pressure escalated, Zuckerberg again tried to show that the company then called Facebook was responding to the criticism. But he was never willing to go far enough to really address the root of the problem, in part because he took disingenuous conservative anger at face value. If conservatives were being silenced on social media more than liberals, it was only because they were more likely to use hate speech and express bigoted views that got caught up in moderation. But the company wouldn't accept that reality.\n\nAccording to reporting in BuzzFeed News , Zuckerberg was already personally intervening to protect extreme right-wing users in 2019, including Infowars founder Alex Jones. As one employee told the publication, \"Mark personally didn't like the punishment, so he changed the rules,\" allowing a wide range of right-wing militant groups to remain on Facebook and organize for the insurrection that occurred on January 6, 2021. That event finally forced the company to take more serious action, but many of those efforts have proven short-lived.\n\nThe man helping Zuckerberg stifle moderation of right-wing accounts was Joel Kaplan, a Republican operative who was serving as vice president of global public policy. There's little doubt that Kaplan helped shape Zuckerberg's views and the policies the company took, and now he'll be even more influential. Ahead of Zuckerberg's bombshell announcement on moderation policy, Kaplan replaced Nick Clegg - Britain's former deputy prime minister - as president of global affairs. Kaplan has significant influence , not to mention a good relationship with Zuckerberg, but the CEO's actions shouldn't solely be placed at Kaplan's feet.\n\nA poorly titled profile of Zuckerberg suggesting he was \"done with politics\" published in the New York Times in September provides good insight into some of the factors driving his political realignment. It describes Zuckerberg as being fed up with political backlash but holding far more ire toward progressive politicians and employees at his philanthropic group than the right-wing political figures who also had him in their crosshairs.\n\nIn particular, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, pushed back on employees who expected their initiative to do more in response to the killing of George Floyd and the overturning of abortion rights in the United States. Zuckerberg reportedly now sees himself as a libertarian or \"classical liberal\" who abhors regulation and \"far-left progressivism\" like pro-Palestine campus protests, which he and Chan consider antisemitic.\n\nZuckerberg's realignment toward the political right should not be a surprise. Over the past decade, he's become the third-richest person in the world. He can also never be displaced from his position at the top of Meta because its dual-class share structure gives him a majority of the voting power. More recently, he's embraced mixed martial arts, which has a more conservative culture. He's been quick to gut diversity initiatives at Meta and now claims the company needs a more \" masculine energy .\"\n\nZuckerberg has been done with the criticism and threats to his power for a while; he's just been looking for the right path to rid himself of it. His firm paid to stoke the campaign against TikTok to take the focus off American social media, and he sees the Trump administration as an opportunity not just to get the US government off his back but to use its remaining power to pressure other countries to back off too. His social position has made an embrace of the political right personally and commercially advantageous, and he sees that conservatives are ready to embrace him as long as he'll take corporate actions that will keep them happy.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg rebranded the company as Meta in 2021, it was not just to distract people from the leaks by former employee Frances Haugen. In a short video before the Facebook Connect keynote where he laid out his vision for the metaverse, he expressed a defiant tone. He claimed that for many people, namely his critics, there will never \"be a good time to focus on the future.\" The real heroes in society, he claimed, were \"those who are willing to stand up and say, 'This is the future we want and I'm going to keep pushing and giving everything I've got to make this happen.'\"\n\nThe future Zuckerberg wants is one where tech billionaires like himself can play in the gated world of suburban tech campuses and Hawaiian compounds without criticism or accountability while telling the rest of us that toys like VR headsets and the metaverse will save their lives. It doesn't matter that their tech ambitions are little more than sci-fi fantasies. Silicon Valley's alliance with the extreme right will allow them to keep preaching how much tech will save the world for a little longer - all while they continue to degrade life for everyone.\n\nThis is an edited version of an article that originally appeared in Disconnect .\n\nParis Marx hosts the Tech Won't Save Us podcast and writes Disconnect , a critical technology newsletter.

But there wasn't much substantive evidence of that at the RNC.\n\nSenator and vice presidential candidate J. D. Vance addresses the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, July 17. (KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLast Saturday, Donald Trump narrowly escaped an assassin's bullet. Two days later, delegates gathered in Milwaukee to officially make him the Republican nominee for president.\n\nFrom what little we know about the shooter, it's possible that his motivations had less to do with politics than a desire to shoot someone famous and go out in a blaze of glory.\n\nBut no one at the Republican National Convention (RNC) seemed to be capable of remembering that. Ben Carson, for example, rattled off the trials the former president had endured, saying that \"first they tried to ruin his reputation,\" and later \"they tried to imprison him,\" and then \"they tried to bankrupt him,\" and most recently \"they tried to kill him.\" In this telling, Trump was shot not by a twenty-year-old registered Republican with unclear motives but by a shadowy They.\n\nIn his speech on the fourth and final night, Hulk Hogan actually ripped off his shirt while ranting about how \"they took a shot at my hero, and they tried to kill the next president of the United States. Enough was enough!\" At one point in Trump's own seemingly endless speech at the close of the convention, he singled out this performance by \"the Hulkster\" for special praise.\n\nPeeling away these layers of theatrics and conspiracism, though, what was the political content of the convention? I watched more hours of it than a mental health professional would advise, and the main theme of those hours, beyond the personal greatness of Donald Trump, seemed to be that Joe Biden had \"opened the border,\" and this was the main cause of rising crime and Americans dying of fentanyl overdoses.\n\nSpeaker after speaker said this - despite the fact that these claims are definitely not true . Cheering delegates waved signs that had been mass-printed for them with the chilling slogan \"Mass Deportation Now.\"\n\nThere are, on a conservative estimate, around eleven million unauthorized immigrants in the United States. Take a beat and think about the logistics of the police operation it would take to round up and deport eleven million men, women, and children who are in, the overwhelming majority of cases, just trying to keep their heads down and live their lives. This is ugly stuff.\n\nBeyond fearmongering about immigrants, though, what did this year's RNC tell us about what Trump's GOP stands for? What did the speakers say about war and peace? About poverty and inequality?\n\nOn the second night of the convention, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley ascended to the podium. It was a big moment. She was the last candidate standing against Trump at the end of the 2024 Republican primaries, just as Ted Cruz had been Trump's last rival in 2016. At the 2016 RNC, Cruz infuriated the crowd by pointedly refusing to endorse Trump - who had, after all, attacked Cruz's wife and even suggested that Cruz's father was involved in the JFK assassination.\n\nHaley put any such worries to rest at the beginning of her speech:\n\nMy fellow Republicans, former President Trump has asked me to speak at this convention in the name of unity. It was a gracious invitation and I was happy to accept. I'll start by making one thing perfectly clear. Donald Trump has my strong endorsement.\n\nShe went on to address listeners who might still have doubts about Trump, saying that \"you don't have to agree with President Trump 100 percent of the time to vote for him.\" She rattled off Trump's accomplishments as president, with a special emphasis on foreign policy. He \"got us out of the insane Iran deal.\" He assassinated Iranian general Qassem Soleimani . He always had Benjamin Netanyahu's back. Meanwhile, Biden \"surrendered in Afghanistan,\" he's \"pressuring Israel instead of the terrorists,\" and he lifted sanctions on Iran.\n\nGovernor Haley's description of Biden's alleged dovishness was detached from reality. But forget that. What fascinated me was seeing the Republican convention delegates gathered to nominate Donald Trump and J. D. Vance cheering at the reminder that Trump brought us closer to war with Iran than we've been at any point since the hostage crisis from 1979 to 1981 and duly booing Joe Biden for allegedly being soft on Hamas. I've been hearing for years about a \"realignment\" that's made the GOP the party of anti-interventionism. But you certainly wouldn't know it from listening to the convention.\n\nSimilarly, the \"realignment\" of the political parties is supposed to have involved Republicans rejecting free-market orthodoxy to embrace economic populism. But the convention cheered House majority leader Steve Scalise for reminding them of President Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy and promising that within the first hundred days of a second Trump term with a Republican majority, those tax cuts would be made permanent. Trump himself bragged about instituting \"the biggest tax cuts ever.\" Apparently, none of these Republicans received the realignment memo.\n\nLet's call that the Haley-Scalise track: praising Trump by reminding viewers that he was president for four years and he might as well have been Mitt Romney.\n\nIf you tuned in to Tucker Carlson on the final night, though, you got superficially populist framing in spades.\n\nI didn't hear a single specific policy recommendation in Tucker's speech, but he sure sounded anti-elitist and anti-interventionist. He said Trump is talked about as a threat to democracy, but Trump is really about restoring democracy. Real democracy, he explained, is about seeing the people of the country as the \"owners\" of the country, not just \"tenants,\" such that politicians \"have to do what we want\" after \"fifty years\" where politicians ignored the will of the people. The politicians step over Americans dying of drug overdoses, he said, to cast votes to spend money on things like the war in Ukraine.\n\nAs it happens, Tucker Carlson is a former Cato Institute fellow whose worldview has changed far less over the decades than his rhetoric would suggest. He's against Medicare for All, he's against a $15 minimum wage, and on foreign policy his primary objection to the war in Ukraine is that he thinks that \"our main enemy is China\" and that \"the US ought to be in a relationship with Russia, allied against China.\" But if I didn't know all that, he'd sound like a populist and an anti-interventionist.\n\nTrump himself made multiple references to the cost-of-living crisis in America and how crushing inflation feels to many Americans, but offered little of substance beyond vague hand-waving (\"We will end the ridiculous and actually incredible waste of taxpayer dollars that is fueling the inflation crisis. They've spent trillions of dollars of things having to do with the Green New Scam. It's a scam\") and a call for United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain to be fired. Trump claimed \"we're going to bring back car manufacturing and we're going to bring it back fast\" by instituting \"a tariff of approximately 100 to 200 percent on each car.\"\n\n\"Under my plan, incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish completely, jobs will come roaring back, and the middle class will prosper like never, ever before, and we're going to do it very rapidly,\" Trump said, heavy on bluster but light on details. He feinted toward nonintervention throughout the speech, but then pledged to build a \"great iron dome\" system for domestic military defense that \"will be built entirely in the USA.\"\n\nTrump's running mate, J. D. Vance, really managed to sound like a populist and anti-interventionist when he spoke on the third night in a shockingly raw and direct way about the pain caused in places like the one he grew up by the policies of bipartisan elites - the way human lives were mangled as \"jobs were sent overseas and our children were sent to war.\" That sounds convincingly populist.\n\nIt's hard to remember what a recent development that is for Vance. Not so many years ago, in his bestseller Hillbilly Elegy , he finger-wagged the \"hillbillies\" he grew up around for their alleged culture of poverty, writing that \"too many young men\" were \"immune to hard work,\" calling some of his neighbors \"welfare queens,\" and emphasizing that these cultural problems \"run far deeper than macroeconomic trends and policy.\" While the success of Hillbilly Elegy remains a big part of his story, repeatedly mentioned at the RNC, the book's main themes of blaming Rust Belt victims of deindustrialization for their own condition have been awkwardly memory-holed.\n\nIn his convention speech, Vance showed that he had gotten the \"populist realignment\" memo - at the least at the level of rhetoric. He painted a picture of economic devastation, and (accurately) nailed then senator Joe Biden for supporting NAFTA and the \"disastrous invasion of Iraq.\" So far, so good. But what does Vance actually want a future Trump-Vance administration to do?\n\nAs Nikki Haley reminded the crowd the night before, Trump was a far bigger Iran hawk than his predecessor or his successor. Does Vance want him to reverse course and pursue détente with Iran in his second term? That would be the true anti-interventionist positions. If so, it seems odd that he didn't say so. And if not, Vance is coasting on the stolen valor of retroactively opposing the invasion of Iraq two decades before he was elected to office while supporting a confrontational policy that could lead to an even more disastrous war with Iraq's neighbor Iran.\n\nAnd what does Vance want to do on the domestic front? Did he champion any economically populist policies to go with the rhetoric? If so, I missed it.\n\nI did hear him falsely claim that workers' wages \"went through the roof\" in Trump's first term. In reality, there was modest but steady wage growth in the last years of the Obama administration as the economy slowly recovered from the 2008 crash, and the trend simply continued in the early years of Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, workers' power to win increases in wages beyond what macroeconomic trends can deliver on their own depends on their ability to organize, bargain, and if necessary go on strike. But Trump's National Labor Relations Board raged a relentless war against unions. Does Vance have a problem with that? Again, if so, he didn't show any sign of it. The only appearance of the word \"union\" in his speech was a line about how Donald Trump is supposedly a \"leader who is not in the pocket of big business, but answers to the working man, union and nonunion alike.\"\n\nThat combination of words felt like it had been vetted by a roomful of consultants. Not in the pocket of big business but answers to the working man? Great. Strong populist energy. Say the word union? Good. You'll get points for boldly diverging from Reaganite orthodoxy. But better make sure to add \"and nonunion\" to signal to your friend Peter Thiel that you haven't gone too far off the reservation.\n\nThis, at the end of the day, is what \"realignment\" means. Trump's GOP will continue to cater to business interests at home and project imperial military power abroad. Comparatively honest ghouls like Nikki Haley and Steve Scalise will sell this package with good old-fashioned Reaganite branding, excitedly reminding their listeners that Trump is the president who tore up the Iran deal and passed a big tax cut for the rich. Tucker Carlson and J. D. Vance will use different words - ones designed to excite people who prefer to believe that reelecting a billionaire union-buster to the presidency will somehow stick it to big business.\n\nEither way, the product is the same.\n\nBen Burgis is a Jacobin columnist, an adjunct philosophy professor at Rutgers University, and the host of the YouTube show and podcast Give Them An Argument .

We can't let them steal this election.\n\nWorkers process polling place equipment and materials at the Clark County Election Department after polls closed on November 3, 2020 in North Las Vegas, Nevada.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nMany millions of Americans are voting by mail or drop box because of the pandemic, and turnout could increase thanks to an unpopular president. The Republican Party has responded by accelerating its assault on voting rights and filing lawsuits at the eleventh hour to stop ballots from being counted.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has suggested that the election will be rife with fraud given the number of mail-in ballots. (When asked to provide evidence of voter fraud in court, the Trump campaign has failed - because widespread voter fraud is a myth.) Trump argued that the Senate needed to confirm new justice Amy Coney Barrett because the Supreme Court could decide the election.\n\nWe've compiled a guide to some of the GOP's most egregious attempts to steal this election through the courts.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Republicans successfully petitioned the state's Supreme Court to toss so-called \"naked ballots,\" the term for mail-in ballots that lack the dual envelope protection required under state law. Democrats had argued that such a decision could end up resulting in thousands of discarded ballots.\n\nRepublicans had also challenged the state's extended deadline for receipt of mail-in ballots but were unsuccessful, even after taking their case all the way to the US Supreme Court.\n\nState officials in Pennsylvania told the Washington Post that they are preemptively segregating late-arrival mail-in ballots in order to preempt any effort by the administration to undermine the results of the vote.\n\nFlorida Republicans successfully disenfranchised an estimated 774,000 people, receiving a ruling in their favor (from the Republican-stacked Eleventh Circuit US Court of Appeals) to significantly roll back a voter-enacted constitutional amendment to restore voting rights to people with felony convictions.\n\nThe constitutional amendment passed in 2018 with 64.5 percent of the vote, ending a practice that disproportionately disenfranchised the state's black voters. But Republican governor Ron DeSantis and the Republican state legislature acted quickly to enact laws adding burdensome barriers to voting for people with felony convictions, including a law requiring people to pay their outstanding court fees and fines before casting a ballot.\n\nDemocrats and civil rights groups challenged the law, arguing that it amounted to a poll tax, but the Eleventh Circuit overruled a district court decision that found the law did, in fact, amount to a poll tax.\n\nHarris County, Texas, has become a key battleground this election. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the county implemented universal curbside/drive-through voting, which is normally restricted to a narrow group of individuals under the state's election code. Several prominent Republicans filed suit in federal court, asking the judge to end the expanded practice and to throw out more than 100,000 ballots that had already been cast this way.\n\nThose Republicans - GOP power broker Steve Hotze, congressional candidate Wendell Champion, Texas state representative Steve Toth, and judicial candidate for Texas 80th District Court Sharon Hemphill - argued that not doing so \"hurts not only the integrity and the reported outcomes of the election for all of the candidates and all of the voters who voted, but it could also dilute or otherwise diminish and cancel [their] casting of a legal vote for the candidates of their choice in the General Election.\"\n\nFortunately, Judge Andrew Hanen, a George W. Bush appointee with a reputation as a GOP partisan, ruled on Monday that the plaintiffs didn't have standing. However, Hanen suggested that Texans should avoid casting their votes in drive-through centers on Election Day.\n\nEarlier this month, Texas governor Greg Abbott reduced the number of ballot drop-off sites to one per county. By 2019, Texas had closed more polling locations than any other state - and has closed 750 since 2012.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit US Court of Appeals issued a ruling on October 29 that requires state election officials to segregate mail ballots that arrive on Election Day from ballots that are postmarked by Election Day but arrive after, in order to leave the door open for a Republican challenge to ballots that arrive after the election.\n\nOfficial government bodies had been advertising that mail ballots postmarked by Election Day would be counted, and the mail ballots sent to voters say that mail ballots postmarked by Election Day and received within seven days of the election would be counted.\n\nLate last month, Republican lawmakers in North Carolina petitioned the US Supreme Court to stop a decision by the state board of elections to extend the deadline for receipt of mail-in ballots to November 12 in order to handle a massive influx of mailed ballots.\n\nNormally, North Carolina law only allows ballots postmarked by Election Day to be received three days after. But the Fourth Circuit US Court of Appeals upheld the extended deadline, holding that, \"There is no irreparable harm from a ballot extension: again, everyone must submit their ballot by the same date.\"\n\n\"The extension merely allows more lawfully cast ballots to be counted, in the event there are any delays precipitated by an avalanche of mail-in ballots,\" the court found.\n\nThe Supreme Court let the lower court ruling stand last week.\n\nThe Supreme Court voted 5-3, along partisan lines, to require mail ballots to arrive by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to be counted, overruling a Wisconsin federal district court's order that ballots postmarked by Election Day had up to six days after the election to arrive and be counted.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent : \"During COVID, the state's ballot-receipt deadline and the court's decision upholding it disenfranchise citizens by depriving them of their constitutionally guaranteed right to vote. Because the court refuses to reinstate the district court's injunction, Wisconsin will throw out thousands of timely requested and timely cast mail ballots.\"\n\nDuring the primary in Wisconsin, the state had accepted mail ballots for up to six days after the election, as long as they were postmarked by Election Day. Eighty thousand ballots that were counted -- about 5 percent of the votes cast -- arrived after Election Day.\n\nThis change, between the primary and the general, could confuse voters and potentially result in thousands of Wisconsin ballots being thrown out.\n\nIn Michigan, Republicans successfully petitioned the Michigan Court of Appeals to overturn a lower court decision allowing ballots postmarked the day before Election Day to be received up to fourteen days after. As a result, voters now have to return their absentee ballots to their clerk by 8 p.m. on Election Day, which could end up disenfranchising thousands.\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit US Court of Appeals issued a ruling requiring mail ballots to arrive by Election Day in order to be counted, overturning a district court judge's order that had extended the deadline to November 6.\n\nIn September, an Arizona judge issued an order allowing voters up to five days after the election to sign unsigned ballots and have their votes counted. The ruling extended a provision already in state law that allows such a cure period for ballots with mismatched signatures from those on file.\n\nRepublicans successfully appealed the decision, securing a reversal in a federal appeals court. Now, voters must sign their unsigned ballots by today. Late last month, Maricopa County reportedly had 11,000 ballots without signatures or with mismatched signatures.\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Daily Poster , here .\n\nJulia Rock is a contributing writer for the Daily Poster .\n\nWalker Bragman is a journalist and JD whose work has been featured in Paste Magazine , the Intercept , HuffPost , the Independent , Salon , Truthout , and the Hill .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

A close look at the money trail shows which sections of capital favor Republicans and Democrats, respectively.\n\nButtons for Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in Flint, Michigan, before a rally on October 4, 2024. (Scott Olson / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFrom one point of view, the aphorism \"you get what you pay for\" does not apply when it comes to US electoral democracy. Enormous amounts of money are spent on elections in this country, but few would say their exorbitant cost is a mark of quality. The total cost of federal elections has increased with each election cycle, but the 2020 election marked a quantum leap in the level of political spending. There was a staggering $14.4 billion in total spending on federal elections, including both presidential and congressional campaigns, in 2020. This was more than double the total amount from 2016, which was itself the most expensive election cycle ever to that point.\n\nBut if you're a billionaire instead of an average voter or small-money donor, the old saying still means something. Earlier this summer, news outlets reported that tech billionaire Elon Musk, whose estimated net worth is over $250 billion, planned to donate $45 million per month to a new pro-Donald Trump outfit called America PAC (both Musk and Trump denied these reports). As of mid-July, the group had already raised upward of $8 billion, largely from titans of the tech world. Its main backer is Joe Lonsdale, who cofounded the software and data firm Palantir with Peter Thiel.\n\nAs for Thiel - who funds much of MAGA-world's political and intellectual apparatus - he must be rather happy with the returns on his political investments. In 2015, he recruited a fresh-faced Yale Law School graduate and soon-to-be best-selling author named J. D. Vance to his Silicon Valley investment firm Mithril Capital. After Hillbilly Elegy went big, Vance moved back to his native Ohio to start laying the groundwork for his political career. Fifteen million dollars of Thiel's money followed Vance back to the Buckeye State, where it boosted his successful 2022 campaign for a US Senate seat. Less than two years later, Trump tapped Vance as his 2024 running mate, capping this Potemkin populist's lightning ascent to the heights of Republican Party politics. At just thirty-nine years old, Vance would be the third youngest vice president in US history if he and Trump win this fall's election.\n\nOne of the biggest themes of the money race so far is the movement of prominent segments of the technology sector into the Republican camp. Thiel has always been there, but several leading Silicon Valley figures who loudly lamented Trump's 2016 election have bought first-class tickets on the Trump train. Their number includes high-profile investors like Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz as well as Chamath Palihapitiya and David Sacks, who as hosts of the All-In tech podcast have become prominent right-wing commentators.\n\nHowever, the tech industry's pocketbook is still largely aligned with the Democratic Party. According to the watchdog group Open Secrets, roughly 80 percent of tech industry donations have gone to Democratic candidates so far this cycle. But that is down from 90 percent in 2020, and if the Trump-Vance ticket prevails in November, it's possible that Silicon Valley's shift to the Right could go from a minority trend to a more durable realignment.\n\nThe driving forces behind this development have to do with both ideology and self-interest, though it's not always easy to tell where one ends and the other begins. Bilious rhetoric against \"wokeness\" fills up the ideological side of the register. Musk recently announced he is moving the headquarters of both X and SpaceX from California to Texas in protest of state laws that protect transgender schoolchildren, though one suspects the move has just as much to do with cost-cutting as genuine conviction.\n\nA recent Financial Times report quotes Palantir executive Alex Karp, a Silicon Valley bigwig who still backs Democrats but whose loyalty is wavering: \"Political correctness in the party is a huge problem, the Democrats can't yet understand the cost of it.\" By the same token, Karp complains that \"people who innovate are fleeing\" the industry because of regulations that supposedly throttle start-ups before they can get off the ground. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler has been a major thorn in cryptocurrency's side. According to one crypto observer quoted by the Financial Times , big crypto investors \"must get him out. They will spend whatever it takes to accomplish that.\"\n\nTech for Trump may garner headlines, but FIRE (finance, insurance, real estate) is still first. As Open Secrets puts it, the \"financial sector is far and away the largest source of campaign contributions to federal candidates and parties,\" and they are far and away the largest source of campaign contributions to Trump 2024. As of July, donations to Trump from the securities/investment industry reached nearly $100 million, with a single donor, the investor and banking family heir Timothy Mellon, accounting for an astounding $75 million (Mellon has also donated $25 million to Robert F. Kennedy Jr's independent campaign). Oil and gas is the next industry on the list, at $13.5 million.\n\nOther top industries supporting Trump include (using Open Secrets' industry categories): miscellaneous manufacturing and distributing ($12.6 million), air transport ($10.5 million), and real estate ($10.4 million). Trump is also attracting enormous donations from individual donors who list their occupation as \"retired\" ($92.5 million) as well as from Republican/conservative ideological organizations ($41.2 million) of various kinds. These figures chime with what we know about today's Republican Party and its core bases of support: ideological conservatives, older voters, extractive and manufacturing industries, and the very upper reaches of the top 1 percent. Nearly half of Trump's donations in dollar terms have come from just four states: Wyoming (19.6 percent), Florida (11.3 percent), Texas (9.9 percent), and California (7.5 percent).\n\nPresident Joe Biden has dropped out of the race, but most of the data we have so far reflects contributions to his campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris will inherit his donor base. Donations to the Democrats also reflect major business interests, including the politically ubiquitous securities/investment industry, but Democratic money is concentrated in a different set of industries and sectors. Moreover, unlike Trump and other GOP candidates, Biden and Democratic candidates generally receive significant contributions from labor unions. Teamsters president Sean O'Brien may have had a prime-time speaking slot at the Republican National Convention, but organized labor remains firmly entrenched in the Democratic coalition.\n\nThe weeks-long Sturm und Drang over whether Biden should drop out of the race shed light on Democratic big-money networks. Many of the megadonors who were most vocally committed to pushing Biden out were from Hollywood, entertainment, and media. George Clooney was the most prominent Tinseltown figure to demand a change at the top of the ticket, but many rich and powerful people without household names were in on the donor strike too. According to one New York Times report, a big-time Hollywood talent agent told Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico: \"If you don't publicly call for Biden to step aside, you are not getting a dime from me.\"\n\nAs of July, the communications/electronics sector, which includes TV, movies, music, and telecommunications companies, accounted for the second largest source of business donations ($21.1 million) to Biden 2024 after FIRE ($44.5 million). Other leading industries donating to the Biden campaign were lawyers/law firms ($12.7 million), education ($9.1 million), and health professionals ($6.3 million). The two largest sources of donations to Biden's campaign as of July were Democratic/liberal ideological groups ($45 million), followed by retirees ($37.2 million). Taken together, labor groups had given about $10.6 million, which outpaced some business sectors but lagged far behind the leading business and ideological groups.\n\nDespite the headlines, Silicon Valley capital remains largely committed to supporting Democrats. Two of the Biden-Harris campaign's top three largest contributors, Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital, are Silicon Valley investment firms. Reid Hoffman, a partner at Greylock and a major Democratic donor, has made no secret of his disdain for Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chair Lina Khan, who has made the mistake of acting on her office's antitrust mandate. Hoffman recently took to CNN to opine that \"antitrust is fine. Waging war is not.\" Khan's fate under a potential Harris administration remains to be seen, and she has strong support among Democrats who praise her for taking a tough anti-monopoly line.\n\nThe intra-Democratic wrangling for influence over Harris's personnel decisions, as well as the wide array of industries and interests in its donor base, coincide with what we know about today's Democratic Party and its core bases of support: ideological liberals, media and tech industries, legal, educational, and health care professionals, and organized labor. Like Trump and the Republicans, the Democratic donor base is highly concentrated in a few states that reflect the geographical distribution of their coalition. Nearly half of Biden's donations in dollar terms came from just three states - California (25.6 percent), New York (9.7 percent), Illinois (5.5 percent), and the District of Columbia (7.8 percent).\n\nIt's fair to ask where all this money actually goes and what difference it makes in terms of electoral outcomes. Readers will not be surprised that the lion's share of it goes to media and advertising. The Biden-Harris campaign spent heavily on the advertising air war. As of July, a whopping 60 percent of its total spending, nearly $65 million, was on media and advertising. Despite this tidal wave of advertising, President Biden's standing in the polls deteriorated to the point where he was pushed out of the race. Moreover, this spending frittered away the Biden campaign's fundraising advantage over Trump, who raised enough money this year to erase the Democrats' cash advantage. (Early evidence, however, seems to show that Biden's decision to step aside has unleashed Democrats' enthusiasm as well as their pocketbooks. The Harris campaign raised a staggering $310 million in July alone, easily topping Trump's $138.7 million haul.)\n\nThe Trump campaign's spending patterns have been more balanced so far. Its leading expenditure is also media, but this accounts for just a quarter of its total spending. It has spent a nearly equal amount on administrative costs, which includes spending on event planning for Trump's signature mass rallies. As of July, a single event planning vendor, Event Strategies, had received sixty-four payments from the Trump campaign, totaling $8.1 million.\n\nPolitical spending constitutes an entire economy of its own, with partisan-aligned firms providing a range of very lucrative services to candidates up and down the ballot. The total cost of the last four federal election cycles topped $40 billion, a figure that does not even include spending on thousands of state and local races. Since the election results are a foregone conclusion in most states, much of that spending is concentrated in a handful of places to move very small margins. Trump's 2016 win depended on 80,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, while Biden's 2020 win turned on a 44,000-vote margin in Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn his classic 1960 book, The Semisovereign People , the political scientist E. E. Schattschneider put his finger on an essential truth of US politics: \"The flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upper-class accent.\" All of us have the right to contribute to candidates and campaigns, but rather few of us have the capacity to do so on a scale that ensures our interests will be represented in the political system.\n\nForty percent of all political donations come from an extremely rarified set: the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent. This is not to say that there are no meaningful differences between the two parties, because there are. To the extent that working-class people find political representation for their class interests, it is through the Democratic Party and its enduring alliance with organized labor. But judging by the state of US society, it's clear that our political system observes its own version of the golden rule: who has the gold makes the rules.\n\nChris Maisano is a Jacobin contributing editor and a member of Democratic Socialists of America.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

It's a fundamental role reversal in US politics.\n\nKamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at the University of Las Vegas on August 10, 2024, in Nevada. (Justin Sullivan / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFor decades, the Democrats were the party that promised to deliver a new, more progressive social order, with a reputation as the party of the angry \" forgotten man \" and of all those who hoped for a new deal. The GOP, on the other hand, was the party of order, stability, and conservatism - the party of the \" silent majority .\"\n\nThis year, those roles are more clearly reversed than ever before. Democrats - acting as the party of order - warn of the destabilizing and chaotic effects of Republican rule. Republicans - acting as the party of radical change - demand a scrambling of the rules of the game. This big shift has accompanied two others: Democrats gaining the upper hand in popular support as well as in the rat race for donors. It's the great role reversal of 2024.\n\nIf Donald Trump's Republican Party is now the party of \"radical\" economic change, as the Financial Times recently warned , it is not radical in anything resembling the left-wing sense.\n\nThe rules of the game it intends to shred are, in the main, those that offer some dignity and hope to immigrants, trans people, women, and other oppressed groups. The change Republicans are after is reactionary in direction: sabotaging the country's excruciatingly slow transition out of a fossil fuel economy, tearing up workplace safety protections and union rights, and handing out a new round of generous tax cuts for the rich.\n\nAnd yet, with Trump slightly but consistently behind in the polls and desperate to win - and in characteristically chaotic fashion - his campaign has also started to articulate a right-wing program for workers. Combined with the air of radicalism hanging over his campaign, of big changes and uncertainty, many will falsely but somewhat understandably see in it a promise for better days ahead.\n\nTrump's right-wing pitch to workers includes: Ending taxes on tips as a way to boost the income of tipped workers, especially in Las Vegas, a key battleground; capping interest rates on credit cards at 10 percent, a means to alleviate the suffering of the millions of Americans for whom easy credit can often be a lifesaver (and a policy lifted , knowingly or not, from Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez); eliminating taxes on overtime work, which would increase take-home pay for those working extra hours; restoring high tariffs on foreign imports, raising the hopes of many in Rust Belt America who dream of bringing industrial jobs back to the United States; an attack on the independence of the Federal Reserve, which Trump blames in part for the country's current economic woes; and an anti-immigrant and pro-fossil-fuel-industry agenda, touted as being part of a jobs plan for working American citizens.\n\nOf course, each item of Trump's program for workers ought to come with the kind of warning one hears on ads for prescription drugs. For instance:\n\nFor years, Democrats have promised to make health care more affordable and to bring back good-paying jobs. Fewer and fewer working-class people believe them. For these voters, a novel program like Trump's - perhaps precisely because experts and elites denounce it so vigorously - could be appealing.\n\nKamala Harris, meanwhile, has tried to be both the candidate of stability - the anti-Trump who will govern with reason and patience - and the candidate of change. It's a hard line to walk. The solution to this challenge that her campaign seems to have settled on is captured in its key slogan: \"We're not going back.\"\n\nThe reference to not returning to Trump's first term is clear, but it is also at least ambivalent about what going forward might look like. \"We're not going back\" is no \" change we can believe in .\" In fact, it has an eerie resonance with the semi-secret slogan of Joe Biden's 2020 bid: \"nothing will fundamentally change.\" Little wonder, then, that as she does her best to reassure Wall Street of her intention to govern to the right of the incumbent president, she's won the support of conservative Republicans like Dick Cheney.\n\nWhat's especially maddening is that when Harris has made concessions to the need to campaign on a bigger \"change\" platform for workers, it's come in the form of getting on the Trump bandwagon rather than aggressively championing the genuinely progressive program laid out by Bernie Sanders at this summer's Democratic National Convention. Trump's plan for abolishing taxes on tips became Harris's plan, too. The Republican commitment to defend fracking to save jobs in Pennsylvania became the Harris commitment as well (despite the fact that no more than twenty-thousand people in Pennsylvania are employed, directly or indirectly, in the industry, and Pennsylvanians are increasingly turning against the practice). Most disturbing, Trump's agenda for cracking down on immigration to reduce job competition has become the Harris agenda also.\n\nDespite all this, Harris's gambit seems to be working to some extent. Deep dissatisfaction with the economy, combined with Trump's position as the candidate of radical change on economic questions may be keeping the election exceedingly close . But it's Harris who just barely leads in most recent estimates of the Electoral College results and in the betting markets, and it's Harris who - setting economic questions to one side and looking at people's general feelings about the race - is seen more in recent polls as the candidate of \"change.\"\n\nFor the forty years from 1968 to 2008, there were at least three clear facts about American politics: First, Republicans were the heavy favorites in presidential elections (the GOP won seven out of ten races in these years, twice in landslides). Second, Republicans were the party of conservatives, standing athwart history yelling stop . And third, Democrats were the underdogs in fundraising, getting outspent by Republicans, sometimes by quite significant margins.\n\nBoth roles and fortunes have changed. Since 2008, Democrats have won three out of four presidential races, and the popular vote in all four. Democratic presidential candidates, not Republicans, had a significant cash advantage (in 2008 , 2012 , 2016 , 2020 , and yet again this year ), while at least in 2016, Trump depended more on small donors than Biden. And the Democrats are now the party fighting to conserve and mend what exists - against a Republican Party that promises root and branch change.\n\nIf what Trump is selling this year is enough to secure him the White House, it will be in part due to the fact that enough angry voters in the middle see him as the candidate who might rewrite the rules of the economy in their favor. And all the warnings from elites about how dangerous he is and about how radical the changes he promises are may only serve to boost many people's confidence that he'll follow through.\n\nOn the other hand, what Trump might soon come to realize - and what the Harris campaign must be counting on - is the truth that has often bedeviled radical parties: the lurch into the unknown is scary. The party of order all too often has the advantage. For some - especially the ideologically committed - drastic change might be a risk worth taking. But for many, \"safety first\" is the natural response to talk of transitions into uncharted territory. And in 2024, that may be good news for Democrats, the new party of conservatives.\n\nNeal Meyer is a member of the New York City Democratic Socialists of America.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nBlackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman on Thursday said the riot at the US Capitol this week was \"appalling and an affront to the democratic values we hold dear as Americans\" - but Schwarzman is one of a number of GOP benefactors suddenly pretending to be shocked and outraged at the mayhem fomented by the politicians they bankroll.\n\nIn the last twenty-four hours, groups like the US Chamber of Commerce and the Koch network's Americans for Prosperity and companies like Chevron have issued similar statements, without acknowledging the role they've played in helping elect the politicians who egged on and fueled the attempt to overturn the election. None of them have pledged to stop funding the Republicans politicians who egged on the insurrection and tried to overturn the election.\n\nThe question now is whether these sponsors will face any consequences for their decisions to fund a political movement that tried to effectively end American democracy.\n\nSchwarzman's case is the most pronounced: the billionaire was one of Wall Street's leading donors to Donald Trump and the Republican machine, ultimately getting himself appointed to a White House business council that shaped federal policies affecting his private equity firm. As Trump's lawlessness and attacks on democratic institutions intensified, Schwarzman became the leading finance industry cheerleader for Trump's reelection, pumping more than $40 million into Republican Party groups and a Trump super PAC during the 2020 election cycle.\n\nBloomberg reported that Schwarzman \"single-handedly accounts for the vast bulk of the reported contributions toward Trump's re-election effort over the past 18 months from people associated with the 31 banks and investment firms that dominate the U.S. financial industry.\"\n\nEven after the election, as Republicans began manufacturing propaganda to pretend the election was marred by fraud, Schwarzman \"defended Donald Trump's response to this year's US poll results during an emergency meeting of senior business leaders alarmed by the president's claims that the election is being stolen,\" according to a Financial Times report .\n\nThe newspaper additionally reported that Schwarzman \"took issue with suggestions made during the meeting that the U.S. could be on the verge of a coup,\" and argued that Trump \"was within his rights to challenge election results.\"\n\nOne attendee later insisted that \"Schwarzman never defended President Trump's assertion that this was an unfair election or a stolen election.\"\n\nDuring the Georgia runoff races, Schwarzman pumped $15 million into a super PAC boosting the Republican incumbents, senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who both said they would support challenging the certification of the Electoral College during their campaigns. (Loeffler changed course on Wednesday evening, while Perdue's term officially expired before certification took place.)\n\n\"Knowing the president's proclivity to lie and incite his followers, Mr. Schwarzman still supported his election campaigns,\" New York Times business columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote after Wednesday's events. \"Should that matter to pension funds and other investors doing business with Blackstone and its companies?\"\n\nIt is a big question, considering Blackstone relies on billions of dollars of investments from state and local pension funds that manage the retirement savings of teachers, firefighters, and other public workers.\n\nPennsylvania's state pension fund, for instance, has paid more than $300 million of investment fees to Schwarzman's firm. He has returned the favor by bankrolling the campaigns of the Republican politicians who have been trying to invalidate Pennsylvania's election and potentially throw out the votes of the same workers whose savings have enriched Blackstone.\n\nIn the last few weeks, Trump officials have tried to pass last-minute rules making it more difficult for private pension funds to pull workers' money out of investment firms based on concerns about the companies' respect for human rights. Public pension funds, however, are not subject to those rules - which means Pennsylvania officials could try to divest from Schwarzman's firm to make sure workers' retirement money does not end up financing a political movement trying to overturn election results and undermine democratic institutions.\n\nPension funds in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Washington state, and other Democratic locales that invest in Blackstone could do the same.\n\n\"Why would public employee pension plans continue to invest in [a] private equity corp like Steve Schwarzman's Blackstone who financed, benefited from & supported Trump & coup plotters?\" tweeted Stephen Lerner, a former top labor union official who is now a fellow at Georgetown University's Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor.\n\nIn addition to Schwarzman, some of the nation's largest and best-known corporations have also bankrolled the politicians who mounted Wednesday's attempt to overturn the election. Popular Information reported that just twenty corporations have spent more than $16 million over the past six years backing the 138 Republican lawmakers publicly committed to rejecting certified Electoral College votes.\n\nAnd corporate titans have routinely funded efforts at the state level to thwart democracy through partisan gerrymandering campaigns and voter suppression laws, The New Republic reported .\n\nCorporations also bankrolled a group that helped organize the protest that precipitated Wednesday's insurrection. Documented reported Wednesday that the Rule of Law Defense Fund, an arm of the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), was listed as one of the organizers of Wednesday's protest. RAGA received hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions last year from Koch Industries, Comcast Corporation, Walmart, Home Depot, Amazon, Google, and other corporate donors.\n\nSome of the companies and organizations that have spent big to elect insurrectionist Republican lawmakers in Washington are speaking out against the riot now as if they have been passive bystanders all along.\n\nWhile billionaire Charles Koch and his conservative dark money network have done more than nearly anyone to paint Congress deep red, his network's political arm, Americans for Prosperity, issued a statement on Tuesday calling on Congress to certify the election. On Wednesday, the group said: \"We join fellow Americans who are watching the violence at the U.S. Capitol with grave concern.\"\n\nAmericans for Prosperity spent $4.6 million to help Missouri senator Josh Hawley defeat Claire McCaskill in 2018. Hawley led the effort among Senate Republicans to challenge certification of the election, and he was photographed raising a fist in support of the insurrectionists outside the Capitol on Wednesday.\n\nThomas Donohue, who leads the US Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday that the \"attacks against our nation's Capitol Building and our democracy must end now,\" and he called upon Congress to \"gather again this evening to conclude their constitutional responsibility to accept the report of the Electoral College.\" Earlier in the week, Donohue had condemned \"efforts by some members of Congress to disregard certified election results.\"\n\nThe Chamber, the nation's top business lobby, spent nearly $5 million backing Senate Republicans this election cycle, according to data from OpenSecrets. That included a $400,000 ad campaign to elect Kansas senator Roger Marshall, one of eight senators who voted on Wednesday to overturn the results of the Electoral College.\n\nThe Chamber spent a combined $1.4 million in support of Loeffler and Perdue's campaigns in Georgia, and it also dropped $2 million in December on a holiday commercial telling people to thank the two senators for fighting for pandemic relief, which they didn't really do .\n\nChevron, which donated $5.4 million this year to party-aligned super PACs working to elect Republican lawmakers, offered up a statement on Wednesday calling for \"the peaceful transition of the U.S. government.\"\n\nAndrew Liveris, the former CEO of Dow Chemical, called the scenes at the Capitol on Wednesday \"tragic,\" saying they brought back \"memories of my lived experiences in emerging economies with coups, brawls in parliament and street violence.\"\n\nIn 2017, before Liveris retired, he donated $100,000 to the dark money group created by Trump allies to promote his agenda.\n\nDavid Sirota is editor-at-large at Jacobin .

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nSo Donald Trump Jr went to the Neshoba County Fair in Mississippi this week, where he said, vis-a-vis the Mississippi state flag, which is the only state flag that still invokes the Confederacy, \"I believe in tradition.\" Those Neshoba County fairgrounds are just a few miles from Philadelphia, Mississippi. The place indelibly associated with the murder of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner in 1964. So that tells you a lot about Donald Trump. Junior and Senior.\n\nBut it also tells you a lot about the Republican Party. Thirty-six years ago, almost to the day, Ronald Reagan, then a candidate for the presidency, also went to the Neshoba County Fair in Mississippi. There, he said, \"I believe in states' rights.\" That, of course, had been the slogan for decades of racial segregation and Jim Crow. Like father, like son; like Reagan, like Trump.\n\nBut it also tells you something about the Democratic Party.\n\nFor Ronald Reagan is the man whose name improbably electrified the Democratic National Convention meeting this week. In another Philadelphia.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Barack Obama said :\n\nRonald Reagan called America \"a shining city on a hill.\" Donald Trump calls it \"a divided crime scene\" that only he can fix.\n\nOn Thursday night, Hillary Clinton said :\n\nHe's [Trump] taken the Republican Party a long way . . . from \"Morning in America\" to  \"Midnight in America.\" He wants us to fear the future and fear each other.\n\nAnd just in case the point wasn't clear, a former official from the Reagan administration enchanted a crowd of screaming Democrats with this one-liner (itself a nod to another DNC one-liner; there's more intertextuality at a political convention than there is in a grad school seminar):\n\nDonald Trump, you are no Ronald Reagan.\n\nSo does any of this matter? Why do I keep harping on the non-newness of Donald Trump , why do I keep resurrecting the multiple precedents for his candidacy against those who would argue for its novelty and innovations?\n\nPart of the reason is that it is an offense against history and memory to pretend that the GOP of the past was somehow a party of reasonable men, clearheaded and basically decent moderates who were taking the car out for a Sunday spin when it all of a sudden it got hijacked by neighborhood toughs and crazed yahoos.\n\nThis is not a new argument with me. I've been trying for years to explain to dubious liberals and skeptical leftists that Trumpism is what this party is all about, that the \"rational, prudential conservatives they think they know are in fact ultra-revanchist songstresses of domination and violence.\"\n\nBut as I've thought about it some more these past few days - why do I keep insisting on these precedents? - it's occurred to me that there is a less historical, less intellectual and scholarly, reason for my claim.\n\nIn this election, we have the opportunity to repudiate not only Donald Trump but Trumpism, and not only Trumpism but the entire apparatus that gave us this man and this moment. That apparatus is the Republican Party and the modern conservative movement.\n\nThe movement and the party that gave us the Southern Strategy, that made white supremacy the major dividing line between the two parties, that race-baited its way to the free market as the dominant ideology of our time, that made hysterical, revanchist militarism the common sense of bipartisanship, that helped turn the Democratic Party into the shell that it is today (with plenty of assistance of course from people like Bill Clinton), that gave us Donald Trump.\n\nWhen we pretend that Donald Trump is an utter novelty on the American political scene, when Democratic presidents and Democratic presidential candidates invoke the reverie of Ronald Reagan against the reality of Donald Trump, when liberal journalists say the contest this year is not between the Republicans and the Democrats but between a normal party and an abnormal growth from an otherwise normal host (with the implication being that if only we could go back to the contests of 2008, 2000, 1992, 1980, 1972, all would be well), we not only commit an offense against history and memory; we not only betray a woeful ignorance of how we came to this pass (and thereby, as the cliche would have it, ensure that we will come to it again); we help shore up, we extend the half-life, of a party and a movement that should be thoroughly smashed and repudiated.\n\n(That, incidentally, is what all the great realignments do: they shatter the old regime, they destroy the ideological assumptions and repudiate the interests that have governed for decades, they send the dominant party and its leading emblems into exile, where they wander in the wilderness for decades.) We make plain our intention to give that party and that movement, even if they should lose in November, a second chance to make their malice and mischief all over again.\n\nSeems like a bad move to me.\n\nCorey Robin is the author of The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump and a contributing editor at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Gage Skidmore / Flickr\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nA specter is haunting the Republican Party. Unlike in the 1980s, it's not \"communism\" or the \"Soviet threat.\" Nor is it \"radical Islam\" or \"terrorism.\" It is Donald Trump, the self-described \"self-made\" billionaire - actually one of the most spectacularly unsuccessful businessmen in recent memory - who has emerged as the frontrunner in the overcrowded race for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nTrump's open xenophobia accounts for much of his popularity among the Republican base - predominantly suburban (and exurban) white middle-class professionals, managers, and small business people, and a minority of white workers. Eschewing what he terms political correctness, he decries the \"rapists and criminals\" supposedly streaming in from Mexico and calls for the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe approach resonates with a broad cross section of the white middle classes. In him they see the consummate anti-politician - a blunt-talking \"man of the people\" who speaks to their fears and anxieties and will restore America to greatness.\n\nTrump's ascendance has stoked panic among the Republican establishment, which is now trying to mobilize its resources to block his nomination. It is bankrolling ads , for instance, that accuse Trump of being unelectable because of his \"extremist views\" and of being a \"closet liberal\" who once supported abortion rights and a national single-payer health insurance program.\n\nThe mainstream media has also latched on to Trump's \"extremism\" and \"electability,\" claims which the Left should greet with some skepticism. After all, Ronald Reagan appeared to be well to the right of the mainstream of US politics in 1980s, and yet proved eminently electable.\n\nOn the Left, two writers - Harrison Fluss and Stanley Aronowitz - recently offered different takes on Trump. For Aronowitz, Trump exposes the role of big money in bourgeois politics. Trump \"lets the cat out of the bag about something the political system has spent more than a century to disguise,\" thereby undermining the legitimacy of representative democracy in America. Fluss, meanwhile, sees Trump as the \"rotten fruit of the American ruling class\" whose ideas are \"no aberration from the mainstream\" of conventional politics.\n\nThere are elements of truth in both interpretations. On the one hand, the ability of Trump and various Super PACs to spend unlimited amounts of money allows small, politically marginal groups of wealthy contributors to so obviously skew the electoral arena that it undermines faith in capitalist democracy.\n\nOn the other, unrestrained capitalist accumulation and competition have brought declining living standards and greater insecurity not only for most working people, but for segments of the middle classes. In the absence of a viable left or labor movement, the precarity that these groups face make them open to the appeals of right-wing demagogues like Trump.\n\nHowever, neither analysis gets at what makes Trump's candidacy both so appealing to layers of the white middle and working classes and so frightening to the Republican establishment. Put simply, Trump and Tea Party-aligned candidates like Ben Carson and Ted Cruz do not represent any segment of the capitalist class in the US .\n\nWhile their hostility to unions and support for brutal austerity and lower corporate taxes coincide with the mainstream of capitalist opinion in the US, Tea Party Republicans in Congress have collided with capital over shutting down the federal government - endangering the credit of the state and capital - and on immigration.\n\nIn 2014, the Chamber of Commerce spent tens of millions to defeat Tea Party candidates in Republican congressional primaries across the country. Yet though many were vanquished in 2014, there were enough who returned to push out John Boehner (R-OH) as speaker of the House, upset at his opposition to using the federal debt ceiling as a bargaining chip to defund Planned Parenthood and slash funding for Medicare and Veterans' pensions.\n\nIn the presidential race, it is likely that the Chamber of Commerce - which represents a broad cross-section of medium and large firms - and the Business Roundtable - which represents the largest, transnational corporations - will attempt to isolate Trump and the Tea Party candidates in favor of Jeb Bush. If that fails, many of the capitalists who support Bush today will be quite comfortable with the leading Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.\n\nOne reason is immigration - a very tricky question for capitalists in the US. Clearly, they do not want masses of immigrants entering the US legally and quickly gaining citizenship rights. However, they are militantly opposed to mass deportations and other measures that would deprive them of a cheap and pliable workforce.\n\nIn 2010, the Chamber of Commerce joined the American Civil Liberties Union and the League of United Latin American Citizens in challenging Arizona's anti-immigrant law (SB 1070), which drove thousands of immigrants to flee the state for fear of arrest and deportation.\n\nIn addition, the Business Roundtable and the Chamber of Commerce have been at the forefront of the push for immigration reform in Congress. Both want some combination of more \"effective border protection,\" a (long and difficult) \"path to citizenship\" for the US's nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants, and a guest worker program for future immigrants that would provide US capital a supply of workers with no rights and no ability to become permanent residents or citizens.\n\nThe Trump boomlet is a repudiation of this agenda. Like the Tea Party, Trump is an example of radical middle-class politics. Caught between a disorganized working class and an increasingly rapacious capitalist class, segments of the middle classes - especially suburban whites in the US - feel insecure economically and socially. They see their livelihoods and social position threatened on all sides.\n\nUnable to directly challenge capital, parts of the middle classes are drawn to a politics that scapegoats immigrants, unions, women, LGBT people, and people of color. The growing right-wing radicalization of the middle classes has fueled the expansion of right-wing formations and figures that are independent of the capitalist classes in a number of advanced capitalist societies: the UK Independence Party in Britain, the National Front in France, the Five Star Movement in Italy, and the Tea Party and Donald Trump in the US.\n\nThis radicalization of the middle classes - what Trotsky once referred to as \" human dust \" - bears some resemblance to the classic fascist movements of the 1920s and 1930s. Genuine fascist elements (white supremacist groups with organized street fighting groups) have been attracted to the Tea Party and Trump.\n\nHowever, neither the Tea Party nor Trump can be described as fascists. Both seek to win power through electoral politics, not abolish elections and representative government. Nor will capitalists in the US, in the foreseeable future, opt for such a far-right option. If the Republican establishment can't stop Trump, they'll likely cross partisan lines and support a neoliberal politician like Hillary Clinton .\n\nThe specter of Trump not only frightens the Republican establishment, but most of the US left. As it has time and time again since the 1930s, the threat of the far right will serve as an excuse for union officialdom and the liberal civil rights, feminist, and LGBTQ establishment to mobilize for Democrats.\n\nBut this solution to the rise of Trump and the far right is no solution at all: embracing \"lesser evilism\" in 2016 would mean yet again forgoing the work of rebuilding the labor and social movements and instead subordinating our radical politics to the Democratic Party. The disastrous result would be that the only visible opposition to the capitalist class would come not from the Left, but from a billionaire businessman.\n\nCharlie Post is a longtime socialist activist who teaches at the City University of New York.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "The Republican Trifecta Looks Complete. What Happens Now?\n\nMother Jones illustration\n\nDemocrats needed to snap up just four seats in 2024 to gain control of the House of Representatives. But today it became clear Republicans would retain control of the House. The results complete a dismal year for Democrats: The House results nail in a Republican trifecta and ensure President-elect Donald Trump will be able to implement his agenda with limited resistance.\n\nRepublicans saw opportunities in two blue states: New York and California-home to 10 of this year's toss-ups . Republicans made significant inroads in each state in 2020 and 2022, leading Democrats to prioritize flipping some of those seats back this cycle. Money flowed to the battles. This year, according to OpenSecrets , the two states had five of the top 10 most expensive House races in the country.\n\nIn New York, Democrats gained back four seats. But their chances fell in California. Across the country-and perhaps to the surprise of Democrats-many communities of color broadly shifted to the right, often saying the economy was not working for them . As my colleague Noah Lanard reported, two California seats, both largely Latino in the southern part of Central Valley, were drags on the opportunity for Dems to take the House. A district with a significant Asian American population in Orange and Los Angeles counties, as I reported, saw a similar dynamic.\n\n\"We're going to raise an America First banner above this place,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a press conference on Capitol Hill, declaring victory on November 12 before more than a dozen seats were decided.\n\nJohnson mentioned policies of a \"common sense\" America First agenda, including secure borders, lower costs, and the end to wokeness and gender ideology.\n\nWe've published a ton of stories on what might happen- an attack on immigration , a crackdown on transgender rights , a reversal of many Democratic environmental policies , and a rethink on education and college affordability .\n\nAnother element to look out for: tax breaks. Through reconciliation, which allows budget-based bills to pass the Senate and avoid the filibuster with a simple 51-vote majority, Republicans will have the ability to propose and pass policies like tax cuts: Many tax cuts.\n\nBreaks enacted during Trump's first term will expire at the end of 2025. While the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent permanently, most tax cuts for households and individuals were short-term.\n\nAccording to the Center for American Progress, an independent nonpartisan policy research and advocacy institute, extending Trump's tax breaks would contribute $400 billion per year to the national debt. Trump has also made other promises such as ending taxation on overtime income, social security benefits, and tips, as well as lowering the corporate tax rate even more, to 15 percent. (The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated some of the additional costs here .)\n\nDespite outgoing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) saying the filibuster will stand the day after Election Day, Trump had repeatedly called for its end in his first term. Republicans could weaken or kill the process and be able to pass any legislation with a simple majority rather than requiring a two-thirds majority to nullify a Democratic filibuster. This would theoretically grant Republican lawmakers the capacity to do whatever they want, creating a sweeping partisan playbook for at least the next two years. It looks less likely after the selection of Sen. John Thune as majority leader.\n\nA Republican majority in both chambers of Congress also prevents Democrats from having any real authority to hold investigations. For the House, committee chairs hold unilateral subpoena power. This would strip Democrats of the ability to conduct inquiries on figures like Trump and those involved in coordinating the storming of the US Capitol.\n\nWith Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, among the first set of decisions will be how to overhaul much of the Biden administration's policies in place of Trump's agenda.\n\nWhile Republican lawmakers elect their House and Senate leaders, House Democrats will have to take time to rethink the next steps of their party.\n\n\"The American people have spoken,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS Mornings on November 12. \"We've got to, as Democrats, work with the incoming administration whenever and wherever possible, and strongly disagree when necessary, and that's going to be the approach that we take.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "It Didn't Start with Trump: The Decades-Long Saga of How the GOP Went Crazy\n\nGuillem Casasús\n\nDavid Corn September+October 2022 Issue\n\nIn May, during an Aspen Institute conference, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told the audience, \"I want the Republican Party to take back the party, take it back to where you were when you cared about a woman's right to choose, you cared about the environment...This country needs a strong Republican Party. And we do. Not a cult. But a strong Republican Party.\" Her comments echoed a sentiment that Joe Biden had expressed during the 2020 campaign: If Donald Trump were out of the White House, the GOP would return to normal and be amenable to forging deals and legislative compromises.\n\nBoth Pelosi and Biden have bolstered the notion that the current GOP, with its cultlike embrace of Trump and his Big Lie, and its acceptance of the fringiest players, is a break from the past. But was the GOP's complete surrender to Trumpism an aberration? Or was the party long sliding toward this point? About a year ago, I set out to explore the history of the Republican Party, with this question in mind. What I found was not an exception, but a pattern. Since the 1950s, the GOP has repeatedly mined fear, resentment, prejudice, and grievance and played to extremist forces so the party could win elections. Trump assembling white supremacists, neo-Nazis, Christian nationalists, QAnoners, and others who formed a violent terrorist mob on January 6 is only the most flagrant manifestation of the tried-and-true GOP tactic to court kooks and bigots. It's an ugly and shameful history that has led the Party of Lincoln, founded in 1854 to oppose the extension of slavery, to the Party of Trump, which capitalizes on racism and assaults democracy.\n\nIn my book American Psychosis: A Historical Investigation of How the Republican Party Went Crazy , I lay out this sordid history in great detail. But even a highlight reel makes it clear that the GOP has bowed to, depended on, and promoted far-right extremists and conspiracists for the past 70 years. Trumpism is the continuation, not a new version, of Republican politics.\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower surrendered to Joe McCarthy on a train.\n\nIn October 1952, Ike, the heroic World War II general who nabbed the GOP presidential nomination running as a moderate, was campaigning in Wisconsin with the nation's No. 1 Red-baiter. Two years earlier, Wisconsin's junior senator had claimed he possessed a list of 205 Communist Party members \"working and shaping policy\" in the State Department. That was a lie. But McCarthy helped trigger a national panic over supposed commie infiltration and became a powerhouse within the GOP. His reckless conspiracy-mongering reached a new height in 1951 when he accused the Truman administration of scheming to deliver the nation \"to disaster\" with an \"immense\" conspiracy. And McCarthy fingered the ultimate villain: George Marshall, the secretary of defense who had helped create the postwar recovery program for Europe known as the Marshall Plan. McCarthy alleged that Marshall was deliberately weakening the United States so it would fall to the Soviet Union.\n\nThis conspiratorial nuttery-designed to prey on Cold War paranoia-struck a chord with millions of voters, and McCarthy was lionized at the GOP convention the following year. Eisenhower believed McCarthy to be a dangerous demagogue and fabricator, and he especially seethed at the attack on his friend Marshall. Yet in the 1952 campaign, Ike was expected to campaign side by side with-and legitimize-this scoundrel who was up for reelection.\n\nEisenhower considered a public strike against McCarthy and had asked a speechwriter to add a short riff to a major speech in Wisconsin that would defend Marshall and assail McCarthy's attack on him.\n\nWhen top Republicans on the campaign train caught wind of Ike's intention, they became alarmed. McCarthy had millions of supporters. Many were Catholic, which gave the GOP an opportunity to break the Democrats' hold on the Catholic vote. Plus, the party might need Wisconsin to win the election. A senior Eisenhower adviser explained this political calculus to Ike. \"Are you telling me this paragraph should come out?\" Eisenhower asked. Yes, the aide replied. \"Take it out,\" Eisenhower commanded.\n\nThat night, in his speech, Eisenhower cautioned against the \"spirit of violent vigilantism\" in the fight for freedom. But he decried left-wing \"contamination\" in \"virtually every department...of our government\" and called for \"the right to call a Red a Red.\" Rather than assail McCarthyism, he sounded as if he were defending it. The Milwaukee Journal observed, \"The general went far toward surrendering ethical and moral principles in a frenzied quest for votes.\"\n\nEisenhower, who decisively won the election, would later regret his decision to cut the anti-McCarthy paragraph. As president, he continued to loathe McCarthy, but refused to directly confront him-though behind the scenes he encouraged criticism of the senator. Eventually, McCarthy's own excesses did him in, and he was censured by the Senate and lost his power and influence. Eisenhower snickered that McCarthyism was now \"McCarthywasm.\"\n\nBut Ike was wrong; others in his party, including his vice president, Richard Nixon, would keep Red-scare hysteria alive. The demagogic promotion of unhinged paranoia had become baked into the GOP's DNA.\n\nOn March 27, 1961, Sen. Barry Goldwater, the libertarian Arizona Republican and conservative hero, wrote a letter to William F. Buckley Jr., the 35-year-old editor of the National Review . Goldwater wanted Buckley to go easy on the far-right kooks gaining sway within the GOP, in particular the John Birch Society. Founded three years earlier by former candy manufacturer Robert Welch, a loon who believed the commies had fully infiltrated every nook and cranny of American life, the society had quickly become a key force on the right and a source of volunteers, organizers, and donors for conservative Republican candidates. Some Republicans feared that these extremists, with their bonkers conspiracy theories, could discredit the party, a concern that intensified when the Chicago Daily News revealed Welch had claimed that Eisenhower was \"a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy.\"\n\nIn his letter to Buckley, Goldwater wrote, \"Let's keep together on this John Birch thing and I would suggest as of now that we allow it to go along for awhile before we take any other steps.\" Mr. Conservative was asking the guru of the rising right to abide Welch's conspiratorial nonsense, even permit it to spread. And in public, Goldwater was supportive of Welch's group, noting he was \"impressed by the type of people in it.\"\n\nIn January 1962, Buckley and other conservative luminaries met with Goldwater at a Florida hotel and further discussed what to do about the Birchers. Goldwater insisted the group contained both \"kooks\" and decent conservatives and was opposed to slamming it. Others in the room wanted to excommunicate the Birchers from the conservative movement. They cooked up a compromise: denounce Welch but not the society. A month later, the National Review blasted Welch's views as \"far removed from common sense.\" But the magazine hailed the society for being the home of \"dedicated anti-Communists.\" Two weeks after that, Goldwater declared that Welch should resign.\n\nThis joint Goldwater-Buckley effort to delegitimize Welch while praising the society was disingenuous. The fundamental mission of the Birchers was to promote crazy McCarthyistic conspiracy theories (Fluoridation was a Red plot!). They were allowing this lunacy to spread, even encouraging it.\n\nWhen Goldwater ran for president in 1964, Birchers enthusiastically donated and volunteered for him. A big boost came from Phyllis Schlafly, a secret member of the society, who had written a book extolling Goldwater. Her slim volume became a key component of the Goldwater campaign. With all this assistance from Birchers and other far-right extremists, Goldwater secured the nomination, and, in his acceptance speech at the GOP convention, famously thundered that \"extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.\"\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson used Goldwater's embrace of extremism to thrash him in the general election, and pundits claimed the GOP and the conservative movement were all but finished. But Goldwater had brought a flood of radicals into the Republican Party-and they weren't leaving.\n\nIn 1968, Nixon had a problem, actually two: George Wallace and Ronald Reagan. Having lost the 1960 presidential race, Nixon was again trying to capture the White House. Nixon worried that Wallace, the segregationist and former Democratic governor of Alabama running as a third-party candidate, would be a magnet for conservative voters and deny him the electoral votes Goldwater had won in the South. Even more immediately, Nixon feared that Reagan, the onetime B-movie star who had won the California governorship in 1966 by exploiting white backlash to the civil rights movement and social unrest, might swipe the nomination from him.\n\nThis led him into the arms of white supremacists. At a May gathering of Southern Republican officials, Nixon pandered, saying he opposed forcing the pace of integration, especially busing to redress school segregation, and favored conservative Supreme Court justices (who would be skeptical of initiatives to advance the rights of Black Americans). He asked the group how to deal with the Wallace threat. You need Strom Thurmond, the arch-segregationist senator from South Carolina, he was told.\n\nThe next day, Nixon met with Thurmond and repeated his song-and-dance routine. Thurmond signed on. He would help Nixon campaign against Wallace and keep Southern delegates from stampeding toward Reagan at the GOP convention.\n\nIn subsequent weeks, Nixon contemplated how best to capitalize on racism. He told his chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, that Nixon could do well with \"ethnics,\" naming \"Irish, Ital, Pole, Mex,\" because \"they're afraid of Negroes,\" and that he intended to ignore the \"Jewish and Negro vote\" and \"go for\" Catholic and Wallace voters. At the convention, Nixon instructed his campaign manager, John Mitchell, to tell Southern party leaders that he would choose a running mate acceptable to the South and would \"lay off pro-Negro crap.\" This was the birth of Nixon's Southern strategy.\n\nWith these assurances-and with Thurmond leaning on the Southern bosses-Nixon blocked Reagan and won the nomination. He chose Maryland Gov. Spiro Agnew, an experienced race-baiter, as his running mate. Nixon proclaimed, \"I won the nomination without paying any price or making any deals.\" That was false. He had won the nomination battle by kneeling before the segregationists and adopting racism as a key ingredient in the GOP'S recipe for electoral success.\n\nReagan eventually got his turn. After being nominated at the GOP's presidential convention in July 1980, his first campaign stop was in Philadelphia, Mississippi-where 16 years earlier the Ku Klux Klan had murdered three civil rights workers. At a county fair, he gave a speech declaring, \"I believe in states' rights\"-the mantra of Southern segregationists. It was an unambiguous sign that Reagan would continue the Republican practice of appealing to racists. A couple weeks later, Reagan deepened his alliance with another extremist constituency.\n\nThe Christian right had recently emerged as a political force, particularly after TV preacher Jerry Falwell founded the Moral Majority in 1979. Falwell had a long history of hatred. In a 1958 sermon, he had railed against integration. More recently, he had waged a crusade to demonize homosexuals, who he contended literally threatened the existence of the United States. Gay people, he said in 1977, would \"kill you as quick as look at you.\"\n\nThroughout the campaign, Reagan courted the new religious right. At the end of August 1980, he appeared at a Dallas gathering of thousands of Christian fundamentalists, including 4,500 pastors, which was underwritten partly by oil tycoon Nelson Bunker Hunt, an ardent Bircher. The speakers' lineup was a who's who of the far right: Falwell, Schlafly, televangelist Pat Robertson, Tim LaHaye (a popular evangelist who had been a John Birch Society member), and others. Christian broadcaster D. James Kennedy warned the faithful that \"1980 could be America's last free election.\" Speakers urged pastors to join a voter registration drive, with an obvious goal: elect Reagan.\n\nReagan advisers Michael Deaver and Edwin Meese fretted over what the fiery Pastor James Robison, an organizer of the event, would say when he spoke just prior to Reagan's address. They urged Reagan to wait offstage. But the candidate strode onto the stage and sat behind Robison. \"There is no possible way that you can separate God from government and have a successful government,\" Robison thundered. He blasted liberals, homosexuals, and communists, lumping them all together into one giant threat to American families. \"We'll either have a Hitler-type takeover, or Soviet dominion, or God is going to take over this country.\" The Christian right had adopted the inflammatory conspiratorial paranoia of McCarthyism, adding liberals and gays to the list of subversive internal threats to the nation. Throughout Robison's speech, Reagan nodded and applauded, and when it was his turn to speak, he threw the crowd a gigantic rhetorical wink: \"I know that you can't endorse me, but...I want you to know that I endorse you.\" The crowd roared.\n\nDuring the campaign, President Jimmy Carter tried to call attention to Reagan's ties to extremists. But the political press accused Carter of being mean and divisive. Reagan's courtship of Southern racists and religious fanatics never became a major issue, and he beat Carter decisively. \"Reagan would have lost the election by one percentage point without the help of the Moral Majority,\" pollster Lou Harris observed. After the election, Falwell entered a victory rally at his Liberty Baptist College, while \"Hail to the Chief\" played in the background.\n\nOn September 11, 1992, President George H.W. Bush appeared before the Christian Coalition and lauded founder Pat Robertson for \"all the work you're doing to restore the spiritual foundation of this nation\"-even though the previous year, Robertson had alleged Bush was part of a Satanic plot. Literally.\n\nRobertson, head of the Christian Broadcasting Network, had competed for the Republican presidential nomination in 1988. During that race, Robertson encouraged his fanatic followers to burrow into state party apparatuses, which they did, gaining control of local party mechanisms in some states, and he promoted a variety of conspiratorial notions, accusing Bush of being allied with a diabolical cabal of international bankers. After Bush triumphed in the primary contest, the GOP handed Robertson a primetime speaking slot at its convention.\n\nThe GOP's embrace of Robertson became a bear hug after he formed the Christian Coalition in early 1990. Though Christian Coalition candidates challenged Republican regulars in local races, GOP bigwigs quickly came to appreciate its organizing might and strategically ignored the inconvenient fact that its leader was a crackpot. Top Republicans, including Vice President Dan Quayle, flocked to the organization's first conference in 1991 to hail Robertson and his troops.\n\nThere, Robertson advanced the far-right trope that America was being annihilated from within, claiming \"elites\" were trying \"to destroy the very society from which they drew their nurture.\" He added, \"There will be Satanic forces...We are not going to be coming up just against human beings to beat them in elections. We're going to be coming up against spiritual warfare.\" According to Robertson, the political foes of the Christian Coalition and the Republicans were directly in cahoots with the devil.\n\nTwo months earlier, Robertson had published a book, called The New World Order , that merged some of the battiest conspiracy theories of the ages. He claimed that secret societies and schemers-occultists, communists, and elites-had for centuries conspired to lock the world in a godless, collectivist dictatorship. The Federal Reserve, J.P. Morgan, the Rockefellers, the Council on Foreign Relations, the United Nations, Henry Kissinger-they were all in on it. So, too, were \"European bankers\" and the Rothschild family (long a target of antisemitic conspiracy theories). George H.W. Bush, he asserted, had \"unwittingly\" carried out \"the mission...of a tightly knit cabal whose goal is nothing less than a new order for the human race under the domination of Lucifer and his followers.\"\n\nGeorge Bush, Satanic dupe-that was Robertson's claim. The Wall Street Journal called his book a \"compendium of the lunatic fringe's greatest hits.\" Yet in search of votes, Bush and the GOP validated this antisemitic and paranoid zealot and signaled to his followers and the world that he and his ideas were worth heeding.\n\nRobertson's troops could not save Bush when he ran for reelection. But the Christian Coalition would become further integrated into the GOP and help Newt Gingrich and the Republicans gain control of the House in 1994. Six years later, Robertson and his group would rescue Texas Gov. George W. Bush when Sen. John McCain threatened to defeat him in the Republican presidential primary. W. welcomed the assistance of the nut who had pegged his dad as Satan's useful idiot.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, a House Republican backbencher summoned conservative activists to the Capitol for a protest and ended up fusing the GOP to a new manifestation of far-right extremism.\n\nEarlier in the year, the Tea Party movement had emerged in response to Barack Obama's election as president. Nominally, its adherents were against his stimulus measure to buoy the economy after the calamitous housing and banking crash. But the Tea Party was shot full of paranoia, racism, and rage. At rallies, attendees waved Confederate flags and claimed Obama was a secret Muslim born in Kenya who was in league with shadowy elites and purposefully trying to destroy the nation so he could impose a totalitarian regime. Tea Partiers, led by Sarah Palin, the defeated Republican vice presidential candidate, falsely claimed Obama's health care reform bill would set up \"death panels\" that would determine whether the elderly and the ill should be allowed to perish. (PolitiFact branded this the \"Lie of the Year.\") Republican officeholders echoed this charge. They also legitimized Fox News host Glenn Beck, an unofficial Tea Party leader who suggested Obama was a \"full-fledged Marxist\" who hated white people, was setting up concentration camps for his political foes, and was creating a \"fascist\" state. Beck was peddling Bircher-like apocalyptic paranoia, and GOP stalwarts were happy to go on his show and help him sell it.\n\nMinnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, another leader of this unhinged movement, suggested the Obama administration was using census information to establish internment camps, and in early November 2009, she urged Tea Partiers to protest the health care bill at the Capitol. Thousands showed up. They carried signs depicting Obama as Sambo. One placard read \"Obama Takes His Orders From the Rothschilds.\" Another equated Obamacare with a Holocaust death camp. At the mention of Democrats' health care plan, the Tea Partiers shouted, \"Nazis! Nazis!\"\n\nYet this crowd was welcomed by the top leadership of the GOP. Present were House Republican leader John Boehner, Reps. Eric Cantor and Mike Pence, and other House Republicans. Boehner, who calculated he could ride Tea Party ire into the House majority and the speakership, affirmed the crowd's fear and paranoia, proclaiming the health care bill \"the greatest threat to freedom I have ever seen.\"\n\nThe GOP failed to block Obamacare, but the Republican Party reinforced and utilized the anger of the movement to seize control of the House in 2010. And Boehner did become speaker-only to find that the new Tea Party-allied Republicans in the House were far-right fanatics who blocked his efforts at cut-the-difference dealmaking on deficit reduction and immigration reform. Five years later, Boehner retired, just steps ahead of a conservative mutiny against him. He had been devoured by the extremists he had exploited to attain power. Boehner and other Republicans had emboldened a nativistic and tribalistic right-wing force that would soon provide a political base for Trump's jingoistic, racist, and demagogic campaign.\n\nThere's a well-established record. For more than 70 years, the Republican Party has stoked animus and conspiracies, often capitalizing on unfounded apprehension about internal enemies subverting the nation. In the 1950s, the foe was Reds. In the 1960s (and beyond), it was Black people demanding social justice and societal change. In the 1970s, the New Right and the religious right claimed liberals and Democrats (and gays!) were plotting to destroy the nation. Tea Partiers asserted Obama headed a sinister cabal bent on turning the United States into a socialist hellhole. Trump and his devotees say the same about today's Democrats.\n\nFrom McCarthyism to the Southern strategy to the New Right to the Tea Party-the GOP told Americans they were being victimized and that their nation was being sabotaged by their fellow citizens. The Republican Party encouraged Americans to believe the worst, and it affirmed the worst beliefs held by Americans. It operated a feedback loop that caused and reinforced animosity. It bred extremism; it cynically profited off extremism.\n\nThere is a great body of academic literature exploring why people believe conspiracy theories, hold fast to false premises, and are susceptible to tribalism and drawn to authoritarians. In 1970, sociologists Seymour Martin Lipset and Earl Raab wrote, \"Right-wing extremist movements in America have all risen against the background of economic and social changes which have resulted in the displacement of some population groups from former positions of dominance.\" Four decades later, political scientists Christopher S. Parker and Matt A. Barreto concluded, \"People are driven to support the Tea Party from the anxiety they feel as they perceive the America they know, the country they love, slipping away, threatened by the rapidly changing face of what they believe is the 'real' America: a heterosexual, Christian, middle-class, (mostly) male, white country.\" In an analysis of Trump's 2016 victory, political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler, and Lynn Vavreck reached an identical conclusion: \"He capitalized on an existing reservoir of discontent about a changing American society and culture.\"\n\nThe GOP hasn't been all extremism, all the time. Goldwater, late in his career, railed against the religious right and supported reproductive rights. As president, Nixon challenged assorted Cold War assumptions and created the Environmental Protection Agency. George W. Bush warned against anti-Muslim bigotry following 9/11. But since at least the 1950s, the party has consistently boosted extremism, prejudice, paranoia, and rage. Sometimes this has led to the GOP prevailing in political battles. In other instances, voters have beaten back this cynical gambit.\n\nThis dark side of the Republican Party has often been obfuscated, allowing Biden, Pelosi, and others to suggest there was once a day when the GOP was an honorable entity. Yet the history is undeniable: The party has consistently sought to exploit the worst of America and foment hate and suspicion. Trump didn't invent this malevolence. He merely turned it into the party's brand.\n\nAdapted from David Corn's American Psychosis: A Historical Investigation of How the Republican Party Went Crazy , which will be published by Twelve in September.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Republican National Convention Was a \"Man's World\"\n\nNate Gowdy/Mother Jones\n\nFormer president Donald Trump walked out onto the floor at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night with a raised fist and a still-bandaged ear, a reminder of the assassination attempt he survived last week.\n\nAs he drew a standing ovation from the nearly 2,500 GOP delegates, a rendition of the hit-song \"It's A Man's Man's Man's World\" reverberated through Fiserv Forum arena.\n\nMan thinks about our little bitty baby girls and our baby boys Man made them happy, 'cause man made them toys And after man make everything, everything he can You know that man makes money, to buy from other man This is a man's world But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing, not one little thing, without a woman or a girl.\n\nIt wasn't just a catchy tune. Throughout four 14-plus hour days reporting at the Republican confab in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the music's lyrics underscored the prevailing attitude on gender norms among the scores of GOP convention-goers I interviewed, the litany of speeches I tuned into, and the half a dozen issue-focused meetings I attended as a member of the media.\n\nFrom the UNC fraternity brothers who were honored on Wednesday for preventing, in their words, \"a mob\" of pro-Palestinian protesters from toppling an American flag on the Chapel Hill campus to famous wrestler Hulk Hogan ripping the shirt from his chest to reveal a TRUMP-VANCE logo in a striking display of machismo, it was men-and ideas on family structure that benefit them-that took center stage.\n\nTake, as a prime example, Trump's choice of a vice presidential running mate. The week before the convention, his shortlist consisted entirely of people with XY chromosomes: Florida Senator Marco Rubio, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, and Ohio Senator J.D. Vance.\n\nOn Monday, Trump selected Vance: a graduate of Yale Law School, the author of Hillbilly Eleg y, a former Never-Trumper, and arguably the most socially conservative of the bunch.\n\nA 39-year-old father of three kids under the age of 8, Vance's deepest convictions seem to center around abortion, marriage, and women in the workplace.\n\nOn reproductive rights, Vance ha s previously called for a federal limit on abortion and has described himself as \"100 percent pro-life.\" He opposes abortion access even in cases of rape or incest, saying in 2021 that \"two wrongs don't make a right.\" He continued: \"What kind of society do we want to have? A society that looks at unborn babies as inconveniences to be discarded?\"\n\nOn marriage, Vance has suggested even domestic violence between a husband and wife shouldn't necessarily elicit divorce. In a 2021 speech to a Christian high school, Vance said that a \"sexual revolution\" has incentivized couples who are \"unhappy\" or \"maybe even violent\" to \"shift spouses like they change their underwear.\"\n\nOn women in the workplace, the new nominee said in 2022: \"If your worldview tells you that it's bad for women to become mothers but liberating for them to work 90 hours a week in a cubicle at the New York Times or Goldman Sachs, you've been had.\"\n\nVance's views on family policy are particularly admired by young Republicans, especially delegates and conservative guests at the convention with whom I spoke.\n\n\"[Vance] may win over a lot of disaffected young males, a lot of people who maybe casually supported Trump, but who weren't planning to actually get out and vote for him. They may be excited by that,\" said Chris Phillips, a Republican at an RNC event for young voters hosted by the nonpartisan Institute of Politics of the University of Chicago.\n\n\"A woman should absolutely have the capacity-and if she doesn't, we should make it so-to raise her kids at home and to be with her kids, especially for the first few years of those kids' lives. It's something that the Republican Party, I think, needs to focus on promoting,\" said Phillips, 21. \"Women or mothers probably have a little bit more of a natural inclination to do that sort of thing. Men probably have a natural inclination to be a little bit more absent and instead go out and be the breadwinners.\" (Phillips added that his beliefs are his own. He's \"not in the business\" of telling other people \"how to arrange their partnerships and child-rearing agendas.\")\n\nTrump conveys a similar message on his 2024 campaign website, saying he would promote \"positive education\" about \"the roles of mothers and fathers, and celebrating rather than erasing the things that make men and women different and unique\" if reelected.\n\nConvention-goers yearned for a time when this sort of family dynamic was more prevalent.\n\nAnnabelle Rutledge, the executive vice president of the group Concerned Women For America spoke fondly of her experience being raised and homeschooled by her mother in Carmichael, California. \"We traveled the country when other people were sitting in their classrooms,\" she told me in front of her organization's Pepto Bismol pink bus. \"It gave us not only a love for learning, but a love for our country as well.\"\n\nAccording to Garrett Weldin, one of the best periods in American history was during the Cold War, when Americans were unified \"against the Soviet Union and communism\" rather than against one another; it was also a period when families had more children and women had a lower participation rate in the workforce. Weldin, a 22-year-old alternate delegate from Delaware, says he'd personally love to have three or four children, finances permitting.\n\nTwice, Weldin called for a future Trump-Vance Administration to enact a \"paid maternity leave\" policy-distinct from the paid parental leave policies that 13 US states have instituted for both mothers and fathers. \"I think that that's something that we should encourage as the Republican Party, because we're supposed to be this party of family values.\"\n\nA 20-year-old intern at the young voters event expressed concern about an increasing traditionalist worldview among conservatives in her age cohort. \"I don't think we live in a time where women are supposed to stay at home and men are expected to be the breadwinners and work outside the home,\" said Simone Nelson, who identifies as a Democrat. \"As a society, I think we have moved beyond that.\"\n\nBut the alternative to a parent or other family member raising kids is typically paid childcare. Of the dozens of Republicans I interviewed, none mentioned a desire for the government to make childcare programs more accessible. Vance has explicitly opposed the concept: \"Normal Americans care more about their families than their jobs, and want a family policy that doesn't shunt their kids into crap daycare so they can enjoy more 'freedom' in the paid labor force,\" he once wrote .\n\nHe has instead offered support for other pro-natalist policy ideas, such as making the healthcare expenses related to childbirth free for parents and protecting those who decide to quit their jobs after childbirth from being hit with penalties from their work-sponsored health insurance.\n\n\"A country that has children is a healthy country that's worth living in,\" Vance said in a 2022 speech.\n\nDuring his primetime slot on Wednesday night, Vance didn't specify which parent he thinks should take care of all those children, but he did signal what he considers the most important role of his wife-a fellow Yale Law School graduate and former clerk to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts-to be.\n\n\"Tonight, I'm joined by my beautiful wife Usha,\" he said. \"An incredible lawyer, and a better mom.\" Two days prior, Usha resigned from her job as a corporate litigator in order to, in her words, \"focus on caring for our family.\" (In his speech, Vance also said his \"most important American dream was becoming a good husband and a good dad,\" though he isn't leaving a strenuous job and instead is seeking an even more demanding one.)\n\nThe 2024 RNC was indeed a man's world: One that many asserted would be nothing without women dutifully supporting them.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Republican Party Is Racist and Soulless. Just Ask This Veteran GOP Strategist.\n\nWoody Harrington\n\nDavid Corn September/October 2020 Issue\n\nWhen Donald Trump decided to back-burner the coronavirus crisis and reboot his reelection campaign with superspreader events in June, he headed to an arena in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to present his case for four more years. In front of an audience of maskless fans standing side by side, Trump performed his usual routine. He threw out buzzwords (\"law and order,\" \"left-wing radicals\"). He boasted. (\"I have done a phenomenal job\" responding to the pandemic.) He denigrated his opponent as \"Sleepy Joe.\" He obsessed over personal grievances and slights, devoting much time to slamming news outlets that had recently shown video of him walking gingerly down a ramp after delivering a commencement address at West Point. What was mostly missing from Trump's speech: ideas.\n\nAlthough he referred to his tax cuts for the wealthy, his appointment of conservative judges, and his \"beautiful\" wall on the US-Mexico border, Trump had little to say about economic policy, national security, health care, education, housing, the environment, and other subjects. Moreover, he offered no agenda for a second term other than vague promises of making everything swell. Days later, during a friendly Fox News \"town hall,\" Sean Hannity asked Trump to spell out his plans for a second term. He replied by rambling on about his inauguration and attacking John Bolton.\n\nAll this was nothing new for Trump, who approaches the presidency more as performance artist than policymaker. But in the Oklahoma crowd were many unmasked Republican senators and House members, who clapped along and looked delighted to be props for The Trump Show . Once upon a time, Republican legislators and party leaders claimed they cared deeply about certain foundational issues-the deficit, family values, free trade, hawkish foreign policy. Now they were cheering a twice-divorced adulterer who had run up the federal debt, sloppily imposed tariffs, and embraced the anti-American autocrats leading Russia and North Korea-a man devoid of serious thought and guiding policy principles, a self-fixated candidate who presented no intellectual framework for his presidency. Had the GOP become the party of no ideas?\n\nBrandon Partin, of Deland, Florida, in front of a flag he brought as he waits for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a campaign rally in 2016. Evan Vucci/AP This seemed a premise worth exploring, so I thought I would check in with veteran Republicans who once were attracted to the party for its conservative ideals but who have become Trump critics. First on my list was Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential bid. I should note that I feel a bit awkward when I talk with Stevens. Plenty of people have asserted that my exposé of the \"47 percent\" tape in 2012 -remember Romney denigrating nearly half of Americans as freeloaders who want the government to take care of them?-played a part in his defeat. But Stevens has always been gracious when we have crossed paths. And this time was no exception. It turned out Stevens had much to say on the current state of his party. Actually, enough for an entire book. Asked if the Republican Party in the Trump years has become an outfit free of governing ideas, Stevens went even further: \"It was all a lie.\" He noted that this was word-for-word the title of his forthcoming book, It Was All a Lie: How the Republican Party Became Donald Trump . The modern GOP, he said, never truly cared about the ideas it claimed to care about. This was a stunning indictment coming from a longtime political consul­tant who had toiled on five Republican presidential campaigns and numerous Senate and gubernatorial races. \"The Republican Party has been a cartel,\" Stevens said excitedly. \"And no one asks a cartel, 'What's your ideological purpose?' You don't ask OPEC, 'What's your ideology?' You don't ask a drug gang, 'What's your program?' The Republicans exist for the pursuit of power for no purpose.\" Throughout his decades as a Republican, Stevens considered this racist element a bug in the system. He now realizes it has been a feature. He huffed that the Republican Party had not merely drifted away from its core positions, as sometimes occurs with political parties: \"Fair trade, balanced budgets, character, family values, standing up to foreign adversaries like Russia-we're all against that now. You have to ask, 'Does someone abandon deeply held beliefs in three or four years?' No. It means you didn't ever hold them.\" He added: \"I feel like a guy who was working for Bernie Madoff.\" Stevens, an erudite fellow who is also a novelist and a travel writer, has become an emblematic ex-Republican. He once believed in GOP ideals and ideas. Now he saw it all as a huge con. His new book is a confession and cri de coeur. The first line is blunt: \"I have no one to blame but myself.\" In these pages, Stevens self-flagellates, calling himself a \"fool\" for his decades of believing-and lying to himself-that the Republican Party was based on \"a core set of values.\" Acknowledging his role, Stevens writes, \"So yes, blame me. Blame me when you look around and see a dysfunctional political system and a Republican Party that has gone insane.\" The book offers one overarching prescription for the GOP: \"Burn it to the ground and start over.\" In our conversation, Stevens exploded with loathing for the party he once faithfully (and lucratively) served. He rejected the common view that Trump had hijacked the GOP. No, he explained, the triumph of know-nothing Trumpism marked the culmination of an internal conflict that had existed for decades between the party's \"dark side\" and its professed ideals. Even William F. Buckley Jr., often hailed as a grand public intellectual and the founding father of the modern conservative movement , was \"a stone-cold racist\" in the 1950s, Stevens pointed out. (Buckley at that time considered white people more \"advanced\" and more fit to govern.) \"A lot of us in the party liked to believe the dark side was a recessive gene, but it's a dominant theme,\" Stevens, a seventh-­generation Mississippian who was named for Confederate Gen. Jeb Stuart, told me. \"And it's all about race. The Republican Party is a white party and there still are more white people than non-white people.\" So that is whom the party aims at-even if this will eventually be a losing proposition as the nation's demographics continue to shift . Ronald Reagan achieved a landslide victory in 1980 by bagging 56 percent of white voters; 28 years later, John McCain lost with 55 percent of white voters. Perhaps the party's fixation on white voters can work one more time with Trump in 2020. \"But we're talking about the Confederacy-literally,\" Stevens said. And Nazi Germany. On his own, with no prompting, Stevens went straight to the Defcon-1 analogy: \"I tell my GOP friends, 'It's crazy to say it's 1934 in Germany...when it's clearly 1936.'\" He insisted that the 1930s are important for understanding the current moment. \"When there was rising anti-Semitism, isolationism, and pro-Nazi sentiment, why did the US not become fascist?\" Stevens asked. \"Because of FDR. Leaders matter, and the GOP has now completely abdicated its role.\" Instead, the party has yielded completely to demagoguery and race-baiting to exploit the racism and resentments of certain white voters. Throughout his decades as a Republican, Stevens considered this racist element a bug in the system. He now realizes it has been a feature. \"They are the Trump Generation. It's how they will be remembered. Like the segregationists of old.\" In 2012, Romney enthusiastically sought and accepted Trump's endorsement, though Trump had been championing the racist birther conspiracy theory. But for Stevens, the decisive moment when the party embraced its ugly heritage came in December 2015, when Trump, then the leading Republican presidential candidate, called for a ban on Muslim travelers to the United States. As Stevens now sees it, Reince Priebus, then the chair of the Republican National Committee, should have declared that the GOP did not support such bigotry and staked out a moral position. Perhaps Trump would still have marched on to victory, but such a move might have distanced the party from a racist candidate. Instead, the party kept mum and eventually folded to Trump. (Romney would go on to be the only GOP senator to vote to remove Trump from office at the end of his impeachment trial.) Stevens now argues that Trump's rise was not a fluke that the party can sidestep or survive. \"This is the complete moral collapse of a governing party of a major superpower,\" he remarked. He wonders how he could have been blind to the GOP's racism and turpitude for so long. \"It is hard to see this when you're in the middle of it,\" he said. \"The only analogy I can find is the collapse of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union, when the difference between reality and what is believed became so disjointed. I should've seen this. I did see this, but I wanted to believe the crazies were a minority.\" Stevens conceded that had Trump not come along, he still might not have been fully aware of the structural immorality of the GOP: The Republican Party was \"a comfortable place for a lot of us. If Trump had lost, I'd probably still be working for a Republican candidate. But Trump made it impossible to deny what the party is. I just don't get why these Republican senators don't stand up to him. What's the worst thing? You'll be an ex-senator? They are the Trump Generation. It's how they will be remembered. Like the segregationists of old.\" It was hard to slow Stevens down as he spoke. He had so much to confess. He forecast a bleak future for the party. Citing the demise of the Repub­lican Party in California (where more voters are now registering \"no party preference\" than Republican), he observed that the GOP was becoming a \"regional/Sun Belt party.\" And he shared his fear that young political operatives working for the party have drawn the lesson that a candidate must emulate Trump to win-that what most matters is not policy ideas but the ability to attack and exploit fears, divisions, tribalism, and resentments. \"Elizabeth Warren can articulate a coherent theory of government,\" Stevens said. \"There is no coherent theory of government for Republicans right now. Usually a coherent theory versus an incoherent theory carries the day.\" \"It's really incredible how this had happened,\" Stevens told me, as I realized I had received far more material from him than anticipated. \"This is the last book in the world I wanted to write. It is tough to come to terms with this, and incredibly depressing. If we say we believe in personal responsibility, you have to take personal responsibility and start with yourself. We created this. It didn't just happen.\" Stevens was not pleased or satisfied with his epiphany: Ideas are not the currency for today's GOP and never truly were. And Trump alone could not be blamed for that. \"Republicans only exist to elect Republicans,\" Stevens remarked with sadness. \"They are down to one idea: How can we win?\"\n\nThis seemed a premise worth exploring, so I thought I would check in with veteran Republicans who once were attracted to the party for its conservative ideals but who have become Trump critics.

      "text": "The GOP Is Recruiting an \"Army\" to Monitor the Vote\n\nElection challengers outside the TCF Center in Detroit, where absentee ballots were being counted, in November 2020. Nicole Hester/Ann Arbor News/AP\n\nTwo weeks from Tuesday, millions of voters across the country will fan out to polling places.\n\nAnd when they do, there will reportedly be a GOP-backed, 200,000-strong army of volunteers watching them. Their task? \" Establish the battlefield \" to challenge the results of the election, should former president Donald Trump lose.\n\nThat's according to a new report in the New Yorker that sheds light on the inner workings of the Republican National Committee's plan -led by Trump's daughter-in-law Lara and Michael Whatley, its co-chairs-to use a giant grassroots group of Trump worshippers to question the integrity of the election.\n\nIn June, the RNC announced that the so-called \"Protect the Vote\" tour would make a series of stops in swing states to \"train volunteers to ensure it is easy to vote and hard to cheat this November.\" (Never mind that research shows voter fraud is quite rare ; that Republican-led gerrymandering has helped enshrine minority rule, as my colleague Ari Berman has covered; and that Trump still refuses to admit he lost the 2020 election-despite more than 60 failed legal challenges affirming that he did.)\n\nAccording to the New Yorker, much of the RNC's strategy relies on indulging supporters' paranoia over conspiracy theories about a Democrat-coordinated campaign to steal the election-via the usual suspects, undocumented immigrants and dead people-and training volunteers to be \"the eyes and the ears of the Trump campaign,\" as far-right Internet personality Jack Posobiec put it. If they suspect fraud, the volunteers are told, they should call the RNC's \"election integrity hotline,\" which a team of volunteer attorneys will apparently answer.\n\nThe irony is that poll watching has, historically, been an important safeguard of democracy. Poll watchers helped implement the Voting Rights Act, for example, ensuring election workers were actually allowing Black people to vote. But experts also say that without clear guidelines-and under Trump's GOP-the practice can help foment Election Day discord.\n\nRecent history offers proof: In 2020, mostly white Republican poll watchers-including five activists linked to the Trump campaign-heckled mostly Black election workers in Detroit and spread disproven rumors of fraud, chanting \"stop the count,\" as NBC News recently investigated . A recent survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that more than a quarter of Republicans-compared with 14 percent of independents and 12 percent of Democrats-believe poll watchers should be armed. And nearly a fifth of Republicans surveyed said that if Trump loses, he should contest the results and do \"whatever it takes\" to assume the presidency-compared with 12 percent of Democrats saying the same of Harris.\n\nThe GOP is not waiting until Election Day to stoke doubt, though: The RNC has already filed dozens of \"election integrity\" lawsuits across the country, which challenge absentee and mail-in ballots and try to make it easier to purge voter rolls and allow local officials to refuse to certify elections, as my colleague Pema Levy recently wrote . As one expert told her, their forethought should be a warning to the rest of us:\n\n\"In 2020, the attempt to undermine election results by the Trump campaign [was] more of an afterthought,\" says Sylvia Albert, who runs voting and election projects at Common Cause, a pro-democracy nonprofit. \"Now it looks like a cohesive party strategy nationwide, and it's not an afterthought. The lesson we've taken is to prepare for it.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "An Honest Republican\n\nAlong the campaign trail, GOP presidential candidates have largely indulged in pandering and scapegoating. Yet, occasionally, each blurts out the truth in order to expose the hypocrisy of his rivals. If the candidates' moments of candor jelled into a GOP platform, what would it look like? Probably something like this:\n\nWelfare : \"The American people will not tolerate cutting off [welfare] benefits for children.... If [Phil Gramm] was proposing that the child would get no support, would have to starve because of mistakes of that child's parents...the American people and I wouldn't support it.\" -Steve Forbes, 9/23/95\n\nTaxes : \"What we did in 1982 and 1983-and certainly, Mr. Forbes would understand this, because he knows all about big corporations and big money-we discovered...a lot of corporations...were ripping off the American public...[for] hundreds of millions of dollars [in taxes]. What we did was close loopholes.\" -Bob Dole, 1/13/96\n\nMedicare : \"Dole owes us an explanation of how he drifted so far outside...Republican philosophy on Medicare. Most of us...believe that a secure social safety net can exist along with...a balanced budget.\" -Phil Gramm, 10/27/95\n\nDemocracy : \"We have a government that does not listen anymore to the forgotten men and women who work in the...factories...and businesses of this country...a government that is too busy taking the phone calls from lobbyists for foreign countries and the corporate contributors of the Fortune 500.\" -Pat Buchanan, 3/20/95\n\nCivil Rights : \"When you talk about racial preference, which I condemn, without condemning racial discrimination, I think that sends a mean-spirited message.\" -Lamar Alexander, 12/1/95\n\nEducation : \"My brother, my two sisters, and I have been able to share in the American Dream because of educational opportunity.... And that's why I think that educational funding, opportunity for the future, is a very, very high priority, none higher.\" -Arlen Specter, 10/11/95\n\nCampaign finance : \"All Republican candidates are millionaires except for me and Alan Keyes. Money does contaminate the process. Disclosure should be everything, and we should do away with all PACs.\" -Bob Dornan, 11/22/95\n\nValues : \"[We act] like the only thing that matters in this country is money. And Bill Clinton will stand up and say that it matters that we take care of the old, and it matters that we take care of the children, and it matters that we care about each other. And you know something? He is absolutely right.\" -Alan Keyes, 1/7/96\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The GOP's Grand Plan: Minority Rule\n\nMother Jones; Macmillan; Nabil K. Mark/Centre Daily Times/AP\n\nIt's been said so often it's almost become a cliché: Donald Trump poses a threat to American democracy. But his authoritarian impulses and hate-encouraging demagoguery are far from the only peril for the nation. Conservatives and Republicans for years have been striving on multiple fronts to weaken democracy by suppressing voter rights and pushing for other measures-such as gerrymandering and placing election boards under partisan control-that undermine majority rule.\n\nNo journalist has been a better chronicler of this nefarious crusade than Ari Berman, the national voting rights correspondent at Mother Jones . Berman, a longtime colleague of mine, has a new book out this coming week that covers the many schemes and plots waged by the right wing to subvert democratic institutions and skew elections in the favor of Republicans: Minority Rule: The Right-Wing Attack on the Will of the People-and the Fight to Resist It . The goal is simple: to amass political power for the GOP, as the party faces demographic shifts that will relegate it to minority status. To achieve this end, the Republican Party and its allies within the conservative movement are rigging the system.\n\nWith this valuable and important book, Berman exposes all the skullduggery and shenanigans of the right that endanger democracy. A few days ago, Berman and I chatted about his efforts to shine a light on the GOP war on America.\n\nIn the first issue of this newsletter, I wrote that Republicans were pushing for \"political apartheid\"-that is, minority rule. In your new book, you write that \"the central threat now facing American democracy is minority rule.\" As many of us know, from the start, there have been institutional features of our constitutional system that bolster minority rule. Then there are measures that Republicans have been trying to implement in recent years to deepen minority rule. Can you give us a rundown on both?\n\nThere's this framework that dates to the founders, who, despite their revolutionary rhetoric, didn't want to create institutions that were all that democratic. A lot of institutions created by the founders were meant to constrain democracy. Even as they've been democratized, you have a situation in which someone can win the popular vote but lose the Electoral College. And each state gets the same number of senators. Wyoming has dramatically more representation in the Senate than California, which violates the principle of one person/one vote. And the Supreme Court is a product of these two skewed institutions. You also did not have voting rights for all. All of these anti-democratic measures were built into the system. Then you have new forms of anti-democratic tactics-like voter suppression and gerrymandering-that are layered on top of this anti-democratic foundation to entrench the power of a conservative white minority.\n\nYou write that the founders put \"a ticking time bomb\" into our democracy. What do you mean by that?\n\nThey created institutions that allowed a minority of the population to control a majority of political power. That idea is directly at odds with the idea that a democracy should be based on the consent of the governed, as laid out in the Declaration of Independence. This is deeply destabilizing because every four years, for example, with the Electoral College, the majority can vote one way, and the minority can vote the other way and still manage to take power. These things are becoming increasingly explosive because in Donald Trump you have an authoritarian leader trying to take advantage of them.\n\nIn terms of the ticking time bomb metaphor, you mentioned how the small rural states have disproportionate power. That might have made sense at the time when the largest of the 13 original states was only so much bigger than the smallest. But as we've grown as a nation, the disparity has become gigantic. Eventually, you'll have a handful of small states having so much more power than the more populous states.\n\nIn 1790, the country's largest state, Virginia, had 12 times the population of the smallest state, Delaware. Today, California, the largest state, has 67 times the population of the country's smallest state by population, Wyoming. Conservatives love to quote the founders and say this is what they intended. But the architect of the Constitution, James Madison, hated the idea that every state got two Senate seats. He said it was going to allow a trifling minority to control the Senate. That's what's been happening. By 2040, roughly 70 percent of Americans will live in 15 states with 30 senators. That means that 30 percent of America is going to elect 70 senators. The Senate, based on how it is set up, guarantees minority rule.\n\nOne thing that caught my attention in the book is that just a very small cadre of right-wing activists are orchestrating this assault on democracy.\n\nThis crystallized after the 2010 election, when Republicans flipped the legislatures in key swing states, and then they gerrymandered to maintain power for the next decade and beyond. There was a small circle of anti-democratic activists who predated Trump and who radicalized the Republican Party before Trump, and they wanted the Republican Party to be defined by restricting voting rights and extreme gerrymandering. The election of Barack Obama in 2008 was the tipping point where Republicans saw the changing demographics of the country working against them. And they said, we need to do something to make sure that these changing demographics don't yield a new political majority and drive our party, a largely white party, into extinction. I think that's what pushed the Republican Party into a more anti-democratic direction.\n\nWhat are the most egregious and outrageous anti-democracy laws and rules that have been recently enacted or that are in the works?\n\nGod, there's so many. The Texas legislature last year passed a law that gave the GOP secretary of state the power to take over elections only in one county in the state-in Harris County, one of the most Democratic counties in the state, which includes Houston. They said, we're only going after this one county. North Carolina Republicans passed a law that took away the ability of the state's Democratic governor to appoint a majority of the members of county election boards. These boards decide things like early voting. They could decide that instead of 20 early voting sites, there will only be one in a huge urban county. They also took the power to certify elections away from those boards and gave it to the Republican-controlled legislature. If they don't like the fact that Joe Biden wins the state, they could try to overturn that result. Voter suppression has always been there for Republicans, but now they're layering elections administration on top of voter suppression. They're trying to suppress votes on the front end. But if that doesn't work, they're going to do it on the back end.\n\nLet's turn to voter ID laws and let me be a devil's advocate. For many, it may sound reasonable that people should have to show official ID when they vote-a driver's license or some other government-issued ID-like you need to get on a plane. What's the problem with these laws?\n\nIt seems reasonable. But if you dig deeper on the numbers, it impacts some communities more than others based on how the laws are written and implemented. For example, there's a law in Texas that allows you to vote with a gun permit, but not a student ID. That clearly seems targeted at some people more than others. Alabama passed a voter ID law, and it closed DMV offices in the majority of the counties where the majority of the Black population lives. So the place where you would go to get the ID no longer exists in these counties.\n\nFor 90 percent of the public, voter ID is not a big issue. But for the 10 percent of the public that may not for one reason or another have this ID, it can be burdensome. And then you need underlying documents like a birth certificate to get that ID. That requires money and time. Texas closed a third of DMV offices after they passed a voter ID law. Some people have to travel 200 miles or more just to get to a local DMV.\n\nRepublicans make it seem like it's all about voter ID. But there are other things they're trying to do. They're attempting to cut early voting. They're trying to eliminate Election Day registration, purge people from the voting rolls, and close polling places. This isn't just about requiring a form of identification. This is about changing all sorts of voting systems that appear to benefit one party over the other.\n\nAre President Joe Biden and the Democrats doing enough to identify and counter these threats to democracy?\n\nThe Democratic Party has become more aggressive about countering these threats to democracy, but the Democrats are not as pro-democracy as the Republicans are anti-democracy. There's still asymmetric warfare going on. After the 2020 election, Republicans in every state legislature they controlled passed legislation to make it harder to vote. Democrats didn't pass any legislation to protect voting rights. That was largely because two people on the Democratic side blocked it: Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin. And Joe Biden was slow in embracing the cause of changing the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. But Democrats have been more aggressive recently. Biden has made the preservation of democracy the centerpiece of his 2024 campaign. He's tried to elevate this issue and often has been mocked for it, with a lot of pundits saying people don't care about democracy. That clearly is not true based on how they voted in recent elections.\n\nThere's a line that conservatives like to push: America is not a democracy, it's a republic. You hear this repeatedly. Explain what they mean by this, and why they're wrong.\n\nYou hear it from Republican Sen. Mike Lee and John Eastman, and all these people who were behind the insurrection, and conservative activist Cleta Mitchell-that America was never set up to be a democracy and was always supposed to be a republic. And that justifies them violating majority rule and pushing anti-democratic measures. I traced this idea back to the John Birch Society.\n\nThese were far-right kooks who believed that 70 percent of Americans were communists in 1959. They thought that there was a communist conspiracy that included President Dwight Eisenhower and that there were Russian weather machines.\n\nAnd you couldn't put fluoride in the water because it would poison you. They were influential in the '50s and early '60s. The John Birch Society pushed this idea that we were a republic not a democracy because that was their way to oppose the civil rights movement and the granting of new rights to formally disenfranchised communities. The founders didn't want a direct democracy, like in ancient Greece, because they thought that direct democracy led to mob rule. But they wanted to create a representative democracy, in which you would have representatives who they believed would be wiser and more thoughtful and more careful and who would represent the views of their constituencies. The representative democracy the founders set up was very flawed. But the point is, they didn't say we're not a democracy. They said clearly that we're a representative democracy. And it's the representative part that is always missed by the people who say we're not a democracy. But they invoke this mantra to justify all sorts of anti-democratic tactics.\n\nSome right-wingers have recently even talked about getting rid of the direct election of US senators.\n\nYes, and there's a Republican gubernatorial candidate in North Carolina saying women shouldn't be able to vote. Trump created this climate with the insurrection and the effort to overturn the election, so anything goes now. What can you do that's worse than try to overturn the election? If that becomes normalized, it's a free-for-all in terms of anti-democratic action.\n\nWe used to think that making it harder for some people to vote was outrageous. But compare that to attacking the Capitol...\n\nThat's what's been so disturbing about the work I'm doing. I started as a journalist writing about barriers to the ballot box, and you're talking about a few thousand people being prevented from voting. Then Trump shows up and tries to throw out 10 million votes in the 2020 election. When you think about it, the level of anti-democratic actions we have seen is way beyond what any of us could have imagined a few years ago.\n\nWhat are your biggest worries for the 2024 election?\n\nThat the anti-democratic movement that was unsuccessful in 2020 will be successful in 2024. They are now more strategic, and they are now being helped by a political system that advantages more conservative and more rural areas as opposed to more urban, more diverse, and more progressive areas. I'm concerned about the toxic combination of an undemocratic political system and an authoritarian leader who wants to take advantage of that political system. I wonder whether our institutions will hold again. Are we a democracy if we're only relying on one party to uphold democracy? That seems a dangerous situation. What if the only party that will uphold democracy becomes unpopular for any number of reasons?\n\nA lot of people feel like we dodged a bullet in 2020. But the gun is being reloaded right now. The effort to overturn the election in 2020 was disorganized. The anti-democratic movement is now more organized. It has a leadership and marching orders and people at all levels. If they want to stage an insurrection, they could stage a much more organized insurrection the second time around.\n\nFinally, you and I shared a small office a long time ago in Washington, DC, when we both worked for the Nation . Any stories about that you want to tell?\n\nHere's what I remember: You watching cable news constantly, every minute of the day on the tiniest TV that I'd ever seen. You talked to Mike Isikoff 16 times a day-\n\nWe were working on a book together-\n\nYeah, and you didn't like me until you realized that I liked Wilco. Your attitude was, who's this guy [ Nation editor] Katrina vanden Heuvel sent down here? What's he doing? And then you mentioned you were going to see Wilco, and I said, \"I like Wilco.\" And the next day, you said, \"Sorry, I don't have an extra ticket. But, you know, next time.\" The fact that I liked Wilco, The Wire , and Curb Your Enthusiasm -that was enough to endear me to you eventually.\n\nWell, those are all very important things and I stand by my decision.\n\nYou can read a wonderful excerpt of Berman's compelling book here .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Hundreds More Former GOP Officials Endorse Harris\n\nHundreds more Republicans say they'll be voting for Harris in November. Mother Jones; Carol Guzy/ZUMA; USA Today\n\nThe trend continues : Republicans are defecting from former President Donald Trump in droves.\n\nMore than 200 Republican officials who once worked for former President George W. Bush, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), and the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the presidency and warned of the dangers of a second Trump term in an open letter released Monday.\n\nThe letter, first reported by USA Toda y, outlines both the foreign and domestic dangers of a second Trump term: \"At home, another four years of Donald Trump's chaotic leadership, this time focused on advancing the dangerous goals of Project 2025 , will hurt real, everyday people and weaken our sacred institutions,\" the group wrote. \"Abroad, democratic movements will be irreparably jeopardized as Trump and his acolyte JD Vance kowtow to dictators like Vladimir Putin while turning their backs on our allies. We can't let that happen.\"\n\nThe signatories range from former volunteers, interns, and assistants to onetime high-level officials in the White House and Senate, including Jean Becker, former chief of staff for 24 years to George H.W. Bush; Joe Donoghue, Senate stalwart and McCain's former legislative director; and David Nierenberg, national finance chair for Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. \"Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That's to be expected,\" they wrote. \"The alternative, however, is simply untenable.\"\n\nSteven Cheung, Trump's spokesperson, said in a statement provided to Mother Jones : \"It's hilarious because nobody knows who these people are. They would rather see the country burn down than to see President Trump successfully return to the White House to Make America Great Again.\"\n\nRomney already said earlier this year he would \"absolutely not\" vote for Trump, but he does not appear to have publicly said who he will vote for. The New York Times reported in 2020 that Bush would not be voting for Trump, citing \"people familiar with [his] thinking\"; Bush does not appear to have addressed the topic thus far for the upcoming election. Spokespeople for Bush and Romney did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Mother Jones . McCain withdrew his support for Trump in the 2016 election after the Access Hollywood tape leaked in which Trump bragged about committing sexual assault .\n\nThe dissent within Republican ranks comes just days after several prominent Republicans-including some ex-Trump officials-sang Harris' praises at the Democratic National Convention and urged conservatives to vote for her over Trump. On Friday, a dozen former White House lawyers who served under three Republican presidents-both Bushes and Ronald Reagan-also endorsed Harris over Trump, alleging that he would \"threaten American democracy and undermine the rule of law in our country,\" Fox News first reported . And as I reported earlier this month, the Harris campaign launched a group aimed at wooing Trump-skeptical voters to their ticket. A Harris-Walz campaign official pointed to these examples as proof of how the campaign has conducted outreach to moderate and independent voters.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, seems to have trouble garnering support from his former staff, let alone from people across the aisle. According to a report published in the Washington Post earlier this month, only about half of Trump's former cabinet has openly endorsed his reelection bid.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Why the GOP Can't Quit Donald Trump (Hint: Look at Its History)\n\nAlex Brandon/AP\n\nIf only the Republicans could get rid of Donald Trump, it could return to normal. This is a common refrain they you often hear from pundits and members of the political class, or maybe from a relative or friend. Trump, in this view, is a dangerous aberration, and all that is needed to de-Trumpify the GOP is for Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, and other establishment Republicans to display some guts, coalesce behind another GOP 2024 contender, and give the indicted ex-president the boot. Such a sentiment is both magical thinking and ahistorical.\n\nIt's a fantasy because a majority of the Republican base-tens of millions of Americans-remain enthralled with Trump. Have you seen the \"Trump or Death\" banners ? These cultists cannot be herded by GOP graybeards into another camp. For them, Trump is a theology, and you can't challenge faith with facts. After the Trump-incited January 6 riot, McConnell and McCarthy took baby steps toward nudging the party out of Trump's clutches, but they soon realized their voters were sticking with Trump and his lies about the 2020 election and everything else. They turned tail. As recent polls show, a majority of Republicans desire a Trump restoration. For the GOP deep state, resistance is futile. To move against Trump would ignite a civil war within the party. That's not a battle the Washington sticks-in-the-mud would likely win. And they certainly are not martyrs.\n\nThe dump-Trump-and-return-to-your-father's-GOP sentiment is also an affront to history. I can say that with confidence, having written American Psychosis: A Historical Investigation of How the Republican Party Went Crazy , a New York Times bestseller that is coming out this week in a new and expanded paperback edition. One key point of the book is that your-father's-GOP is largely a myth. Trumpism-or a version of it-has been a critical part of the Republican Party for seven decades. As American Psychosis shows, since the 1950s, the GOP has always encouraged and exploited extremism. Through McCarthyism, Barry Goldwater's alliance with the nutjobs of the John Birch Society, Richard Nixon's Southern Strategy partnership with racists, the New Right and the Religious Right, Reaganism, both George Bushes' embrace of antisemitic conspiracy-monger Pat Robertson, Newt Gingrich, Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, Sarah Palin, the tea party, and, finally, Trump, the party has long nurtured a relationship with far-right radicals, bigots, fundamentalists, and, yes, kooks. It did so by recklessly and relentlessly stoking the paranoia, fear, resentments, and grievances of conservative voters.\n\nOften this was considered a side-hustle by the GOP establishment, an action necessary to achieve electoral victories that would then allow its officials to govern in a more respectable manner. Court the wingnuts during the campaign but then return to Washington as responsible statesmen. Think of Mitt Romney in the 2012 race enthusiastically accepting Trump's endorsement, even though Trump was best known politically at the time as the champion of the racist birther conspiracy theory. (A former Romney aide tells me that seeking Trump's embrace was considered a necessary evil to bolster Romney's standing with right-wing GOP voters and that after it was secured the campaign wanted nothing else to do with Trump.) But then Trump came along as a candidate in 2015 and tossed all pretenses aside. He made outreach to the extremists a central component of his campaign. He even went on Alex Jones' show to talk directly to the wackos.\n\nTL;DR for American Psychosis : The GOP's relationship with hatred and conspiracism did not begin with Trump. Consequently, yearning for the good ol' days-like when the House GOP made Rush Limbaugh, a super-spreader of fear and loathing, a honorary member of its caucus?-is misplaced nostalgia. Put another way, the roots of the GOP's present troubles-which bore the poisoned fruit of Trump-are deep and have long been in place. There is no clean ground to which to return.\n\nWhen the book was first published last year, I knew that the Trumpers wouldn't pay it any attention. But I wondered how the small band of anti-Trump Republicans would receive it. Could they concede that many of the elements of the Trumpified GOP that they now despise were present decades before Trump seized control of the party? After all, nothing comes from nothing. Trumpism was not the political equivalent of the Big Bang.\n\nAs I made the rounds of talk shows and podcasts, I found that some recovering Republicans were able to acknowledge that there had been a rottenness within the GOP that predated Trump and that he was able to deftly exploit. Charlie Sykes, a prominent conservative talk show host and author, called American Psychosis \"a searing and deeply reported account of how a major political party binged on crazy pills for decades,\" endorsing its core theme.\n\nI was especially interested in how Joe Scarborough, co-host of MSNBC's Morning Joe, would react. A former Republican House member from Florida who served during the so-called Gingrich Revolution, he had been a consistent critic of Trump and had said goodbye to the GOP in 2017. How would he take to the notion that the road to the Trumpism he deplores was paved by crass and cynical GOP actions over the years that fueled hatred and validated extremism for political gain?\n\nOn air with him, I  laid out this basic thrust of American Psychosis. Scarborough responded, \"I'm going to get around to agreeing with you at the end but be patient with me at the beginning. You're going to think I'm preaching a moral equivalence. I'm not.\" I prepared for battle. Usually when someone says they are not about to engage in moral equivalence, that's precisely what they are about to do. I thought that he was going to resort to the simple-and wrong-argument that \"the other side does it, too!\" That is, the libs and Dems can be just as nutty and extreme as Trump Republicans and their devotees.\n\nIn the book, I countered that argument and showed that there has been an asymmetry in American politics. No prominent national Democrats have ever engaged in anything like McCarthyism, embraced an outfit as extreme and irrational as the John Birch Society or the tea party, or promoted paranoia-driven conspiracy theories that demonize and dehumanize political opponents. In my mind, I began to compose a retort to Scarborough.\n\nHe continued:\n\nBut I am saying that we have been a nation over the past 50, 60, 70 years that has been paranoid whether it's conspiracy theories around JFK's assassination or Neil Armstrong walking on the moon or Democrats saying that George H.W. Bush and the CIA took crack into inner cities to harm Black people or whether it was the truthers after 9/11. We have dealt with this. And sometimes it's come from the left and sometimes it's come from the right.\n\nOkay, here we go, I thought. Show me one Democratic president who encouraged any of this. Or one who welcomed into his political coalition a group that included leaders who declared Americans who engaged in private conduct that they deemed immoral should be executed-as Ronald Reagan did when he forged a close relationship with the Moral Majority, which was led by ministers who said that under \"God's word\" gay people could be killed for engaging in homosexuality. I kept listening:\n\nWhat disturbs me so much now are the very people that I knew best, the people that worked with me on my campaigns, starting in 1994...were people that actually...they watched news. They saw the news. You could have a conversation with them. They might say something crazy to you, and I'd say, \"Well no, no, you need to read this.\" And they'd read it, and they'd be fine. Now I talk to those people, and they say, \"I don't read the news anymore. I just don't follow it because you just can't trust the mainstream media.\"...They get [their information] from QAnon. They get it from Chinese religious cult websites. They get it from the most bizarre places... We are now in a post-fact world. I can't even talk to a lot of friends and family members and people I care so much about and I have for my whole life... Tell me about that development because, by the way, I've been in the Republican Party until about five years ago. It was never this bad. How did it get this bad?\n\nA tone of pain was in Scarborough's voice, as he shifted course to note that the conservatives and Republicans in his world had gone bonkers or become captured by fringe conspiracism. I wanted to make sure that no viewer could interpret his initial comments as an argument of equivalence and explained that though conspiracy theories and wacko ideas have existed on both the right and the left, the GOP, not the Democrats, had taken advantage of this for decades.\n\nI agreed with him that \"things have gotten worse\" on the Republican side but added that one could look to the 1950s and McCarthyism to see that this embrace of irrationality and paranoia has long been part of the Republican brand. Given the history covered in my book, present-day Republicans cannot portray recent developments in the party as an exception. There needs to be accountability for how the GOP has long galvanized extremist forces.\n\nScarborough cut in and noted that not a single Democratic leader fed the 9/11 conspiracy theory that George W. Bush was behind that horrific attack or allowed it to happen. He then referred to an episode that kicks off an early chapter of American Psychosis : When Dwight D. Eisenhower was running for president in 1952, he spent a day campaigning with Sen. Joe McCarthy in Wisconsin, McCarthy's home state. He considered adding to a speech he would give that evening a brief denunciation of McCarthy and his reckless Red-baiting. Yet top GOP officials, horrified at the idea of castigating a Republican whose outlandish and fact-free conspiracism was resonating with millions of fearful voters, persuaded Ike not to do it. Instead, Eisenhower delivered an address that echoed McCarthy's demagoguery.\n\nScarborough noted that Eisenhower passed on the chance to condemn McCarthy and McCarthyism: \"Ike is a hero of mine... [He] refused to say a damn thing about it, and there are parallels to that and where we are today.\"\n\nBingo. I pointed out that this Eisenhower moment might be considered the \"original sin\" of the modern GOP, when a leader went along with craziness that he knew was both wrong and dangerous for the nation because of \"political transactionalism.\" Scarborough agreed. \"And after that point,\" I added, \"it happened again and again and again in the party you once loved.\" Scarborough replied, \"Yep.\"\n\nThe conversation moved on. (You can watch the entire exchange here .) So Scarborough had been correct in his prelude. He had not resorted to a false argument of moral equivalence. He did not challenge my charge that decades of Republicans accommodating and exploiting extremism led to the triumph within the party of Trumpism.\n\nComprehending this history is crucial for understanding the present moment and the political crisis that grips America. Crisis? Yes, it's a crisis. A fellow who tried to overturn an election, who incited insurrectionist violence to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, who has called for suspending the Constitution, who has endorsed the batcrap crazy QAnon conspiracy theory, who has vowed to lock up his political foes, and who has declared his authoritarian intentions is at this moment an even-money bet to win the 2024 election. Despite this peril, there persists within the political media world that notion that it might be possible to bounce Trump, flip a switch, and return the GOP to its days of presumed non-craziness. American Psychosis shows that is improbable. There has never been a time when the modern GOP was free of hateful and irrational extremism.\n\nTwo years after the Trump virus caused a violent eruption that threatened American democracy, little has changed within the party-and its base. Millions of Trump-worshipping Republicans still believe that the 2020 election was rigged and that January 6 was a false flag operation. Should Trump disappear from the scene today, this irrationalism-this psychosis-will not vanish. He's not the cause of the GOP's sickness; he's the symptom. If that is not fully recognized, there will be no effective treatment or cure.\n\nThis essay was adapted from an article that appeared in David Corn's Our Land newsletter.

      "text": "A Large Percentage of Republican Primary Voters Can't Stomach Trump\n\nSteve Helber/AP\n\nFormer President Donald Trump easily swept to victory in a handful of additional Republican caucuses this weekend, looking ever more imperious in his bid for the GOP nomination. But new data from the Associated Press suggests his easy victories are hiding a serious potential problem: Never Trumpers aren't changing their minds.\n\nThe AP reported on Sunday that even though a huge majority of Republicans appear to be enthusiastically on board with Trump, a significant fraction of those who voted in the first three GOP nominating contests say they will never vote for him in the general election. According to the analysis of Republican voters, 2 in 10 Iowa voters, 1 in 3 New Hampshire voters, and one quarter of South Carolina voters said they would not vote for Trump. While those numbers aren't huge, Trump needs every last vote to do better than he did in 2020 when-as he often denies-he lost to Joe Biden.\n\nThe AP report did find, however, that just because those voters said they didn't want to vote for Trump-ever-it didn't mean they were Biden voters.\n\nAs gloomy as the AP's findings were for Trump, Biden got his own bad polling breakdown news on Sunday as well. The New York Times released its own analysis of polling data that said 47 percent of Biden's voters strongly agree that he is too old to be an effective president, and another 26 percent somewhat agree. Biden, who is 81, is battling voter perceptions that he is too elderly and possibly senile to be president. In a sign of the times in which elderly politicians are the norm ( the median age for U.S. senators is 65 and House members is 59 ), Trump comes out relatively in better shape in the NYT poll, with only 42 percent of his own voters agreeing that he is too old to be an effective president.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Republicans are sleepwalking into a midterm disaster. Wisconsin should be a wake-up call.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nDonald Trump doesn't like losers. So one has to wonder what he is thinking after Elon Musk, his biggest political donor, fell flat on his face in an attempt to prop up a MAGA-backed candidate in this week's Wisconsin Supreme Court race.\n\nWhile it's important not to overthink the results of an off-cycle election, Trump and Musk's embarrassing loss is a warning sign for Republicans ahead of next year's midterm elections.\n\nIt came at an unfortunate time, as Trump announced massive across-the-board tariffs that spooked Wall Street, leading to the biggest one-day loss since 2020. Two Florida Republicans also underperformed in special elections for House seats, raising concerns among Republicans about their narrow majority.\n\nBut Wisconsin was the clearest signal of the looming danger for Republicans.\n\nMusk overplayed his hand. The tech tycoon and his super PAC poured tens of millions of dollars into the race, but all that money could not stop the growing pushback against Trump's trail of destruction. Despite Musk's efforts, voters elected state Circuit Judge Susan Crawford to the state's Supreme Court, maintaining the court's 4-3 liberal majority.\n\nThe victory wasn't easy. Trump beat former Vice President Kamala Harris in Wisconsin by less than 1 point , making it the closest state race in the 2024 presidential election. Yet Crawford defeated Trump-endorsed Brad Schimel by 10 points .\n\nTuesday's election in Wisconsin is not the only sign that Republicans need to read the writing on the wall: Trump and Musk's DOGE tactics are toxic in the minds of voters. While GOP candidates won both special elections for two House seats in Florida, Democrats cut into the margin of victory in each race by double digits. By sticking with Trumpism and enabling an unelected billionaire, the Republican Party has exposed itself to a possible bloodbath during the 2026 midterms.\n\nI know a thing or two about winning tough races. I served as chairman of the Republican National Committee during the 2010 midterms, when a \"Republican wave\" changed the power dynamics in Washington and state capitals across the country. But 2010 didn't start out that way. It came about because of a concerted effort to take advantage of an incumbent president's missteps.\n\nIf I were a state Republican chairman looking at Tuesday's election results, here's what I would be thinking: First, voters are already sick and tired of all the chaos Musk has unleashed across America. Trump will be left to clean up the mess that Musk leaves behind on every aisle. Voters will blame the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers who didn't stand up to Musk. The Republican Party needs to understand this reality.\n\nWe're already seeing voters express their anger at town halls, and GOP leadership asking Republicans in Congress not to meet with their constituents doesn't help. Republican candidates are stuck with the Trump brand if they don't offer the electorate an alternative path.\n\nRepublicans in tight House races must differentiate themselves from Trump.\n\nThat brings us to my second point: Republicans in tight House races must differentiate themselves from Trump. They can only do that if they're more concerned about what their voters want instead of what Trump thinks of them. However, since Republicans seek Trump's endorsement to win primaries, it becomes nearly impossible for them to distance themselves from his damaging policies.\n\nIt will take individual candidates who are not afraid to draw stark contrasts between their vision for American families and whatever politics Trump is playing. If they are successful, it creates a lane for a new generation of GOP candidates to rise above Trump's stranglehold on the party.\n\nLastly, Democrats have a role to play if they get out of their own way. Republicans have been masterful at defining the Democratic Party. It's now time for Democrats to define exactly what this Republican Party is. Voters are just starting to process the chaos, the mixed messages, the damage to institutions and the growing sense of insecurity surrounding Trump's second term. This can't be a missed opportunity. Democrats must find a straightforward narrative and make it stick. Drive it home every single day and don't give an inch.\n\nThe key to success is keeping it simple and standing with voters heading into the midterms next year. GOP communications veteran Doug Heye warned Democrats not to overplay their hand. This week on MSNBC, he said, \"Democrats don't need a wave. They just need a ripple, given how small the House majority is. Stay focused and say the smart things. Don't make overpredictions.\"\n\nThe path forward for the pro-democracy movement will be a balancing act. Tuesday's elections underscored the weaknesses inside the Republican Party and how that weakness shows up at the ballot box. It's now up to Democrats to exploit those weaknesses and return power to the American people.\n\nFor more thought-provoking insights from Michael Steele, Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend, watch \"The Weekend\" every Saturday and Sunday at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC.\n\nMichael Steele is a co-host of \"The Weekend,\" which airs Saturdays and Sundays at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC.

      "text": "Dear Chuck Schumer, the 'old' Republican Party is never coming back\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThis summer will mark 10 years since Donald Trump first descended the escalator at Trump Tower to announce his candidacy for president of the United States.\n\nNow, two months into his second term, it's becoming painfully clear that many of the people best positioned to push back against his agenda still haven't accepted how much the world has changed.\n\nThe latest example came from Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in \"Mad House,\" an upcoming book from Annie Karni and Luke Broadwater of The New York Times, which revealed a 2023 exchange in which he said Trump was an aberration.\n\n\"Here's my hope ... after this election, when the Republican Party expels the turd of Donald Trump, it will go back to being the old Republican Party,\" he said, according to the book.\n\nThere are a lot of things wrong with this quote other than its needlessly vivid imagery.\n\nI remember the \"old\" Republican Party well. I was its chairman in 2009 shortly after the transformative victory of President Barack Obama and Democratic dominance in both chambers of Congress. The late Sen. John McCain had been the party's nominee in 2008 and then-Gov. Mitt Romney would be its nominee in the next cycle.\n\nThese former figureheads of the party are now considered by Trump's acolytes as RINOs, Republicans in Name Only. MAGA Republicans fantasize about McCain roasting in hell . Conservative heavy-hitters like Matt Schlapp say Romney's physical safety would be jeopardized if he so much as attended the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nThe \"old\" Republican Party is gone. It sold its soul to Trump in return for two presidencies and three Supreme Court seats.\n\nOne by one, the Republicans who stood up to Trump in the beginning have either left politics or capitulated, often in humiliating fashion.\n\nAfter Trump insulted his wife's appearance and lied about his father during the 2016 presidential primary, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could have continued calling Trump out as a \" sniveling coward .\" Instead, he became one of his sniveling supporters.\n\nWhen Trump dragged him into a stomach-turning exchange about genital size on a national debate stage, then-Sen. Marco Rubio could have insisted to Republican voters that their rhetoric had to rise above Trump's brazen behavior. Instead, he now serves as Trump's Secretary of State.\n\nTrump has shown that he can turn the Republican base against even the most stalwart conservatives.\n\nSome of this is careerism. Trump has shown that he can turn the Republican base against even the most stalwart conservatives, which leaves those who want to remain in elected office with a choice: debase themselves to gain power or stick to their principles and be cast aside like Romney and McCain.\n\nBut the truth is Republicans capitulate even when it's not necessary. Far too many of today's Republicans are unwilling to call out Trump's seedy dealings with Russia, heed warnings about the perils of relying too heavily on tariffs or stand with law enforcement over pro-Trump extremists - all positions that are unpopular with broad swaths of voters.\n\nAnother reason the Republican Party I once led is never seeing a revival? Republican voters don't want to revive it. In fact, MAGA officials repeatedly race to outdo each others' depravity because they know today's Republican voters will reward them for it.\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, who once envisioned a Republican Party that carved out space for LGBTQ+ rights , now fundraises on a bizarre obsession with trans people's bathroom habits.\n\nFar-right Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, once considered a fringe conspiracy theorist by people with multiple brain cells, is now one of the party's leading political figures and the top congressional fundraiser in her state .\n\nEven Trump's most unhinged Cabinet picks were awarded confirmations not despite their lack of experience or support for conspiracy theories, but because of them.\n\nAnd there's Trump, whose criminal indictments and even convictions became a cause célèbre and his highest fundraising days of the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe old Republican Party is not coming back. Those bridges have been burned by Republicans. The sooner Schumer and those Republicans interested in the re-emergence of traditional republicanism understand this reality, the sooner we move on from Trumpism. But sitting back and waiting for the GOP to \"expel\" Trump won't change a thing.\n\nFor more thought-provoking insights from Michael Steele, Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend, watch \"The Weekend\" every Saturday and Sunday at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC.\n\nMichael Steele is a co-host of \"The Weekend,\" which airs Saturdays and Sundays at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC.

Activate your online access\n\nFormer Vice President Henry Wallace warned eighty years ago about the threat posed by politicians like today's GOP leaders.\n\nWhen House Speaker Mike Johnson, the Louisiana Republican who schemed to help Donald Trump overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, appeared Sunday at the Republican presidential nominee's Madison Square Garden rally, he concluded his otherwise forgettable complaints about \"woke ideology\" with a fevered declaration that, \"We're not in a battle this time between two different political parties. It's much deeper than that. There's something much more fundamental going on,\" argued the speaker.\n\nThe speaker claimed that:\n\nWe're in a battle between two completely different visions for who we are as a nation and who we're going to be. We revere the founding principles. We revere our Judeo-Christian foundations. We revere individual freedom and limited government, and the rule of law, and peace through strength, and fiscal responsibility, free markets, human dignity, secure borders. But the other team doesn't anymore, my friends. This is not your father's Democratic Party.  They are now full on to Marxism and socialism. They don't envision for us to save the founding principles in the greatest nation in the history of the world. Instead, what they envision for us is that we will be some sort of European-style Marxist, borderless utopia.\n\nPolitiFact immediately pointed out that Johnson's remarks were based on \"Pants on Fire\" falsehoods .\n\nBut that correction did not prevent Johnson from hitting the road to promote his dishonest, and crudely divisive, claims about the Harris campaign, which is, in fact, backed by dozens of prominent Republicans who recognize that the Democratic ticket is closer to the American political mainstream than today's GOP.\n\nJohnson is not alone in his abandonment of the truth. Republican Vice Presidential nominee J.D. Vance has been called out, again and again, for making racist and xenophobic statements about Haitian immigrants in Ohio.\n\nIt has become increasingly common, in these closing days of the campaign, to hear former Trump officials and high-ranking military leaders describe Trump's rhetoric and behavior as fascist. Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has said that she agrees with the characterization, while describing Trump as a dictator in waiting.\n\nIn her closing argument to the American people, delivered Tuesday on the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., the vice president described Trump as \"unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power.\" The Democrat recounted the historic struggles of Americans who fought for individual liberty and fuller democracy. \"They did not struggle, sacrifice and lay down their lives, only to see us cede our fundamental freedoms, only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant,\" Harris declared. \"The United States of America is not a vessel for the schemes of wannabe dictators. The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised.\"\n\nThe focus on Trump is appropriate. But the threat does not end with this one man. The fact is that many prominent Republicans have embraced messaging that fits the definition of \"American fascism\" proffered during World War II by one of the most outspoken advocates for the struggle to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\nThere will always be those who claim that the mere mention of \"fascism\" or the \"tactics of neo-fascist division\" in an American context goes too far. But they fail to recognize that fascism takes many forms, as former Vice President Henry Wallace explained in his groundbreaking essay, \"The Danger of American Fascism.\" Writing for the New York Times in the spring of 1943, Franklin Roosevelt's second vice president explained that, \"The worldwide, age-long struggle between fascism and democracy will not stop when the fighting ends in Germany and Japan.\"\n\nFascist thinking would remain a threat, even in the United States, warned Wallace. \"The American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact,\" he observed. \"Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism.\"\n\nThe American fascist, said Wallace, \"is one whose lust for money or power is combined with such an intensity of intolerance toward those of other races, parties, classes, religions, cultures, regions or nations as to make him ruthless in his use of deceit or violence to attain his ends.\" But, the former vice president added, they are especially inclined toward propaganda. \"With a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth to the public but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money or more power.\"\n\nWallace argued that American fascism could be \"encountered on Wall Street.\" He noted that, \"Some even suspect that they can detect incipient traces of it along the Potomac\" in Washington.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nThat willingness to call out his fellow business and political leaders, even fellow Democrats, distinguished Wallace from most other political figuires-in his time, and ours.﻿\n\nWallace was a controversial vice president and an even more controversial presidential candidate in 1948. A onetime Republican who was drawn into the Democratic fold by FDR, Wallace was a man of deep Christian faith who studied the great religions of the world, an extraordinarily successful businessman who supported trade unions and recognized the value of government intervention on behalf of consumers, and a proud American who sought to avert the Cold War by advocating for diplomacy with the Soviet Union, when others refused to do so. He was accused of being too close to radicals, including the communist and socialist labor organizers, civil rights activists, and Hollywood writers US Senator Joe McCarthy would eventually target. His explicit advocacy for an end to \"Jim Crow\" segregation inspired death threats.\n\nBut, when it came to identifying and calling out the fascist threat abroad and at home, FDR's vice president was acting as a political pragmatist who recognized a genuine danger and a necessary response. He used the term \"Americanized fascism\" to help people recognize that authoritarian tactics and threats were not merely a foreign concern. What Wallace wanted Americans to understand is that fascist thinking can adapt itself to different moments, and different countries. Indeed, he explained, American fascism \"is an infectious disease, and we must all be on our guard against intolerance, bigotry and the pretension of invidious distinction.\"\n\nWallace argued that it was not difficult to identify American fascists. \"They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution,\" he wrote. \"They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjection.\"\n\nEight decades after Wallace wrote his description of American fascism, the United States finds itself at a moment when there is a great battle for political power between Trump's Republicans and Harris's Democrats. It is appropriate in a such a moment for people of differing political persuasions to exercise caution when it comes to characterizing political rivals. But Trump with his talk of going after the \"enemy within,\" Vance with his racist lies, and Johnson with his pattern of amplifying divisive falsehoods, have crossed the lines about which Wallace warned.\n\nThey are leading a Republican Party that once defended civil liberties and free and fair elections in a direction Americans are well warned to avoid.\n\nDemocrats have begun to call out the threat, with varying degrees of boldness. After John Kelly, the retired Marine general who served as Trump's White House chief of staff, revealed Trump's enthusiasm for \"German generals\" and said the former president meets \"the general definition of fascist,\" Harris's running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, announced, \"Folks, the guardrails are gone. Trump is descending into this madness - a former president of the United States and the candidate for president of the United States, says he wants generals like Adolf Hitler had.\" Asked if she thinks Trump is a fascist, Harris replied, \"Yes, I do.\" And a new ABC News/Ipsos poll, conducted before Kelly spoke up, finds that 49 percent of Americans surveyed identified Trump as a fascist who fans the flames of hate.\n\nBut the debate must extend beyond a rigid focus on Trump, as Representative Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland) has explained . \"Two of the hallmarks of a fascist political party are: One, they don't accept the results of elections that don't go their way. And, two, they embrace political violence,\" Raskin said in a 2022 interview.\n\nEchoing a President Biden's ominous warning about the threat posed by MAGA Republican election denialism, Raskin decried \"continuing attacks on our constitutional order from the outside by Donald Trump and his movement.\"\n\nVance and Johnson have only moved the GOP in a more extreme direction over the past two years. That's one of the reasons why Democrats need to be prepared to warn-as Wallace did more than 80 years ago-about \"the danger of American fascism.\" They need to recognize that Americans are hearing a lot about the word \"fascism,\" and about the threat that is poses. But they are not hearing enough about the Democratic alternative to that threat.\n\nWallace argued for pro-democracy politics-and a pro-democracy governance-writing:\n\nIt must develop the ability to keep people fully employed and at the same time balance the budget. It must put human beings first and dollars second. It must appeal to reason and decency and not to violence and deceit. We must not tolerate oppressive government or industrial oligarchy in the form of monopolies and cartels. As long as scientific research and inventive ingenuity outrun our ability to devise social mechanisms to raise the living standards of the people, we may expect the liberal potential of the United States to increase. If this liberal potential is properly channeled, we may expect the area of freedom of the United States to increase. The problem is to speed up our rate of social invention in the service of the welfare of all the people.\n\nThat's a potent vision from 1944 for an anti-fascist politics that remains relevant to a 2024 presidential race where fascism is, once more, a looming threat.\n\nThe hour is late. The contest is close. But Americans are disinclined toward authoritarianism, as Harris recognized in her \"closing argument\" speech on Tuesday. Voters can be rallied to oppose the threat.\n\nThe pro-democracy majority has been too confident in the belief that it can't happen here. Now, that majority must rise up and declare it won't happen here.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

One option was a result like that of Barack Obama's win in 2012 , where Democrats, as an incumbent party, kept the White House by a narrower, though still comfortable, margin and held the Senate, yet failed to take the House. The other option was a more daunting one: that of Ronald Reagan's win in 1980 , where Republicans challenged a Democratic incumbent, won the White House decisively, and took the Senate, yet failed to take the House.\n\nWe got the Reagan option, only worse. This year, Americans saw what civil rights lawyer Connie Rice describes as \"a decisive dark red wave that drowned the better angels of progress.\" It isn't just that Donald Trump is so much more dangerously inclined than Reagan who, though he was the iconic conservative figure of the mid-20th century, would have a hard time finding a place in Trump's GOP. It's also that today's Republican Party is actually much more closely aligned with Trump-in some cases out of actual agreement, in other cases out of fear of Trump's penchant for retribution-than it ever was with Reagan in the 1980s. Trump will, in all probability, use the power of the presidency more aggressively and recklessly than his predecessors did.\n\nBut just because the task is going to be difficult doesn't mean Democrats can throw in the towel. They have to find ways to check and balance this president. And, for this fight, history is instructive.\n\nSome of the congressional dynamics in the coming months and years could be similar to the Reagan era. In the 1980s, Democrats and their allies in the labor, environmental, and civil rights movements initially built bipartisan congressional coalitions to upend some of the 40th president's most cherished initiatives. Eventually, they figured out how to regain control of the Senate and expand their House majority. Recognizing the prospect that history can repeat is vitally significant for the organizing of an effective opposition to the second Trump presidency.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that we do not know precisely how the 2024 race has ended.\n\nBecause key races for the House and Senate remain undecided, a lot about this election is still up for grabs. With millions of ballots yet to be counted-mostly in the heavily Democratic states of California, Washington, and Oregon-we don't even know what the final popular vote count will be.\n\nBut here's some of what we know as of Thursday morning.\n\nTHE SENATE: With the defeat of Democratic incumbents Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, as well as the flipping of a historically Democratic seat in West Virginia, the Republicans now have at least a 52-48 majority in the Senate. That GOP majority could expand, as Democratic incumbents are trailing in two additional states. Republicans could end up with a 53-47 majority, perhaps even 54-46.\n\nThe size of that majority matters. If it is narrower, then appeals to Republicans who have distanced themselves from Trump at crucial moments in the past, such as Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Maine's Susan Collins, as well as a handful of other GOP senators who have broken with Trump on individual issues, could yet block the new president's most noxious cabinet picks and initiatives.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, teachers unions and their allies in Alaska and Maine convinced Murkowski and Collins to oppose Trump's selection of billionaire Betsy DeVos to serve as secretary of education. Murkowski and Collins, urged on by activists with groups such as MoveOn, joined Arizona Senator John McCain in voting to save the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf the Republican majority is wider, it will be harder to move the Senate. But labor, environmental, education, civil rights and civil liberties activists in the states could find openings-not just with Murkowski and Collins but also with the 20 Republicans who will be up for reelection in 2026 (as opposed to 13 Democrats).\n\nTHE HOUSE : Control of the House is still up for grabs, and, since this fight will determine whether Democrats maintain any legislative control in Washington, how it turns out is vitally important. As I write, several dozen races are yet to be called . Republicans have the advantage. But a substantial number of the undecided seats are on the West Coast-in California, Washington, and Oregon. There is still a remote possibility that New York Democrat Hakeem Jeffries could emerge as the speaker of the House. If that happens, however, his majority would be minuscule and his challenges great. His first responsibility would be to avoid the frequent mistake of Democrats who greet a new Republican administration with simplistic pledges to seek avenues of cooperation. If Trump does something positive, of course Democrats can work with him. But if he moves in the wrong direction, as he has promised to do, House Democrats have to use every tool at their disposal to check and balance Trump. And they should be clear about their willingness to do so on behalf of an American electorate that, according to CNN exit polling, believes by a 55 percent majority that Trump is \" too extreme .\"\n\nWhether they are narrowly in the majority or narrowly in opposition, this is the time for congressional Democrats to show some spine. They need to be courageous on issues where too many of them have been cautious-including defenses of vulnerable and threatened communities, dramatically raising the minimum wage, expanding labor rights, rejecting tax cuts for the rich, strengthening Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act, and opposing the horrific Israeli assault on Gaza.\n\nFirm lines in the sand need to be drawn early and maintained. There have to be positions that are nonnegotiable. If there are not, Trump will take full advantage of the openings that Democrats hand him.\n\nActivists inside and outside of the Democratic Party need to remind elected leaders of this fact.\n\nAs frustrated, angry, and overwhelmed as they may be by Tuesday's election results, those who want to fight back against Trump and Trumpism must remember that they have power of their own. They can use it to make clear to the leadership of the Democratic caucuses in the House and the Senate that, just as Trump will claim a personal mandate, they must claim a constitutional mandate to check and balance Trump's excesses. It is not enough for those who oppose Trump's policies to lobby congressional Republicans to do the right thing on a particular issue, even if such lobbying is important. It is just as essential to pressure Democrats to stand strong on behalf of the constituencies they are supposed to represent.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nTHE STATES: Democrats currently serve as the governors of 23 states and three territories . In a number of those states, from New York to California, the party also controls the legislature as well. These states need to establish themselves as beachheads against Trump's worst excesses. There will be specific fights between the new administration and state officials on issues ranging from immigration to the climate crisis to abortion rights, raising wages and education-issues on which, in a number of cases, referendums results from red and blue states suggest that the American people are far more progressive than the leaders of either party recognize.\n\nSmart strategies, education, and organizing are going to be needed at every level of campaigning and governing. It won't be easy. There will be defeats. But there will also be victories; there always are, even in the darkest times. The task is to organize toward a politics where there are fewer losses and more wins for the priorities that matter most to Americans.\"What do we do?\" asks Representative Greg Casar, a progressive Democrat from Austin, Texas, who called for a Gaza ceasefire, took bold stances in favor of economic, social, and racial justice, and on Tuesday won reelection with 67 percent of the vote. Casar answers: \"We organize, care for each other, and fight back through the fear and anger.

It was a radical party that championed economic and social and racial justice.\n\nKamala Harris walks out with former US representative Liz Cheney during a rally at Ripon College on October 3, 2024, in Ripon, Wisconsin.\n\nThe great error that much of the media made with its coverage last week of the visit by Kamala Harris and Liz Cheney to the Wisconsin birthplace of the Republican Party came in the form of a suggestion that Cheney, the possessor of one of the most prominent names in contemporary Republican politics, was providing Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, with a connection to the historical roots and values of the Grand Old Party.\n\nIn fact, it was the other way around.\n\nCheney, a former Republican congressional leader, has a history of adopting extreme right-wing stances on matters of war and peace, corporate power, labor rights, immigration, and a host of other issues that would have been anathema to the people who founded the Republican Party. She is, as well, the daughter of a former Republican vice president, Dick Cheney, who dragged the party into the neoconservative camp and made its name synonymous with tax cuts for the rich and subservience to corporations.\n\nIt is Harris-the daughter of immigrants who is running on proposals to strengthen the ability of the federal government to tackle price gouging by monopolies, tax the rich, improve the circumstances of the working class, and advance the cause of economic, social and racial justice-who would be far more likely to arouse the enthusiasm of the people who launched the Republican Party from a schoolhouse in the eastern Wisconsin college town of Ripon.\n\nThough she may not be so left-wing as the Ripon Republicans of 1854, Harris has views that are reasonably in sync with the first candidate they elected to the presidency. Republican Abraham Lincoln decried the \"monstrous injustice of slavery\" at a time when most Southerners and many Northerners accepted the original sin of the American experiment; he supported sweeping land reforms; he sided with immigrant workers; and he engaged in militant advocacy for the working class. \"Labor is prior to and independent of capital,\" Lincoln announced in his first annual address to the nation, in 1861. \"Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.\"\n\nThat's a line often quoted by labor unions that now are among Harris's most ardent supporters-and that for decades have opposed the anti-union policies of the Cheneys and their corporate allies. But politics makes for strange alliances. So it is that Cheney, the former Republican congressional leader who in 2021 broke with her party's president after he sought to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, has emerged as Harris's most prominent Republican backer.\n\nHarris and Cheney came to Ripon with the purpose of encouraging more Republicans to join the former representative from Wyoming in backing the Democratic nominee's presidential bid. It's a politically significant endeavor at a point when Harris is locked in a competitive presidential race with former president Donald Trump, the authoritarian extremist who has spent the better party of a decade working to turn the GOP into a cult of personality.\n\nDespite the former president's tightening grip on the party machinery, millions of party members reject what Cheney on Thursday described as Trump's \"depraved cruelty.\" Former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley won 4.3 million votes for her primary challenge to Trump-earning substantial support in Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, and other closely contested battleground states. Though Haley is now a grudging Trump backer, her supporters have organized a well-funded Haley Voters for Harris campaign that is actively seeking to move disenchanted Republicans toward Harris.\n\nCheney appeared with Harris at a packed rally where banners declared, \"Country Over Party,\" and where the former representative from Wyoming told wavering Republicans, \"In this election, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration. It is our duty.\"\n\nTrump's response to this threat has been to label Harris as \" a radical left person .\" Like most contemporary Republicans-along with a lot of Democrats and members of the media-Trump imagines that the Republican Party has always been conservative. But that's a political fallacy.\n\nWhat Trump fails to recognize is that the \"radical left\" label better describes the politics of the founders of the Republican Party than the \"conservative\" label that Ronald Reagan, Dick Cheney, Liz Cheney, and their kind so successfully attached to the party during the time that it was their fiefdom.\n\nThe first Republicans were true radicals-people who sought to upend the politics of the country at a time when the existing parties were capitulating to the demands of Southern slaveholders and their political patrons.\n\nIf you visit the Little White Schoolhouse in Ripon , which is emblazoned with the words \"Birthplace of the Republican Party,\" you will be introduced to the story of how Alvan Earle Bovay \"called a meeting of 53 voters...to form a new party.\" The historical record tell us that the meeting was organized \"to protest the Senate's passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which permitted the extension of slavery beyond the limits of the Missouri Compromise. The protest resulted in the formation of a new, albeit local party, drawn from the ranks of disgruntled Whigs, Free Soilers, and Democrats.\"\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nAmong the petitioners were a number of people like Jacob Woodruff , who moved to the Ripon area as a member of the Wisconsin Phalanx. And Hiram S. Town, another member of the Phalanx. And Robert Mason, another member of the Phalanx. And William Dunham, an incorporator of the Phalanx, who served as a moderator of the first of the meetings that gave rise to the Republican Party.\n\nThe Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, an independent federal agency that advises the president and Congress on national historic preservation policy, describes the Wisconsin Phalanx as \"an experimental socialist community\" founded by followers of Charles Fourier, the French philosopher who was one of the founders of utopian socialism. Fourier's ideas were popularized in the United States by Horace Greeley's New York Tribune , which for a number of years employed Karl Marx as its European correspondent.\n\nBovay, a friend and associate of Greeley, had moved to Ripon a few years before he called the 1854 meeting. A veteran organizer who had led militant movements for land reform-with the slogan, \"Vote Yourself a Farm\"-Bovay had long advocated for the formation of an independent political movement with the purpose of gaining control of legislatures and the Congress in order to enact radical reforms.\n\nAt Bovay's urging, Greeley popularized the new party, which united partisans from many political camps in common opposition to the spread of slavery. Among the first Republicans were many allies and associates of socialist causes , including Joseph Weydemeyer, a former Prussian Army officer who would continue to correspond with Marx as he rose through the ranks as a military officer during the Civil War.\n\nDecades after the founding of the new party, the great trade unionist and Socialist Party leader Eugene Victor Debs would reflect on this history in his speeches. Though he dismissed both major parties of the early 20th century as \"wings of the same bird of prey,\" Debs allowed as how \"the Republican Party was once red.\"\n\nThere may have been a measure of hyperbole in that remark. The Ripon Republican were not all socialists, and they did not agree on every ideological issue. Yet there is no question that they were united in their radical faith in the need for a political party that respected the Declaration of Independence, with its promise that all human beings are created equal, and that defended the Constitution. The first national Republican Party platform invited \"the affiliation and cooperation of the men of all parties, however differing from us in other respects, in support of the principles herein declared; and believing that the spirit of our institutions as well as the Constitution of our country, guarantees liberty of conscience and equality of rights among citizens...\"\n\nIt is in that spirit that Kamala Harris, a reasonably progressive Democrat, is inviting contemporary Republicans to back a presidential bid that is in the spirit of the original Republican Party; while Liz Cheney, an unreasonably conservative Republican, is urging her fellow partisans to abandon their partisanship and put \"Country Over Party.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

In fact, she has joined one of Greenland's most prominent political figures in bluntly pushing back against the American president's scheming to buy-or, perhaps, simply claim-the island that is home to 57,000 people.\n\n\"Greenland is not for sale,\" declared Murkowski and Greenlandic parliamentarian Aaja Chemnitz after consulting this week. \"The question has been asked and firmly answered by the government of Greenland, Naalakkersuisut.\"\n\nThat was a stark response to what critics have identified as the president's \" Napoleonic tendencies \" and \" Dreams of a New American Empire .\"\n\nMurkowski's intervention matters because it is coming not just from global leaders or members of the media , but from a senior Republican senator, even if that senator's influence may have been diminished by the fact that she is one of the few independent thinkers left in Trump's GOP.\n\nMurkowski, who did not vote for Trump in 2016, 2020, or 2024, has emerged as the Senate's leading Republican dissenter since Trump returned to the White House. She was the first GOP senator to announce that she would vote against confirming Pete Hegseth , the president's scandal-plagued pick to lead the Department of Defense (two other Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, later joined her), and she has expressed skepticism about other Trump picks. She has criticized the president's pardons of insurrectionists and \"strongly disagreed\" with his executive order to rename Denali, the Alaskan peak that is North America's tallest mountain, for former Republican President William McKinley- saying , \"Our nation's tallest mountain, which has been called Denali for thousands of years, must continue to be known by the rightful name bestowed by Alaska's Koyukon Athabascans, who have stewarded the land since time immemorial.\"\n\nMurkowski represents a state with ties to Greenland, because they are both Arctic regions with large populations of Indigenous people and strategic positions in the world. With her deep roots in what was for almost a century an American territory, the chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs knows the history of the long struggle for representation that ended with Alaska statehood in 1959. And Murkowski has an independent streak that has seen her win four Senate elections as a labor-friendly, pro-choice Republican who draws significant support from Democrats and independents. Unlike other GOP senators, who fear that Trump and his allies might move to unseat them in party primaries, Murkowski has confidence in her political resilience. In 2010, Republican primary voters rejected her in favor of a Tea Party acolyte. In response, Murkowski ran in the general election as a write-in candidate -and won.\n\nBut even with that record, her willingness to stand up to the latest Trump juggernaut has been striking-so much so that an Associated Press writer in Juneau termed her current positioning as \"stunning for a congressional Republican who has faced his wrath before and yet remains unbowed by pressure to embrace his agenda.\"\n\nMurkowski's intervention on behalf of Greenland is especially significant because she is aligning with international critics of the expansionist vision that Trump has outlined in speeches, press conferences, and conversations with global leaders-including \" a contentious, aggressive telephone call \" with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark, the European Union member state that includes Greenland as a self-governing Arctic region with its own language and culture. Chemnitz represents Greenland in the Danish parliament as a member of the island's pro-independence Inuit Ataqatigiit party . She also chairs the Standing Committee of Parliamentarians of the Arctic Region , of which Murkowski is a cochair.\n\nAfter the committee of parliamentarians met over the weekend, Murkowski and Chemnitz issued a statement that noted Trump's talk about purchasing Greenland, along with increasing global attention to the fact that the largest non-continental island in the world \"is strategically located for defense, shipping, and more. It is also a storehouse for all sorts of minerals, the building blocks of society that will determine who leads-and controls-the industries of the future.\" The statement firmly asserted, \"The United States, like Denmark, should recognize that the future will be defined by partnership, not ownership. To ensure our alliance reaches its full potential, Americans must view Greenland as an ally, not an asset. Open for business, but not for sale.\"\n\nMurkowski and Chemnitz explained, \"The future does not require us to redraw the borders on that [map of the Arctic], but to work harder than ever across them,\" and called-in a clear reference Trump's territorial ambitions-for \"a larger acceptance of the Arctic as a region of shared responsibility whose opportunities cannot be seized, and whose challenges cannot be overcome, by any one nation on its own.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

So Democrat Mark Pocan gave them a chance to speak their mind.\n\nRepresentative Mark Pocan (D-WI) speaks during the WisDems 2024 State Convention on June 8, 2024, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nBelmont, Wisconsin, hasn't had much time in the political spotlight since it briefly served in 1836 as the first capital of the Wisconsin Territory. But, on Saturday, the quiet village of 989 people felt like the hottest spot on America's electoral map. Cars lined Mound Avenue, the community's main drag, and a crowd of people lined up long before the doors of the local community building opened for US Representative Mark Pocan's town hall meeting. So many people showed up that all the seats were filled before the session began. Several hundred people lined the walls of the room and had begun sitting on the floor up front by the time the meeting was opened by Pocan, a progressive Democrat who is one of the House's sharpest critics of President Trump and billionaire \"shadow president\" Elon Musk's shock-and-awe assault on the nation's social safety net.\n\nBelmont sits on the far edge of Pocan's sprawling southern Wisconsin district, in rural Lafayette County, which last fall voted for Trump by a 3-2 margin over Democrat Kamala Harris. On Saturday, the congressman welcomed constituents of all political persuasions for a freewheeling discussion about threats posed by Trump and Musk to cherished federal agencies such as the Veteran's Administration-and about a Republican budget plan that analysts say could take as much as $880 billion from Medicaid in order to fund massive tax cuts for the rich. But the seven-term congressman did something else. He played host to voters from across the county line, in the neighboring congressional district of Republican US Representative Derrick Van Orden.\n\nVan Orden, a vulnerable two-term incumbent with a history of angry blow-ups involving constituents, colleagues, librarians , and young Senate pages , has, like many Republican House members, been lying low to avoid circumstances where he might face tough questions about Trump-Musk initiatives-and about his lockstep support for GOP budgets plans that are unpopular with voters in his district.\n\nLast week, a headline in the La Crosse Tribune , one of the largest newspapers in Van Orden's sprawling western Wisconsin district, read, \"U.S. Representative Van Orden draws fire over changes to constituent meetings.\" It focused on complaints that he had grown increasingly inaccessible, as concerns about the GOP agenda in Washington have mounted. A western Wisconsin television station, WXOW, reported that Van Orden's constituents were \" distraught \" over the congressman's cancellation of a scheduled town meeting in Eau Claire, the largest city in the district.\n\nThis provided Pocan a perfect opportunity to call out Van Orden's truancy-and, by extension, that of Van Orden's fellow House Republicans.  And it worked. When the Democrat made a special point of inviting constituents of his Republican colleague to the meeting on \"The Republican Rip Off: $4.5 Trillion in Tax Cuts for the Ultra-Wealthy,\" state and national media outlets drew attention to the gathering, and it became the talk of the town in Belmont and surrounding communities.\n\nResidents of Van Orden's district came from near and far to attend the town hall, as did Pocan's own constituents. Pocan opened the meeting by telling the crowd that packed into the community building, \"This is the largest town hall I've held in Lafayette County, by about tenfold.\" While more folks hoped to press in, the representative announced, \"We're at capacity. I've got to follow the law. I'm not Trump or Musk.\" Undaunted, people who couldn't get inside listened through the open windows of the hall.\n\nPocan asked how many people in the room were Van Orden's constituents, and dozens of hands shot up. Among them was Myron Tranel, a retired farmer from the nearby Town of Platteville, who said of Van Orden, \"He just won't show up to hear from the people he's supposed to represent.\" Karen Essex, another resident of rural Grant County, which is at the southern end of the Republican's district, said, \"He doesn't want to talk to people. He doesn't want to listen. He doesn't want to answer questions.\" Essex complained that Van Orden's approach mirrors that of a growing number of House Republicans who stand accused of avoiding constituents. \"I'm concerned that Republicans just don't want to hear that voters want them to keep Trump in check,\" said Essex. \"We're supposed to have three branches of government. But two of them [the legislative and the judicial] aren't working.\"\n\nPocan recounted widespread criticism of Van Orden, and read a message from the Republican-who was invited to attend the Belmont meeting-in which Van Orden claimed he had a scheduling conflict. Then the Democrat explained how constituents could send a message to the Republican's office and said, \"Derrick may not talk to you. But he sees the call numbers.\"\n\nFor his part, Pocan said his office had seen a record number of calls in recent weeks, many of them expressing concern about threats to the Medicaid program. That was a major topic at the town meeting in Lafayette County, as were concerns about threats to programs that serve veterans and the prospect that cuts to international food initiatives associated with USAID would harm working farmers in the region.\n\nPocan and his staff jotted down details of all the questions and concerns, and then the congressman stuck around after the meeting to speak individually with voters from both districts.\n\nFor his part, Van Orden issued a statement last week suggesting that he might be feeling the heat. While he still accused Democrats like Pocan of \"fearmongering,\" the Republican said he was now urging the administration to watch out for farmers and veterans. But Van Orden still towed the administration line, saying he was \"confident\" that Musk and his team would maintain benefits.\n\nThe crowd in Belmont lacked that confidence, and they made their frustration abundantly clear. \"Van Orden does not represent me. Will you?\" asked one of the questioners. \"Got it!\" said Pocan, indicating that he would take their concerns back to Washington. But the Democrat also urged residents of Van Orden's district to keep calling the congressman, and demanding town hall meetings. Noting that a Republican proposal to implement a $4.5 trillion tax cut that will benefit the rich while gutting vital federal programs could be stopped if just a handful of Republicans were to refuse to go along with the party leadership, Pocan urged the crowd to keep the pressure on, to keep calling and to recognize that, even if Republicans avoid them, \"town halls matter!\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Unfortunately for the Republicans who have chosen Donald Trump as their 2024 presidential nominee, they are having a hard time keeping up with the chaos that the 78-year-old convicted felon and aspiring dictator is spawning. It's not that top Republicans have qualms about lying on their candidate's behalf. They're more than willing to maintain the cult of personality Trump demands. The problem is that they can't keep their trumped-up stories straight.\n\nWhen it was reported in June that Trump told House Republicans that \"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city,\" US Representative Bryan Steil, a Wisconsin Republican, declared, \"I was in the room. President Trump did not say this.\" Yet his Wisconsin colleague Derrick Van Orden, at roughly the same moment, posted on X that Trump \"was specifically referring to the crime the CRIME RATE in Milwaukee.\" Another Wisconsin Republican, US Representative Scott Fitzgerald, told a local reporter, \"What he was talking about was the elections in Milwaukee.\" For its part, the Trump campaign claimed the report that Trump had called the convention city \"horrible\" was a \"total lie.\" But then Trump said it was \"very clear\" that he was talking about \"terrible\" crime, only to claim moments later that he was referring to \"the election.\" Still stung by the backlash his remark had inspired, Trump made a face-saving trip to Wisconsin and announced, \"I love Milwaukee.\" Then media outlets revealed that Trump had arranged to stay in Chicago, rather than Milwaukee, during the convention. Trump's Republican apologists raced back to the spin room, scrambling to embarrass themselves once more in the service of their dear leader.\n\nThe real story of what's become of the GOP won't be detected in its 2024 platform, which Trump has allowed to be written by delegates this year, after denying them a chance to do so in 2020. Nor will it be found in the transcripts of Trump's incoherent addresses to the assembled faithful. If you want a full measure of the degeneration of the party of Abraham Lincoln, it is necessary to see how lockstep loyalty to Trump has replaced Republican values, conservative ideology, and whatever modicum of self-respect remained after the moral concessions of the Bush-Cheney years.\n\nThe GOP is no longer a political party in any sense that Americans could or should understand. It's a Big Lie, wherein so-called \"leaders\" spend more time defending Trump's lawless behavior-going so far as to show up at his New York trial to bemoan the fact that the justice system was working-than standing up for their constituents or backing programs that deal with the very real challenges of the 21st century. Republicans aren't even trying anymore. They're just phoning in their apologias for Trump.\n\nThe handful of dissidents who dare suggest that the emperor has no clothes are now so marginalized that for the most part they are, like Utah Senator Mitt Romney, choosing to quit rather than fight. And the few free-thinking Republicans who might fill that void are looking like the Don Quixotes of 2024. In Michigan, for instance, libertarian-leaning former US representative Justin Amash, who once voted to impeach Trump, is challenging the establishment with a Senate bid that rejects cult-of-personality politics and says, \"What we need is not a rubber stamp for either party, but an independent-minded senator prepared to challenge anyone and everyone on the people's behalf.\"\n\nAmash is right. But being right doesn't count for much in 2024, so Amash finds himself running uphill against Trump-backed former House Intelligence Committee chair Mike Rogers. Rogers once condemned Trump as a \"destructive\" figure who \"sounded more gangster than presidential.\" Now he's just another slobbering Trump apologist, claiming he's \"excited\" to do the ex-president's bidding. Like many of his Republican colleagues, Rogers has abandoned his constituents, and his conscience, in order to join Trump's party of liars. The good news is that they are such bad liars that the truth might just prevail in November.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Activate your online access\n\nThe theme at the 2024 Republican convention is restoration, not revolution. And the mood, at least last night, was confident.\n\nFormer US president Donald Trump during the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Monday, July 15, 2024.\n\nM ilwaukee -It was just bad luck, I suppose, that the first Republican delegate I ran into here outside the Fiserv Forum was Susan Sweeney. Though her Abe Lincoln stovepipe hat promised a colorful character-and perhaps fodder for a MAGA caricature-Sweeney, a delegate from Chicago's northern suburbs, told me she had come to the convention \"to talk about the things that unite us as Americans, not the things that divide us.\"\n\nSweeney did list her three major issues: \"illegal immigration,\" inflation, and so-called parental rights. I'm sure her views on those issues are at odds with those of most Nation readers-though her argument that \"the quality of your kid's education shouldn't depend on your zip code\" might find some sympathizers. But Sweeney, who recently retired as a special needs teacher for preschool kids, was simply too normal, too reasonable, and-by Republican standards at least-too moderate to paint as an extremist.\n\nI arrived in Milwaukee with memories of the last full GOP convention in Cleveland in 2016-which, as my colleague Joan Walsh recently recalled , was a nightmarish spectacle of political cruelty.\n\nTwenty twenty-four feels different. Donald Trump may be the same vicious grifter he's always been, and the Republican Party, which still had pockets of deep Never Trump resistance in 2016, is now wholly his creature. But the mood here is far from the Nuremberg-style hatefest I'd, frankly, expected.\n\nLike England's Tories, Trump's Republicans have long seemed determined to live up-or down-to the label of \"the nasty party.\" And there was certainly some of that here. Ted Cruz-a walking, smirking incarnation of the dark side- told the crowd that \"every damn day\" Americans \"are dying, murdered, assaults, raped by illegal immigrants\" who came here not because they were fleeing violence at home but \"because Democrats cynically decided they wanted votes from illegals more than they wanted to protect our children.\" The Republicans' traditional, and cynical, exploitation of grief was on full display, as a procession of murder victims' relatives blamed their losses on Joe Biden and the Democratic Party. Yet the theme overall was of reconciliation, not revenge, and of restoration, not revolution.\n\nTuesday evening had been billed as a parade of losers, with former Trump rivals Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, and Marco Rubio lining up to publicly kiss the ring of the victorious nominee, who once again sat in the arena sporting the Vincent van Gogh-style ear bandage that has become a visual reminder of his near-assassination last weekend. But perhaps because none of them had ever gone quite so far as to compare Trump to Adolf Hitler-as vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance had done before his born-again MAGA conversion-the abasement seemed somehow less humiliating, the endorsements less extorted.\n\nNot that there was anything remotely plausible in Haley's claim that her \"strong endorsement\" of the man she once described as unfit to be president was motivated by \"the Democrats' hav[ing] moved so far to the left that they're putting America in danger,\" rather than her own political ambition. Her reminder that \"you don't have agree with Donald Trump 100 percent of the time to vote for him,\" while true enough, landed in silence, though her comment that \"a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris\" roused the crowd a bit more-and helped to illuminate Haley's possible path to redemption.\n\nAs the governor of a key Republican citadel, DeSantis had more claim to a place on the program-and judging by the applause that punctuated his speech, more claim to the audience's affections. His lampooning of DEI as standing for \"division, exclusion, and indoctrination\" brought louder cheers than any of Haley's applause lines. But the man Trump memorably lampooned as \"Ron DeSanctimonious\" struggled to shake off the aura of grievance and resentment that mark his politics-and his personality.\n\nInstead it was Rubio, fresh off of losing to Vance in this year's veepstakes, who delivered what was easily the most effective speech of the night-a tribute to Corey Comperatore, the former firefighter killed at the Trump rally on Sunday, which depicted the party's credo of \"America First\" not as a jingoistic rallying cry but as \"a fight for the hopes and dreams that unite us, and make us one.\"\n\n\"There is nothing dangerous, or divisive,\" Rubio told the television audience, \"about putting America first.\"\n\nIt was as if, in mustering Trump's former rivals, the party was using them not merely as surrogates but also emissaries from the land of the normal people. Rubio repeatedly brought the crowd to its feet-and in the end he brought Trump to his feet as well, clapping and beaming.\n\nHow long will this Norman Rockwell vision of Republican comity last? Who knows. But for tonight, at least, this felt like a party at peace with itself and with its leaders.\n\nWhich might be the most frightening thing of all.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Activate your online access\n\nThe Republican Attorney Generals Association is working overtime to install authoritarian AGs across the country.\n\nAuthoritarian regimes cannot work without functionaries and bureaucrats who enforce the strongman's will at the local level. A despot, even one who is operating above the law and using all the tools of fear and violence at his disposal, cannot easily reach into people's everyday lives.\n\nAs detailed in the Project 2025 organizing document, Republicans have big plans for a fascist takeover of the national government should Donald Trump be reinstalled as president.\n\n(Trump has tried to distance himself from the project, but don't be fooled.) Their plans involve placing Trump loyalists at every level of government, stripping executive agencies of their independence, and using the levers of power to take rights away from women, the LGBTQ community, and pretty much anybody who dares to oppose them.\n\nProject 2025 is a plan for the national level, but what about state and local concerns? Obviously, conservatives plan on winning-and holding-many gubernatorial seats and statehouses, imposing their antebellum vision through the power of state government, just as white folks were able to do during the Jim Crow era. But there is another important piece in the totalitarian apparatus: state attorneys general. By controlling the office of a state's top prosecutor, Republicans can break into people's homes and bedrooms and turn their culture-war obsessions into criminal penalties and prison time. Should Trump's dystopian reelection come to pass, it likely won't be SEAL Team 6 standing with its jackboots on the necks of civil liberties and pluralistic tolerance. It will be a state trooper, acting under the direction of an elected state attorney general, who comes to your wedding to break up your same-sex marriage, deport your friends, or force your daughter to bring a pregnancy to term against her will.\n\nTo help promote this dreadful work, Republicans have an organization in place that both amplifies the efforts of existing authoritarian AGs and recruits and backs future ones. It's called the Republican Attorneys General Association, or RAGA. Founded in 1999 as part of the Republican State Leadership Committee (a group devoted to getting Republicans elected to statewide office), RAGA split off as its own entity in 2014. Since then, a villainous row of wealthy Republican donors have poured millions upon millions of dollars into the group, successfully installing their candidates in the top prosecutor spots and making sure that, once in office, those Republican AGs do what their donors paid for.\n\nThere are 27 Republican state attorneys general-and all of them share a broadly extremist agenda, regardless of the particularities of their state. They're all anti-immigrant , and they're willing to use every shred of their power to harass, detain, and deport people who are out of status. They're in favor of forced birth . They're anti-trans , anti-labor , and anti-environment , and they support smash-and-grab capitalism. Only five are women. Almost all of them are white.\n\nRAGA is incredibly well funded. The organization rakes in dollars from Koch Industries (the multinational, earth-destroying conglomerate operated by Charles Koch); the US Chamber of Commerce Institute for Legal Reform (a group dedicated to protecting big business by preventing class-action lawsuits and limiting legal liability for wrongdoing); and Altria Client Services and Reynolds American (both lobbying arms of the tobacco industry). By far the biggest RAGA funders, though, come from groups aligned with the conservative legal archfiend Leonard Leo.\n\nAccording to Open Secrets , the Leo-aligned Judicial Crisis Network gave $4 million to RAGA in the 2020 election cycle, $6.5 million in 2022, and $1 million (so far) in 2024. And that's just the money we can track via public filings; Leo is also widely believed to control the purse strings of the dark-money behemoth the Concord Fund. Reports indicate it has funneled at least $9.5 million to RAGA since 2020.\n\nWe have an idea of what all these donors are getting for their money, because RAGA produces a \"price list\" that details its pay-to-play scheme. According to documents from 2018 that were obtained by True North Research, for an annual contribution of just $125,000, donors get to attend the attorneys general annual meeting as well as \"retreats\" with senior staff of the various officeholders. For an annual contribution of $250,000 or more, donors are instructed to call in to find out what else is on the menu, as if they're checking on the soup of the day. Who can say for sure what Leo gets for the millions and millions of dollars he directs their way, but my opening guess would be anything he damn well wants.\n\nI think the RAGA pay-to-play scheme can be distinguished from those of other seedy political associations by the fact that the RAGA crew are prosecutors. They're part of law enforcement. When RAGA officials sell themselves, or appear to sell themselves, what they're giving away is the fair and equal application of the rule of law. Individuals and corporations that give money to RAGA are potentially buying themselves out of legal scrutiny, or criminal liability, for their business practices. Paying off RAGA is not unlike a Mafia family paying off a detective to look the other way on an unsolved murder, or a drug dealer contributing enough money to the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association that any cop who pulls him over knows not to write him up for drunk driving.\n\nLast year, ProPublica reported on shady dealings between RAGA officials and Johnson & Johnson. After RAGA supported the January 6 attempted coup, many of its funders fled. So did Johnson & Johnson-at first. But the company, which was facing costly litigation at the state level, soon agreed to a meeting with RAGA bigwigs, and the money began flowing again. A few months later, RAGA attorneys general negotiated two settlement deals with Johnson & Johnson. There's a reason that corporations like Amazon, Walmart, UPS, and Home Depot, which are often entangled in state litigation, contribute to RAGA.\n\nWhile cozy, corporate-friendly schemes are a big part of the RAGA docket, its most significant work is ideological. RAGA attorneys use their power to push the Republican agenda through the court system by filing lawsuits and complaints against any law or rule they don't like.\n\nAfter the 2020 election, the Texas AG and indicted felon Ken Paxton brought a motion to the Supreme Court to invalidate the results of the election in four states that Joe Biden clearly won; 17 RAGA members joined the motion. But the group didn't stop there. In addition to its legal maneuvers, RAGA engaged in extralegal activities to overturn the election: Its 501(c)4 dark-money wing, the Rule of Law Defense Fund, recorded a robocall urging people to join the protests on January 6 and \"stop the steal.\"\n\nWhile RAGA wasn't able to overthrow the government-with the pen (in courts) or with the sword (at the Capitol)-the example reveals its basic playbook for working the legal system.\n\nStep one: An attorney general files a test case-a lawsuit that the AG knows violates federal law and, just as often, basic logic. Step two: Other RAGA AGs join the fight. Step three: The lawsuit is either rejected by the lower court or, if a Trump judge is presiding, accepted-but in either case, the ruling is almost always appealed by the losing side. Step four: RAGA's friends on the Supreme Court take the opportunity to intervene and, in most cases, change the federal law to align with Republican political or cultural priorities.\n\nRAGA AGs use this playbook again and again, although their pet issues differ by state. Paxton, for instance, has used test cases to inject as much cruelty as possible into the nation's immigration policies. Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador used a test case to try to prevent sick women from receiving emergency medical care should that care include an abortion. Before he was elected as Louisiana's governor, Jeff Landry led the charge to get the Supreme Court to eviscerate the Clean Water Act.\n\nThe call-and-response between RAGA AGs and their allies on the Supreme Court is an essential way that Republicans are able to bypass Congress and enact policies that extend far beyond their states and take away the rights of people living in New York or California.\n\nAnd RAGA's biggest funder, Leonard Leo, wants more. Leo has called on RAGA to \"flood the zone with cases that challenge misuse of the Constitution by the administrative state and by Congress.\" That threat can be made a reality thanks to Leo's other great quest-to remake the Supreme Court-which he more or less achieved four years ago and which resulted this summer in the conservative justices' overruling judicial deference to regulatory agencies. The court's ruling throws into question thousands and thousands of regulations, and RAGA AGs will likely try to deregulate entire industries, one lawsuit at a time.\n\nStill, given the state of reproductive rights in a post- Roe v. Wade world, the most essential function served by RAGA officials in the coming months and years will be as the enforcers of the Republicans' anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ, Christofascist agenda. Most RAGA AGs have sued the Biden administration over its mandates to provide gender-affirming care. And RAGA attorneys are leading the charge to criminalize abortions. When the first person is arrested for going out of state to have an abortion, I promise you it will happen at the direction of a RAGA AG. Republicans won't need to pass a national abortion ban if RAGA attorneys can sue to prevent women and pregnant people from leaving forced-birth states-and arrest doctors and activists from other states who try to help them.\n\nIt is worth noting that this is the plan regardless of who wins the presidential election. If Trump wins, RAGA will likely feel emboldened; if Harris wins, it will be determined to try to stop her administration by any means necessary. As long as a conservative supermajority controls the Supreme Court, RAGA attorneys will always be one lawsuit away from changing the nation's laws.\n\nThat's why focusing on these state elections is vital. In a presidential year, almost all of the electoral oxygen gets sucked to the top of the ticket, for obvious reasons. But people in states with attorney general elections should be motivated to go to the polls and stop RAGA from gaining even more control over the legal apparatus.\n\nThere are 10 races for state attorney general this November. Because of the polarization of our politics, eight of those races are noncompetitive, with five almost certain to go to the Republican candidate and three to the Democratic candidate; only two remain truly up for grabs. I'll focus on those two competitive races, which are in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, but you should also hear about the races in Missouri and Indiana, where the Republican is likely to win but could lose if enough fair-minded voters don't reflexively vote for whoever has an \"R\" next to their name on the ballot.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA jeff jackson (d) vs. dan bishop (r)\n\nNo race highlights the importance of state attorneys general more than the contest in North Carolina. That's because two of the state's US representatives, Democrat Jeff Jackson and Republican Dan Bishop, decided to give up their seats in Congress to vie for the role of their state's top prosecutor. In tossing their seats aside, these two politicians are telling us that they'll have more power and influence-or, at least, better career prospects-by holding a state-level job than they'd have as members of the federal government.\n\nThey're not wrong. A congressperson is just one among 435-someone to be herded alongside the other cats by a strong party leader-who can occasionally propose but rarely enact their preferred policy agenda. An attorney general, by contrast, is an executive who can make policy through lawsuits and prosecutions. And because AGs hold statewide office, the job is often a springboard to other statewide positions, such as governor or US senator. Indeed, there are many governors, including North Carolina's Roy Cooper, who previously served as the attorney general of their state.\n\nThanks to their previous turns in elected office, we know that the contrast between these two AG candidates could not be more stark. Before he was elected to Congress, Bishop was a county commissioner who supported North Carolina's infamous House Bill 2-the country's first \"bathroom bill.\" That law, passed in 2016 (and repealed in 2020), dictated where people were allowed to pee, forcing them to use bathrooms according to the sex assigned to them at birth, while also allowing discrimination in public accommodations. One can reasonably expect Bishop to use the full powers of the state AG's office to harass transgender kids at every available opportunity.\n\nSince he joined Congress in 2019, Bishop has been a member of the far-right \"Freedom Caucus\" and has voted against every abortion access bill that has been proposed in the House. He has also opposed immigration reform and voted against the Dream Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for children brought to this country by parents who were out of status. Bishop voted in favor of impeaching Secretary of Homeland Security Alexander Mayorkas but voted against impeaching former president Donald Trump.\n\nAnti-immigrant, anti-abortion, and anti-trans, Dan Bishop is the essential distillation of a RAGA candidate.\n\nJackson, while not the most progressive Democrat, has nonetheless left a different legislative trail while in Congress, voting \"no,\" for instance, on a restrictive voter registration bill as well as on the Mayorkas impeachment. He is also a defender of reproductive rights, which is critically important in North Carolina. In 2023, the Legislature passed a 12-week abortion ban; while it was ultimately vetoed by Roy Cooper, the Democratic governor, the fact that Republicans enjoy a five-to-two majority on the state Supreme Court means that an attorney general like Bishop, working in tandem with the court's conservative supermajority, could threaten reproductive rights and women's health even despite a governor's veto. Indeed, Jackson has warned that Bishop's election \"could invite certain kinds of lawsuits from him on abortion medication, or the provision of abortion, and they could run all kinds of offense on reproductive freedom from that perch.\"\n\nIn addition to defending reproductive rights, Jackson has taken strong stances against sexual assault. He was a proponent of a critical 2019 revision to a North Carolina law that closed a \"loophole\" that prevented women from revoking consent during sexual relations. Jackson has also been a defender of LGBTQ rights and has come out in favor of regulating artificial intelligence.\n\nThe contest between Jackson and Bishop shows why state AG races are so important. The election could be the difference between an abortion ban and reproductive freedom, regardless of whom voters send to the Legislature or the governor's mansion. Nearly every post- Dobbs state election tells me that if voters truly understand what's at stake, all the RAGA money in the world won't be enough to win Bishop the job.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA eugene depasquale (d) vs. dave sunday (r)\n\nUnlike North Carolina's Bishop, the RAGA-backed attorney general candidate in Pennsylvania is trying to stay away from culture-war issues. Dave Sunday, the current district attorney for York County, is running as a standard-issue carceral prosecutor. He wants to put people in jail and, toward that end, argues that putting people in jail is the best way to stop crime.\n\nSunday has said that he doesn't think the state Constitution protects the right to reproductive choice, but he has also said, \"I will follow the law, whatever that law is, as determined by the Legislature.\" Given the state of conservative politics, that's about the best you can hope for from a Republican candidate for any office. If his statement were true, I'd say \"Fair enough\" and move on.\n\nThe problem is, it may not be true. During the Covid-19 pandemic, when the law required Sunday to enforce then-Governor Tom Wolf's mandates and restrictions, he didn't follow it. Instead, during the earliest, harrowing months of the pandemic, he directed local law enforcement not to issue citations to businesses that violated Wolf's closure orders. He later doubled down, refusing to enforce Wolfe's order mandating masks in schools.\n\nMaybe I have trust issues, but when I see a guy so hooked into the conservative matrix that he won't even enforce a Covid mandate, I struggle to believe that he will let the Legislature decide whether pregnant people should be afforded human rights. Your mileage may vary.\n\nThe Pennsylvania AG seat is open this cycle because the previous state attorney general, Democrat Josh Shapiro, vacated it when he successfully ran for governor of the commonwealth in 2022. His victory is yet another indication that winning an attorney general election can be a springboard to higher office.\n\nThe Democratic nominee this year is Eugene DePasquale, who has been serving as Pennsylvania's auditor general. That's essentially the state's top investigator, which is a credential for AG, but DePasquale doesn't have the courtroom and trial experience that Sunday has. He is campaigning on prosecuting individuals who commit hate crimes, defending abortion rights, and opposing voter suppression tactics.\n\nStill, DePasquale's light prosecutorial record and centrist profile aren't the main issue in this race, because Sunday and the Republicans aren't really running against DePasquale. They're running against Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, who has effectively defined what a \"progressive prosecutor\" looks like and has used his prosecutorial discretion to great effect. Krasner is virtually untouchable in Philly, but the \"more like Alabama\" parts of Pennsylvania have been fed a constant stream of lies and misinformation about his effectiveness. In 2019, the Legislature passed a law allowing the state AG to prosecute certain firearms offenses in Philadelphia-and Philadelphia alone-if Krasner declined to do so.\n\nShould Sunday win, he will most likely use every shred of his authority to frustrate Krasner. That's what this race is really about.\n\nThis, too, is part of the RAGA strategy. Republicans know that even in red and purple states, there are urban centers that the long arm of their culture wars cannot reach. So that's where state attorneys general come in: They are well positioned to wrest \"home rule\" away from local DAs elected by Black and brown majorities.\n\nIf there are voters in Philadelphia who think they won't be affected by the state AG race because they have a great top prosecutor at home, I urge them to think again.\n\nMISSOURI elad gross (d) vs. andrew bailey (r)\n\nI'd like to be able to tell you that the civil rights attorney and former Missouri assistant attorney general Elad Gross has a real shot at taking down the Republican candidate for state AG. Gross seems like a nice man with a sweet sense of humor (his campaign website features a picture of the one time he almost made a tackle in football-before failing three times to make his college team). On the issues, he offers a standard spread of center-left positions, from protecting reproductive rights to stopping public corruption. And Gross is against Missouri's disgusting puppy mill industry.\n\nThe Humane Society rates Missouri as the worst state in the nation in terms of puppy mills. Of the 100 \"most problematic puppy breeders\" the society tracks, the Show-Me State is home to 23 of them. Gross has an extensive plan to deal with this, including suing inhumane breeders and making it harder for them to advertise and sell. If you can't already tell, this is an issue I care a lot about, and I would love to see Missouri elect an AG committed to stopping these people.\n\nBut... Missourians probably won't. Missouri is not a bellwether state; it's a red state with a vocal minority of liberals in St. Louis and Kansas City. The Republican voters of Missouri will functionally kill puppies if that's what it takes to install the next conservative hopeful who will crush reproductive rights.\n\nThis probably helps explain why so much of the attention this summer was focused on the Republican primary for AG, which was held on August 6. Missouri's previous attorney general was Eric Schmitt, who now serves as the state's junior US senator. Missouri's senior senator, insurrectionist fist-pumper Josh Hawley, was the attorney general before him. Missouri's AG office is a fast track to national prominence for the worst kinds of conservatives.\n\nThe GOP primary pitted Missouri's perfectly rabid current RAGA attorney general, Andrew Bailey, who was appointed by Republican Governor Mike Parson after Schmitt left for the Senate, against Will Scharf, one of Donald Trump's personal attorneys. Scharf was on the team that successfully argued before the Supreme Court that presidents should be allowed to commit crimes.\n\nRAGA did not officially endorse either candidate in the primary, but Leonard Leo's mini-army of aligned groups poured money into Scharf's campaign. Billionaire Republican donor Paul Singer (last seen offering Supreme Court Justice Sam Alito free fishing trips) also put $1.4 million into the campaign.\n\nThe argument against Bailey was simply that he wasn't MAGA enough. Bailey has toed the RAGA line since his appointment in 2023, but Scharf is part of the Leo brain trust, a person who can be counted on to bring whatever test case helps the MAGA movement the most. Scharf's campaign essentially argued that Bailey didn't do enough to help Trump overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nIn the end, Leo's attempt to install his loyal subject didn't work: Bailey smashed Scharf in the primary. While his positions are plenty terrible for the women of Missouri, defeating a Leo ally is nonetheless a victory-and a reminder that these state elections don't always come down to dark money and clandestine influencers. They come down to voters paying attention.\n\nI don't know if Missouri voters are paying enough attention to elect Gross, a guy who favors the humane treatment of puppies-and women in dire need of medical services-over Bailey, a guy who is suing Planned Parenthood for allegedly helping minors flee Missouri to obtain reproductive care. But I won't lose hope until the ballots are counted. Some people in Missouri might want an attorney general who works for them, instead of for RAGA.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nINDIANA destiny scott wells (d) vs. todd rokita (r)\n\nThe race for attorney general in Indiana is not close: The incumbent RAGA Republican, Todd Rokita, is likely to defeat his Democratic challenger, Destiny Scott Wells. But in a just world, the race would, at the very least, be close. The fact that it's not is an indictment of the Republican voters of Indiana and their cult-like devotion to the MAGA cause. Rokita is such a problem that Indiana almost changed its laws to make sure that a person like him cannot run for office in the future. Yet here he is.\n\nRokita is another former member of Congress who became state attorney general. Since assuming office in 2021, he has hit all the RAGA agenda points. He has been zealously anti-immigrant, literally suing a city for passing a local ordinance that declared the place \"welcoming\" to immigrants. He created a website to make it easier for students to snitch on \"woke\" teachers. He's been hostile to voting rights but friendly to corruption (testifying before Congress, he threatened to sue the government should it pass the \"For the People\" anti-corruption bill). He loves taking money from the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nBut none of this is what got Rokita into trouble. In 2022, he took to the airwaves to blast Dr. Caitlin Bernard. Bernard is the Indiana obstetrician who performed an abortion on a 10-year-old rape victim who had to flee Ohio to receive the procedure after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade . The medical care Bernard provided was legal in Indiana, but Rokita went on Fox News to announce that his office was launching an investigation into her. During his appearance, he called Bernard an \"abortion activist acting as a doctor-with a history of failing to report.\"\n\nRokita was reprimanded by the state Supreme Court for violating Indiana's rules of professional conduct; he later entered into a settlement with the state's disciplinary commission.\n\nEarlier this year, the Indiana Legislature attempted to pass a bill preventing people from running for attorney general if they had been sanctioned by the state Supreme Court. It wouldn't have applied to Rokita, since he was reprimanded, not sanctioned, but one gets what they were going for here. Indeed, in March, the Legislature removed the provision, with one Republican calling it \"inappropriate in an election year.\"\n\nIt would be great if all of this mattered to Republican voters, but Rokita wasn't even challenged in the primary.\n\nDestiny Scott Wells is a capable candidate. She enlisted in the Army National Guard when she was 19 and remains in the Army Reserve. Her campaign is focused on medical privacy-a key issue given the Republican push to revoke contraception rights and scour the medical records of women who deign to travel out of state. She should be a viable alternative to the guy who wants to harass doctors for providing medical care to 10-year-old rape victims. But this is Indiana, so I think we know how this will go.\n\nI n the remaining six races where the attorney general slot is in contention, RAGA candidates will likely run the table in Montana, Utah, and West Virginia, while Democrats look poised to win in Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Once in power, those RAGA AGs will wreak havoc on abortion rights throughout the country. In the other states where they are already installed, they will continue to do the bidding of wealthy Republicans like Leo and, increasingly, Elon Musk, who appears to have captured Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and persuaded him to sue media organizations on Musk's behalf.\n\nStill, RAGA's greatest asset has always been public ignorance of its significance. These elected officials wield more power than any individual congressperson and, with the help of lawsuits designed expressly for the current US Supreme Court, can have more national influence than any governor. Yet most people can't name them-or the candidates who are running to stop them.\n\nIn a presidential election year, most people's motivation for going to the polls is to vote for the top of the ticket. Some go on to vote for the whole roster of open positions, but plenty give up after filling in the bubble for president. Others, meanwhile, never make it to the polls at all, either because they're turned off by \"politics\" and feel that not voting is a protest worth making, or because they feel that their state's Electoral College votes have already been decided.\n\nIf you know any of these people, try to talk to them about their state and local races. Try to talk to them about their state attorney general. Try to talk to them about the large swaths of power they are ceding to these people by not showing up. RAGA attorneys can be beaten, even in states that will ultimately go to Donald Trump. The key to winning these races is for people to understand that they're important.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com .\n\nSometimes the right wing in this country seems like a riddle wrapped in an enigma encased in a conundrum. Do they want to strengthen the government in line with the once-fringe doctrine of the \" unitary executive ,\" concentrating most official power in the hands of a president who would then rule more or less by fiat? That's the fascist position.\n\nOr would they prefer to destroy the government, to \"starve the beast,\" something anti-tax activist Grover Norquist used to call for decades ago? \"I don't want to abolish government,\" he declared. \"I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\" That's the anti-government nihilist position.\n\nYou might not think that those two goals could coexist comfortably within a single party. And of course, you'd be right if you were talking about an ordinary American political party. But the Republicans are no longer an ordinary party. In many respects, in fact, they have become the however-fractious sole property of one Donald J. Trump. That former and quite possibly (God forbid) future president has no trouble simultaneously advocating contradictory, not to mention devastating, ideas. That's because, for him, ideas are an entirely fungible currency that he deploys primarily to maintain the attention and adulation of his-and it is increasingly his alone-GOP \"base.\" And precisely because Trump has so little invested in actual policy, the right wing believes he's a weapon they can point and shoot in whatever direction they choose.\n\nYou might also wonder why, at a moment when horror is being heaped on horror in Israel/Palestine, when wars continue unabated in Ukraine and Sudan , I find myself focusing on some distinctly in-the-weeds aspects of the American political system. Perhaps it's partly to distract myself from all the other nightmares around us. But even if I believed (which I don't) that the right response to the crisis in Israel/Palestine involved sending more weapons and money to Benjamin Netanyahu, Congress isn't in a position to appropriate anything at the moment.\n\nJust as we face so many crises globally, the legislative branch of the world's (theoretically) most powerful country has ceased to function. Perhaps by the time you read this, Republicans in the House of Representatives will have stopped squabbling over which right-wing bigot should be speaker. Maybe they will have opted for Jim Jordan, who has accused the Biden administration of planning to replace white voters with immigrants, or perhaps someone else entirely. Remember, too, that whatever joker emerges as speaker from such a chaotic process will be second in line to the presidency, should something happen to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\n\nRecently, I've somehow managed to end up on a few right-wing e-mail lists. The strangest people (Ron DeSantis, for example) are writing to ask me for money. My most recent supplicant was Stephen Miller, former senior adviser to President Trump and co-author, with Steve Bannon, of Trump's 2017 inaugural address in which the new president inveighed darkly against the \"American carnage\" he saw defiling the nation's landscape. These days, Miller is himself a president of something called the America First Legal Foundation , which bills itself as \"Fighting Back against lawless executive actions and the Radical Left.\"\n\nMiller, it turns out, has written to let me know that \"we are living in extremely perilous times and a truly dangerous moment for our Republic.\" As it happens, I agree with him, though obviously not for the same reasons. \"The federal bureaucracy has turned against the American people,\" Miller's missive continues. \"It has been completely corrupted into an ideological monolith of hard-left loathing for America. The fearsome power [his emphasis] of the state is raining down on political dissidents, while violent and vile criminals are released into our communities.\" The solution, of course, is to send money to America First Legal, so it can get on with the business of \"Fighting Back against lawless executive actions.\"\n\nMiller, however, will likely be less concerned about the fearsome power of the state once it's again in the hands of Donald Trump. Indeed, he's part of a group of former and present Trump advisers engaged in planning for a potential presidential transition in 2025. These include Russell Vought, who ran Trump's Office of Management and Budget, and former Trump White House chief of personnel John McEntee. As The New York Times reported in July, \"Mr. Vought and Mr. McEntee are involved in Project 2025 , a $22 million presidential transition operation that is preparing policies, personnel lists and transition plans to recommend to any Republican who may win the 2024 election. The transition project, the scale of which is unprecedented in conservative politics, is led by the Heritage Foundation, a think tank that has shaped the personnel and policies of Republican administrations since the Reagan presidency.\"\n\nThe key thrust of Project 2025 is full implementation of the \"unitary executive\" principle-the view that the Constitution locates the power of the executive branch in a single individual, the president. In its maximalist version, according to the Times , this theory also contradicts the long-held doctrine of the separation of powers, under which three coequal branches of government-executive, legislative, and judicial-provide checks and balances on each other. Under the unitary executive principle, presidential power simply outweighs that of either Congress or the Supreme Court. Project 2025's backers know that Trump will agree and act accordingly.\n\nBy \"long-held doctrine\" I mean a blueprint for democratic government that goes back to two 17th- and 18th-century political philosophers: Charles Montesquieu, who first wrote about the separation of powers, and John Locke, whose ideas about unalienable rights were enshrined in the Declaration of Independence. Like Montesquieu, Locke advocated a separation of governmental powers in which the legislative, not the executive, would be supreme. In that view, the democratically elected legislature makes a nation's laws and-just as the name suggests-the executive exists to \"execute\" them.\n\nDespite their occasional homages to Montesquieu and Locke, the Heritage Foundation and its followers have flipped that thinking upside down by insisting that the Constitution considers the executive branch superior to the other two. If that were the case, wouldn't the executive branch be described in that document's first article? In fact, Articles I, II, and III describe the legislative, executive, and judicial functions in that order, suggesting that if any of these is superior, it is (as Locke argued) the legislative.\n\nHeritage, however, points to Article II, which begins: \"The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows...\" What \"follows\" is a lengthy description of the very electoral process that Trump and company tried so hard to suborn on January 6, 2021.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nWhile Trump was president, he delighted in explaining to anyone who'd listen that he had \"an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.\" At the time, that suggestion of ultimate power was met with widespread derision.\n\nHowever, were Trump to be reelected, the folks at the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 and the America First Policy Institute have plans to, as the starship Enterprise captain Jean-Luc Picard would say, make it so. As the Times reported in July, their goal is \"to alter the balance of power by increasing the president's authority over every part of the federal government that now operates, by either law or tradition, with any measure of independence from political interference by the White House.\" Consider what follows a first step in exactly that direction.\n\nOK, now let's truly dive into the weeds: In his final year as president, Trump issued an executive order amending the regulations governing the federal civil service. That service was instituted by law in 1871 in response to what was then seen as rampant favoritism throughout the federal government. Patronage jobs-positions granted, often to the friends and family of powerful politicians or in return for money or favors-were officially eliminated. Competitive processes designed to select qualified candidates for specific positions replaced the old system.\n\nToday, the Office of Personnel Management oversees the hiring and firing of roughly 2.2 million civilian federal employees, the people who keep the wheels of government turning. They administer Social Security, Medicare, and the Internal Revenue Service, among many other things. They make sure that your meat isn't rotten and the alcohol content of your vodka bottle is what it says on the label.\n\nThe vast majority of those employees are chosen through competitive examinations, but about 4,000 key positions are directly appointed by the president or other senior officials, including the leadership of many agencies, like the Environmental Protection Agency or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other government executives. It's not unreasonable for presidents to want to put their own policy stamp on various branches of government through such appointments.\n\nThose 4,000 positions exempted from competitive hiring fall into five categories, delineated in five \"schedules\" (lists) described in a subsection of Title 5 of the United States Code. To be exact, Rule VI of Subsection A of Title 5-I told you we were going to get into the weeds!-lists in Schedules A through E the employees exempt from civil service exams.\n\nOr at least those were all the exempt categories until October 2020. That's when Donald Trump issued an executive order creating Schedule F, which exempted from competitive hiring all \"career positions in the Federal service of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.\"\n\nSuch a broad, ill-defined category could, in fact, have come to include any junior employee in any federal department who might in the course of his or her employment have cause to send a memo to a superior advocating any action. It's estimated that implementing Schedule F would have sent the number of exempt civil service employees soaring from 4,000 to roughly 50,000.\n\nOn taking office, however, President Joe Biden immediately rescinded that executive order so, at the moment at least, Schedule F no longer exists.\n\nIn fact, the feckless President Trump we knew wasn't even vaguely prepared to replace 50,000 civil servants with his own people during his last few months in office or, likely as not, over the following four years had he been reelected. That's where the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 comes in. They are now spending millions of dollars to recruit and vet political appointees who would toe the Trump line (a line they hope to draw in a future Trump presidency).\n\nThe rock band Stealers Wheel caught our current situation perfectly back in 1972 when they sang about \"Clowns to the left of me / Jokers to the right.\" The jokers to the right of me (and to the right of the majority of the people in this country) are the members of the House Freedom Caucus , their allies, and other MAGA followers. They are the ones (de)constructing the house of cards that Congress is becoming at this very moment. To call them anarchists would be an insult to conscientious anarchists everywhere. They are, in fact, anti-government nihilists who believe in little beyond a kind of gun-slinging performative violence . They don't want to drown the government quietly in a bathtub but to strangle it on live TV. And keep in mind that they have imagined nothing with which to replace it.\n\nWhere to begin? Those Freedom Caucusers in the House are now walking weapons in search of a target. Yes, they threatened to shut down the government unless their demands were met, but then they couldn't even decide what those demands were. Did they want to cut Social Security, Medicare, and other social service programs ? Impeach President Biden? Stop the prosecutions of Donald Trump? Increase border security? Stop funding Ukraine's war effort?\n\nWhen House Speaker Kevin McCarthy agreed to cooperate with the Democrats to prevent just such a shutdown, they threw him out. Then they couldn't agree on a new speaker, even though the House of Representatives can't conduct business without one. Yet not a day passes without a bomb-thrower like Matt Gaetz strutting around saying things like : \"My goal is to get the most conservative Speaker of the House with broad trust across the conference. The Swamp of Washington D.C. is going crazy right now because they are not in complete and total control-this gives us a great opportunity to put the interests of our fellow Americans first.\"\n\nMuch of this would be funny if it weren't so deadly serious. However, recent polls suggest that a 2024 contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden remains a toss-up. As historian Heather Cox Richardson recently told The Guardian , \"Democracies die more often through the ballot box than at gunpoint.\" The reelection of Trump. she believes, will signal:\n\n\"An end of American democracy. I have absolutely no doubt about that, and he's made it very clear. You look at Project 2025, which is a thousand pages on how you dismantle the federal government that has protected civil rights, provided a basic social safety net, regulated business, and promoted infrastructure since 1933. The theme of his 2024 campaign is retribution.\n\n\"I don't think people understand now that, if Donald Trump wins again, what we're going to put in power is those people who want to burn it all down.\n\nI can't say it any better than she has. They want to burn it all down so that they can rule over the smoldering ashes. That would put us on a true Schedule F-for Failed State-a condition this country now seems hell-bent on achieving.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

In this era of deep political division and hyper-partisanship on both sides of the aisle, candidates are often too cautious about how they frame their outreach to the broader electorate. Some of that caution is understandable. But it should not preclude a sharp focus on the lawless Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe mistake that too many Democrats have made in this election cycle is to imagine that edgy criticism of Trump will somehow narrow their appeal to independents and wavering Republicans. That makes no sense in a campaign season where mobilization of the broad anti-Trump base is critical for Democrats.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is reaching out to Republicans, as her recent visit to Wisconsin with former House Republican Conference chair Liz Cheney made clear. Yet, as anyone who watched the September debate between the two major-party presidential candidates well understands, Harris is also running hard and smart against Trump. It is hard to think that a substantial number of enthusiastic Trump backers will choose a Democratic candidate for the Senate in their states. Yet Republicans are currently mounting campaigns that imagine they can grab up independent votes, and even some Democratic votes, for GOP Senate candidates in blue and purple states.\n\nThis is the sly focus of campaigns for Republican Senate candidates such as former governor Larry Hogan in Maryland, Nella Domenici in New Mexico, Mike Rogers in Michigan, and Eric Hovde in Wisconsin. All of these GOP contenders are making major pushes to attract votes from moderate independents and Democrats.\n\nIn his race against Democratic US Senator Tammy Baldwin, Hovde is quoting Democratic presidents such as John  F. Kennedy on his website. In his race against Democratic US Representative Elissa Slotkin for an open seat in Michigan, Rogers is pitching himself as a candidate who \"will look for every opportunity to be bipartisan\" in the Senate. In New Mexico, where she faces Democratic US Senator Martin Heinrich, the Republican is mounting a \"Democrats for Domenici\" campaign. In his Maryland open-seat contest with Angela Alsobrooks, the Democrat who serves as Prince George's county executive, the Republican candidate is running a \"Democrats for Hogan\" campaign, mimicking Harris's \"Country Over Party\" slogan, and saying he won't vote for Trump in November. But the notoriously thin-skinned Trump has endorsed Hogan, saying, \"I'd like to see him win. I think he has a good chance to win.... I can just say from my standpoint, I'm about the party, and I'm about the country. And I would like to see him win.\"\n\nWhy is Trump for Hogan and for other Republicans Senate candidates who have tried, in at least some instances, to distance themselves from the GOP nominee? That's simple. If Trump wins a second term as president in November, his ability to appoint cabinet members who will implement his Project 2025 agenda, as well as Supreme Court justices and other federal jurists who will protect him from accountability, will be determined by which party controls the Senate. Trump knows that if he has a Republican Senate, and especially if the Republican majority is padded with GOP senators from swing states and blue states, there will be no stopping him.\n\nSimilarly, if Harris wins but ends up with a Republican-controlled Senate, her ability to govern will be severely limited.\n\nThe stakes are too high for Democrats to pull their punches in blue states and swing states.\n\nSchiff, a former United States Attorney who led the first of two congressional efforts to convict Trump for his many high crimes and misdemeanors, got the calculus right in his debate with Garvey.\n\nThe Republican tried to make Schiff's record as an impeachment manager a liability for the Democrat, griping, \"I can't imagine, Mr. Schiff, how you could get up every morning and have one mission, and that's to go after Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"How can you think about one man every day and focus on that when you've got millions of people in California to take care of?\" asked the Republican. \"I think it's unconscionable.\"\n\nBut Schiff recognized that voters, be they Democrats or Republicans or independents, want their elected representatives to be willing to hold the powerful to account.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\n\"Mr. Garvey likes that particular attack because that's what Trump likes to say. It's his way of telling MAGA viewers out there, 'Hey, I'm one of you.' That's not what Californians are looking for, Mr. Garvey,\" said the Democrat. \"Mr. Garvey, I stood up to a corrupt president. Yes, I investigated him. I impeached him. I led the trial in the Senate, and he incited a violent attack on the Capitol. And I was there that day, Mr. Garvey. I was there on January 6 as those insurrectionists were breaking down the doors and windows. The fact that you think that's perfectly OK, that you still want to support the guy who incited that [violence] tells me that you would never take your oath of office as seriously as I do.\"\n\nIt was a takedown that put everything in perspective.\n\nThe debate moderator invited the Republican to respond. But when the camera focused on Garvey, all that viewers saw was a long, awkward silence.\n\nSchiff finally said, \"I've left him speechless.\"\n\nGarvey eventually mumbled a few empty words.

If it sinks, he could drag his party down with him.\n\nBy Nate Cohn\n\nThe time after a presidential election can feel like a moment of clarity. The results, after all, are finally in.\n\nBut over the last two decades, the post-election period hasn't offered any clarity at all about the future of American politics. The winning party repeatedly convinces itself it has won a mandate, or even a generational advantage. The shellshocked losers retreat into internal debate. And then just a few months later, it becomes clear that the next phase of American politics will not be what the winners imagined.\n\nThis week, the next two years of American politics began to come into focus, and it does not look like a MAGA or Republican \"golden age.\" The special House elections in Florida and the Supreme Court election in Wisconsin confirmed that Democratic voters were not, in fact, stunned into submission by last November's election. More important, President Trump's sweeping tariffs - and the economic downturn that may follow - have created enormous political risks for Republicans.\n\nIn one key respect, the elections on Tuesday were not significant: They do not suggest that Democrats solved any of the problems that cost them the last election. Instead, they mostly reflect the party's advantage among the most highly informed, educated and civically engaged voters. This advantage has allowed Democrats to excel in low-turnout elections throughout the Trump era, even as he made enormous gains among the disaffected and disengaged young, working-class and nonwhite voters who show up only in presidential elections.\n\nStill, Democrats won't have to face many of those disaffected and disengaged voters until 2028. The results last Tuesday thus offer a plausible preview of the next few years of elections: major Democratic victories, including in next year's midterm election.\n\nThere might not have been anyone marching in pink hats, and congressional Democrats might have been \" playing dead ,\" but the Democratic special election strength looks just as large as it did in 2017 and 2018, before the so-called blue wave flipped control of the House.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But he has yet to take any real steps to reverse them.\n\nBy Maya C. Miller\n\nReporting from the Capitol\n\nSome Republican senators on Capitol Hill, including one of President Trump's most ardent supporters, have signaled their uneasiness to the sweeping global tariffs that the president announced this week and that sent global markets reeling .\n\nSenator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, warned on Friday that a future where other countries slap retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, as China has already done , was a \"very real possibility\" and would be a \"terrible outcome\" for the country.\n\n\"It's terrible for America,\" Mr. Cruz said on the latest episode of his podcast. \"It would destroy jobs here at home and do real damage to the U.S. economy if we had tariffs everywhere.\"\n\nMr. Cruz also said that a trade war would likely push inflation up and burden consumers with higher costs.\n\n\"I love President Trump. I'm his strongest supporter in the Senate,\" Mr. Cruz said. \"But here's one thing to understand: A tariff is a tax, and it is a tax principally on American consumers.\"\n\nMr. Cruz's comments came just two days after the Senate, in a largely symbolic move, voted to halt planned 25 percent levies on Canada . However, the bill is almost certain to die in the House - and even if it does not, Mr. Trump would be unlikely to sign it.\n\nMr. Cruz was not among the Republican senators who joined all Democrats in pushing the bill through. They were Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, and Senators Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, both of Kentucky.\n\nOn Thursday, another top Republican senator - Chuck Grassley of Iowa - teamed up with a Democrat to introduce a bill aiming to reclaim congressional authority over the implementation of tariffs.\n\nThe bill, which Mr. Grassley co-sponsored with Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, would require the president to give Congress 48 hours notice of any new tariffs. Congress would then have to approve those tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. Mr. Cruz was not a co-sponsor.\n\nMaya C.

      "text": "Republicans Better Watch Out\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nGuest Essay\n\nBy Kristen Soltis Anderson\n\nMs. Anderson, a contributing Opinion writer, is a Republican pollster and a moderator of Opinion's series of focus groups.\n\nJust a few months ago, Republicans were triumphant, while Democrats were demoralized. But something real has happened: Democrats' fury is building. Perhaps they have had it with Elon Musk. Perhaps Senate Democrats' capitulation on government funding ignited voters who felt abandoned by their party leaders. Perhaps it was all the institutions cutting deals under pressure from President Trump. Whatever it was, Democrats are proving a political axiom: Anger is a more powerful motivator in voting than happiness and satisfaction.\n\nAnd Republicans had better watch out, as they learned Tuesday night in a Wisconsin statewide election for a State Supreme Court seat, in which the Democratic-backed candidate prevailed by 10 percentage points just five months after Mr. Trump beat Kamala Harris there by just one point.\n\nAs a pollster, I've been focused recently on gauging what voters think of Mr. Trump's performance back in office. One way to do this is by asking if they approve or disapprove of the job he is doing across a range of issues - a metric that in the past few weeks showed gently declining but overall middling approval ratings.\n\nBut I think studying how voters feel is also important - maybe even more important than studying what they think. In my polling, when I ask voters how they feel about what the Trump administration is doing, Democrats are not simply dissatisfied. When I offered voters a range of seven emotions in a poll in mid-March, from \"furious\" to \"thrilled,\" the top response from Democrats was \"furious,\" at 38 percent. Only a quarter of Republicans described themselves as \"thrilled,\" by contrast (though, make no mistake, Republicans support Mr. Trump a great deal).\n\nWhat should worry Republicans most is that when a party wins elections and its supporters are satisfied with what their side is doing, it becomes easy to rest on one's laurels and miss the bubbling rage of the other side or not find ways to counter it. Democrats did this, to some extent, during the rise of the Tea Party movement, dismissing it as AstroTurf - activism masquerading as grass-roots energy - and paying dearly for it in the first Obama midterms, in 2010. Republicans may wish to dismiss some of what they see appearing at angry town hall meetings, but this isn't just the usual anger of an opposition party: Mr. Trump is supercharging the anger in two important ways that add up to even greater potential peril for Republicans in the short run.\n\nThe first factor is the nature of Mr. Trump's policy pushes, such as new tariffs and the mass firings of government employees, which can cause immediate problems for families, consumers and business leaders, with the only balm being his vague assurances of an ensuing upside. This is exactly the kind of dynamic that deepens the frustration and anger of a large group of very personally affected voters, who will seek to send a message.\n\nHi, everyone! There's something I'd like your take on: In the piece, I liken this moment to the 2010 Tea Party movement. Back then, there was a fair amount of debate within the GOP about whether they should run on a message of opposing and stopping President Obama, or if they should also put forward their own agenda. I wonder what you think Democrats ought to do now: run mostly on channeled anger about Trump, or put forward their own agenda and try to be more positive? And if the latter, what should be the main focus of their agenda?\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

It passed on party lines as part of a resolution that cleared the way for a vote later Tuesday on a government spending bill needed to prevent a shutdown at the end of the week.\n\nThe national emergency law lays out a fast-track process for Congress to consider a resolution ending a presidential emergency, requiring committee consideration within 15 calendar days after one is introduced and a floor vote within three days after that. But the language House Republicans inserted in their measure on Tuesday declared that, \"Each day for the remainder of the 119th Congress shall not constitute a calendar day\" for the purposes of the emergency that Mr. Trump declared on Feb. 1.\n\nDemocrats jeered the maneuver.\n\n\"The speaker is petrified that members of this House will actually have to take a vote on lowering costs on the American people,\" said Representative Greg Meeks, Democrat of New York, who introduced the privileged resolution. \"If Congress can't act to lower prices, protect retirement savings and hold the president accountable, what are we even doing here?\"\n\nDemocrats in the Senate could still try to force a vote to end the tariffs, putting Republicans in that chamber in a tough spot. But in order to terminate the levies, a resolution would have to pass both chambers and be signed by Mr. Trump.\n\nAna Swanson contributed reporting.\n\nCatie Edmondson covers Congress for The Times.\n\nAdvertisement"

With Tariffs, Trump Is Raising Them.\n\nTariffs\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nNews analysis\n\nPresident Trump's tariffs are scrambling the Republican plan for the economy, long centered on tax cuts and growth.\n\nBy Andrew Duehren\n\nAndrew Duehren writes about tax policy and the economy.\n\nThe Republican Party embarked this week on a haphazard experiment in economic policymaking, wagering that the United States can weather a monumental tax increase in the form of broad tariffs on imported goods as long as Congress also cuts taxes on income.\n\nIt's a mash-up that many investors, economists and even some G.O.P. lawmakers expect to be a failure.\n\n\"I always think that with gambling, at least you have a chance of winning. This is worse than that,\" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who worked for former President George W. Bush, said. \"This is betting with the mafia. You're going to lose.\"\n\nPresident Trump's plan to charge at least a 10 percent tariff on nearly all imports into the United States - along with much higher rates on goods from many countries - is the culmination of his quest to force companies to manufacture domestically, even if it comes at the expense of a relatively strong economy. Because tariffs are a type of taxation, Mr. Trump's plan is among the largest tax increases in decades, analysts say, a policy change that sent the stock market reeling, paralyzed corporate investment and shoved the economy closer to a recession.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans on Capitol Hill are plowing forward with legislation that would lock in lower taxes for American individuals and companies. There's diminishing hope among Republicans that those cuts can make up for drag created by the tariffs. Some of Mr. Trump's allies and tax cut enthusiasts, like Stephen Moore, his former economic adviser, have been begging the president for \"more tax cuts and less tariffs, please.\"\n\nOf course, Mr. Trump and the White House argue that tariffs are not taxes on Americans, but rather on foreign companies that will have to lower their prices to maintain access to the U.S. market. Mainstream economists have consistently found that tariffs raise prices for American consumers and companies, including domestic manufacturers who import materials to turn into final products.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

They have become forums where voters confront members of Congress about the sharp spending cuts they are proposing and President Trump's moves to fire federal workers and defund programs across government.\n\nMr. Hudson told Republican lawmakers that Democratic activists were bombarding town halls and drowning out actual constituent voices, and predicted the trend would worsen, according to two people in the room for his remarks. He encouraged House Republicans to instead hold tele-town halls or Facebook Live events. Both of those formats allow moderators to filter questions and comments.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson endorsed the approach at a news conference later on Tuesday, arguing that in-person town halls no longer provided lawmakers with an effective way to communicate with constituents.\n\n\"Democrat activists who don't live in the district, very often, will show up for these town hall events and they'll go in an hour early and they'll fill all the seats,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"Now I'm not saying everyone in these town halls that you've seen on television were not from the local area, but look, there are people who do this as a profession. They're professional protesters. So why would we give them a forum to do that right now?\"\n\nAt recent town hall events, some of the most strident complaints have come from participants who identified themselves as Democrats. But a number of questions pressing lawmakers have also come from Republicans. During a telephone town hall with Representative Stephanie Bice, Republican of Oklahoma, a man who identified himself as a Republican and retired U.S. Army officer voiced frustration over potential cuts to veterans benefits.\n\n\"How can you tell me that DOGE with some college whiz kids from a computer terminal in Washington, D.C., without even getting into the field, after about a week or maybe two, have determined that it's OK to cut veterans benefits?\" the man asked, referring to the Elon Musk-led effort known as the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nSimilar scenes played out in 2017, when protesters swarmed Republican town halls across the country and urged their lawmakers not to vote to replace the Affordable Care Act. Since then, a number of members of Congress have scaled back their participation in public town halls events, leery both of security concerns, and the optics of being subjected to testy confrontations.\n\nCatie Edmondson covers Congress for The Times.\n\nAdvertisement"

Policies Hits Senate Snag\n\nTrump Administration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nThe Trump administration asked Republicans in Congress to stop California's ban on new gas-powered cars. The Senate parliamentarian said it wasn't allowed.\n\nBy Lisa Friedman\n\nRepublicans in Congress cannot use an obscure legislative maneuver to stop California's ban on the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035, the Senate parliamentarian ruled on Friday.\n\nThe decision dealt a blow to efforts by the Trump administration to quickly kill policies that promote electric vehicles.\n\nCalifornia had received a federal waiver under the 1970 Clean Air Act from the Biden administration to impose a stricter automobile emissions standard than the one set by the federal government. Under that waiver, it enacted a plan to require all new cars sold in the state by 2035 be free of emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, the primary contributor to climate change.\n\nIt's one of the most ambitious climate policies in the United States, designed to shift the auto industry toward electric cars.

      "text": "\"Weird\" Is a Rebuke to Republican Dominance Politics\n\nAre you weird? According to Democrats-who have made \"weird\" a new term of art for Republicans-you're weird if you get overexercised about the genitalia of Olympic athletes, think childless people shouldn't have the right to vote, and generally fixate on controlling women, families, gender, and sexuality for reasons that seem transparently bound up in your own embattled masculinity and deep shame. You're weird if you yell in public about sharks, or about \" Joe Biden's border bloodbath ,\" especially while your hands dance to music only you can hear . You're weird if you want to track strangers' menstrual cycles but are mad that people know you Googled \"dolphin porn.\" You're weird if you campaign vigorously on issues that fly against common sense, such as getting rid of library books, abolishing the Department of Education, and giving the President dictatorial powers. \"Weird\" is multipurpose, a catchall designation for extreme or intense things that Republicans do or say. Its capaciousness is part of its appeal.\n\nIt's only a bit of an exaggeration to say that, semantically, \"weird\" doesn't really mean anything. The Democrats' disinclination to sharpen their critique telegraphs a desire to get on with it: to speed toward the future rather than linger in 2016. Back then, the liberal line on Trump was that he was \"not normal,\" and that his conduct as President should not be \"normalized\"-a rhetorical strategy that failed because \"normal\" doesn't really mean anything, either. Eight years ago, \"normal\" could easily be bent to accommodate the democratically elected occupant of the White House and one of the most powerful men in the world. A President has too much status, and can launch too many warheads, to be prosecuted for strangeness alone. Maybe we're the strange ones for voting them into office?\n\nThe reversal of that dynamic surely accounts for some of the glee that the \"weird\" brigadiers are spreading. My colleague Jay Caspian Kang proposes that \"weird . . . allows liberals to slap back at years of similar aspersions from the right.\" Socially progressive parties are more often tagged as outré, Kang observes, and so it's satisfying to turn the tables, to \"normalize [one's] politics through the imagined average voter.\" Democrats do seem relieved by a mounting conviction (among other Democrats, at least) that Republicans are not just cruel but deviant, and they have plenty of evidence to draw on, in the form of outlandish policy proposals and absurd comments. But another redefinition also appears to be taking place. The way liberals are using it, \"weird\" has less to do with one's distance from the norm than with one's desired level of control. With the Weird Sisters, in \"Macbeth,\" Shakespeare evoked the Fates, classical beings who decided who was born, exactly how long they lived, and how they died. The liberal capture of \"weird\" subtly registers that older valence, antiquity's spin on the \"control freak.\"\n\nWhen \"they go low, we go 'ew,' \" Monica Hesse wrote in a smart piece praising \"weird\" 's efficacy as a tactic. Hesse focussed on the word's air of schoolyard contempt, which, she argued, reframed the would-be bad boys of the right as \"kids in the corner eating glue off their hands.\" But though \"weird\" is snarky, it's not an epithet that would gladden bullies' hearts. It's not vindictive; it's not precise. It doesn't belabor the point, perhaps because displaying such antipathy and rancor toward another person would be, well, weird. Instead, \"weird\" is dismissive, implying that the specifics aren't worth getting into: the brisk impatience of a tweet from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, when she had to explain the phenomenon to Vivek Ramaswamy, is a far cry from the sadism we've come to expect from Trumpworld. (\"Trying to watch what LGBTQ+ people do all the time is abnormal. Punishing people who don't have biological offspring is creepy,\" Ocasio-Cortez wrote crisply, as if annoyed to have to spell it out.) There's an implicit expectation that weird behavior is temporary, a passing fever rather than an inherent trait. This contrasts with the brutal, identity-based attacks that characterize the MAGA movement.\n\nFor all the attention paid to how the word \"weird\" paints Republicans, its real utility seems to lie in the image it projects of Democrats. On the spectrum of insults, \"weird\" is fairly mild, with just enough sting to mean business-more of a forceful call-in, in contemporary parlance, than a devastating callout. The new rhetoric has helped prominent men in the Party, from Governor Tim Walz to Senator Chris Murphy to Senator Chuck Schumer , present an alternate vision of masculinity: something stoic, down-to-earth, relaxed, and trustworthy. Tellingly, Walz, who has been most closely tied to the attack, was just announced to be the Vice-Presidential nominee. Speaking about his Republican counterpart J. D. Vance, Walz, a former football coach, said , \"It's weird. I don't want him talking about my family.\" A more universal sentiment can hardly be imagined, and it's especially charming in the mouth of America's Midwestern Dad. In general, the \"weird\"-slinger comes off as frustrated but hopeful; under no illusions about his opponent but still fundamentally reasonable; prepared to indulge in some well-warranted ridicule but not to compromise his decency. These are the same old Dems, in other words, but newly willing to bring the fight. It's no accident that \"weird\" 's rise has coincided with Kamala Harris's ascendency as a candidate, a moment of political renewal that has galvanized listless liberals . Rhetorically, \"weird\" conveys that unusual times call for unusual measures, and that the Democrats have finally figured out how to go both low and high at once.\n\nThere's even a hint of caregiving in the left's language. Weird is the sort of word a parent might use to wave away a child's anxiety-\"A monster in the closet would be pretty weird , huh?\" It's a way of acknowledging a fear without assigning it too much power. And it's a form of containment. There's a sense of quarantining this baffling political weirdness away from the rest of the country, not in anything so crazy as a physical structure-no need for that-but simply in a word, a gust of air, some sound attached. The wager of \"weird\" is that Americans of all stripes have been longing for de-escalation, a cooling hand on their brow, and that they'll welcome a chance to distance themselves from the perceived fringe. Biden's Presidency may have offered a measure of stability and sanity to those reeling from the unreality of the Trump years, but his reëlection campaign did not. The country seemed to be sleepwalking toward November as Trump's rhetoric darkened and the Democratic establishment dismissed clear evidence of their candidate's decline. As in a nightmare, we all had rigor mortis and couldn't open our mouths to protest when we were told that these two men represented the best our political system had to offer. Harris, when she moved to the top of the ticket, jolted many people back to life. The fear and confusion aren't gone, but her candidacy diminishes those feelings, makes them seem silly and insignificant. By running Harris, Democrats are signalling that they refuse to dwell in denial; and, therefore, that they refuse to fight MAGA on its own fantastical turf. If she wins, the country has a shot at waking up from an extremely weird dream. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Republican Victory and the Ambience of Information\n\nDawn had not yet broken on the election results last week when Democrats began their favored ritual of falling out of love. Reasons were enumerated why Kamala Harris, the candidate who weeks earlier had been a magnet for enthusiasm, was an obvious poor choice to run for President. She was too coastal , it was suggested, too centrist , too un-primaried , too woke , too female . What were they thinking? The remorse is familiar, regardless of the outcome. When Joe Biden ran for President in 2020, many Democrats lamented that the Party hadn't produced a stronger option-but Biden went on to receive more votes than any candidate in American history. Hillary Clinton transformed, in the Party's view, from a historic nominee to a terrible candidate almost overnight. Barack Obama was widely acknowledged as a great candidate-even a once-in-a-generation one-who barely made it to a second term. John Kerry, a \" legitimate, good candidate ,\" lost the popular vote; Al Gore, almost universally considered to be a terrible candidate, won it. One might conclude that the Democrats' ability to hold the heart of the American public has amazingly little to do with the ideal dimensions of the candidate they put forth, and that their perennial trying and failing to find the perfect figure, followed by rites of self-flagellation, is a weird misappropriation of concern. The Republicans don't lament the inadequacies of their candidates, clearly. The Republicans have thrice sent Donald Trump.\n\nIf the problem this year wasn't the person, was it policy? Our distance from the close of the polls is still measurable in days, and yet voices have settled into hot debate about which issues Harris undersold, at the cost of the election. She leaned too much on reproductive freedom , we hear, or gave fatally little attention to concerns about immigration or the Palestinian cause or the Israeli cause . The campaign missed what spoke to men , perhaps particularly Black men , or Latino men -or was it women ? Also, not enough about the kitchen-table economy .\n\nTo anyone who studied the Harris campaign up close, many of those accounts don't track. The Vice-President talked about illegal immigration, and her work to curb it, all the time. Mobilizing Black men in swing states was among the campaign's most deliberate projects. The Democrats were faulted for hazy policy long after they released a ninety-two-page party platform and an eighty-two-page economic chaser filled with figures, graphs, footnotes, and detailed plans. Harris spoke at length about taxes and the kitchen-table economy all across the country.\n\nWhy didn't the speeches register? Why did people persist in thinking that Harris was short on policy; that Trump's programs would boost the American economy, despite a widely broadcast consensus from sixteen Nobel Prize-winning economists to the contrary; or that he would lower taxes for working people, though the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy calculated that he would increase them? Even many of Trump's critics think his first term marked a high point for border patrol, though more unauthorized migrants have been forced to leave under Biden. (Why was Biden's Presidency widely dismissed as desultory, when, in fact, as my colleague Nicholas Lemann recently put it , \"he has passed more new domestic programs than any Democratic President since Lyndon Johnson-maybe even since Franklin Roosevelt\"?) How did so many perceptions disprovable with ten seconds of Googling become fixed in the voting public's mind? And why, even as misapprehensions were corrected, did those beliefs prevail?\n\nDemocrats, during their hair-shirt rituals, gaze into their souls and find \"bad messaging.\" There is talk of a poor \"ground game,\" an élite failure to \"connect.\" But the Harris campaign set records or near-records for fund-raising , volunteer enrollment, and in some districts voter registration ; it is hard to imagine what a better ground game or a closer connection might have looked like in three months. And the messaging, which hewed to the middle-class experiences of Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, neither of whom is Ivy-educated or grew up rich, was hardly misguided in a race that ostensibly came down to the economic and exclusion anxieties of working people. Yet Democrats did make a crucial messaging error, one that probably (as the line goes) lost them the election. They misjudged today's flow of knowledge-what one might call the ambience of information.\n\nHarris's approach this year was distinct from her failed effort to run a more identity-centered campaign in the Democratic primary of 2020. Instead, it leaned on strategies that had carried her toward her two most improbable electoral victories: her first race, for San Francisco district attorney, which she entered while polling at six per cent, against a powerful progressive incumbent and a well-known law-and-order centrist, and won by more than ten points; and her election as California's attorney general, which at least one major California paper initially called for her opponent on Election Night, before Harris gained ground in the continuing count and, in a reputation-making vindication of her strategy, pulled ahead. Her magic in those elections had come largely through micro-targeting-a focussed, intensely local effort to engage voters on tailored terms and to mobilize small communities that traditional campaigning missed. In the early two-thousands, this was the cutting edge of ground strategy. Harris's political peers regarded her as one of its first virtuosi.\n\nOn the trail with the Vice-President, reporting a profile for Vogue , I was struck by how reflexively her mind and methods ran to the local frame. When I noted, in an interview, that one of her policy signatures seemed to be investing in community-development financial institutions (C.D.F.I.s)-which offer capital access to struggling communities-Harris lit up and elaborated a neighborhood-centered theory of market-based improvement. She touted C.D.F.I.s' contributions to \"the economy of the community.\" Laying out her middle-class economic-opportunity programs, she invariably talked about a woman who had run a nursery school on her block.\n\nIf Americans still arrive at a theory of the world through their communities, the boundaries of those communities have broadened and diffused. Harris's micro-targeting home run in San Francisco came before the iPhone. Her second unlikely victory, in the race for California attorney general, roughly coincided with Facebook's introduction of a proprietary sorting algorithm for its News Feed. In the ensuing years, there were major changes to the channels through which Americans-rich Americans, poor Americans, all Americans-received information. As early as 2000, the political scientist Robert Putnam, in his landmark study \" Bowling Alone ,\" noted that technology, not least the Internet, had an individuating, isolating tendency that eroded the network of civic bonds-he called it social capital-that joins and holds people in groups.\n\nIt is wrong to suggest that people now relate only through digital screens. (People still show up at cookouts, dinner parties, track meets, and other crossings.) But information travels differently across the population: ideas that used to come from local newspapers or TV and drift around a community now come along an unpredictable path that runs from Wichita to Vancouver, perhaps via Paris or Tbilisi. (Then they reach the cookout.) Studies confirm that people spend less and less time with their neighbors. Instead, many of us scroll through social networks, stream information into our eyes and ears, and struggle to recall where we picked up this or that data point, or how we assembled the broad conceptions that we hold. The science historian Michael Shermer, in his book \" The Believing Brain ,\" used the term \"patternicity\" to describe the way that people search for patterns, many of them erroneous, on the basis of small information samplings. The patterns we perceive now rise less from information gathered in our close communities and more from what crosses our awareness along national paths.\n\nThe Democrats didn't look past national-scale audiences-Harris sat with both Fox News and Oprah. But she approached that landscape differently. The campaign, it was often noted, shied away from legacy-media interviews. It instead used a national platform to tune the affect, or vibes, of her rise: momentum, freedom, joy, the middle class, and \" BRAT \" chartreuse. When she spoke to wide audiences, her language was careful and catholic; one often had the sense that she was trying to say as little as possible beyond her talking points. The meat and specificity of her campaign-the access, the detail, and the identity coalitions-were instead concentrated on coalition-group Zooms, and on local and community audiences. Harris micro-targeted to the end.\n\nDonald Trump did the inverse. He spoke off the cuff on national platforms all the time. He said things meant to resonate with specific affinity or identity subgroups, even if they struck the rest of listening America as offensive or absurd. (\"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs!\") As my colleague Antonia Hitchens reported , his campaign was boosted by a traditional get-out-the-vote ground effort late in the game-despite this apparently not being a priority for Trump-but the canvassing was less about delivering policy information than about tuning voters' ears like satellites to the national signal. (Election fraud was a theme.) Trump's speeches at rallies, many people noticed, had a curious background-music quality: they went on forever, aimlessly, and people would come and go at will. The actual speeches didn't seem to matter; they existed simply to set a vibe and keep certain broad suggestions (immigration big problem! Biden Administration so corrupt!) drifting into the ether. Trump seemed to think that much of the voting public couldn't be bothered with details-couldn't be bothered to fact-check, or deal with fact checkers. (\"Who the hell wants to hear questions?\" he asked at a town hall in October before deciding to dance and sway to music for more than half an hour.) Detail, even when it's available, doesn't travel widely after all. Big, sloppy notions do.\n\nPlanting ideas this way isn't argument, and it's not emotional persuasion. It's about seeding the ambience of information, throwing facts and fake facts alike into an environment of low attention, with the confidence that, like minnows released individually into a pond, they will eventually school and spawn. Notions must add up to a unified vision but also be able to travel on their own, because that's how information moves in a viral age. And national media is key. Trump's command of the ambience of information wouldn't have been possible without his own platforms, such as Truth Social, as well as allies such as Fox News' C.E.O., Suzanne Scott, who in 2020 excoriated her team after they fact-checked Trump, and Elon Musk, who, hoping for executive-branch power over his own sector, largely funded more than a hundred and seventy-five million dollars' worth of pro-Trump outreach, was read into early voting data , and tweeted lies, conspiracy theories, and mistrust of media on his network, X, which boosts his posts. The communications researcher Pablo Boczkowski has noted that people increasingly take in news by incidental encounter-they are \"rubbed by the news\"-rather than by seeking it out. Trump has maximized his influence over networks that people rub against, and has filled them with information that, true or not, seems all of a coherent piece.\n\nThis is the opposite of micro-targeting. The goal is for voters to meet ideas coming and going so often that those notions seem like common sense. The pollster and political-marketing-language consultant Frank Luntz assembled a focus group of men who had previously voted for a Democratic nominee but were voting for Trump this year. Many of their rationales were based on untrue information settled deep in the ambience of information. \"Nothing against people from California, but the policies in California are so bad I wouldn't be surprised if the state goes bankrupt,\" a participant in Indiana said. (California has the largest economy in the U.S.) \"Kamala from California is too radical . . . she's too far left.\" (Biden's policies tended to be to the left of Harris's, when they didn't align.) These are not convictions that someone acquires from a specific source, neighborhood, or community.\n\nOf all the data visualizations that were churned out in the hours following the election, the one that struck me most was a map of the United States , showing whether individual areas had voted to the left or to the right of their positions in the Presidential race in 2020. It looks like a wind map. And it challenges the idea that Trump's victory in this cycle was broadly issues- or community-based. The red wind extends across farmland and cities, young areas to old, rich areas to poor. It is not the map of communities having their local concerns addressed or not. It's the map of an entire nation swept by the same ambient premises.\n\nIn a country where more than half of adults have literacy below a sixth-grade level , ambient information, however thin and wrong, is more powerful than actual facts. It has been the Democrats' long-held premise that access to the truth will set the public free. They have corrected misinformation and sought to drop data to individual doors. This year's contest shows that this premise is wrong. A majority of the American public doesn't believe information that goes against what it thinks it knows-and a lot of what it thinks it knows originates in the brain of Donald Trump. He has polluted the well of received wisdom and what passes for common sense in America. And, until Democrats, too, figure out how to message ambiently, they'll find themselves fighting not just a candidate but what the public holds to be self-evident truths. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Rise of the New Right at the Republican National Convention\n\nAround lunchtime on Tuesday, the former Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy , trailed by a phalanx of aides, stepped out of the sun on the plaza outside Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum, where the Republican National Convention is being held, and sat down at a sports pub named the New Fashioned. The evening before, the Ohio senator J. D. Vance , who was a classmate of Ramaswamy's at Yale Law School, had been formally nominated as Donald Trump's running mate, and all the talk around the Convention was about the ascent of the so-called New Right, the cohort of Republican intellectuals, operatives, and politicians who have been working to transform the basic ingredients of Trumpian nationalism into a coherent ideology-a group that includes both Vance and Ramaswamy. A prominent New Right policy thinker, after pointing out that he and others had spent a decade trying to move from the fringes of the Party, said, \"I mean, it's amazing!\" One longtime Republican told me that he'd listened to a podcast on the New Right on his morning run, to try to get up to speed. Ramaswamy, for his part, was eager to talk about the New Right's central tension: \"The single most important topic for the next four years of the conservative movement is the distinction between the national protectionists and the national libertarians, both of whom reject the neoliberal consensus.\"\n\nOutside, the far-right millennial operative and media personality Charlie Kirk was interviewing Ben Carson , an improbable clash of Republican generations. Inside, digging into lunch, Ramaswamy spooled out his theory. What members of the New Right shared, he said, was an opposition to what Ramaswamy called the \"neoliberal consensus\" that had promoted immigration, military support for foreign allies and democracies, pro-corporate economics, and free trade. This movement, he went on, rejected \"growth for its own sake, economic growth at the expense of national identity, national security.\"\n\nRamaswamy cuts a distinctive figure-a slim, fast-walking, thirty-eight-year-old biotech millionaire with a high forehead and a widow's-peak pompadour. In person, he was less showy and more down-to-earth than he'd been on the stump, an entrepreneur with a wonkish side, but he also displayed a tendency of up-and-coming élites from time immemorial to ambitiously carve up the future. Vance, he said, embodied the national-protectionist outlook-committed to a retreat from international trade in favor of a domestic reindustrialization program, and to a weaponization of the federal government. (In 2021, Vance had called for a \"de-Baathification program\" within the U.S. bureaucracy, saying that conservatives should fire \"every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our own people.\") Vance has also supported populist initiatives in the Senate, such as reductions in the price of insulin and cuts to the pay of C.E.O.s, and has advocated for a stringent social conservatism.\n\nRamaswamy positioned himself as the representative of the New Right's libertarian wing. There was room within America First, he thought, for a trade break from China that stopped short of a full retreat from the international system, and for a smaller federal bureaucracy instead of a weaponized one. \"I do not want to replace a left-wing nanny state with a right-wing nanny state,\" Ramaswamy said. \"I want to shut down the nanny state.\" Trump, he went on, shared elements of both visions. The former President was more in Vance's camp on trade and more in Ramaswamy's on government. \"Drain the swamp is the national-libertarian,\" Ramaswamy told me.\n\nCarson stopped by the table, and he and Ramaswamy briefly chatted. I asked Ramaswamy which coalitions were behind each of these factions, and he said that it was too early to say. \"This is very nascent, very bleeding edge,\" he said. It was still a debate among élites. No wonder the New Right has clung so closely to Trump. He has the legions. They are theorists in search of an army.\n\nThe Republican Party has lost the popular vote in six of the past seven elections, but as delegates gathered in Milwaukee this week they seemed confident that they would win this one, so complete has been Joe Biden's crisis. The rolling protests and counter-protests outside the hall, and the furious fights between anti- and pro-Trump factions inside of it, both of which characterized the Republican Convention in Cleveland in 2016, were entirely gone. I left Ramaswamy and milled through the crowd in the plaza. Reporters wearing yellow lanyards chatted amicably with delegates, who wore red lanyards. Games of cornhole were in progress despite the midday heat. The ominous atmosphere of Trump's first Convention had given way to the late-middle-aged day-drunk familiarity of a rich beach town. This was happy MAGA .\n\nAny discernible notes of tension at this Convention have tended to include an element of generational conflict: Mitch McConnell , the Party's eighty-two-year-old leader in the Senate, was booed when he spoke on Monday. Matt Gaetz , the bratty, forty-two-year-old, ultra-right Florida congressman, crashed a CNN interview with the recently deposed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy , who had no speaking slot on the Convention stage-his time had passed. \"What night are you speaking?\" Gaetz shouted. When Ramaswamy addressed the Convention, the Never Trump conservative Jonah Goldberg disparaged him on CNN: \"I don't believe his sincerity on anything. But he's very good at telling people who want to like him what they want to hear. And he's another one of these younger guys who is a very old person's idea of what they want young people to be like.\" Perhaps that was a good read on the New Right-that they are less of a mass movement than an effort to try to solve an aging party's enduring problem of how to imagine a future.\n\nOne reason this brainy-sounding rhetoric about ending neoliberalism has appealed to rank-and-file Republicans is that most of its proponents have paired it with an exacting social conservatism. Vance, for instance, implied in a 2021 interview that victims of rape and incest should be required to carry pregnancies to term, but he has softened his position more recently to match Trump's. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri whose politics are similar to Vance's, told me that Republicans needed to shed their affiliation with corporate interests and Wall Street-\"I mean, there's just no future there,\" he said-but he still maintained that religious voters are the \"true base\" of the Party. Working-class voters, he went on, whether or not they go to church, consider themselves religious and \"associate religion with a form of nationalism. It's sort of, like, 'America is a country blessed by God.' \"\n\nOutside of the Convention zone, Milwaukee can seem eerily vacant. On Tuesday afternoon, I sat down in the empty courtyard of an insurance company's complex and spoke with Elbridge Colby , a defense official in the Trump Administration and a prominent China hawk, who had just finished a panel inside. (Earlier this year, Politico had named him one of the two likeliest selections as Trump's next national-security adviser.) The week before the Convention, Colby had addressed the New Right at the National Conservatism Conference, an annual gathering that attracts the anti-internationalist, anti-immigrant, and anti-corporate wing of the Republican Party. There were plenty of interventionist foreign-policy thinkers still active on the right, he told me, but there were also signs that neoconservatives might not dominate the Republican donor class for much longer. That same day, the Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk , who reportedly had urged Trump to pick Vance, planned to give forty-five million dollars per month to a pro-Trump super PAC . (On X, Musk called the article \"FAKE GNUS.\") \"There is a spectrum,\" Colby said, \"but I do think it is moving our way.\"\n\nIs it? Trump is a variable and dissolute figure. The day after he picked Vance for Vice-President, triggering a cascade of stories about the financial industry's panic over a populist threat, Bloomberg published an interview with the former President in which he mused about picking the JPMorgan Chase C.E.O., Jamie Dimon, as his Treasury Secretary. Trump also reportedly intervened, against the wishes of religious conservatives, to remove from the Party platform a plank calling for a federal bill banning abortion. Hawley told me that decision \"frankly mystifies me. I think it's a mistake.\" But when I asked Hawley which policies he might expect to be addressed first, if Republicans won full control of the government in November, he mentioned expanding energy production and securing the border. That didn't sound like much of a break with the Party's traditional priorities, but the senator said, \"Let me just push back-tariffs, too.\" Even on foreign policy, the revolution wasn't immediately obvious. Just a few hours after I met with Colby on Tuesday, Nikki Haley was at the lectern in the convention hall saying that the source of all the problems in the Middle East can be \"laid at the feet of Iran.\" The New Right policy thinker had told me, \"I don't know anyone under the age of thirty who doesn't treat the neocons with total scorn.\" But it didn't exactly seem like neoconservatism was dead.\n\nFor months, the Democrats have drawn attention to Project 2025 , a nine-hundred-page document, compiled by a constellation of conservative groups, detailing a full-scale war on the bureaucracy which would follow a Trump victory, along with a list of candidates for a staggering array of posts who could be counted on to erode the government from within. (Trump has recently disavowed Project 2025.) Oren Cass, the founder and chief economist of the think tank American Compass, which promotes a retreat from neoliberal economics and which advised on the project, told me, \"I could give a list of people for every single Cabinet position who I think would be great.\" He added, \"I could give you a list of people for every position who are plausible choices and very kind of normie, Paul Ryan-style Republicans. And I could give you a list of people who are, like, clearly unqualified, but also, for various reasons, plausible choices. And the reality is that the actual final Cabinet is going to be some combination of people from those three lists.\" Cass said that, when Trump won the 2016 election, the G.O.P. had been like the dog that caught the car; now the Party was somewhat better prepared. But, still, it was Trump. Really, who knew?\n\nCass himself had once been the domestic-policy director for Mitt Romney's 2012 Presidential campaign, which, he later said, \"opened his eyes to the bankruptcy of market fundamentalism,\" as New York magazine put it. (On Tuesday, Dylan Matthews, a senior correspondent for Vox who writes about economic policy, posted on X, \"It's 2000. There's a new kind of conservative in town. 'Compassionate conservatives' are rejecting free-market orthodoxy. It's 2013. There's a new kind of conservative in town. 'Reform conservatives' are rejecting free-market orthodoxy. It's 2024 . . .\") In other words, these ideas have been kicking around for a while. But that makes it all the more remarkable that their breakthrough into the mainstream has come with Trump, since the New Right's leading politicians have also adopted Trump's election denialism, his disinterest in the ideal of democracy, and his cruelty toward minorities. Hawley might have been in Vance's spot had he not been caught on camera first raising his fist in support of demonstrators outside of the Capitol on January 6th and then scampering away from the mob once its members had breached the building.\n\nA central irony of the New Right is that it is a campaign to remake conservatism for the working class undertaken by a tiny group of people who are obviously élites-an astonishing number of whom (Vance, Hawley, Ramaswamy, and Colby among them) graduated from Yale Law School, in the late two-thousands and early twenty-tens. Their success has so far hinged on how effectively they can capture the enthusiasm of other élites. Of course, this makes the fate of the New Right dependent upon the personal ambitions and political choices made by a very small number of individuals, one of whom is now running for Vice-President. Christopher Rufo, the conservative activist and Manhattan Institute fellow who was central to the campaigns against diversity-equity-and-inclusion programs and critical race theory, told me, of Vance, \"What's exciting about it to me is J.D. is still thinking, still learning, still positioning, and, like everyone in our generation, we're still trying to arrive at a crystallized form of what our politics will be.\"\n\nVance is not yet an especially compelling stump speaker. As he introduced himself at the Convention on Wednesday night, there was an asynchronicity in his interactions with the audience. He would try to make a serious point, and attendees would erupt into a football cheer; when Vance tried to give the crowd what they wanted to hear-insisting, for instance, that Trump had run for office, enduring \"abuse, slander, and persecution,\" because \"he loves this country\"-the response was polite applause. All day, the crowd had been getting revved up: the lusty cheers earlier that evening for Peter Navarro, who had recently finished a prison sentence, for contempt of Congress related to a January 6th investigation, were far louder than those for the Vice-Presidential nominee. Vance was quieter and more halting, but he was also making an unusual kind of appeal, based on his disputes with others in the room. \"I think our disagreements actually make us stronger,\" Vance said. His message to Americans, he went on, was that the country should be governed by \"a party that is unafraid to debate ideas and come to the best solution.\"\n\nThere was one moving moment in Vance's address, when he introduced his teary-eyed mother, \"ten years clear and sober,\" and a funny one, when he recalled discovering that his grandmother had kept nineteen loaded handguns in various locations throughout her house, so as always to be in reach of one in case of an intruder. More important was a generational riff. \"When I was in the fourth grade, a career politician by the name of Joe Biden supported NAFTA , a bad trade deal that sent countless good jobs to Mexico,\" Vance said. \"When I was a sophomore in high school, that same career politician named Joe Biden gave China a sweetheart trade deal that destroyed even more good American middle-class manufacturing jobs. When I was a senior in high school, that same Joe Biden supported the disastrous invasion of Iraq, and at each step of the way, in small towns like mine, in Ohio, or next door in Pennsylvania and Michigan, in other states across our country, jobs were sent overseas, and our children were sent to war.\" This history, of élite failure and working-class suffering, has been the one told by liberals and progressives; reversing the trend has been central to the policy initiatives and identity of the Democratic Party since the Iraq invasion. The story is true, Vance was saying, but the right has a claim on it, too.\n\nNot everything Vance said landed so smoothly or concisely. Implausibly, he tried to blame the increase in housing prices, at least in part, on rising levels of illegal immigration. When he attempted to invoke the experience of actual working-class Americans, he seemed to be describing political constructions rather than actual people: \"the factory worker in Wisconsin who makes things with their hands and is proud of American craftsmanship.\" An effective liberal political movement would note the New Right's entanglement with a regressive social agenda, the compromises it has made with Trump, and its commitment to voting against working-class interests despite the rhetoric. (The A.F.L.-C.I.O., for instance, has scored Vance's 2023 voting record at zero per cent.) But, given Biden's struggles, there is no such effective movement right now. Vance had entered the hall to \"America First,\" by Merle Haggard, an anti-Iraq War ballad, and he had exited to Fleetwood Mac's \"Don't Stop\"-Bill Clinton's campaign song. That Vance had co-opted the Democrats' music was a hard-to-miss suggestion of what he and his cohort are up to, and a signal, perhaps, of the depth of the political threat. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "How Republican Billionaires Learned to Love Trump Again\n\nIn February, the billionaire investor Nelson Peltz convened two dozen of the country's wealthiest Republicans for a dinner at Montsorrel, his $300-million oceanfront estate in Palm Beach, just down the road from Mar-a-Lago. During the 2020 campaign, Peltz had hosted a lavish fund-raiser for Donald Trump at the mansion, which took in $10 million. But, in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, Peltz, like many Republicans of all income levels, had publicly denounced the President. In an interview with CNBC on January 7th, he apologized for his vote and said that Trump would always be remembered for that day's \"disgrace.\" \"As an American,\" he added, \"I'm embarrassed.\"\n\nDuring this year's Republican primaries, Peltz gave $100,000 to a super PAC supporting Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator, but Scott dropped out before a single G.O.P. vote was cast. By the time of Peltz's dinner, it was clear that Trump would secure the Republican nomination for an unprecedented third consecutive election. Peltz, who was no longer on speaking terms with the ex-President, opened the discussion with a blunt assessment of the race. \"I don't like Donald Trump,\" an attendee recalled Peltz saying. \"He's a terrible human being, but our country's in a bad place, and we can't afford Joe Biden.\" So, Peltz concluded, however much they might dislike it, \"we've all got to throw our support behind him.\"\n\nSome of Peltz's guests remained skeptical, holding to the view, as the attendee put it, that \"Trump's a terrible person-I'm going to focus on the Senate.\" Most of the donors, however, adopted a more pragmatic approach to the ex-President. Many of them had been granted significant access to the White House during his four years in office. Some were expected to be considered for senior roles in a second term: Trump has personally floated the name of the hedge-fund tycoon John Paulson, for instance, as a potential Secretary of the Treasury, touting him as \"a money machine.\" \"They know how transactional he is,\" the attendee told me. \"They're hoping to have some influence over the course of appointments and therefore the direction of his Administration.\"\n\nA few of Peltz's guests were all in. Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas gambling titan, has known Trump for decades; his wife, Andrea Hissom, is close to the former First Lady, Melania, and the two couples have spent time together in Palm Beach. And then there was Elon Musk, the world's richest man, who had reportedly got to know Peltz through Peltz's son Diesel, a tech entrepreneur. At the time, Musk had said that he would not back a candidate in the Presidential race. By the fall, he would enthusiastically endorse Trump, spending $75 million to support him through a new super PAC , and spreading pro-Trump lies and conspiracy theories on his social-media platform, X.\n\nTrump, the richest man ever to serve in the White House, is himself a billionaire, though the extent of his wealth has long been in question. (As of mid-October, with stock in Trump's social-media venture, Truth Social, experiencing a pre-election bounce, Forbes estimated his net worth at about $5.5 billion.) In 2016, Trump hardly bothered to court big donors. He was shunned by much of the G.O.P. élite and largely self-funded his Republican primary campaign. He lambasted Jeb Bush, the brother and son of Presidents, as a tool of the moneyed class. \"Super PAC s are a disaster,\" Trump said in a 2016 debate. \"They're a scam. They cause dishonesty. And you'd better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.\"\n\nBut in 2020, as an incumbent President, Trump embraced super PAC s and their funders. The two main super PAC s supporting his campaign raised $255 million on his behalf that year; his total fund-raising came to more than $1 billion. However, Biden, like Hillary Clinton four years earlier, raised even more than Trump, bringing over-all spending in the 2020 Presidential race to a record $5.7 billion.\n\nAs 2024 began, Trump's money problems were mounting: Biden started the election year with almost $120 million in the bank-nearly three times as much as Trump. The ex-President, with four criminal indictments and multiple civil lawsuits pending, was also paying tens of millions of dollars in legal bills through his political operation. The main super PAC of his Republican rival Nikki Haley, meanwhile, outraised his own by nearly $5 million in the second half of 2023. In January, Trump posted a threat on social media to the donors defecting to Haley, whom he had taken to calling Birdbrain: \"Anybody that makes a 'Contribution' to Birdbrain, from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. We don't want them, and will not accept them.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nOn February 16th, the same day as Peltz's dinner in Palm Beach, Trump's business was hit with a $355-million judgment, plus interest, in a New York civil fraud case. At a fund-raiser in Dallas, in March, Biden taunted his rival about his dire financial state, joking, \"Just the other day, a defeated-looking guy came to me and said, 'Mr. President, I need your help. I'm being crushed with debt. I'm completely wiped out.' I had to say, 'Donald, I can't help you.' \"\n\nBut Trump's cash crisis was misleading. By mid-March, after Haley dropped out and the ex-President clinched the nomination, his fund-raising comeback was already under way. Many rich Republicans might have preferred to move on from him, but they were still, above all, right-wing partisans. They had flip-flopped on Trump before; they could do it again. Later that month, Peltz hosted Musk, Wynn, and a few others for a Sunday-morning breakfast. This time, Trump was not the subject of agonized debate among the billionaires. He was the guest of honor.\n\nTrump's effort to win back wealthy donors received its biggest boost on the evening of May 30th, when he was convicted in Manhattan on thirty-four criminal counts related to his efforts to conceal hush-money payments to the former adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. After the verdict, Trump walked out to the cameras in the courthouse and denounced the case brought against him as \"rigged\" and a \"disgrace.\" Then he departed in a motorcade of black Suburbans. He was headed uptown for an exclusive fund-raising dinner, at the Fifth Avenue apartment of the Florida sugar magnate José (Pepe) Fanjul.\n\nThe ex-President arrived with his son Eric, stopping to shake hands and exchange pleasantries with each of the approximately two dozen guests, a \"AAA list\" of the G.O.P.'s top funders, as John Catsimatidis, the billionaire supermarket owner, put it. Such events, another attendee told me, often feel like a birthday dinner for the host, except that \"there's a lot of money being given to someone who isn't the host-making Donald Trump the birthday boy, so to speak.\"\n\nTrump was seated at the head table, between Fanjul-a major Republican donor going back to the early nineties-and Stephen Schwarzman, the C.E.O. of Blackstone, the world's largest private-equity fund, who had endorsed Trump the previous Friday. Securing the support of Schwarzman was a coup for the Trump campaign. In 2022, he had said that he would not back the former President again, because it was time for \"a new generation of leaders,\" and, during the primaries, he had given $2 million in support of Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor, who had repeatedly called Trump \"unfit to be President.\" In a statement explaining the reversal, Schwarzman said that Biden's \"economic, immigration and foreign policies\" were \"taking the country in the wrong direction.\"\n\nAt the dinner, Trump reprised his public rant about the \"biased\" legal proceedings brought against him, but an attendee who spoke with me was struck by how \"calm and confident\" Trump seemed for someone facing prison time. \"He has this very strong internal capability to push those things aside and still feel good about things,\" the attendee said. At the end of the evening, Trump went around the room and solicited opinions on whom he should pick for his running mate. Haley, Scott, and Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota and a wealthy businessman, were mentioned; a couple of the attendees expressed a preference for J. D. Vance, the young populist senator from Ohio, whom Trump would ultimately choose. The donors appeared to relish the chance to help select a Vice-Presidential candidate. \"I've never seen anything like it,\" the attendee marvelled. Trump raised about $50 million at the event.\n\nTrump was fund-raising off his conviction with small-dollar donors as well; his campaign, which portrayed him as the victim of a politicized justice system, brought in nearly $53 million in the twenty-four hours after the verdict. Several megadonors who had held back from endorsing Trump announced that they were now supporting him, including Miriam Adelson, the widow of the late casino mogul Sheldon Adelson; the Silicon Valley investor David Sacks, who said that the case against Trump was a sign of America turning into a \"Banana Republic\"; and the venture capitalist Shaun Maguire, who, less than an hour after the verdict, posted on X that he was donating $300,000 to Trump, calling the prosecution a \"radicalizing experience.\" A day later, Timothy Mellon, the banking-family scion, wrote a $50-million check to the Make America Great Again super PAC .\n\nEd Rogers, a longtime G.O.P. lobbyist, had never publicly endorsed Trump or raised money for his campaigns. On May 31st, the day after Trump's conviction, he sent his first contribution to the ex-President. \"There was no case to make that that was not targeted prosecution,\" he told me. He predicted that other Republicans who, like him, had been \"allergic\" to Trump would now get on board as well. \"I tell people I am a Bill Barr, Chris Sununu, Nikki Haley Republican,\" he said, listing the names of Republican officials who had criticized Trump in blistering terms only to support him again in 2024; Haley, despite having called Trump \"unhinged\" and a threat to the Republic, had announced the week before his conviction that she would vote for him. \"The choices are Biden or Trump, and I'm at peace with that,\" Rogers said in June. \"I wish it was a different equation, but it's not.\"\n\nMany donors I spoke with at the time described Trump's trial as an impetus, but they tended to cite a litany of other reasons, too, including questions about Biden's age and fitness to serve another term, concerns about his economic policies, and gripes about some of his appointees, such as the head of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, who has launched high-profile antitrust investigations. Trump, despite his populist rhetoric, deficit spending, and support for market-distorting tariffs, has sold himself as a pro-business candidate. He has promised extensive deregulation, nearly unfettered drilling for oil and gas, and tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals. \"A lot of the donors have just come to the conclusion that, when you add it all up, the risks with Trump are behavioral-personal behavior and what he says-versus the policies,\" the attendee at the Fifth Avenue fund-raiser told me. It was a \"rationalization\" adopted by \"even those who were initially very put off, very alienated, by his behavior at the end of his Presidency.\"\n\nBy late May, Trump's campaign had more money in the bank than Biden's. The incumbent President's disastrous performance in a June 27th debate against Trump only accelerated the trend. \"After the debate, Biden looks like a loser, so these people who were never going to give to Biden, they're now even more attracted to the idea of giving to former President Trump,\" the attendee at Fanjul's dinner said. \"Because he looks like a winner.\"\n\nThe following month, as Democratic donors and elected officials frantically pressured Biden to drop out of the race, Trump and the Republicans again outraised the Democrats. \"The Zeitgeist in the business world is that Trump is going to be President again,\" a billionaire C.E.O. who is not a Trump supporter told me at the time. \"Therefore, why fall on your sword on principle?\" He added, \"Businesspeople-their main focus in life is to make money, and you make money by backing winners. . . . They've concluded, O.K., he's going to be President, let's hold our nose and do what we have to do.\"\n\nThe modern era of campaign finance began with George W. Bush's 2000 Presidential campaign, which professionalized the idea of the campaign \"bundler\" and created, in effect, a national club for wealthy Republicans who backed the G.O.P.'s Presidential effort. Individual contributions to federal candidates were limited to a few thousand dollars in so-called hard money, but wealthy supporters could tap their networks to bring in hundreds of thousands more. The Bush campaign formalized this approach, calling its top fund-raisers, those who raised more than $100,000, Pioneers; in 2004, a new category, Rangers, was added for those who collected more than $200,000. \"We made it fun,\" Jack Oliver, Bush's national finance director, recalled. \"We built a community.\"\n\nDuring the 2008 campaign, Bush's successor, Barack Obama, harnessed his hope-and-change platform to the power of the Internet, raising an unprecedented number of gifts online from small-dollar donors. The increase in donations-in addition to both parties actively recruiting big-dollar bundlers-made it the first Presidential election in history in which the campaigns spent more than $1 billion. Two years later, the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision ruled that federal law could not prevent corporations from spending unlimited sums to elect candidates, a decision that effectively ended restrictions on campaign fund-raising.\n\nThe arms race of political spending that ensued has not only increased the influence of money in politics-it's changed the nature of national elections. \"What's happened is that money has moved from the political parties-which were a centering force in American politics for two hundred years, because they had to stay competitive-out to super PAC s on the right and the left,\" Tom Davis, a former Republican House member from Virginia, who once ran the Party's congressional-campaign committee, told me. \"That has only further polarized our politics.\"\n\nEarlier in this election cycle, the Federal Election Commission, already a largely toothless agency, undid some of the few remaining restrictions on coördination between candidates and super PAC s. Many large contributions are no longer disclosed at all, with huge sums flowing through so-called dark-money funds that support candidates or causes without revealing their donors; the Web site OpenSecrets found about $660 million in such spending in 2020. Far more dark money is expected in this year's election. One veteran political operative told me that, even as the billion-dollar campaign remains a recent phenomenon, the country could soon see its first billion-dollar contribution. \"The amount of money sloshing around Washington now is beyond any sense of reality,\" Fred Wertheimer, a public-interest lawyer who spent his career advocating for enhanced campaign-finance laws, said. \"It's like a sandbox for billionaires, and they treat it like a sandbox, and they go in and play.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nGordon Sondland, a wealthy hotelier from Seattle who parlayed a million-dollar donation to Trump's 2017 Inauguration into an appointment as the Ambassador to the European Union, began bundling donations for Republicans in the early two-thousands. \"Look, I bundled for George W. Bush. I bundled for McCain, Romney, Jeb Bush, and then, ultimately, for Trump,\" he said. \"And if you bundled a few million dollars through a fund-raiser or through a lot of cold-calling, leaning on friends, colleagues, acquaintances-that was considered a significant achievement.\" At the start of the Trump era, Sondland added, \"you used to get a really good seat at the table at an event for fifty grand. . . . Now you add another zero to that. It's five hundred to get to the roundtable, and that's just a ten- or fifteen-minute discussion in someone's dining room with the candidate.\"\n\nIt's not only the sums that have changed; donors now expect more for their money. \"It's a whole different class,\" Sondland said. \"They're less concerned about the photo op and a visit to the state dinner at the White House.\" Instead, he added, \"they want to essentially get their issues in the White House. . . . They want someone to take their calls.\"\n\nDuring the 2019 impeachment inquiry of Trump, Sondland acknowledged under oath that there had been a \"quid pro quo\" in Trump's attempt to pressure the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, into investigating Trump's political opponents. Trump fired Sondland two days after the impeachment trial ended in a Senate acquittal. Nonetheless, Sondland told me that he planned to vote for Trump again. \"It's a binary choice,\" he said. \"And I want the Trump policies.\"\n\nThe bundling of hard-money individual contributions-currently capped at $3,300 each for the primary and the general election-which Sondland calls \"business as usual\" fund-raising, is still happening. But, whereas Bush's Rangers needed to bring in $200,000, a bundler now has to collect $2.5 million to join the top-tier \"Trump Victory Trust,\" according to documents obtained by CNBC. \"Bundlers of hard money still have a role, because that is the principal way in which Republicans fund campaigns at the federal level,\" a Trump supporter who was one of the original Bush Pioneers told me.\n\nThe reason is structural: Democrats have retained an advantage in small online donations, while Republicans rely on a higher percentage of large contributions. As of late September, sixty-eight per cent of contributions to the Trump political network had come from big donors, compared with fifty-nine per cent for the Democrats. Trump, in other words, needs his billionaires more than the other side does. Raising more money from fewer donors is the Party's strategy.\n\nTrump's time in the White House provided ample evidence that some billionaires could have extraordinary sway in a second Trump Administration. \"They think they have a greater chance to have influence over Trump than they have had the last four years over Biden,\" a prominent Republican fund-raiser told me. Key positions in Trump's first Administration went to alumni of Goldman Sachs, the C.E.O. of the nation's largest oil company, and scions of wealthy families, such as Betsy DeVos. When criticized for appointing so many ultra-rich Cabinet members, Trump responded, \"I want people that made a fortune!\" His signature legislative accomplishment slashed the top corporate tax rate from thirty-five per cent to twenty-one per cent and reduced the top individual-income-tax rate. \"You all just got a lot richer,\" Trump was reportedly overheard saying, at his Mar-a-Lago club, hours after signing the bill.\n\nIn office, Trump gave some of his donors highly unusual roles in government. Schwarzman, the Blackstone C.E.O., for example, had not supported Trump in the 2016 primaries, but he gave $250,000 to his Inauguration; soon after the Senate passed the tax-cut bill, he hosted a private lunch with Trump at his New York triplex-the former home of John D. Rockefeller-where the cost of entry was $50,000 a plate. Schwarzman revealed in his 2019 memoir that Trump had asked him to help renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Schwarzman reportedly spoke with Trump as often as several times a week during the talks. \"Donald listens to me because I'm richer than Donald,\" Schwarzman joked at one point to Gerald Butts, then the top adviser to the Canadian Prime Minister.\n\nSchwarzman also wrote that he had served as Trump's intermediary with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping, personally extending the invitation that led to Xi's visit to Mar-a-Lago, in early 2017. In 2018, Schwarzman made eight trips to China \"on behalf of the administration,\" personally reporting back to Trump about his efforts \"to assure senior Chinese officials that the President was not looking for a trade war.\" His pivotal role was not disclosed at the time, despite the potential conflicts inherent in having the person in charge of Blackstone's broad investment portfolio also represent the U.S. government. In 2020, Schwarzman gave $3 million to a pro-Trump super PAC .\n\nPeltz, the billionaire who hosted fellow Republican donors in Palm Beach, also had direct access to the White House. A few months after Trump's Inauguration, he met privately with the President in the Oval Office, presenting him with a written dossier that made the case that Amazon and its owner, Jeff Bezos, were responsible for the economic woes of the U.S. Postal Service. Trump, who had long attacked Bezos as the proprietor of the Washington Post , summoned a senior official to hear Peltz's complaint. According to the official, Peltz told Trump that \"the reason why the Post Office is in the red is almost entirely because of Amazon,\" claiming, falsely, that it received preferential rates, benefitted from \"unfair competition,\" and ought to be considered an antitrust violator.\n\nTrump's staff tried to figure out what Peltz's interest was in the matter. It turned out that Trian Fund Management, Peltz's asset-management firm, had recently taken a $3.5-billion stake in Procter & Gamble, the consumer-products giant. Peltz, an activist investor who buys his way into corporate-leadership roles, often by prompting proxy fights, considered Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods a threat to his business. On December 29, 2017, Trump tweeted, \"Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!\"\n\nIsaac Perlmutter, the former head of Marvel Entertainment, which he sold to Disney, in 2009, for $4 billion, was also at Peltz's breakfast for Trump in Palm Beach. (Trump personally introduced the pair at Mar-a-Lago, where Perlmutter has a regular table next to the ex-President's; last year, Peltz and Perlmutter joined forces when Peltz launched an unsuccessful bid to win a seat on Disney's board.) Perlmutter donated $5 million to Trump's 2016 campaign; his wife, Laura, was a member of Trump's Inauguration committee. Soon after Trump became President, he installed Perlmutter and two of Perlmutter's friends from Florida as de-facto overseers of the Department of Veterans Affairs, an agency with an annual budget of some $200 billion. \"On any veterans issue the first person the President calls is Ike,\" a former Administration official told ProPublica, which revealed the arrangement.\n\nDavid Shulkin, whom Trump had appointed to head the V.A., made multiple visits to Palm Beach to consult with the troika that officials came to call \"the Mar-a-Lago crowd.\" \"There probably weren't too many times I met with the President when he didn't say, 'What's happening with Ike?' \" Shulkin once said. When Perlmutter visited Washington, Shulkin told me, \"I would get a call-'Could you come over to the White House? Mr. Perlmutter's here with the President.' \"\n\nShulkin was fired by Trump, in March of 2018, amid a controversy over an expensive trip to Europe that Shulkin had taken at taxpayers' expense. Within hours, he went public with accusations that the story had been hyped by Trump political appointees who were intent on privatizing many of the V.A.'s services. Shulkin told me that he never fully understood why Perlmutter, who had not served in the U.S. military or even visited a V.A. hospital until Shulkin took him to one, had been given such power over the agency. He described Perlmutter as \"a private-sector guy\" whom Trump admired as a self-made man, someone who \"had started with very little and built empires.\" The problem, as Shulkin saw it, was that Perlmutter had little idea of what he was doing. \"Because he never worked in government, he didn't understand government,\" Shulkin told me. \"Part of my role was always trying to translate-'That isn't the way we could do things in this organization.' \"\n\nPerlmutter, however, has remained close to Trump. He and his wife gave $21 million to a super PAC supporting Trump's bid in 2020, and, in 2024, they bankrolled a new pro-Trump super PAC , Right for America, donating another $25 million. By September, Right for America had raised some $70 million, which it has spent on an advertising blitz this fall. The venture drew support from other longtime members of Mar-a-Lago, including the Newsmax founder Christopher Ruddy, who gave $100,000, and Anthony Lomangino, a South Florida waste-management mogul, who donated $7.85 million. Scott Bessent, another hedge-fund executive often mentioned as a possible Trump Treasury Secretary, also contributed $100,000.\n\nPerlmutter's highly unusual role in the first Trump Administration appears to have become something of a template for outside influence in a second term. In March, when Elon Musk met with Trump at Peltz's house for breakfast, they discussed a broad advisory gig for the tech billionaire on such matters as immigration and the economy-\"in the mold of the role\" that Perlmutter had played at the V.A., according to the Wall Street Journal . By August, after publicly endorsing Trump, Musk had fleshed out the idea. During a lengthy live-streamed conversation with Trump, Musk suggested that a commission was needed to investigate how to rein in government spending. Such a panel, Musk posted on X, \"would unlock tremendous prosperity for America.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nWeeks later, during a speech at the Economic Club of New York, Trump formally announced his support for a \"government-efficiency commission\" that would \"conduct a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government.\" He proposed that Musk, despite having received billions of dollars in government contracts and subsidies for his ventures SpaceX and Tesla, should chair the effort. Soon, Trump was calling Musk his future \"Secretary of Cost Cutting.\" It sounded like a more ambitious version of a project that Trump had launched early in his Presidency, when he named the billionaire investor Carl Icahn as a special adviser in charge of overhauling federal regulations. Icahn left the role less than a year later, when an article in this magazine raised questions about potential conflicts of interest.\n\nTrump has long made a practice of telling potential supporters what they want to hear. This year, he has also changed previous policy positions in ways that would benefit some of his party's largest donors. In March, for example, he publicly reversed course on forcing the sale of the Chinese-owned social-media app TikTok, despite having signed an executive order, in August, 2020, stating his intention to ban the app if it was not sold to a U.S.-based buyer within forty-five days. Back then, Trump warned that a Chinese company owning so much of Americans' personal data was a national-security threat. But this winter, when the Biden Administration endorsed a bipartisan bill to force TikTok's sale, Trump came out against the measure. On Truth Social, he wrote, \"If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck\"-his derogatory name for Facebook's C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg-\"will double their business.\" Steve Bannon, Trump's former adviser, posted another explanation for the about-face: \"Simple: Yass Coin.\"\n\nDays earlier, at an event in Florida for the conservative group Club for Growth, Trump had met with Jeff Yass, a major investor in TikTok's parent company, ByteDance. Yass, a libertarian-leaning Wall Street billionaire who started out as a professional poker player, has not officially endorsed Trump or donated directly to him. Instead, he has given more than $25 million to the Club for Growth PAC , which is supporting the ex-President's reëlection. (According to OpenSecrets, Yass and his wife have contributed more than $70 million to conservative candidates and causes this election cycle.) Yass also appears to have had a hand in Trump's personal enrichment. This spring, the company behind Truth Social merged with Digital World Acquisition Corp., a company in which Yass's trading firm, Susquehanna, was the single largest institutional investor. Truth Social went public in March, and Trump's majority stake in the company is now worth an estimated $3 billion.\n\nPerhaps the most striking example of the former President's donor-friendly flexibility in 2024 has been his shift on the cryptocurrency industry. In recent years, he was unambiguously critical of bitcoin, the most widely traded digital currency, saying it \"seems like a scam\" and \"potentially a disaster waiting to happen.\" But, in 2024, he became an unapologetic promoter of it, attracting contributions from major players in the field, such as the twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, each of whom donated $1 million in bitcoin to help Trump. The former rowing stars who famously sued Zuckerberg, their classmate at Harvard, for allegedly stealing the idea for Facebook, went on to found the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini. (In a speech this summer, Trump called them \"male models with a big, beautiful brain.\") This year's Republican Party platform offers few details on many policy issues affecting Americans, but it is unusually specific on crypto, promising to \"defend the right to mine Bitcoin\" and opposing the creation of a \"Central Bank digital currency,\" which could threaten the crypto industry's biggest investors.\n\nIn July, Trump flew to Nashville for the Bitcoin 2024 conference, where he spoke shortly after one of his top fund-raisers, Howard Lutnick. Lutnick, the C.E.O. of the Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald, has become a leading public proponent of the crypto industry; at the conference, he announced a plan to lend $2 billion to crypto investors, allowing them to use bitcoin as collateral. Onstage, Trump said that his Administration would permit the creation of so-called stablecoins, which, he promised, would \"extend the dominance of the U.S. dollar to new frontiers around the world.\" Trump also promised to fire Gary Gensler, Biden's chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose pro-regulatory positions on crypto have outraged bitcoiners. The United States, Trump vowed, \"will be the crypto capital of the planet.\"\n\nLutnick, who has known Trump for thirty years and who once made a guest appearance on \"The Celebrity Apprentice,\" supported Trump's previous campaigns. But he has significantly increased his giving in 2024. According to Bloomberg, Lutnick and his wife donated $30,200 to Republicans in 2016 (though he also gave $1 million to Trump's 2017 Inauguration committee), $1.3 million in 2020, and $12.1 million so far this year. In May, during the former President's trial in Manhattan, Lutnick hosted a fund-raiser for him at Lutnick's apartment in the Pierre hotel. In early August, he held another event at his forty-acre estate in Bridgehampton, which brought in $15 million; seats for a roundtable with Trump in Lutnick's dining room went for $250,000. The following Monday, MAGA Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC , recorded a $5-million donation from Lutnick, the largest individual political gift he'd ever made.\n\nAfter the Bitcoin event in Nashville, Trump brought Lutnick on board his plane, Trump Force One, to a campaign stop in Minnesota, where Lutnick introduced Vance. Lutnick later told an interviewer that travelling to a rally with the former President was like \"going to a rock concert with Mick Jagger.\" During the trip, Lutnick said, Trump offered him a formal role as co-chair of his Presidential transition team. The decision was announced a few weeks later, after the fund-raiser at Lutnick's Bridgehampton home. Another co-chair is Linda McMahon, the former head of the Small Business Administration in the Trump Administration. She, too, is a wealthy donor who, according to federal records, has given more than $10 million to support Trump in 2024.\n\nThat same month, Trump announced that he and his sons Don, Jr., and Eric were getting into the crypto business themselves. Steve Witkoff, a New York real-estate mogul and a major Trump donor, who testified on Trump's behalf during his civil fraud trial this year, helped set up the venture, called World Liberty Financial. One of the entrepreneurs brought in as a partner, Chase Herro, was later revealed to have referred to himself as \"the dirtbag of the Internet.\" Trump, during a rambling two-hour live-stream rollout on X, struggled to describe how exactly the new business would work, or even when it would launch. \"Crypto is one of those things we have to do,\" he said. \"Whether we like it or not.\"\n\nBy then, Lutnick's sphere of influence had moved well beyond bitcoin. In October, he told the Financial Times that appointees in a second Trump Administration would be subject to a strict \"loyalty\" test to avoid the kinds of senior aides who sought to constrain Trump during his first term. \"Those people were not pure to his vision,\" Lutnick said. \"We're going to give people the role based on their capacity-and their fidelity and loyalty to the policy, as well as to the man.\"\n\nFor all Trump's success in winning back reluctant conservative billionaires, many of them have seen firsthand the ways in which his erratic behavior and anti-market ideas could disrupt their businesses and the wider economy. After Trump became President, he asked Schwarzman to enlist high-profile business executives to serve on an advisory council. The participants included Musk; Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase; Mary Barra, of General Motors; Bob Iger, of Disney; Larry Fink, of BlackRock; and Jack Welch, the former C.E.O. of General Electric. It was a perfect Trump setup: the biggest brand names in American business would come to the White House, kiss his ring, and offer free advice. But, as one of the panel's members recalled, the first session quickly devolved into an argument between Trump and several participants over his false allegation that China was manipulating its currency. In the summer of 2017, following Trump's comments about there being \"very fine people on both sides\" of the white-supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, the group convened an emergency call and decided to disband. After Schwarzman conveyed the news to the White House, Trump preëmptively tweeted that he had decided to shut the group down.\n\nEarly this summer, Trump's campaign surprised the Business Roundtable, a members-only organization of corporate C.E.O.s, with a last-minute acceptance for the ex-President to appear at the group's quarterly meeting in Washington. Andrew Ross Sorkin, the Times ' financial columnist and a host of \"Squawk Box,\" on CNBC, reported that even C.E.O.s at the meeting who were sympathetic to Trump had found the former President uninformed and \"remarkably meandering.\" A source in the room told me that Trump's digressions included complaints about his court cases and \"crazy rants about Venezuelan immigrants.\"\n\nSoon after the event, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at Yale University who tracks the political preferences of America's corporate leaders, wrote in an op-ed for the Times that not a single Fortune 100 C.E.O. had donated to Trump by June of this year, something he called a \"telling data point.\" In fact, Sonnenfeld argued, the lack of giving to Trump from traditional Republican donors in the business community was the real fund-raising story, \"a major break from overwhelming business and executive support for Republican Presidential candidates dating back over a century.\" Sonnenfeld told me that such giving \"fell off a cliff\" when Trump became the Party's nominee-going from more than a quarter of Fortune 100 C.E.O.s in 2012, when Mitt Romney was the G.O.P. candidate, to zero in 2016. In 2020, he noted, only two Fortune 100 C.E.O.s had given to Trump-someone in the energy sector who is no longer running his company and Safra Catz, the C.E.O. of the Oracle software corporation. One lobbyist who speaks with many corporate C.E.O.s told me, \"Unanimously, they hate the Biden Administration's policies. But I think almost unanimously they would much rather deal with that than the risk of catastrophic disaster from a Trump Administration.\" By fall, the only Business Roundtable member publicly backing Trump was Schwarzman.\n\nCharles Koch, perhaps the most legendary Republican financier of recent decades, has never backed Trump, either. The political network affiliated with him and his late brother David remained officially neutral in the Presidential races of 2016 and 2020, and spent tens of millions of dollars trying to defeat Trump in this year's Republican primaries, much of it supporting Haley. When she dropped out, the Koch network concentrated on down-ballot races. But Kochworld, like the Republican Party more broadly, remains divided. \"There are a lot of donors in that network lobbying Charles from the perspective of, I know you don't like him, but he's better than the alternative,\" Marc Short, who worked for a Koch-affiliated group and later served as Vice-President Mike Pence's chief of staff, said. Nevertheless, neither Koch nor Pence is supporting Trump this fall-a remarkable rift, given the role that each of them has played in Republican politics.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has cultivated a new group of what might be called MAGA megadonors. A study conducted for The New Yorker by the campaign-finance expert Robert Maguire, of the nonprofit good-government group CREW , found that, as of this summer, more than forty of the G.O.P.'s biggest super- PAC donors during Romney's 2012 campaign had never given to a pro-Trump super PAC , including Oracle's co-founder Larry Ellison, the Dallas real-estate tycoon Harlan Crow, and the hotel magnate J. W. Marriott, Jr. Meanwhile, nearly sixty pro-Trump donors in the study, including Lutnick, Mellon, Perlmutter, and the Wisconsin shipping magnates Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein, had given nothing to the pro-Romney super PAC . Others have significantly increased their giving. The Adelsons, for example, donated $53 million to the pro-Romney super PAC in 2012 and $90 million to support Trump in 2020, when they were the largest individual donors of the cycle. By the end of September, Miriam Adelson had given $100 million to back Trump in 2024.\n\nWith such sums at stake, Trump has pursued what the former Bush Pioneer called a \"high touch\" approach to the Republican billionaire class. The ex-President has all but invited donors to view their contributions as business investments, telling oil-and-gas executives who went to see him in April at Mar-a-Lago, for example, that, because he would allow unrestricted drilling, they should raise $1 billion for his campaign-a statement redolent of Sondland's \"quid pro quo\" that soon leaked to the Washington Post . The campaign's strategy, another longtime fund-raiser told me, was essentially to let Trump be Trump: \"He talks the same book to everybody.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nOliver, the former Bush finance director, observed that the difference between the model of the Bush campaigns and Trump's is the difference between having a large pool of \"institutional investors\" which had been built up in the course of years, and a series of ad-hoc \"transactional\" dealings with a relatively small group of the ultra-rich.\n\nSean Wilentz, a historian at Princeton University, offered another key distinction. Trump's billionaires-many of whom have made their fortunes as hedge-fund managers, activist investors, and corporate raiders-tend to be highly motivated ideologues and individual operators. \"It's transactional, but their end of the bargain is a lot different than just having access to the President of the United States,\" Wilentz told me. \"They see Trump as their instrument. This is an investment for them to take power.\" Wilentz noted that, unlike the \"traditional corporate conservative élite\" dating back to the Gilded Age, this new \"class of the super-rich\" appears both more numerous and less civic-minded. \"The other guys might have been robber barons,\" Wilentz said. \"These guys are oligarchs.\"\n\nIn July, after a would-be assassin's bullet grazed Trump's ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, another wave of giving came in to the Trump campaign. Musk officially endorsed him on X within an hour of the shooting. But the following week, Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Kamala Harris as his successor. Democrats, especially those who had been reluctant to support the eighty-one-year-old incumbent, began dumping record sums into the race: Harris brought in $200 million in her opening week as the Party's official candidate. In August, her first full month atop the ticket, Harris's network raised $361 million to Trump's $130 million. Her operation, the Times reported, was bigger than Trump's \"in nearly every discernible category.\"\n\nBut, even as Trump's momentum faded, most of the billionaires who had returned to his side were sticking with their choice. \"Do they have buyer's remorse? No,\" one veteran Republican fund-raiser told me in August. He allowed that \"there's concern about Trump being able to turn to a disciplined message,\" but, for this group, at least, Harris was never a conceivable option. \"They view her as even further left than Biden from a policy perspective,\" the veteran fund-raiser said. \"There wasn't an alternative to not be for Trump-the alternative would be for no one.\"\n\nAnother possibility was for major Republican donors to switch their emphasis to the Party's efforts to hold on to the House and win back the Senate. One Republican fund-raiser, a former Haley supporter, spoke to me from the sidelines of a summer retreat that House Speaker Mike Johnson held for big givers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where he found a number of donors more skeptical about the White House race. \"They're just saying they're going to sit out the Presidential for the time being and focus on the down ballot,\" he said. \"The races where, even if Harris wins, if we unleash gargantuan resources in that particular race, we can still win.\"\n\nAmong the donors who have reluctantly swung to Trump was the billionaire Thomas Peterffy, a Wall Street mogul and a six-figure donor to Trump in 2020, who had vowed to do \"whatever I can\" to make sure the G.O.P. had a different nominee in 2024. Federal campaign-finance records show that, through the summer, Peterffy donated some $7 million to G.O.P. politicians and Party organizations, but he had given nothing publicly to Trump. In August, he donated $844,660 to the Trump 47 joint fund-raising committee, which helps support the ex-President's campaign.\n\nTrump was still trying this summer to personally persuade a few remaining billionaire holdouts to get back on board. Two of his biggest targets were Kenneth Griffin, the C.E.O. of the hedge fund Citadel, and Paul Singer, the founder of the activist investment group Elliott Management-both former Haley backers who had yet to endorse him. In recent years, Griffin has been among the Republican Party's top benefactors; as of August, he had donated nearly $75 million to G.O.P. candidates and super PAC s. But he had publicly disavowed Trump after his Presidency; according to a friend of Griffin's, he has privately called the former President a \"three-time loser\" and an \"idiot.\" Earlier this year, he said that he would consider giving to Trump, depending on whom he chose as his running mate; according to the veteran fund-raiser, he was \"not a fan\" of Vance. Singer had similarly given tens of millions to Republican causes this year without formally backing Trump.\n\nIn July, Trump met with Griffin and, separately, with Singer. His lobbying effort was partially successful. On August 15th, Singer sent $5 million to MAGA Inc. Griffin, however, eventually announced that he would not be giving any money to the ex-President. \"I have not supported Donald Trump,\" he said this fall. \"I'm so torn on this one.\" He added, \"I know who I'm going to vote for, but it's not with a smile on my face.\" (Griffin told me that \"Americans enjoyed greater economic opportunity, and the world was a safer place, under President Trump's leadership,\" and that \"Senator Vance has matured quickly on the campaign trail.\")\n\nTrump's courting of billionaires has been an explicit part of the Democrats' campaign against him. At the Democratic National Convention, in August, Harris said that the ex-President's populist rhetoric did not match the reality of a man who \"fights for himself and his billionaire friends.\" But the talking points miss an uncomfortable fact for both parties: during the Trump era, it's the Democrats who have enjoyed a clear advantage with the nation's wealthiest political donors. According to OpenSecrets, big donors-those who gave $100,000 or more to just one party-contributed $5.2 billion to Democratic causes and candidates in the last election cycle, and $3.3 billion to Republican ones. Despite Trump's cultivation of the crypto bros and Wall Street money, his online chats with Musk and his Mar-a-Lago fund-raisers with Big Oil executives, that trend is on track to continue this year. A recent Bloomberg survey of billionaires showed Harris receiving support from twenty-one of the country's richest people, compared with fourteen who were backing Trump. The difference, though, is that Trump had taken in millions more from these supporters. His campaign is far more dependent on its shrinking segment of the ultra-rich.\n\nIn September, the day after the debate between Harris and Trump, I spoke again with the lobbyist Ed Rogers. \"You know, I'm a Trump voter, a Trump donor,\" he said, \"but I think Harris is going to win.\" Another Republican told me that, after Trump's poor debate performance, he had seen similar hand-wringing from other major donors: \"Can I stomach giving money to this guy and he keeps blowing it?\"\n\nIn at least one notable case, Harris managed to regain a major donor who had defected to Trump, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Ben Horowitz. Horowitz and his business partner, Marc Andreessen, who are both longtime Democratic givers, had stunned the tech world in July by endorsing the ex-President, citing, in part, Trump's newfound support for the crypto industry. But, in October, Horowitz announced that he and his wife planned to make a \"significant donation\" to Harris, saying that, though the Biden Administration had been \"exceptionally destructive on tech policy,\" he had spoken personally with Harris, a friend from California, and was \"hopeful\" that she would take a different approach. \"There was no real engagement by the Biden world with the business community,\" a Democratic donor who has spoken with the Vice-President told me. \"Harris has been very intentional about engaging. She's saying all the right things.\"\n\nHarris's success with the moneyed class infuriated Trump. \"All rich, job creating people, that support Comrade Kamala Harris,\" he wrote in a social-media post in September, \"you are STUPID.\" A couple of weeks later, he posted the false claim that Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan C.E.O., whom Trump had also mused about as a candidate for Treasury Secretary, had endorsed him. Not only was this untrue, as JPMorgan swiftly announced; it turned out that Dimon's wife had donated more than $200,000 to the Democratic ticket and attended a dinner this summer with Harris.\n\nAs if to rebut the doubters, Trump appeared in early October at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the scene of the first assassination attempt against him, alongside his wealthiest benefactor, Musk. Trump had outsourced much of his campaign's turnout operation-the traditional preserve of the political parties and the candidates-to Musk's America PAC . Musk, whom the Times called \"obsessive, almost manic\" in his backing of the ex-President, had all but relocated to Pennsylvania to oversee an effort to swing the crucial battleground state. In Butler, he leaped around the stage in a black MAGA hat, as the former President grinned with delight. If Trump does not win, Musk told the crowd, \"this will be the last election.\"\n\nA few days later, Harris's campaign made a stunning announcement: she had raised $1 billion in a matter of weeks, the largest sum ever collected for an American politician in such a short amount of time. Harris more than doubled Trump's contributions in September alone. Will it matter? During the past two decades, the winner of the Presidential election has always been the better funded of the two candidates-with the notable exception of Hillary Clinton, in 2016. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "What Is Happening to the Republicans?\n\nOne of the oldest imperatives of American electoral politics is to define your opponents before they can define themselves. So it was not surprising when, in the summer of 1963, Nelson Rockefeller, a centrist Republican governor from New York, launched a preëmptive attack against Barry Goldwater, a right-wing Arizona senator, as both men were preparing to run for the Presidential nomination of the Republican Party. But the nature of Rockefeller's attack was noteworthy. If the G.O.P. embraced Goldwater, an opponent of civil-rights legislation, Rockefeller suggested that it would be pursuing a \"program based on racism and sectionalism.\" Such a turn toward the elements that Rockefeller saw as \"fantastically short-sighted\" would be potentially destructive to a party that had held the White House for eight years, owing to the popularity of Dwight Eisenhower, but had been languishing in the minority in Congress for the better part of three decades. Some moderates in the Republican Party thought that Rockefeller was overstating the threat, but he was hardly alone in his concern. Richard Nixon, the former Vice-President, who had received substantial Black support in his 1960 Presidential bid, against John F. Kennedy, told a reporter for Ebony that \"if Goldwater wins his fight, our party would eventually become the first major all-white political party.\" The Chicago Defender, the premier Black newspaper of the era, concurred, stating bluntly that the G.O.P. was en route to becoming a \"white man's party.\"\n\nBut, for all the anxiety among Republican leaders, Goldwater prevailed, securing the nomination at the Party's convention, in San Francisco. In his speech to the delegates, he made no pretense of his ideological intent. \"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,\" he said. \"Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.\" (He delivered that famous line shortly after the delegates had defeated a platform plank on civil rights.) Goldwater's crusade failed in November of 1964, when the incumbent, Lyndon Johnson, who had become President a year earlier, after Kennedy's assassination, won in a landslide: four hundred and eighty-six to fifty-two votes in the Electoral College. Nevertheless, Goldwater's ascent was a harbinger of the future shape of the Republican Party. He represented an emerging nexus between white conservatives in the West and in the South, where five states voted for him over Johnson.\n\nThe reason for the shift was clear. Many white Southern Democrats felt betrayed by Johnson's support of civil rights. The civil-rights movement had learned how to translate grassroots activism into political power. Among government leaders, L.B.J. was singularly important to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and he stood firmly behind the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In both cases, he pressed on white Southern Democrats in Congress who had long supported the racist culture and strictures of Jim Crow. Until the mid-twentieth century, it was the Republican Party, founded a century earlier by Northerners enraged by the expansion of slavery-the \"party of Lincoln\"-that looked more favorably upon the rights of Black Americans. In 1957, it was a Republican President, Eisenhower, who deployed troops to intervene on behalf of Black students in the school-integration crisis in Little Rock. Goldwater's rise proved the catalyst for change. As the historian Ira Katznelson told me, Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act mainly for libertarian reasons: \"Nonetheless, it was a signal, and opened up possibilities for a major realignment.\"\n\nEstablishment leaders of the G.O.P. were concerned that Goldwater had opened up the Party, which had barely emerged from the shadow of McCarthyism, to fringe groups on the far right, such as the John Birch Society-people whom Nixon referred to as \"kooks.\" (Robert H. W. Welch, Jr., the founder of the society, claimed that the goal of the civil-rights movement was to create a \"Soviet Negro Republic.\") Marsha Barrett, a historian at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, who chronicles the evolving relationship between civil rights and the Republican Party in her forthcoming book, \"The Politics of Moderation: Nelson Rockefeller's Failed Fight to Save the Party of Lincoln,\" notes that, before Rockefeller issued his broadside, George W. Lee, a Black civil-rights activist, businessman, and lifelong Republican, wrote to Robert Taft, Jr., the Ohio Republican who ran for Congress in 1962. Failing a significant intervention, Lee said, \"the Republican Party will be taken over lock, stock, and barrel by the Ku Kluxers, the John Birchers and other extreme rightwing reactionaries.\"\n\nYet, once it became clear that Goldwater could win the nomination, shock at his extremism on a number of issues, including the potential use of nuclear weapons, began to morph into compliance. Taft's behavior was typical of the trend. Although his family had long been a mainstay of the Republican Party-his grandfather had been President; his father, a senator-he endorsed Goldwater. Barrett told me that Goldwater's rise was facilitated by the fact that \"some moderate Republicans were simply trying to protect their own political prospects.\"\n\nIn the contemporary Republican Party, the resonance is obvious. Mitch McConnell , the Party's leader in the Senate, has long played this game, despising Donald Trump but knuckling under to the reality of his immense popularity among Republican voters. At Trump's second impeachment trial, McConnell voted to acquit but, after the vote, delivered an excoriating speech about Trump's incitement of the January 6th riot at the U.S. Capitol and the effort that day to reverse the results of the 2020 election. Days later, when asked whether he would support Trump if he was nominated by the G.O.P. in 2024, McConnell responded, \"Absolutely.\"\n\nThe most widely debated political question of the moment is: What is happening to the Republicans? One answer is that the Party's predicament might fairly be called the revenge of \"the kooks.\" In just four years, the G.O.P., a powerful, hundred-and-sixty-seven-year-old institution, has become the party of Donald Trump. He began his 2016 campaign by issuing racist and misogynistic salvos, and during his Presidency he gave cover to white supremacists, reactionary militia groups, and QAnon followers. Trump's seizure of the Party's leadership seemed a stunning achievement at first, but with time it seems more reasonable to ponder how he could possibly have failed. There were many preëxisting conditions, and Trump took advantage of them. The combination of a base stoked by a sensationalist right-wing media and the emergence of kook-adjacent figures in the so-called Gingrich Revolution, of 1994, and the Tea Party, have redefined the Party's temper and its ideological boundaries. It is worth remembering that the first candidate to defeat Trump in a Republican primary in 2016 was Ted Cruz, who, by 2020, had long set aside his reservations about Trump, and was implicated in spurring the mob that attacked the Capitol.\n\nOne of the most telling developments of the 2020 contest was rarely discussed: in August, the Republican National Convention convened without presenting a new Party platform. The Convention was centered almost solely on Trump; the events, all of which took place at the White House, validated an increasing suspicion that Trump himself was the Republican platform. Practically speaking, the refusal to articulate concrete positions spared the Party the embarrassment of watching the President contradict them. In 2016, religious conservatives succeeded in getting an anti-pornography plank into the platform, only to be confronted by news of Trump's extramarital affair with the adult-film performer Stormy Daniels. Now there would be no distinction between the Republican Party and the mendacity, bigotry, belligerence, misogyny, and narcissism of its singular representative.\n\nOr consider the events of the past six months alone: during a Presidential debate, a sitting Commander-in-Chief gave a knowing shout-out to the Proud Boys, a far-right hate group; he also refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, and subsequently attempted to strong-arm the Georgia secretary of state into falsifying election returns; he and other Republican officials filed more than sixty lawsuits in an effort to overturn the results of the election; he incited the insurrectionists who overran the Capitol and demanded the lynching of, among others, the Republican Vice-President; and he was impeached, for the second time, then acquitted by Senate Republicans fearful of a base that remains in his thrall. The fact that behavior is commonplace does not mean it should be mistaken for behavior that is normal.\n\nLink copied\n\nBut the character of the current Republican Party can hardly be attributed to Trump alone. A hundred and thirty-nine House Republicans and eight senators voted against certifying some of the Electoral College votes, even after being forced to vacate their chambers just hours earlier, on January 6th. A week later, a hundred and ninety-seven House Republicans voted against Trump's impeachment, despite his having used one branch of government to foment violence against another. Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, the most senior of the ten Republicans who voted to impeach, survived an effort to remove her from her post as chair of the House Republican Conference but was censured by her state's party organization. In the House, more Republicans voted against Cheney than voted to remove Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, the extremist Trump stalwart and QAnon promoter, from her committee posts. She lost those assignments, but only because the Democrats voted her out. Then, on February 13th, all but seven Republican senators voted to acquit Trump in his impeachment trial.\n\nThe Trump-era Republican Party does occupy a very different niche from the Party of 1964. When Trump was sworn into office, the G.O.P. held both houses of Congress. In 2018, the Democrats won back the House; the Senate is now a fifty-fifty split. But the Party still controls thirty state legislatures and twenty-seven governorships. In November, Trump, facing multiple, overlapping crises, all of them exacerbated by his ineptitude, won seventy-four million votes. Still, the Republican Party confronts a potentially existential crisis. Last year, Thomas Patterson, a political scientist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, argued in his book \" Is the Republican Party Destroying Itself? \" that, over time, the Party has set a series of \"traps\" for itself that have eroded its \"ability to govern and acquire new sources of support.\" The modern Republican Party was built upon the Southern beachhead that Goldwater established more than half a century ago. Johnson rightly worried that his embrace of civil rights would lose the South for the Democrats for at least a generation. In 1968, Richard Nixon won the Presidency, employing the Southern Strategy-an appeal to whites' racial grievances. By 1980, the G.O.P. had become thoroughly dependent on the white South. In 2018, some seventy per cent of \"safe\" or \"likely Republican\" districts were in Southern states. Prior to last year's election, Southerners composed forty-eight per cent of House Republicans and seventy-one per cent of the Party's ranking committee members. The South remains the nation's most racially polarized region and also the most religious-two dynamics that factor largely both in the Party's political culture and in its current problems. \"The South,\" Patterson writes, \"is a key reason why the GOP's future is at risk.\"\n\nIn addition, the G.O.P.'s steady drift toward the right, from conservative to reactionary politics; its dependence on older, white voters; its reliance on right-wing media; its support for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans; and its increasing disdain for democratic institutions and norms all portend increasing division and a diminishing pool of voters. Republicans, Patterson says, have been depending on a \"rear-guard strategy\" to \"resist the ticking clock of a changing America.\" Time may be running out for the Party, as its base ages and dwindles. \"Its loyal voters are declining in number and yet have locked the party in place,\" Patterson writes. \"It cannot reinvent itself without risking their support and, in any event, it can't reinvent itself in a convincing enough way for a quick turnaround. Republicans have traded the party's future for yesterday's America.\"\n\nThe marginalization of moderate Republicans has accelerated in the past decade, since the advent of the Tea Party. Moderates in Congress recognized that, if they hewed to a centrist position, they would face serious primary challenges. In 2010, conservatives revolted against the Obama Administration's bailout of the banks during the housing crisis. In theory, that uprising could have spawned a cross-partisan populist alliance of the anti-corporate left and fiscal conservatives, but it was quickly subsumed by paranoid, racist currents. The same year, as debates over the Affordable Care Act came to dominate American politics, Tea Party gatherings began to resemble proto-Trump rallies, at which the first Black President was sometimes lampooned as a monkey. That blend of populist rage and overt racism was the active ingredient in what eventually became the Trump movement. In the 2014 Republican primary in Virginia, when David Brat, with the support of state Tea Party activists, defeated Eric Cantor, the House Majority Leader, the G.O.P. took note that even the most powerful conservatives faced a threat from far-right upstarts.\n\nSome of the few remaining Republican centrists, such as Jeff Flake, of Arizona, Rob Portman, of Ohio, and Pat Toomey, of Pennsylvania, are leaving politics entirely. Last month, Reuters reported that dozens of Republicans who had served in government during the George W. Bush era were abandoning the Party. Jimmy Gurulé, who was Under-Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said that the Republican Party he knew \"no longer exists,\" that what exists in its place is simply \"the cult of Trump.\" Trump's centrality has so far survived his loss to Joe Biden and the spectacle of the Capitol riot. In states across the country, local Republican officials are working against leaders whom they deem disloyal to the former President. The Arizona Party even censured Cindy McCain, the widow of the state's six-term senator. The result is that the Party leadership sees no popular incentive to move toward the center, even as the warning signs of decline accumulate. Last year, for the first time, the number of registered Independents exceeded the number of registered Republicans. In the eight Presidential contests since 1988, Republicans have won the popular vote only once, in 2004.\n\nThe emergence of Trumpism as the Republican brand has also borne out the warning that the G.O.P. would become a white man's party. In a now famous autopsy of Mitt Romney's loss to Barack Obama, in 2012, analysts for the Republican National Committee argued that the Party had to expand its appeal to people of color if it hoped to be competitive in future national elections. \"Nothing happened,\" Patterson told me, speaking of the G.O.P.'s response to the report. \"Right-wing media said, 'You're going to ruin America if we take the advice of the Republican National Committee.' \" Today, the Republican electorate is whiter and more male by far than its Democratic counterpart. By 2020, eighty-one per cent of Republican voters were white, and fifty per cent were male.\n\nLast November, Trump made gains among some minorities, over 2016, particularly Latinos, although minority groups remain overwhelmingly supportive of the Democratic Party. The gender gap between voters for Biden and those for Trump was the most pronounced in recent history: fifty-seven per cent of women voted for Biden; forty-two per cent voted for Trump. The G.O.P. has also gained increasing shares of decreasing constituencies. White conservative Christians remain prominent in the Party, but they are a dwindling segment of the electorate: in 2007, thirty-nine states had white Christian majorities; today, fewer than half do. In 1996, non-Hispanic whites made up nearly eighty-five per cent of the electorate; by 2018, they were just sixty-seven per cent. In the six Presidential elections since 2000, Democrats have lost the white vote every time, but prevailed in half of them even without it. The day before the 2020 election, Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a longtime Republican election lawyer, who represented the George W. Bush campaign in 2000 and 2004, published an op-ed in the Washington Post , warning that the Party could find itself a \"permanent minority.\"\n\nThe fraught discussions over the G.O.P.'s future are really debates about whether the current Party is capable of adapting to modern circumstances again-or whether it will turn into a more malign version of itself, one even more dependent on white status anxieties. As Heather Cox Richardson, a historian at Boston College and the author of \" To Make Men Free ,\" a history of the Republican Party, told me, \"When you see the collapse of parties it is usually because you have some problem of the existing party system coming up against a major new change.\"\n\nThe Republican Party itself was built on the ruins of the Whigs, a party that broke apart in the tempests leading up to the Civil War. Marsha Barrett mentioned a passage to me from Herbert Hoover's address to the 1936 Republican Convention, four years after he had lost the White House to Franklin Roosevelt, in which he issued a warning about what becomes of parties that fail to navigate the critical issues and circumstances of their time. \"The Whig Party,\" Hoover said, \"temporized, compromised upon the issue of slavery for the Black man. That party disappeared. It deserved to disappear.\" Hoover was speaking in the midst of the Great Depression, but his larger point was that parties are not necessarily permanent political fixtures. Considering that history, it's worth asking whether the party of Lincoln, now the party of Trump, is engaged in conflicts so intense that it will go the way of the Whigs.\n\nThe G.O.P.'s travails echo a historical pattern. Despite the United States' reputation as the most stable democracy in the world, most of the political parties born in this country, including major ones, have ceased to exist. The list of those that have collapsed includes, in addition to the Whigs, the Federalists, the Democratic-Republicans, the American Party (also called the Know-Nothings), the Free-Soil Party, the Populist Party, the National Republicans, the Anti-Masonic Party, and three iterations of the Progressive Party. (The Socialist and the Communist Parties also briefly commanded public attention.) What we refer to as the two-party system has collapsed twice before. The Democratic and the Republican Parties have endured as long as they have because they have significantly altered their identities to remain viable; in a sense, each has come to represent what it once reviled.\n\nAmerica's political parties and the party system are, in fact, accidents of history. The Founders were suspicious of \"factions,\" as parties were then called, fearing that powerful blocs would put their own regional or commercial interests above the common good, and endanger the fragile union of the new nation. But, as Richard Hofstadter wrote, in his 1969 book, \" The Idea of a Party System ,\" the Founders' \"primary paradox\" was that they \"did not believe in parties as such, scorned those that they were conscious of as historical models, had a keen terror of party spirit and its evil consequences, and yet, almost as soon as their national government was in operation, found it necessary to establish parties.\"\n\nGeorge Washington reluctantly ran for the Presidency in 1788. He remains the only Independent elected to that office. His farewell address, of September 19, 1796, provides the framework for the peaceful transfer of power. (It is read aloud in the Senate every year; this year, that event occurred a week after Trump's impeachment trial had concluded there.) In the address, Washington, like a father chiding his bickering children, advised his countrymen, no matter what their political passions, to consider the fundamental bonds that connected them as Americans. Political parties were useful to check the worst instincts of a monarch, he wrote, but, in a democracy, a party\n\nagitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions.\n\nNevertheless, that fall the nation held its first partisan election. Divisions evident in Washington's Administration had solidified into formal categories: the Federalists, who supported a strong central government and favorable relations with Great Britain, coalesced around John Adams and Alexander Hamilton. The Democratic-Republicans adopted Thomas Jefferson's arguments for a decentralized government and a national alliance with France. Adams beat Jefferson in the race to succeed Washington, but, as a result of a quirk in the Electoral College at the time, Jefferson became Vice-President. Not only had parties come into existence; even James Madison, who had charted their dangers in Federalist No. 10, had joined one-Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans. Each side rationalized its existence by pointing to the excesses of the opposition. After Jefferson won the White House in 1800, the Federalists opposed his signature act, the Louisiana Purchase, of 1803. When Madison succeeded him, they opposed the War of 1812. But both events stoked popular support across the country, which was expanding rapidly, and the élitist-oriented Federalists, nestled largely in the Northeast, soon ceased to be contenders in national politics.\n\nThe first two-party system was over, but the victor, despite having essentially unchecked one-party rule, didn't survive for long. In the 1824 election, Senator Andrew Jackson, Democratic-Republican of Tennessee, and a hero of the War of 1812, won the popular vote, but no candidate achieved a majority in the Electoral College. Two of the runners-up, John Quincy Adams, the son of the first Federalist President, and Henry Clay, the Speaker of the House, formed an alliance that handed the Presidency to Adams and made Clay the Secretary of State. In the uproar that ensued, the Party split, with each side laying claim to a portion of its name: the smaller faction, led by Adams, became the short-lived National Republicans; the larger, led by Jackson, became the Democratic Party.\n\nCrucially, Jackson's populist allure, along with his pioneering campaigning practices, such as hosting barbecues and cultivating a national network of affiliates, meant that people did not simply vote Democratic; they began to identify as Democrats. Parties were becoming a fixture not just in America's politics but also in its social life. In 1828, Jackson defeated Adams in a landslide, and, four years later, was easily reëlected. He was succeeded by his Vice-President and former governor of New York, Martin Van Buren, a wily political operator with consequential ideas about national affairs. Having witnessed single-party rule and the collapse of the Democratic-Republicans, he essentially turned Washington's warning on its head: a contest between parties, rather than jeopardizing democracy, could be the key to its survival, he maintained, precisely because there were so many potential economic and geographic dividing lines in the nation.\n\nA viable second party was already in place. Henry Clay had been building a broad and loosely affiliated coalition of Jackson's opponents; they came to be known as the Whigs, and by 1836 they were in control of the main Senate committees. (Two Whigs were elected to the White House: William Henry Harrison, in 1840, and Zachary Taylor, in 1848.) As the historian Eric Foner wrote in \" Politics and Ideology in the Age of the Civil War ,\" \"Van Buren and many of his generation of politicians had been genuinely frightened by the threats of disunion\" in earlier years. \"They saw national two-party competition as the alternative to sectional conflict and eventual disunion.\"\n\nYet, to a remarkable degree, the history of political partisanship and the trajectory of American parties has been bound up with the history of race in this country. Just as the two major parties of the mid-twentieth century recognized the polarizing effect that civil-rights legislation would have, the Democrats and the Whigs sought to prevent slavery from becoming the axis of national politics. Both parties were internally divided on the issue, and were largely successful in keeping it at the margins of national discourse. But, in 1854, Senator Stephen Douglas, Democrat of Illinois, in an effort to build a cross-regional alliance that he hoped would help him win the Presidency, introduced the catastrophically divisive Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed new states to decide for themselves whether they would permit or prohibit slavery. Douglas's act posed a defining dilemma to the parties, much as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 did a century later. The Democratic Party aligned firmly around its pro-slavery wing. The Whigs could neither finesse the issue nor establish a unified opposition to it, and the Party dissolved. The second two-party system had ended, with stark implications for the nation, and civil war on the horizon.\n\nLink copied\n\nAbraham Lincoln, who had returned to legal practice after serving in the House, as a Whig, was so incensed by the Kansas-Nebraska Act that he decided to reënter politics. The party he joined got its start at a meeting in a schoolhouse in Ripon, Wisconsin, attended by a small group of disaffected Whigs, alienated Democrats, and Free-Soilers, all of whom were furious about the act. The new Republican Party immediately possessed an asset that its predecessor lacked: clarity on the fundamental political and moral issue of the day, the expansion of slavery.\n\nThe Federalists collapsed because they failed to expand their demographic appeal; the Whigs because of internal incoherence over what they stood for in the nation's most crucial debate. Among the more striking dynamics of the Trump-era G.O.P. is the extent to which it is afflicted by both of these failings.\n\nThe arc of political movements in this country has never been predictable. The Democratic Party, confronted with a changing nation, chose to adapt, evolving, over time, from a bastion of pro-slavery sentiment in the nineteenth century, and of volatile racism for the first half of the twentieth, to its current status as a multiracial coalition emphasizing civil, women's, and immigrants' rights. That transformation mirrors the narrative that the country likes to tell about the growth of American democracy. The Republican Party, which had a firmer grasp on that ideal at its outset, rose from a passionate opposition to the spread of slavery to become a redoubt of Confederate sympathizers and racial reactionaries, and home to the twice-impeached former President who cultivated them. Jennifer Horn, the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party, told me that the G.O.P., in its current incarnation, is \"the most open embrace of an anti-democracy movement that we have seen in our country in a very long time.\"\n\nHorn quit the Party in December and, until recently, worked with the Lincoln Project , a group of Republicans dedicated to preventing Trump's reëlection. She added, \"This Republican Party cannot win a national election. Everybody will say, 'But look, Trump brought more people out than they did before.' Yes, but the opposition brought out even more people.\" The Republican Party appears to have decided in the wake of Trump's defeat that, particularly at the state level, it will pursue tactics, such as gerrymandering and voter suppression, that will enable it to wield power even from a minority position. Since the Civil War, Van Buren's ideas about the stabilizing effects of partisan competition have held sway in American politics. But it is increasingly reasonable to revisit Washington's perspective that, under the right circumstances, a party could become antagonistic to the health of democracy.\n\nIn the past decade, gerrymandering has taken on renewed prominence, especially as software has become more sophisticated and analytical tools make it easier to predict how individual households will vote. The Brennan Center for Justice reported that the redistricting put into effect after the 2010 census provided the G.O.P. with at least sixteen additional seats in the House of Representatives. In 2013, the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder eviscerated a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and allowed changes to voting laws which, in the name of preventing voter fraud-something that has repeatedly been proved to be a nonexistent problem-made voting more difficult, particularly for minorities. Those laws were overwhelmingly passed in state legislatures controlled by Republicans. (The Brennan Center is tracking more than two hundred and fifty bills, pending in forty-three states, that would restrict voting.) Last Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on an Arizona law that effectively restricts voting access for people of color, in a case that could undermine remaining protections of the Voting Rights Act; the conservative Justices appeared ready to uphold the restrictions.\n\nMichael Steele, the first Black chair of the Republican National Committee, told me that these efforts are a losing strategy. We spoke in mid-January, when the images of the Capitol insurrection were still fresh. Early in our conversation, he pointed to the decades when the Democrats controlled Congress in the middle of the twentieth century as a product of the G.O.P.'s operating as a regional party, based in the Northeast, rather than as a national one. Making inroads in the Southern states was key to the Party's growing influence, but the modern Party, Steele told me, \"is not really prepared for the ways that the country is changing\"-including, again, in the South. \"Virginia was a blood-red state,\" he said. \"It was actually sort of the model of Republican strength and political power, by virtue of how the Republicans controlled the state. But what happened? By 2006, that was done. And you could see the trend line heading down 95 into North Carolina, Georgia, bringing it over into the rest of the South.\" Referring to the defeat of Trump, followed, in January, by that of the senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, Steele said that the Republicans \"lost Georgia not once but three times.\"\n\nSteele's assessment is akin to conclusions that Rockefeller and other moderates drew in the past century. Between 1940 and 1970, about five million African-Americans left the South for industrial centers in Northern and Midwestern states, which were largely Democratic strongholds. The influx changed the political calculus. Black voters had begun abandoning the Republican Party during Franklin Roosevelt's first term; now their increasing numbers in those cities meant that their concerns would carry more weight with Democrats at the state and municipal levels. \"Politically, the Democrats repositioned themselves,\" Steele said. That process happened in fits and starts, but the Democrats' over-all shift toward greater reliance on Black voters and more attention to their concerns opened a breach with the Party's powerful Southern wing, which Goldwater filled.\n\nConversely, Republicans have moved further away from emerging groups in the electorate, resurrecting political tactics that are reminiscent of the segregation-era South. \"If your base is ninety per cent white, and you're losing Asian-Americans by two to one, the Black vote by nine to one, and the Hispanics by two to one,\" Thomas Patterson told me, \"voter suppression becomes the only viable strategic option.\" Just since the Senate and Presidential losses in Georgia, the Republican-controlled state legislature has introduced twenty-two proposed laws that would make voting more difficult in that state; the most restrictive would limit absentee voting and early voting on weekends. (Last Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed HR1, a huge reform package that would expand voting rights; no Republicans voted for it.)\n\nAmid the storm of canards about the Presidential vote tally last year, an easily discernible pattern emerged: the Trump Administration contested the results in Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Atlanta-all of them cities with significant Black populations in states that he lost. The Party, Horn told me, has to admit that \"we did a terrible thing. We tried to disenfranchise American voters. We targeted minority voters in Georgia and Michigan and Pennsylvania, trying to overturn democracy in America.\" Yet a reckoning seems nowhere in the G.O.P.'s near future. The Party offered Donald Trump as its platform, and there's no indication that this state of affairs has changed since he reluctantly moved out of the White House.\n\nTwo weeks ago, attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference convened in Orlando, to rally the right wing of the Republican Party. When Trump took the stage, on the last day, he was received in a manner typically reserved for politicians who have won an election. Matt Schlapp, the conference organizer, referred to Trump as \"the President of the United States.\" Trump cycled through the now familiar grievances about cancel culture and bad trade deals and, unsurprisingly, flogged the false tale that his fortunes are the result of election fraud-all to rounds of raucous applause. According to a recent study conducted by the American Enterprise Institute, nearly eighty per cent of Republicans hold favorable views of Trump, and two-thirds of them believe that there was widespread voter fraud in November, despite clear evidence to the contrary. CPAC featured sessions that included \"Protecting Elections: Part 2: Other Culprits: How Judges & Media Refused to Look at the Evidence,\" and \"Fraudulent 2020 Elections in South Korea and the United States.\"\n\nThe idea that the nation would thrive with two parties was contingent upon both of them holding a shared version of reality. It's also the case that a demographic clearly in the thrall of radicalizing conspiracy theories, and convinced that it stands no chance of exercising its will through electoral politics, will potentially turn to violence as a regular form of expression. The A.E.I. study found that fifty-six per cent of Republicans believe that the use of force may be necessary to save \"the traditional American way of life.\" The obvious concern should be that January 6th was not a culmination but, rather, a preface to more violence conducted under the same banners.\n\nAt CPAC , Trump shot down the idea that he would form a separate MAGA party, making it clear that the G.O.P. will be cast in his likeness for the foreseeable future. \"We have the Republican Party,\" he told the crowd. There's also the question of Trumpism's having intergenerational potential. Observers are wondering what Ivanka Trump's future looks like, and whether Lara Trump, the former President's daughter-in-law, will run for the seat of Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, when he leaves office, in 2022. (Burr voted to convict Trump in the second impeachment trial.) Jennifer Horn told me, \"I maintained this hope that, if we could just beat Donald Trump, then others in the Party would see that as their opportunity to come forward and say, 'O.K., let's put that behind us.' \" She did not anticipate the durability of Trump's version of Republicanism even after his defeat. \"The Party,\" she told me, said, \" 'You may have defeated Trump, but we're all in for Trumpism. Full steam ahead.' \" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Why Republican Insiders Think the G.O.P. Is Poised for a Blowout\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, I spoke with a leading Republican political consultant about the Senate campaign in Georgia. That race is strategically significant for both parties, but it has a special symbolic importance for Democrats. The incumbent, Raphael Warnock , who for many years has occupied Martin Luther King, Jr.,'s pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church, in Atlanta, is seen as a potential national leader of the Democratic Party-and he may still lose to a scandal-ridden ex-football star, the Republican Herschel Walker . The Republican consultant told me that Warnock's prospects were even bleaker than many recent public polls suggest. \"There isn't a single private poll in America that has Herschel Walker anything but ahead,\" the Republican consultant told me. \"Not one.\"\n\nDispatches and analysis by New Yorker writers across the country .\n\nThe consensus among a number of G.O.P. pollsters and operatives I spoke to this week is that in the Senate races that are thought to be competitive, Republican candidates are heading for a clean sweep: Mehmet Oz will beat John Fetterman in Pennsylvania, and not just by a point or two; Adam Laxalt looks pretty certain to defeat the incumbent Democratic senator Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada; even less regarded candidates such as Blake Masters in Arizona will be carried into office by a predicted wave. \"He won't deserve it, but I think at this point he falls into a Senate seat,\" one Republican strategist told me. To these Republican insiders, certain high-profile races in which G.O.P. candidates were already favored now look like potential blowouts- Kari Lake 's campaign for governor in Arizona, J. D. Vance 's for Senate in Ohio. And some races that seemed out of reach, such as the Senate campaign, in New Hampshire, of the election denier Don Bolduc , now look like possible wins. The word that kept coming up in these conversations was \"bloodbath.\"\n\nMy interest in talking with Republican consultants and pollsters, those with their hands in many races around the country, was not only to collect predictions but to hear the G.O.P.'s story of the election. (I let them speak anonymously, and spoke with some of their Democratic peers, too, in order to provide a check on their accounts.) I wanted to know what they thought earlier polls had missed, and how a race that had seemed like a tossup for much of the year could turn into a Republican rout.\n\nOne thing was obvious in these conversations: many of these professionals had spent much of the summer working to manage the abortion issue, which became the election's chaotic element after the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade, in June. It supplied a burst of Democratic support and fury, but also changed polling in interesting ways. \"What happened post-Dobbs was that progressives started picking up the phone at nineteen-nineties rates,\" the Republican strategist told me. \"Answering a political poll itself became a kind of expression of political identity.\"\n\nThis Republican said that he and a colleague had examined polls in which they had access to individual voter data and concluded that as much as sixty per cent of Democratic poll respondents this summer were so-called super voters, those who vote in every single election, even though such voters normally compose about a third of the general electorate in each party. (He found no such effect among Republicans.) \"This created an informational doom loop, where Democratic candidates get told, You should talk about January 6th, democracy being on the ballot, trans rights,' \" he said, \"because their primary super voters are picking up the phone and telling them this is what they care about.\"\n\nStill, crafting a winning response to the abortion issue was a fixation among Republicans. A pollster working in many races across the country said, \"I had candidates who wanted to know the same thing, week after week, 'How do we answer this abortion thing? They're beating me up on it.' \" The pollster went on, \"And what they figured out is, we don't have a good answer. It is what it is.\"\n\nIn the end, Republicans didn't find a way through the political fact that many of the voters they wanted to win were against them on abortion so much as wait it out. As a Democratic strategist pointed out to me, a flood of funding after the Supreme Court decision allowed Democratic campaigns to put ads on television \"much, much earlier\" in swing states. This created a unique situation, he went on, in which Democrats were disproportionately tuned in to politics, the Democratic base was overrepresented in polls, and swing voters were overwhelmingly seeing Democratic ads. \"I think that's what creates that blue mirage during the summer,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, the polls were likely underrepresenting certain segments of the electorate. In recent years, more educated voters, especially white women, have moved to the Democrats, and less educated ones, of all races and especially men, toward the Republicans. When it comes to polling, these shifts have created an imbalance, in which one of the most visible groups in politics, and one especially energized by the Dobbs decision, had shifted toward Democrats, and one of the least visible had shifted toward Republicans. \"The fastest-moving portion of the electorate is Hispanic men, and the second-fastest-moving portion of the electorate is Black men,\" the Republican consultant told me. You want to get them on the phone? \"Good fucking luck.\"\n\nA Democratic pollster told me, \"Arizona is, I think, like ground zero for that trend. I think you're [also] seeing a lot of Hispanic drift toward Laxalt.\" This Democrat also noted that Stacey Abrams , the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Georgia, is underperforming among Black men, and thought that Abrams's opponent, Republican Governor Brian Kemp , \"is going to do a decent job winning Black voters compared to his 2018 performance.\"\n\nIf Republicans couldn't wait to get away from the major social issues, the Democrats continued to focus on them. Speaking about the defection of Hispanics to the G.O.P. in Nevada, the Republican strategist told me, \"The reason that Democrats have fucked this up is that they won't stop talking about abortion. And the reason that they screwed it up with Blacks is they won't stop talking about abortion. . . . It's like they're a two-issue party. It's this and Trump. They can't stop. I don't think they have anything else.\"\n\nThe evolving Democratic coalition has made the party at once more prosperous and more progressive, a trick that long seemed difficult to pull off. But it has also exposed the party to certain vulnerabilities, especially among working-class voters. Across the country, Republicans have tended to emphasize a simple story about inflation-that the White House had been inattentive to its rise and its impact on ordinary Americans. As the Republican strategist put it to me, \"Inflation is the big federal story, and a lot of blame belongs on the White House, because the White House just wished this would go away instead of saying, 'We know it's real, we know it's a problem, it's happening everywhere, we're going to do everything to fix it but we can't fix it immediately.' \"\n\nIn certain politically competitive parts of the country, especially the booming Sun Belt states of Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and Texas, Republican governors could also make some policy gestures to back up the way they spoke about inflation. In July, Kemp, the governor of Georgia, extended a statewide gas-tax holiday. In August, he committed to spend two billion dollars in state-budget surplus on property-tax and income-tax rebates if reëlected. The next week, he said that $1.2 billion in federal COVID aid would be converted to three-hundred-and-fifty-dollar checks for low-income Georgians. In the closing statement of his final debate against Abrams, Kemp celebrated what he called the lowest unemployment rate and the most people ever working in the history of Georgia.\n\nThe gubernatorial campaigns of Ron DeSantis , in Florida, Greg Abbott , in Texas, and Kari Lake, in Arizona, have similarly emphasized this contrast-between the sunny G.O.P.-managed economy at home and the darkening, inflation-related clouds emanating from Joe Biden's Washington. If voters felt economically stressed, Kemp said during his final debate, \"the problem is, [wages are] not going up fast enough to keep up with Joe Biden's inflation.\"\n\nIt probably isn't an accident that the next generation of MAGA stars has come from growing Southern states. As the Democratic pollster put it to me ruefully, \"Being a governor of a Sun Belt state is awesome, because your economy is growing so fast, because you don't have to raise taxes, and tax revenue just goes up, and then you get to do popular economic stuff.\"\n\nRepublicans also moved to capitalize on the flailing economy with declarations-at campaign stops, in television ads, on right-wing media-that the country was descending into chaos. As the Democratic consultant Stanley Greenberg wrote this week, Democratic candidates \"faced a barrage of ads on crime starting in September and early October, a barrage aided by Fox News dramatically increasing its crime reporting.\" This offensive seems to have worked: when Greenberg asked voters what they most feared about Democratic control of Congress, their top pick was \"crime and homelessness out of control in cities and police coming under attack,\" which ran thirteen points ahead of concerns about illegal immigration.\n\nEven if Democrats had wanted to make their own pivot to economic issues, their window to do so, by the early fall, was closing. The inflation index in September was much worse than it had been during the preceding months, and quite quickly it was difficult for Democrats to find much to brag about economically. By October, the basic daily experience of the race, for the Republican consultants I spoke with, had changed. \"Post-Dobbs, Republicans stopped taking polls,\" a Republican pollster told me. \"In October, my sampling guys came back and told me, 'Republicans are taking polls again. Response rates are through the roof.' \"\n\nBy then, according to the insiders, Democrats were too trapped in issues-abortion and the threat to democracy-that appealed to their most devoted and best-educated supporters, and had not done enough to reassure voters that they were addressing material concerns. The Republican pollster, who has been regularly surveying Pennsylvania, told me that, when it came to the Democratic focus on abortion, \"there just doesn't seem to be any specificity. You'd want to do it with high-education, high-income supporters. It's, like, no, they're running on abortion constantly in, like, Scranton.\"\n\nBack in the summer, I'd spoken with the Republican strategist, who then predicted that the Dobbs wave would be ephemeral. \"The Republican base is asking for very, very little,\" he told me this week. \"For all the stories we have about, like, the election deniers, from March of last year until now, their demands have basically been, like, 'Please do something about the economy, please do something about immigration, please don't let dudes participate in girls sports, and please do something about crime.' \" When it came to independents, he went on, \"It's, like, 'Please do something about inflation, please do something about crime, we're pretty much with you on the girls-sports thing, just don't be a dick about it.' \"\n\nHe sounded a little gleeful. \"It's almost like we've fallen ass-backwards into the Contract with America,\" he said, referring to the 1994 conservative agenda that fuelled the Republican takeover of Congress that year and elevated Newt Gingrich to House Speaker. \"Certainly not because of any cunning or wit or foresight on our part. Let me assure you, it has not been because of the searing intellect of Republican leadership.\"\n\nDemocrats were eager this week to point out how many seats the party in control of the White House typically loses in a midterm election-Barack Obama, the greatest politician the Party has produced in a generation, lost sixty-three seats in the House of Representatives in his first midterm. But many of the Republicans I spoke with saw this year as distinct. The pollster in Pennsylvania said that in 2010, \"Obama got punished for overreach. That's not this. This is incompetence.\" When I asked the Republican consultant what the voters coming home to the G.O.P. in October wanted, he said, \"Stop Biden. That's it.\"\n\nSome elections are not complicated at all. As these Republican strategists saw it, their candidates did not get past unpopular positions on abortion with a tactical masterstroke, they simply absorbed the electoral hit and moved on. The economy is not good, and the President is both a Democrat and unpopular. If you looked only at those factors you might expect a result not unlike the Republican wave that these G.O.P. insiders have predicted. Maybe the race was simple enough that it could be sketched on a napkin.\n\n\"I can show you the trajectory of all our races,\" the Republican pollster told me. \"We took a benchmark in July-O.K., this is going to be harder than we thought.

      "text": "The Real Republican Radicals\n\nThere have been two major political developments in the final, post-election act of the Trump Presidency -each interesting on its own, but confusing when taken together. First, Trump's hold over elected Republicans has seemed only to strengthen after his loss, amid his baseless claims of a rigged election. When the attorney general of Texas announced an almost fact-free lawsuit trying to reverse the election results in four swing states, a hundred and twenty-six Republican members of Congress signed a statement supporting it. The list included some known Trump dead-enders but also plenty of mainstream Republicans: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, New York's Representative Elise Stefanik, Missouri's Representative Ann Wagner. This week, Senator Josh Hawley, of Missouri, a rising star in the Republican Party, announced that he will formally challenge the certification of the election. Trump's hold over his party was supposed to rest on his ability to win, but he lost, and not much has changed. More than a month after the election, the Republican Party of Arizona tweeted an image of Donald Trump standing over a body of water, in which he was reflected as a lion. The caption read \"Lionhearted.\"\n\nThe second development is the more surprising one: the conservative grass roots, long understood to be the source of Trump's political strength, have been less forceful in their defense of the idea that the election was stolen than the Party's elected leaders. For all the fears that preceded Election Day, there has been no widespread political violence, and rallies convened to protest the election results have drawn a far cry from the \"MILLION\" marchers that Trump's press secretary claimed. During the past two months, the defense of the President has been defined by the comic-pathetic scene of Rudy Giuliani denouncing the election results to a handful of supporters and press at Four Seasons Total Landscaping, in Philadelphia. The Trump movement was long understood to represent a populist era of politics-a toppling of the élites. But now we are at the end of the Trump Administration, with the President insisting that democracy itself is under siege, and the people at the barricades are politicians and their lawyers.\n\nIn an effort to make sense of all this, I put in a call to the former Arizona senator Jeff Flake , one of the Republican insiders Trump effectively ejected from power. Flake, a libertarian conservative, was a forceful critic of Trump's during the 2016 campaign, and called for Trump to withdraw from the Presidential race after the disclosure of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that October. The President made the senator from Arizona a political target, on and off Twitter, and Flake's approval ratings among Republicans in his home state plummeted. (This, even as Flake voted with Trump's positions eighty-one per cent of the time). In October, 2017, Flake announced that he would not run for reëlection, saying that winning the nomination \"would require me to believe in positions I don't hold on such issues as trade and immigration, and it would require me to condone behavior that I cannot condone.\" Of the mood that had gripped the Republican Party, he said, \"This spell will pass, but not by next year.\"\n\nFlake lives in Mesa, Arizona, where he voted for Joe Biden last month. His wife of thirty-five years, Cheryl, keeps his schedule. He still has his oaky, patient senatorial voice but none of the old senatorial pomp. Flake spoke about the conservative base the way Western reporters speak about Kim Jong Un-as a force that is sublime in its power and childish in nearly every other dimension. In Flake's view, the Republican Party had resisted its weakest, most irrational element for years, and then finally acceded to it. \"Take Arizona as a microcosm,\" Flake said. \"For years, John McCain, principally, and [the former U.S. senator] Jon Kyl, and myself spent a lot of money from our campaigns and whatnot trying to keep that infrastructure sane. And, with McCain gone, and Kyl out, me gone, there is no effort at all in Arizona. You try to convince your neighbor who is a rational Republican to attend a district meeting or become a precinct committeeman, and then they attend, and all it is is conspiracy theories, and birtherism for years. The Party has simply been ceded to that element.\" At least partly out of exhaustion. The Party's radicalization, especially on immigration, had meant that \"the business community has stopped giving to the state Republican Party, by and large,\" which made the state Party even more dependent upon the national Party, which meant that its ranks filled even more with loyalists willing to tweet out photos of an aging casino billionaire reflected as a lion. Flake said, \"It's just a vicious cycle we're in.\" (\"Jeff Flake is stuck living in the past,\" a spokesperson for the Arizona G.O.P. wrote in an e-mail to The New Yorker . \"The days of crony capitalists and 'Republicans In Name Only' dominating the levers of power in the Republican Party is on the decline.\")\n\nFlake was describing a process that continued to unspool even after his story ended, and whose natural terminus is something like the situation of the past month, in which the conspiracies emanating from the President's most senior allies have far exceeded anything coming from the conservative grass roots. \"It's time to move on,\" the televangelist Pat Robertson said last week, suggesting that the President should leave Washington and not run again in 2024. (He spoke highly of Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor). In the most powerful seats in conservative Washington, the mood has been different. Ron Johnson, the senator from Wisconsin, has called for a hearing to investigate \"election irregularities\" in the 2020 contest. The former national-security adviser Michael Flynn, a retired three-star general, suggested that the President might invoke martial law as part of his challenge to the election results. Sidney Powell, a former prosecutor and Texas appellate lawyer, unspooled such baroque conspiracies about voting machines that even Giuliani insisted she wasn't speaking for the Presidential campaign, but the President himself invited her to the White House several times during the week before Christmas. Some of this is natural-inner circles tighten when everyone knows an era is ending. But the inner-circle conspiracies took in something like half the Party in Washington-the portion that had signed the Texas letter. The paranoia was coming from the top of the Party; conservatism had been flipped upside down. Nothing the President had done since the election surprised Flake. He said, \"What has surprised me is how many people in positions of power have pushed this nonsense.\"\n\nFor several weeks, I'd had a daunting file open in my browser tab-several hundred pages of affidavits from Republican poll watchers in Michigan, documenting irregularities that they claimed to have seen while observing the main vote-counting site in Detroit. After I got off the phone with Flake, it occurred to me that this file was a probe into the new Republican Party that Flake had described-these were the Michiganders who had been willing to serve as the foot soldiers in Trump's war against the election. Judges had read it, seen no meaningful evidence of a stolen election, rolled their eyes, and moved on, but from a cultural point of view it made for interesting reading.\n\nThere was nothing especially raggedy or vague about the poll watchers' affidavits. Their testimony was clear, their observations exact, their cursive legible to the point of elegance. Even if they had enrolled in Sidney Powell's and Michael Flynn's project, they sounded very little like Sidney Powell or Michael Flynn. They had been backed by a team of Republican lawyers, and some of them were lawyers themselves (George L. Boller: \"I am a member in good standing of the state bar of Michigan\") or accompanied by lawyers (Cynthia Brunell: \"I arrived a few minutes before 9 p.m. on Tuesday November 3 with my husband, David Brunell, an attorney volunteer with the Republican Party\"). They came from prosperous and middle-class suburbs of Detroit: Bloomfield Hills, Sterling Heights, Livonia. They stayed for remarkably long shifts and kept a careful watch. (Articia Bomer: \"I arrived at approximately 9:30 p.m. and left the next morning at approximately 6:30 a.m.\") Sometimes, when they could not remember exact details, they acknowledged it. (Colleen Schneider: \"I asked the first set of women if they were getting counted twice and they said no. I moved down the line and asked again and I was told to pretty much mind my own business. I cannot remember the exact words.\") To read the file was to see the basic virtues of twentieth-century corporate life (exactitude, determination, careful record keeping) repurposed in service of a mania.\n\nMany of the Republican poll watchers detected hostility from the election workers, perhaps because the Republicans were assiduously noting which of them were wearing Black Lives Matter face masks. (Colleen Schneider: \"She told her table to continue counting the votes. Then she said that I didn't intimidate her, to which I replied that she didn't intimidate me either.\") Some suspicion concentrated on the poll workers, who were alleged to have counted some ballots that were incomplete. The patchiness of municipal government machinery drew attention. (Andrew John Miller: \"I saw roughly 24 computers on November 3, 2020 and every computer I saw had a red error messages in the lower right-hand corner saying, 'update overdue.' \") But even when the poll watchers noticed something that seemed to them amiss, the observations were relayed matter-of-factly. (Braden Gaicobazzi: \"At least 80% of the military ballots I saw were straight ticket democrat or simply had Joe Biden's name filled in on them. I had always been told that military personnel tended to be more conservative, so this stuck out to me as the day went on.\") The popular story of the Republican base through the Trump years, and especially this year, has been that it comes from the social margins, subject to the conspiratorial paranoia of QAnon and OANN. But, at the crucial moment, the base that the President could rely upon was composed of careful partisans who followed the rules and sought remedy within them. If Michael Flynn was plotting a revolution, they were preparing for a lawsuit. Really, they did not seem so far from the precinct committeemen whom Jeff Flake had worked so hard to install, to keep the Party infrastructure \"sane.\"\n\nSome of the poll watchers lived in Michigan's tenth congressional district, and in December their congressman, a conservative named Paul Mitchell III who had not run for reëlection, quit the Republican Party. In a letter addressed to the R.N.C. chair, Ronna Romney McDaniel, and Representative McCarthy, Mitchell made clear that he had supported the President (voting with Trump ninety-five per cent of the time, helping to whip votes, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars to support his colleagues) but that he had reached a breaking point after the election. \"If Republican leaders collectively sit back and tolerate unfounded conspiracy theories and 'Stop the Steal rallies' without speaking for our electoral process, which the Department of Homeland Security said was 'the most secure in American history,' our nation will be damaged,\" Mitchell wrote. \"With the leadership of the Republican Party and our Republican Conference in the House actively participating in at least some of those efforts, I fear long-term harm to our democracy.\" Mitchell wrote that he had asked the House's clerk to record his affiliation as 'independent' for his final votes. \"While admittedly symbolic, we all know that symbols matter.\"\n\nWhat has happened to the Republican Party during these past four years, and what will happen to it now? When Trump moved into the Oval Office, he hung a portrait of Andrew Jackson. But it is hard to credit the party as Jacksonian, or even broadly populist, when, this fall, it refused to send modest checks to suffering Americans, even though its own control of Washington was on the line. Trump was said to augur a rise of a more nationalistic cadre of young conservatives, but the emblem of this supposed turn, Turning Point USA, featured, at its annual conference in December, two models blasting cash through a \"money cannon.\" The conservatism to come might be anything at all.\n\nIn some ways the Republican and Democratic establishments have opposite problems. The Democratic problem is that no one ever leaves-it is in the hands of a stubborn, cagey gerontocracy . The Republican Party's problem is that no one ever stays. In the space of a few short years, its leadership has pinged from neoliberalism to radical libertarianism to minoritarian institutionalism to authoritarian nationalism, hauling the conservative citizens of Sterling Heights along in their wake. Partisanship, rather than ideology, is keeping the Republicans glued together. If there were reasons to think that nationalism would be a stopping point, the events since Election Day have undermined them. Come January, conservatives will be in the minority, awaiting new instructions from new leaders to come.\n\nIn Mesa, Flake noted that his own political banner had been constitutional conservatism; it was only about five years ago that this was the default slogan of any grassroots movement on the right. \"Everybody had their worn pocket Constitutions that they'd rip out at events,\" he said. Now that same movement had arranged itself, Flake pointed out, behind the insistence that challenging the election results was \"the only way to save the Constitution, and even calls for martial law.\" Another rueful laugh. Flake said, \"It's just blown me away, frankly, how quickly that can happen.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Republican Party's Constituency Has Changed. They Aren't Acting Like It.\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nRepublicans are coming off their best presidential election performance with low-income voters in recent memory. According to the (imperfect) 2024 exit polls , President Donald Trump won voters earning $50,000 or less, something he didn't do in either his 2016 or 2020 campaign. This is a landmark measure of the Trump-era realignment, with lower-income, noncollege voters of all races moving toward the Republican Party, while college-educated, higher-income white voters migrate to the Democrats.\n\nRepublican governance, however, has not kept up with these changes.\n\nAfter a chaotic, grinding effort Tuesday to corral the necessary votes, House Republicans barely passed a blueprint for their \"one big, beautiful bill\" containing much of Trump's legislative agenda. It tees up their ability to use the filibuster-proof reconciliation process to enact a sweeping bill, along party lines, down the road.\n\nThe blueprint creates space for a mishmash of Republican priorities, like beefing up border security and boosting defense spending. But its core is the same old, same old: cutting spending for programs that poor people rely on, and cutting taxes. It is, in other words, roughly the same agenda that Republicans sought in 2017, when Trump entered the White House for the first time, even though the party's composition has changed significantly since then.\n\n(To clarify: This process is a separate negotiation from the other major ongoing legislative effort-funding the government beyond March 14-that will require Democratic cooperation. It has its own problems .)\n\nWhat House Republicans passed Tuesday is not the final bill achieving all of Trump's big, beautiful successes. Instead, this measure gives various committees their marching orders: The Armed Services Committee has put together a plan for $100 billion in new defense spending; the Homeland Security and Judiciary committees, which have immigration and border jurisdiction, respectively, get $200 billion to play with; the Education and Workforce Committee has to find $330 billion in savings; and so on. Once the House and Senate pass an identical blueprint, then the committees set about writing the final bill itself, and try to pass that.\n\nAll in all, the blueprint allows for $4.8 trillion in tax cuts and spending on other GOP priorities, while requiring at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts elsewhere. It also has a mechanism , at the conservative Freedom Caucus' request, that if Republicans don't reach $2 trillion in mandatory spending cuts over the next decade, then there's less money allowed for tax cuts.\n\nThe most controversial element for Republicans is that the blueprint tasks the Energy and Commerce Committee with finding $880 billion in cuts. This powerful committee, once described as having jurisdiction over \"anything that moves, burns, or is sold,\" also oversees Medicaid. Since Trump has ruled out cuts to Medi care , it's Medicaid, a program that spends nearly a trillion dollars a year, that's the obvious pot to raid for cash. Indeed, House Republicans earlier this year put out a menu of spending cuts they could choose from, and the bulk of the Energy and Commerce options relate to Medicaid. Republicans have some other big targets, for other committees, in mind, whether that's rolling back food stamps or student loans. But the members have cornered themselves into targeting Medicaid for the bulk of the savings they want to achieve in order to finance tax cuts.\n\nIt has at least begun to dawn on some Republicans that the party now describing itself as the tribune of the American poor might be acting counterintuitively here .\n\nA group of eight GOP members of Congress representing significant Hispanic American populations-a demographic sprinting to the Republican side of the aisle- wrote a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson last week, warning that \"slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in rural and predominantly Hispanic communities where hospitals and nursing homes are already struggling to keep their doors open.\" Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who fancies himself a New Right populist, warned the House against \"severe cuts to Medicaid.\" So, too, has MAGA whisperer Steve Bannon.\n\n\"Medicaid, you gotta be careful,\" Bannon recently said on his podcast. \"Because a lot of MAGAs are on Medicaid, I'm telling you. If you don't think so, you are dead wrong.\"\n\nTrump himself seems to understand the damage Medicaid cuts could do to his coalition. But he's given mixed and conflicting views on the House GOP's targeting of Medicaid, as is his wont.\n\nModerates' concerns about Medicaid were not Johnson's only worry as he tried to bring the plan to a vote at the beginning of the week. Certain conservatives with a flair for independence had their own gripes about the package's debt impact.\n\nIt was a few of the conservative members holding out who stalled the action into Tuesday night. Those most concerned about Medicaid were placated earlier in the day to at least go along with this step. Two talking points were key to bringing them around.\n\nThe first was the technically correct assertion that the blueprint does not mention the word Medicaid once.\n\n\"Can you specify one thing today that identifies a single cut?\" New York Rep. Mike Lawler told reporters Tuesday morning. The blueprint, as he said, is where \"you start the process, and then you negotiate what the final terms of the agreement are going to be.\" This, again, is correct. But the blueprint does dig an $880 billion hole that is difficult, if not impossible, to fill without major cuts to Medicaid-and not just \"waste, fraud, and abuse.\" For now, though, Republicans can say with a straight face that they're simply beginning a process.\n\nSecondly, these members are also hoping that this will all be changed when the process moves to the Senate.\n\n\"Ultimately, the question is: What is the Senate going to come back with?\" Lawler said. \"We have to pass the same resolution, right?\" In other words, House Republicans expect that the version of the blueprint that comes out of the Senate-which doesn't have to contend with a hard-ass Freedom Caucus-won't put such a target on Medicaid.\n\nAnd so the process moves along. The bill that passed Tuesday night doesn't actually enact any cuts, and thus, it allows everyone to save face. Eventually, though, this will all come to a head. The historically narrow House Republican majority, depending on any given day's attendance, can afford only one or two defections on a vote. On one end are moderates and vulnerable members, or members representing ascendant, working-class elements of the new Republican coalition, for whom cutting the social safety net makes no political sense whatsoever. On the other end are Freedom Caucus members, who believe with divine passion that the United States will soon collapse under the weight of its debt, and that meaningfully reducing that debt is their single biggest priority while they hold power. One side will eventually have to give.\n\nThe GOP is training its sights on Medicaid for cuts only because Trump had ruled out changes to Medicare and Social Security, both commonly understood to be third rails. But it might be dated thinking for the GOP, given the changes in its coalitional composition, to not consider Medicaid a third rail of its own. The party will either back off or risk finding out the hard way.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Republicans Feel Invincible Right Now\n\nThe 2024 Republican National Convention is a happy place. That's unusual. In recent cycles, whether the nominee has been John McCain, Mitt Romney, or Donald Trump, there have always been substantial pockets of discontent within the arena. If there's broad discontent within the party among attendees this year, they're doing an awfully good job hiding it.\n\nThe sunny vibe is especially unusual because the now-official party nominee was shot in the ear on Saturday, coming literally within an inch of his life. What could explain the way delegates and other conventiongoers so quickly moved beyond that trauma and pivoted to joy?\n\nThe only way to put it is that Republicans are feeling invincible.\n\nTrump was already leading the election before Joe Biden's catastrophic debate performance kicked off an ongoing multiweek spectacle of the Democratic Party's destroying itself in the broad light of day. Trump was then leading by more. Then he survived an assassination attempt. If possible, he is now likely leading by even more. Republicans are riding a euphoria they have never quite experienced during Trump's time in politics. It's unusual . They can't help but speculate about divine intervention.\n\n\"There's almost a providence about it,\" Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall told me and another reporter.\n\nRepublicans aren't worried about the little stuff these days. If there was any discontent heading into the convention, it was the Trump campaign's rewriting of the party platform's abortion section, which for the first time in decades doesn't call for a federal ban at a certain stage of fetal development. After the shooting, no one cared about that anymore.\n\nBut they're not even sweating the rather large question of which Democrat Trump will run against in November. Marshall, for one, speculated that after the assassination attempt, \"I don't think you could give Kamala Harris the nomination. She would say no to it.\" In other words, she wouldn't want to be the sacrificial lamb in a year that Democrats, in Marshall's view, appear poised to lose.\n\nIt wasn't the only time I heard that line of thinking. Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project, a social conservative group, assessed that Democratic efforts to oust Biden would peter out after the assassination attempt \"because ultimately they don't want to waste one of their up-and-coming stars now that the country is much more likely to elect Donald Trump.\"\n\nI spoke to Schilling and Marshall at a doozy of an event that the American Principles Project was throwing at a Milwaukee bar outside the Fiserv Forum. The APP, in conjunction with Orange County Choppers-the custom motorcycle maker chronicled on the much-memed show American Chopper -was gifting Riley Gaines, the former college swimmer protesting the inclusion of transgender women in women's sports, a new custom motorcycle that it unveiled at the event. Schilling, Marshall, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and American Chopper star Paul Teutul Sr. were there for the honors and to share their beliefs against \"boys in girls' sports.\"\n\nTeutul told me, at first, that he didn't care whom the Democrats ran.\n\n\"All I look at is that [Trump] needs to win,\" he said. \"I don't look at who he's running against.\" Then, though, he said in a quieter voice, \"definitely Joe Biden.\" But Teutul has felt really good about Trump's chances \"ever since that controversy with them trying to arrest him and stuff like that.\"\n\nGreg Reiman, a guest of a Wisconsin delegate (his wife), was strolling around the plaza outside the Fiserv Forum Tuesday morning. He showed me a photo of how close he had sat to the Trump family the previous night and noted that Eric Trump had smiled when he had said hi to him.\n\nReiman has been taking a \"little pleasure\" in watching the Democratic infighting of late. He did concede, however, that \"there's only a twinge, and just a twinge , of feeling bad for Joe Biden\" because \"maybe he's been held in a bubble and doesn't realize how bad he's looking.\"\n\nIf there's anything keeping Republicans' euphoria in check, it's a feeling that the sinister Democrats might still have more tricks up their sleeve. One thing that truly locked-in partisans on, yes, both sides have in common is a belief that the other side's operatives, strategists, and other pooh-bahs are masters in dark magic, capable of anything .\n\n\"The [Democratic] Congress members, the senators, it seems like they're kind of giving up because they know Joe's not going anywhere,\" Reiman reasoned. \"But the Carvilles, the real operatives behind the scenes, they're too cutthroat, too mean. They play to win, and they don't give a shit who gets run over in the process. Even Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe \"guys behind the scenes,\" he said, would \"unplug your life support machine just to charge their phones.\"\n\nWhether it's by divine providence, sorcery from party operatives, or something else, political fortunes can flip in a switch. There's no better example of that than the 2016 election, when Trump was written off as having any chance of winning, for a new reason, every day. And around the 2016 convention, much of the conversation was about which major party figures weren't even bothering to attend the event, either for personal political reasons or to keep their fingerprints off Trump's takeover of the GOP.\n\nThat's less of a conversation this time. The party really is united. On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell-who didn't speak with Trump and for more than three years would barely say his name-made a point of announcing Kentucky's delegates for Trump during the roll call of the states. (He was booed throughout, which was funny. Reintroduction into Trumpworld doesn't happen overnight.) McConnell's deputy and potential successor as Republican leader, South Dakota Sen. John Thune, also had a strained relationship with Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 election. He was right there on the convention floor too during Trump's nomination.\n\n\"I know, at least on the Senate side, we're very unified. The Trump campaign, the president himself, our Senate leadership, all the entities, everybody's working together,\" Thune said. \"I think that we are very, very unified coming out of this, which I think is exciting.\"\n\nTrump's felled rivals from the primary, Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, both were last-minute additions to the program, after initially planning not to come. I did, however, run across one Republican primary candidate who was not yet on board with the team. Asa Hutchinson, the former Arkansas governor whose anti-Trump positions made him a ripe target for Trump's jokes about his low polling numbers, was loitering around inside the convention's security perimeter Tuesday morning. But even he is beginning to sound as if he's getting close.\n\n\"He certainly has shown strength, resilience, and now a tone that reflects the need to bring America together, so I applaud that,\" he said of Trump. He would take that into consideration as he determines \"where I go in this election.\"\n\n\"When you look at what the Republicans offer versus what the Democrats offer,\" he said, \"I'm a Republican.\"\n\nI was speaking on the convention floor Monday to Forgiato Blow, the right-wing rapper behind such songs as \"Boycott Target.\" He was wearing a T-shirt featuring the now-famous Evan Vucci photograph of Trump raising his fist onstage in Butler, Pennsylvania, above which read \"IMPEACHED. ARRESTED. CONVICTED. SHOT,\" and below which read, \"STILL STANDING.\"\n\nI asked Blow what his first thought had been, seeing the news about the attempt on Trump's life. Anger? Concern? No.\n\n\"I said, 'The election's over.' \"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Who J.D. Vance Is For\n\nIn choosing Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as his running mate, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made his campaign strategy clear: boys, boys, boys.\n\nWhite working-class men were key to Trump's victory in 2016, and Biden's ability to peel off some of their support was one reason he won in 2020. Now Trump seems to be doubling down on the strategy of catering to disaffected men-mostly white ones, but also Black and Hispanic men and young men. He's doing so to some degree in policy, promising to close the border to immigrants, whom he paints as physically dangerous to vulnerable white women and economically threatening to the forgotten white men.\n\nBut Trump is just not much of a policy guy; he's an entertainer and a symbol-maker, equal parts savior and avenger, a man onto whom fans can project all sorts of hopes and inclinations. And as such, his appeal to men is much more about masculine performance and cultural signaling than about expertise, competence, or even a loose plan of action.\n\nWhich is why Vance, perhaps the least qualified and least experienced vice presidential nominee in decades, may have appealed to Trump. Vance brings no practical skill set to the ticket. Yes, he could pull more money from Silicon Valley billionaires , but he doesn't promise to deliver any key state (Ohio, where Vance is a senator, was already Trump's) or bring along any new demographic (white men are already Trump's). Instead, he supplies youth and vigor, masculine embitterment , and white male rage. (\"Even at my best, I'm a delayed explosion,\" he wrote in his bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy .) And that, Trump's campaign has banked , is enough to win the election. Perhaps it's even enough to give the MAGA movement a second life once Trump is gone.\n\nMAGA is a movement of both gender traditionalism and cartoonish machismo, rejecting the compassionate conservatism of George W. Bush's evangelical Christianity for the muscular reactionaryism of Jacked Jesus . Trump's sexism and his poor treatment of women in his personal life have been extensively documented; Vance has been outspoken about his particular ire for women who have an insufficient number of children, as well as for mothers who work outside the home. (Vance has three children and, until his candidacy was announced, his wife worked a demanding job at a law firm.)\n\nHe has complained that childless women have too much power, griping , \"We are effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.\" He has argued that \"a healthy ruling class\" must be made up of people with children. And since he has also suggested that mothers shouldn't prioritize working in demanding roles-\"If your worldview tells you that it's bad for women to become mothers but liberating for them to work 90 hours a week in a cubicle at the New York Times or Goldman Sachs, you've been had,\" he tweeted just after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade -he has insinuated, effectively, that the ruling class should be made up of men.\n\nThese views are, obviously, alienating to a lot of women. But they may be surprisingly appealing to disaffected men who feel that their rightful place at the top of the social, political, economic, and familial hierarchies should be restored.\n\nA lot of recent data has, in fact, shown that there is a huge self-defined masculinity gap between Republicans and Democrats, with Republican men much more likely than Democratic ones to say that they are \"very masculine\" (54 percent vs. 33 percent), according to a 2022 American Enterprise Institute survey . According to that same survey, Black and Hispanic men look a lot more like Republicans than Democrats when it comes to ideas about their own manliness: 55 percent of Black men and 52 percent of Hispanic men also say they are \"very masculine.\" In 2023 a Politico magazine/IPSOS poll of just over 1,000 people found that one of the biggest predictors of support for Trump is a belief that men are besieged by an anti-male culture-that men's roles and masculinity itself are under attack. Trump performs his tough-guy routine for this group of men, who hold tight to their masculine identities. Vance speaks directly to them.\n\nIn Vance's Republican National Convention speech , his first as the VP pick, the Ohio native emphasized this men-first strategy. He stressed that Americans need a leader who \"answers to the working man.\" This election isn't about him, he intoned: \"It's about all of us, and it's about who we're fighting for.\" Who is that? He listed off three archetypes: \"the autoworker in Michigan,\" \"the factory worker in Wisconsin,\" and \"the energy worker in Pennsylvania and Ohio.\" Women, of course, are autoworkers, factory workers, and energy workers. But these jobs are heavily coded as blue-collar and male, and it's not hard to read between the lines and see that when Vance speaks about the working class, he means exactly what he said early on in his speech: that he's talking about the working man .\n\nAs for women, well, Vance did say, \"Our movement is about single moms like mine, who struggled with money and addiction but never gave up.\" Which is an interesting way to introduce his own mother on the national stage but hardly a familiar, inspiring, or even particularly accurate picture of American women, single moms or not. The women that Vance talked about were all members of his own family. In fact, the only time the word woman showed up in his speech was when he was talking about his grandmother, and the only working woman he referenced was his wife (\"Usha, an incredible lawyer and a better mom\"). Men, on the other hand, merited specific mention as tradesmen who had lost their jobs, as the patriots who had signed up for military duty after 9/11, and as the workers a Trump presidency will answer to. It's hard to believe that this wasn't an intentional nod to the people Vance hopes will get behind him.\n\nEven before picking Vance, Trump was running way ahead with men. In early July, after his debate against President Joe Biden, Trump saw a surge of male support, with 58 percent of respondents in a New York Times/Siena College poll saying they would vote for him, and just 31 percent backing Biden. Women are not so enthusiastic: Biden retains a lead with female voters, although the margins are not nearly as dramatic. Most polls don't break out support by race and gender combined, but Trump also leads among white voters, 56 percent of whom are supporting him-a trend that suggests he has particularly strong backing from white men.\n\nAnd he seems too to be making inroads with men of color. Again, the most recent and reliable polls are not granular enough to break down the preferences of Black and Hispanic men vs. women (or older voters of color vs. younger ones), but voters of color without college degrees are surprisingly split: Biden leads this cohort by just 7 points, with 40 percent supporting Trump. But voters of color without college degrees are more likely to be male than female . In other words: While Black voters are still strongly pro-Biden and Hispanic voters remain more pro-Biden than pro-Trump-and while white voters are much more pro-Trump than any other racial group-the data suggest that when it comes to Trump's making inroads among voters of color, he'll have the best luck with men.\n\nVance has similar strengths. In his 2022 senate race, Vance won 58 percent of male Ohio voters, including 62 percent of married men, 64 percent of white men, and nearly 15 percent of Black men.\n\nThis, in a traditional campaign sense, makes Vance a poor choice for the vice presidency. If Trump is trying to win over more voters, he has much more room to grow with women. From 2016 to 2020, he increased his support from white women, while Biden gained among white men. This year, though, women have been flocking to Democrats in the wake of abortion bans and other instances of GOP hypermisogyny. Trump himself knows that abortion politics are the GOP's weak spot, which is why he has forced the party to be more deceptive about its opposition to abortion rights in its 2024 platform. But winning back women is apparently a lower priority than emphasizing MAGA masculinity. And elections, after all, are about both turnout and persuasion. In choosing Vance, Trump seems to be betting that he can increase male turnout by fanning the flames of masculine discontent and perhaps persuade some Democrats and independents that they too are better represented by the party of men.\n\nFinally, leaning so heavily on masculine power is also a strategy particularly calibrated in opposition to Biden. Trump is by no measure a healthy young man and has rarely received praise (other than from himself) for his mental acuity. But voters really are worried not just about Biden's age but about his stamina and his physical and cognitive abilities.\n\nAnd some may be swayed further still by Vance, whose appeal rests partly in his youth, especially when compared to Biden. (Vance is 39.) Male voters are much more likely than female ones to strongly believe that Biden is simply too old to be president-60 percent of them say so, according to Times polling . And just 21 percent say the same of Trump.\n\nPutting a much younger man on the ticket reinforces Trump's core message: He and Vance are red-blooded American males, and this is no country for old men. (Vance, for his part, has leaned into the role as well: When the Chinese spy balloon was floating over the U.S., Vance posted a photo of himself on social media pointing a gun at the sky .)\n\nNor, the Trump ticket suggests, is it one for middle-aged women. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is much younger than Biden. But she'll be 60 by Election Day. Vance will be 40-making him, if he and Trump win, one of the youngest vice presidents in American history. In Vance, disgruntled men may see someone who stands up for, and stands in for, their return to greatness. Trump's conservative base may see a man who can carry the MAGA movement for years to come. Whether that's enough to counteract the damage the GOP has done with female voters is a gigantic question. But in choosing Vance, Trump has laid his cards on the table, and he's going all in on the guys.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "A New Documentary About The Last Republican Finds an Unexpected Source of Hope\n\nHow did a liberal Hollywood director end up making a documentary about a conservative Christian politician? The answer, explains The Last Republican 's Adam Kinzinger, is simple: Hot Tub Time Machine .\n\nSteve Pink is, in fact, the director of the John Cusack vehicle about a time-traveling Jacuzzi and its sequel, as well as a co-writer of High Fidelity and Grosse Pointe Blank , none of which would make him an obvious choice to profile Kinzinger, the Illinois Republican who effectively ended his political career by voting to impeach Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 insurrection. And that may be why Kinzinger, who hints that he was approached by several other filmmakers, granted Pink access to what turned out to be his final 14 months in office. It's not a particularly hard-hitting documentary, and despite the broader implications of Kinzinger's fate, the movie stays narrowly dialed in on its singular subject, his family, and his staff. But the intimacy that spans both sides of the camera, guarded and combative as it sometimes is, ends up being key to extracting a note of hope from a story that could otherwise just be a downbeat cautionary tale.\n\nThe Last Republican , which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival this weekend and is still seeking distribution, frontloads the barbed exchanges between the filmmaker and his subject, who seem to share little in common beyond being born in Illinois. \"You have contempt for what I believe,\" Kinzinger says to Pink early on, and shortly thereafter he characterizes the director as being \"basically a communist.\" (\"Progressive,\" Pink faintly mumbles off-camera.) Although he was a featured speaker at the Democratic National Convention in August, Kinzinger is no political moderate. He may have thrown his weight behind Kamala Harris in this election cycle, but as he told the Los Angeles Times in Toronto, that's in part because her approach to foreign policy is more hawkish than Trump's . Swept into office in the 2010 elections as part of the tea party wave, Kinzinger pushed to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to preserve the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds for abortions. So he wasn't an obvious candidate to break with his party in 2021, when he was one of 10 House Republicans to vote in favor of impeaching Trump, and one of two to serve on the Congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attacks.\n\nNeither Pink nor Kinzinger seems inclined to dig too deeply into the psychology of why Kinzinger acted the way he did, a subtle affirmation that he's not the one who needs to have his head examined. Instead, the movie mostly tracks the consequences of his actions, and his disillusion and disbelief with what has become of the political party he once believed in. Kinzinger happily presents himself as a lifelong politics geek, recalling how he turned his childhood bedroom into a mock headquarters for the Bush-Quayle campaign and petitioned passers-by to join the cause, even though the only foot traffic came from his family members. But his political career began almost by accident, when he was captured on camera disarming a knife-wielding attacker who had slashed his own girlfriend's throat in the street. A military veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Kinzinger knew how dangerous it was to go up against an armed assailant with nothing but his bare hands, and he's well aware how easily he could have been killed. But he's matter-of-fact about why he stepped in. In dangerous situations, he says, 90 percent of people either freeze or flee. He's the other 10 percent.\n\nThe movie's most affecting sections take Kinzinger through the experience of being abandoned by his party, including the individuals who mentored him as a young congressperson. It's a story he narrates both in real time and in a retrospective interview conducted in his empty Capitol Hill office, where you can still see the imprint of his legislator's desk pressed into the carpet. His keenest rage is directed not at Donald Trump but at Kevin McCarthy, who went, in the space of weeks, from criticizing Trump's attempt to overturn the presidential election to bending the knee at Mar-a-Lago. In retrospect, Kinzinger sees that brief period, after the Jan. 6 attacks weakened Trump's legitimacy and before the former president began to reassert his hold on the party, as a crucial missed opportunity, when he and the nine other House Republicans (plus seven in the Senate) who voted to impeach could have established themselves as a vocal new faction and rallied a larger chunk of the Republican Party to their cause. But apart from Liz Cheney, who also served on the Jan. 6 committee and was successfully primaried by a Trump loyalist the year after her appointment, the other eight pro-impeachment voters went quiet, and any hope of a broader movement died on the vine.\n\nInstead, Kinzinger was portrayed as a laughingstock, derisively dubbed a \"Pelosi Republican\" by McCarthy and mocked by right-wing media for tearing up during his closing speech at the Jan. 6 hearings. (On Fox, Tucker Carlson smirked over a caption that read, \" Adam Kinzinger Is Still Crying. \") Over the course of Kinzinger's final year on the Hill, it's clear that becoming a pariah in his own party, not to mention the recipient of regular threats to his and his loved ones' lives, takes a toll on the people around him. At one point, a staffer opens a door in his office to reveal a cabinet stuffed with Kleenex boxes. And of course, the cruelty is the point . It wasn't enough to disempower Kinzinger; he had to be humiliated, dragged through the mud at every opportunity so no one else would dare to follow his lead. And it worked. Trump believed that Republican politicians were weak, that he could use the power of his followers to bend the party to his will and trash its long-standing ideals-and he has, unequivocally, been proven right .\n\nThe fact that one of the few things Adam Kinzinger and Steve Pink can agree on is their mutual love of the original Red Dawn underlines the fact that they're both members of Generation X, and one way to read the documentary is as a comment on their (and my) generation's lack of a political footprint. (Even Kamala Harris, for all her love of Prince, is technically a Boomer.) You could argue that Kinzinger chose righteousness over obedience in a way that cost him everything and accomplished next to nothing-or, even worse, that he now serves as an example for any Republican who might so much as entertain the notion of getting out of lockstep with Donald Trump. But there's optimism in The Last Republican , even if you have to look outside of Kinzinger's party to find it. Kinzinger and Pink couldn't seem more different, especially in a polarized political culture where common ground is almost impossible to find. But you can feel them finding common cause, if not spanning the ideological gulf, then at least managing to call out across it. They'll probably never see eye to eye, but at least they can agree on which movie to watch.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Want to Stare Into the Republican Soul in 2023?\n\nThe party was on at a gathering of unsung Republican heavyweights, and I was in search of the armadillo racing. The booze was flowing: Open bars numbered in the double digits, plus metal bathtubs teemed with beer on ice. Cover bands played and DJs spun. There was line dancing and trick ropers, twirling lassos and mechanical bulls, bucking riders and stilt-walkers.\n\nAnd there were car dealers-thousands of them. So many gray blazers atop so many pairs of jeans, so many corporate logos embossed on so many fleece vests. So many, many men. This year's blowout was in Dallas and the invite called for \"Western duds,\" so there were omni gallon hats and dinner-plate belt buckles too.\n\nThis was opening night of the NADA Show, the annual convention of the National Automobile Dealers Association, one of the most powerful trade organizations representing one of the richest professions in America, and there was much to celebrate.\n\nThe years since COVID hit had been some of the industry's best ever. Supply-chain issues had sent prices skyrocketing. New car prices were up; used car prices were up even more . \"This has been an unexpected bonanza for new car dealers,\" George Hoffer, professor emeritus of transportation economics at Virginia Commonwealth University, told Time late last year. Only a few months prior, the research firm Haig Partners clocked average gross profit for dealers at 180 percent over 2019 levels.\n\nReally, the past hundred years had been great. Auto dealers are one of the five most common professions among the top 0.1 percent of American earners. Car dealers, gas station owners, and building contractors, it turns out, make up the majority of the country's 140,000 Americans who earn more than $1.58 million per year.* Crunching numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau, data scientist and author Seth Stephens-Davidowitz found that over 20 percent of car dealerships in the U.S. have an owner banking more than $1.5 million per year.\n\nAnd car dealers are not only one of the richest demographics in the United States. They're also one of the most organized political factions-a conservative imperium giving millions of dollars to politicians at local, state, and national levels. They lobby through NADA, the organization staging the weekend's festivities, and donate to Republicans at a rate of 6-to-1. Through those efforts, they've managed to write and rewrite laws to protect dealers and sponsor sympathetic politicians in all 50 states. All of which meant that this year, presidential hopeful Nikki Haley and Fox News darling Greg Gutfeld, among others, had made the pilgrimage to kiss the key ring.\n\nBut just as times are strange for Republicans, they are for car dealers too, and the event this year had a decadent and desperate energy. Opening night featured a concert by country star Brad Paisley. He was set to take the stage in mere minutes, and I still hadn't found the armadillos. I'd sidled through the \"speak-easy,\" happened upon the blackjack tables, and even run smack into a male dancer standing atop a saddle swinging 4 feet off the ground. But the small mammal racetrack eluded me.\n\nGet on the list.\n\nI pushed through crowded hallways, my path lit by the luminous logo of prodigious subprime lender Ally Bank. I rounded a corner, past a room full of ax throwers, and finally came face-to-face with a donkey. He was freighted on both sides by coolers full of beer. Dealers lined up to take pictures with him. I asked an event staffer where the armadillos were. They'd been canceled at the last minute, she told me: The beer burro was the live-animal entertainment replacement. Cheers burst in from the main hall; Paisley hit the stage.\n\nI retreated to a side room, where a man named Andrew-bald, besotted-told me it was his seventh NADA convention. So far this one was tame compared with last year's in Las Vegas, he said, chewing on a pork slider from a nearby buffet table and swallowing the finer syllables of his words. \"You know why they couldn't have it in Vegas this year?\" he asked. \"Too many divorces.\" Behind him, two men in vests went up and down on a seesaw in the shape of a mustache, each sitting atop one curl of the handlebar.\n\nI asked Andrew what he thought of these halcyon days. \"The last two years, cars have basically sold themselves,\" he said with a sigh. \"There's a fucking reckoning coming.\"\n\nIn many ways, you can't understand U.S. conservatism without understanding the car dealer-that middlemensch of American capitalism, selling a product he doesn't make at a fat-enough markup to become fabulously rich and politically powerful. And dealers who have lodged themselves in the middle of Republican politics find themselves at a crossroads, just like the party they patronize. Underneath the froth, and the humidity, there was anxiety in the air. I journeyed to the NADA convention to hear the dealers' vision of the future. What I found is a stark prescription for what Republicans want now.\n\nWhen the first car dealership opened in 1898, in Detroit, it was seen as a convenience for cash-strapped manufacturers, who were overwhelmed just by producing the cars. They needed a means to reach customers without having to build their own sales networks. A class of middlemen sprang up. Car dealers quickly became pioneers of influence, concocting new and astonishing breakthroughs in the very American alchemy of converting riches to political sway.\n\nAs the automobile industry flourished, so did the dealership model-but the American entrance into World War I threatened to interrupt that ascent. So, in 1917, a group of 30 Chicago dealers went before Congress to argue that cars shouldn't be classified as luxuries by the tax code. The luxury distinction would have allowed car-manufacturing facilities to be converted to use for wartime production. That would have been fine for manufacturers, which would have continued making money manufacturing, but disastrous for car dealers, who couldn't just sell tanks.\n\nThe dealers won the argument and then some, leaving Washington with a 40 percent cut in the \"luxury tax,\" which was then being levied on car sales. With that, the National Automobile Dealers Association was born.\n\nThat first taste of triumph only whetted the appetite. By the 1930s, with another war effort in the works, dealers went state by state. \"At that time, there was lots of attention being paid to small business as having inherent virtue and the need to protect mom-and-pop shops,\" Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, told me. \"They embraced that story, and were extremely successful at getting legislatures in all 50 states to strictly regulate how cars were sold.\" In 17 states, it is outright illegal for car manufacturers to sell cars at all.\n\nThe \"mom-and-pop\" facade of the postwar period gave way to multibillion-dollar, intergenerational dealership empires. As of 2021, the top 10 dealership groups in the U.S. had annual revenues around $100 billion, more than any company that actually makes cars.* The NADA became one of the most influential lobbying entities in Washington, with 16,000 dues-paying businesses spanning 32,500 franchises . Soon enough, a stop at the annual NADA convention became routine for presidential hopefuls and even presidents. Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan, and Hillary Clinton all attended ahead of presidential runs; Bill Clinton and both Bushes came after they left the White House.\n\nBy the time car salesmen had won their reputation as the very least scrupulous of business practitioners, dealers had secured such an astounding array of political protections via their lobbying outfit that no countervailing force-economists, car manufacturers, civil rights groups, environmentalists , or the Koch brothers -has been able to thwart them. A survey done in 2016 by one of their own trade publications found that 87 percent of Americans disliked the experience of buying a car at a dealership. So what? You don't have to be well liked if you're powerful.\n\nNow car dealers are one of the most important secular forces in American conservatism, having taken a huge swath of the political system hostage. They spent a record $7 million on federal lobbying in 2022, far more than the National Rifle Association, and $25 million in 2020 just on federal elections, mostly to Republicans. The NADA PAC kicked in another $5 million. That's a small percentage of the operation: Dealers mainline money to state- and local-level GOPs as well. They often play an outsize role in communities, buying up local ad space, sponsoring local sports teams, and strengthening a social network that can be very useful to political campaigns. \"There's a dealer in every district, which is why their power is so diffuse. They're not concentrated in any one place; they're spread out everywhere, all over the country,\" Crane said. Although dealers are maligned as parasites, their relationship to the GOP is pure symbiosis: Republicans need their money and networks, and dealers need politicians to protect them from repealing the laws that keep the money coming in.\n\nThe dealers need that protection now more than ever. Recent legislation from the Biden administration, namely the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act, has directly and indirectly thrown many billions of dollars at incentivizing people to buy electric cars. And the White House is counting on that to propel its climate strategy. The EV revolution could be ushered in, potentially at a handsome premium, by the dealers themselves. This was, in fact, the weekend's theme: \"NADA is all in on EVs,\" read the event's promo material. \"Getting all charged up\" read the programming packet tucked into my complimentary NADA-branded backpack.\n\nOne major problem with this plan is a certain company called Tesla. When the electric car manufacturer started up, it refused to use dealers at all, opting instead for a direct-sales model. Buyers could check out the cars in showrooms at malls and then buy online, a heady workaround of those dealer protections. Online sales minimized interactions with oleaginous salesmen and added price transparency, which did away with the haggling. Tesla, meanwhile, ended up making more money by not having to sell its cars to dealers, who would then mark them up. Other EV startups-Lucid, Rivian-went the same way, and soon enough, legacy manufacturers started flirting with direct internet sales too. \"We have all this inventory sitting around in dealers,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a 2022 investor presentation . \"Get rid of all of it ... go 100 percent online.\" (He later walked back that statement .)\n\nThe dealers, of course, fought back and are fighting still. They're in court in California, Texas, Colorado, Mississippi, and Florida , among other places, to keep laws on the books that prevent cars from being sold by manufacturers or that prevent manufacturers from servicing their own cars or otherwise encroaching on their business model. After years of litigation, Michigan , the birthplace of the dealership, recently agreed to let Tesla sell and service cars in-state. Half of states have loosened dealer protections more (red states, ostensibly \"pro-business,\" tend to have the most binding restrictions), but dealers are still making record profits. Even Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, despite launching his presidential bid with Tesla's Elon Musk, has raised millions from dealers and given no indication he'd veto two restrictive, dealer-sponsored bills passing through the Florida Legislature. (These bills would make it illegal for car manufacturers to set transparent prices and allow buyers to order EVs from legacy manufacturers online.)\n\nThe car dealers in Dallas were gathering on the 10-year anniversary of a triumphant 2013 stand they took, as a political bloc, against direct sales in Texas . That year, the Legislature of the Lone Star State downed proposals to allow direct sales of vehicles there-thanks to millions in campaign donations and lobbying outlays from the dealers. After another takedown, in 2017, the Houston Chronicle marveled that dealers are \"astonishingly difficult to dislodge.\" Now Teslas made in Texas have to be shipped out of the state and then reimported across state lines to any buyers in Texas who purchase them online, one of many ridiculous workarounds born of dealer-protection laws.\n\nThe first lesson of NADA? Don't mention Tesla.\n\nThe morning after the welcome party, I rolled onto the showroom floor with plenty of time to take in the sprawling exhibition, secure a good seat for Nikki Haley's much-anticipated speech, and learn about our industry's future.\n\nWhy \" our future\"? Well, when I submitted a request for press credentials months prior to the event, I was denied. Befitting a gathering of car dealers, I was told, improbably, that the dealers had run out of the thing I wanted-a press pass-which left me with no choice but to secure a similar but much more expensive model: a full-price, regular ticket. And I was doubly bound by the fact that Graham Holdings, Slate's parent company, also happens to own multiple car dealerships, which are indeed dues-paying members of NADA, and presumably important to the company's financial health. I identified myself as a journalist to everyone I spoke with, but the placard around my neck hailing my full-price ticket was a reminder that I had skin in this game.\n\nI passed through the doors and entered the carpeted expanse. I journeyed straight to the base of Auto Spin, a 25-foot pyramid with a white Ford SUV twirling at its top. \"The world's tallest spinning display, see it one mile away,\" the monolith proclaimed. I was beckoned by a man on a microphone to spin a prize wheel. \"Free money, no risk, no obligation,\" he said. I spun the wheel, and an attendant produced a wad of cash a cinder block thick, like a teller at a strip club. It was a losing spin. Laughing, he peeled a dollar off the top and presented my prize: \"100 ... pennies.\"\n\nI pocketed my winnings with glee, only to find that this was far from the only station giving out money for nothing. All over the floor were prize wheels and games and gimmicks where attendees were raking in $1, $5, $10, and $20 bills with one hand and grabbing drinks from the many open bars with the other. A robotic car wash, called the Hercules 6000, rinsed a red hatchback on an endless loop.\n\nI walked and walked so far I lost sight of Auto Spin, and eventually washed up in the \"EV Solutions Center,\" which was tucked into the farthest reaches of the building.\n\nHere, in the exurbs of the convention, was scheduled programming meant to enlighten dealers about the promise of selling EVs. I hunkered down for a presentation by Buzz Smith, \"the EV-angelist.\" His lecture, \"Selling EVs Is Easy, Even in Texas!,\" was already underway.\n\nBald and goateed, Buzz wore a shimmering, red-sequined sports coat that seemed, in places, to have been set upon by plastic-hungry moths. Take the time to learn how the car actually works, he counseled the crowd. Get the buyers out for a test drive. \"The big message, though, is do not mention the environment. Do NOT mention climate change,\" he warned. In other words: Don't let politics kill a sale. The crowd nodded. People took notes.\n\nAs the microphone made the rounds for questions, one dealer in a light-blue button-down came huffing down the aisle like an objector trying to thwart a marriage. He grabbed the mic, plopped down in the front row, and exhaled as he asked, peevishly: \"What is the labor cost?\" (He was referring to the cost required to hire technicians to service EVs.)\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Buzz.\n\n\"That's a good question! Thank you!\" the blue-button-downed man shot back, praising himself. \"It's just a lot of risk! These workers are afraid of getting electrocuted; they have to wear gloves.\"\n\nThere were risks too, Buzz said, in fixing an internal combustion engine. And the new class of mechanics was being trained on EVs. The question asker glowered in his chair. An emcee swooped in, thanked the attendees, and the crowd dispersed.\n\nI headed over to the stage to talk to Buzz.\n\nThis was not his first presentation, he told me. Hecklers were not uncommon. EVs were up against the economic interests of dealers, who were already conservative-i.e., prone to be suspicious of them-and the full force of Fox News was giving dealers a spread of made-up reasons to hate EVs even more.\n\n\"There's a lot of resistance,\" Buzz told me, \"because of the compensation plan. We're asking them to make about a quarter of the income they used to make. So there's lots of pushback, especially if they're staunch conservatives.\"\n\nIn other words, even if the dealers' lobby were able to contain the Tesla contagion, legacy-brand EVs sold through dealerships still posed a problem. This was partially because of virtual showrooms-companies were creating their own sales floors online, and setting transparent, no-haggle prices. But more importantly, dealers make the majority of their money on servicing cars and financing them. Actually selling the cars is not that remunerative. State laws give dealers exclusive rights over warranty service, which manufacturers are forced to pay dealers to provide. (Dealers make even more selling semi-pointless add-ons like \"extended warranty\" coverage.) Compared with traditional cars, EVs have far fewer component parts; they don't need constant servicing or oil changes. That means that electric vehicles generate 40 percent less aftermarket revenue. Not to mention, EV technicians are harder to come by and thus more expensive to hire than regular mechanics, which further eats into dealer profit. And because EVs are a new technology, and expensive, buyers tend to be more skeptical about them and slower to pony up the cash to drive off in one, which means more time dedicated to each sale, more time dedicated to learning about what's under the hood, and thus, lower margins for salesmen too. More work, less pay-bad, bad, bad.\n\nBuzz wasn't discouraged by pushback, he assured me, just like he wasn't discouraged after his colleagues at the dealership where he'd worked nicknamed him \"the Socialist.\" But he had, he admitted, retired from sales and taken up blogging. Buzz, I got the sense, was part of the reason some of the official material came with a disclaimer: \"The views and opinions presented in this educational program and any accompanying handout material are those of the speakers and do not necessarily represent the views or opinions of NADA.\"\n\n\"Dealerships are a little bit blinded by the power of their organization and the franchise laws,\" Buzz said. They can lobby all they want, he told me, but in the end, \"it's not gonna work.\"\n\nAll the floor seats at the Nikki Haley event were taken. I clambered into the nosebleeds, and settled in to watch a comedian in pajama pants warm up the crowd. He rattled off an exhaustive list of car names, and had a joke for each one. The big finish: \"If you're in a great marriage, I hope you get a Hummer-not an EV, though. I heard nobody's getting one of them.\" Loud applause.\n\nOut came Danny Renshaw, NADA's committee chairman, to say a few words. \"We're standing on the threshold of a revolution,\" he intoned somberly. A pall fell over the crowd. It was clear that this was not the good kind of revolution.\n\nIn swept some rock music, a headbanging video montage of the year's various lobbying successes. New, unrealistic fuel standards: opposed. State dealer-franchise laws: defended. Tax increases on small businesses: You better believe those were dead as a doornail. There was footage of Republican senator Lindsey Graham, and the front door of the office of his Texas colleague John Cornyn.\n\nThen, more sobering news from outgoing NADA chairman Mike Alford. \"We all feel unsettled,\" he said. \"Let me be blunt: There are reasons for concern.\" But, he said, \"people prefer dealerships. Local dealerships are crushing direct sales. Dealers are truly essential.\" As proof, some dealers were given awards for philanthropic efforts, including for chartering a \"free\" (donation-based) ice cream truck and a Christmas toy drive. Two vehicles were donated to the Dallas Police Department because \"dealers support the enforcement of our laws.\"\n\nAnd there, finally, was Haley. As she crossed the stage, those in the floor seats made a late stab at a standing ovation, but this was not the youngest crowd: The applause had already died down by the time most were firmly on two feet.\n\nHaley rattled off her accomplishments as governor of South Carolina, which included helping drive down statewide unionization rates to the lowest in the country after she courted nonunion auto-factory installations from BMW and Nissan. \"I didn't allow unions in our state. I was a union buster, and that's something I was very adamant about,\" she said. It was, to that point, the biggest clap line of the afternoon. \"Sounds like you were a unifier,\" Alford responded.\n\nShe talked about her time working with Donald Trump, whom she was diligent not to criticize, and her time at the United Nations. (\"I don't know what that is. I just know everyone hates it!\" she claimed she told Trump's then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus when he called to offer her the job.) \"I like her,\" whispered a woman sitting in front of me to the man beside her.\n\nFinally, with 10 minutes to go, the discussion took a turn. \"We're car dealers, we love politics, we're engaged, as you know from your time as governor,\" Alford said. \"What do you think of the field of candidates right now on the GOP side ...\"\n\nJust days prior, CNBC had noted that Haley's staff had been directed to report to South Carolina in anticipation of a presidential run. Her appearance at NADA was likely her last before she announced she would be running for president. The stars seemed aligned for a big reveal.\n\nShe parried the question, talking about the midterms. \"We didn't lose those races because of one person,\" she said. \"Republicans were completely outraised.\" Which, if not exactly true, sure did set the table for a fundraising ask.\n\nAlford tried again. \"Is there any political position you hope to hold someday?\"\n\n\"I've never lost a race; I'm not gonna start now,\" she said, before adding, \"I'm not announcing today.\" She got her standing O in the end. \"Thank you, thank you,\" she said. \"I'm gonna need each and every one of you.\"\n\nOn the sidewalk outside the convention center, I asked Jim and Brooke, attendees who didn't want me to use their last names, what they thought. \"Liked it,\" said Jim. \"She was great,\" said Brooke. I asked if they'd heard enough to support Haley over the rest of the Republican field in 2024. Well, said Jim, \"dealers are very conservative. We gotta see who all's in.\" The support was not resounding.\n\nEven so, a few weeks later, when Haley did announce she was running for president, her campaign video featured a number of talking points rehearsed, verbatim, at the NADA keynote.\n\nHaley didn't address the electric elephant in the room. But the very next day, another conservative luminary, Greg Gutfeld, was not so cautious.\n\nFrom the same nosebleeds, I watched the onetime editor of Men's Health and current aw-shucks libertarian everyman of Fox News careen through a couple of jokes about a car dealer ripping off Nicolas Cage and about his own regrets in car-buying. \"I love cars,\" he decreed, before calling his car \"a pain in the ass\" and admitting, as a resident of New York City, to not really driving much at all. Then he was praising Elon Musk, who, even as he becomes a right-wing hero in some circles, was so villainous 'round these parts I'd barely heard his name whispered all weekend. The full sweep of the monologue seemed almost tailored to offend the target audience. There was grumbling. Even I started to feel bad.\n\nThen, finally, after nine minutes of muted applause and polite laughter, Gutfeld landed one. \"Cars are fun. If you wanna live in a padded cell, if you wanna drive your Prius, that's great. I am all for gas, lots of gas!\" Gutfeld couldn't even finish his sentence over the riotous applause that broke out. He started in on a different joke, then abandoned it midway through to go back to the well. \"Nobody is going to be able to confiscate your gas-powered car, because what's gonna tow it?!\" The audience roared. \"I have not seen an e-tow truck to save my life!\"\n\nThat night, the convention's final evening, had Dionysian promise. Multiple after-parties had been booked with big-name performers. Sugarhill Gang and Nelly were playing one car-company fete; another firm had rented out the House of Blues and locked down Smash Mouth as a headliner. It took some finagling to get on the lists-the spots were reserved for clients, customers, and dealers willing to fork over their contact info and sit through a sales pitch-but I had a dealer's credential.\n\nI entered The Factory, incidentally the name of the venue in Dallas, and dove into a sea of bright-orange cowboy hats festooned with blinking LEDs and bobbing to Sugarhill Gang. The group, which peaked in popularity with the 1979 hit \"Rapper's Delight,\" was midway through a surprisingly macabre set, playing records of songs from friends who'd recently died: \"Gangsta's Paradise\" by Coolio, \"Just a Friend\" by Biz Markie. The Gang rapped a few words over the tracks here and there, but only sporadically. The crowd seemed perfectly delighted all the same. When, finally, the group played \"Rapper's Delight,\" the entire band was perilously winded by the song's final verse.\n\nThe Gang bowed, and departed. Back to the open bar we stampeded. Last year, I heard, Vanilla Ice had performed.\n\nThen came Nelly's hype man: \"Make some noise if you're over 30,\" he bellowed. We obliged; we were. Nelly ran through his greatest hits of the early 2000s: \"Hot in Herre,\" \"Air Force Ones.\" The music of a bygone time, a simpler, better era, when cars weren't sold by direct-to-consumer, the internet barely existed, and prices were negotiable and opaque. The crowd knew all the words. He did a remix of \"Cruise,\" the country song by Florida Georgia Line, which features a whole bunch of car imagery. Everyone loved it. It was the third time I'd heard it that day: once remixed, once covered, and once recorded, played through tinny convention center speakers.\n\nThe previous night, as I'd loitered near various bars at company-sponsored happy hours, parties, and private events, a handful of revelers had admitted to me, in various states of apprehension, that they thought EVs were going to take away everything they had built. But here, no one would tell me they felt the same. They couldn't even hear me ask over the chorus of \" Ay, must be the money!\" A man in an inflatable dinosaur suit bumped into me again and again.\n\nOnce more unto the breach. On the final day of the convention, I hauled myself out of bed for Deion Sanders, the former NFL star turned college football coach. Despite having just blotted the line on a $30 million contract at the University of Colorado, Sanders had booked the 9 a.m. Sunday slot for a motivational number. I thought for sure that attendance would be limited after the night's exuberance, but there everyone was, bright and early, ready for \"the church of Deion.\"\n\nSanders, more polished than his keynote predecessors, hit the right notes of flattery and ideology that the dealers were looking for. He sympathized with the challenges of running a family business dogged by disappointing progeny, and told the crowd that he ranks his kids every month, to combat the malign forces of youth softness. He knew the names of some cars when presented with the obligatory question of what new make he wanted to buy. His atavism came with the weekend's most gloss.\n\n\"We've got a soft country right now!\" he intoned. Everyone cheered. \"We gotta get back to the basics,\" he said. \"You all are providers, leaders, and conduits of change.\" Later: \"We cannot change; we gotta get back to the basics.\"\n\n\"Applaud yourself,\" Sanders instructed, and the dealers did.\n\nBy 10 a.m., I was back on the exhibition floor. I trudged back to the prize wheel and won. I threw the novelty dice and won. A mimosa was pressed into my hand, and then a Budweiser. I was double fisting before 11 a.m., and I was not the only one.\n\nA man with veneers explained to a Colombian bartender how his friend was being hunted by Venezuelans. I walked past another man reporting conspiratorially into his phone that the issue with the kids these days is parents that have become too tolerant. \"The problem,\" he whispered, \"it's us.\" We made wild and inadvertent eye contact. I hurried past the Crypton booth-\"Buy and Sell Cars With Crypto\"-which was fittingly manned by nobody. I took a hat and a T-shirt, and then flowed like runoff through the channels of the exhibition, back to the EV Solutions Center, for one last keynote speech: \"What You Should Know About the New Federal EV Tax Credits.\"\n\nThis, I assumed, could be a major draw-a how-to on tapping the multibillion-dollar vein of public-sector giveaways that was being offered as a buy-off, the free-money lubricant of the EV transition-what, in a simpler, gasoline-powered era, might have been called priming the pump.\n\nBut when Andrew Koblenz, executive vice president of legal and regulatory affairs for all of NADA, took the stage, 6 of the 120 seats were occupied. Three of the six attendees, according to their badges, were event staff. One woman was wearing noise-canceling headphones.\n\nKoblenz faced down the microphone, sighed, and gave an abbreviated presentation. The points were very technical: how to fill out forms for the Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credit, what to know about eligibility requirements for the Section 45W Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit. The floor opened for questions-or, rather, Koblenz asked the one man taking notes if he had anything on his mind. (He did not.)\n\nAfterward, another man in a suit in the audience strode over to me and began his own impromptu presentation. \"This stuff is crazy, what they're saying. It's crazy. Claiming 10 percent of the fleet will be electric by 2030? Never gonna happen. Do you sell EVs?\" I looked sheepishly over at Koblenz, well within earshot.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"They're toys; they're not cars. And there's nothing clean about clean energy-we know that,\" he said.\n\nI told him I was writing about the convention and about the electric vehicle transition.\n\n\"Ask any Tesla owner if they have a second car, and if it's a Tesla,\" he directed me. \"Ask what they take on road trips.\" He told me tales-grim tales-of Ford dealers who, rather than sell EVs and meet the company's requirements for doing so, had instead decided to give up selling Fords of all types altogether. \"I can get you in touch with plenty of dealers who feel that way,\" he said.\n\nSo there it was: Dealers stand between many electric cars and most American car buyers, but they aren't just going to lay down and let some zero-emissions playthings roll them over. Some, I heard over and over, would rather not deal than deal with someone else's dictates.\n\nNever mind that the Environmental Protection Agency was preparing regulation such that two-thirds of all new cars sold by 2032 would be all-electric. Never mind that the Federal Trade Commission had singled out the industry for a crackdown. Dealers had stared down the government before and were making more money than ever. They took hostages-they did not become them. They would self-sabotage if they had to. A recent Sierra Club survey would find that two-thirds of car dealerships did not currently have an EV for sale; almost half of those dealers said they were refusing to offer them. They had 100 years of practice and accumulated power, all leading to this moment. Dealers have the best diesel-powered federal advocacy in the country-and Republican foot soldiers hard at work to ensure that the future will not come.\n\nThe best of Slate, delivered late.\n\nCorrection, May 30, 2023: This piece originally misstated that there are 140,000 millionaires in the U.S. There are more than 5 million millionaires in the U.S., some 140,000 of whom earn more than $1.58 million a year.

Kennedy Jr.'s nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the swing vote on the panel-Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy- posted his support. At 10:30 a.m., Indiana Sen. Todd Young, a key vote on the Intelligence Committee, posted his support of Tulsi Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence. Maine Sen. Susan Collins, another potential swing vote, had thrown Gabbard her support on Monday afternoon. Both of these nominees, long considered the most endangered of the remaining bunch, made it out of committee. Barring a landmark breakthrough in human behavioral studies in the coming days, both will be confirmed to Trump's Cabinet.\n\nThe question was asked when these Cabinet nominees were announced in November, and we rapidly approached the answer on Tuesday morning: There is no such thing as \"the decisive Republican vote against Trump's nominee\" in the United States Senate.\n\nThe hours and minutes before Cassidy's announcement feel like a distant era of since-extinguished mystery.\n\nThe Finance Committee hearing room was packed with reporters, staff, and the public, and it was a more staid group relative to the confirmation hearings' MAHA Mom pep rally . When Chairman Mike Crapo gaveled open the session, one of the only empty chairs in the room was Cassidy's. Eventually, he would enter from the room's antechamber alongside Senate Majority Leader John Thune. Cassidy was largely expressionless, but at one point conferred with several staffers. The conversation ended, one of the staffers nodded across the room, and shortly thereafter, Cassidy's announcement went live on X.\n\n\"I've had very intense conversations with Bobby and the White house over the weekend and even this morning,\" Cassidy's post read. \"I want to thank VP JD specifically for his honest counsel. With the serious commitments I've received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes.\"\n\nMinutes later, the senators voted, approving Kennedy's nomination 14-13, on party lines. GOP Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson-who has said that Kennedy called him when he was considering ending his presidential campaign last year to ask if he could win confirmation as Trump's HHS secretary-shook Cassidy's hand. Cassidy then used his iPad to cover his face from the pool of photographers five feet away as he spoke with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott.\n\nOn the way out, I asked Thune when he learned about how Cassidy would vote. He suppressed a laugh.\n\n\"I'll let him talk about it.\"\n\nCassidy would further explain his vote on an empty Senate floor later Tuesday morning. He said that he personally received hundreds of calls and messages on the subject over the weekend, and that \"diametrically, three-dimensionally, they disagreed.\" He spoke to Kennedy several times over the weekend and into Tuesday morning. His hope, at least, is that Kennedy could be the singular figure who could give \"reassurance\" to the \"many mothers\" that \"the vaccine their child is receiving is necessary, effective, and most of all safe.\" Kennedy and the White House made numerous commitments to Cassidy, he said, such as providing a close working relationship with Cassidy, sticking to \"current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems,\" that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would not remove statements or studies saying that vaccines don't cause autism, and providing 30-day notice to Congress if HHS wants to change vaccine safety monitoring programs.\n\nYoung, meanwhile, didn't even paraphrase Gabbard's \"commitments\" to him-he just posted the letter she wrote to him. In the letter, Gabbard committed to holding accountable leakers from the intelligence community, specifically disowning a 2019 tweet of hers praising Edward Snowden and saying she would \"protect\" such figures. Much of the resistance to Gabbard's nomination, on both sides of the aisle, has been her refusal to call Edward Snowden a \"traitor,\" and in her letter, Gabbard pledged not to recommend clemency for him to the president.\n\nTuesday afternoon, the Intelligence Committee approved Gabbard's nomination by a 9-8 vote, also along party lines.\n\nHow reliable are these commitments from Kennedy and Gabbard? Well, we'll find out, and one suspects we'll find out good and hard . To be generous: It's difficult right now-given the full-scale assault the early Trump administration has taken to the federal government and the showy disrespect it's shown to Congress' authority-to believe that these commitments will in any way restrain either Kennedy or Gabbard from doing what they want to do, and what Trump chose them to do. Indeed, proving that he played these senators is of special interest to Trump and his brand. Less than an hour before the vote, with Cassidy trying to overcome his fears of Kennedy promoting vaccine conspiracy theories, Trump posted a conspiratorial tweet about autism on social media to promote Kennedy's bid. We don't know if Trump plans to pardon Edward Snowden. But the possibility of shaming the many senators who were concerned about it has to be an inducement.\n\nFor senators who think a nominee is a high risk for a Cabinet position, there's an easier way to go about alleviating those fears than by securing \"commitments\": voting against the nominee. But if Cassidy and Young want to continue their Senate careers in solidly red states, that simply isn't an option for them. And while Susan Collins, from a light-blue state, has shown a willingness to cast a floor vote against a nominee with room to spare, even she wasn't comfortable providing the decisive \"no\" vote on committee.\n\nNeither Cassidy nor Young ever endorsed Donald Trump in the 2024 election, and Cassidy has a special target on his back for having voted to convict Trump following his second impeachment, after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. The senator already has a serious primary challenger ready for him in 2026. Young, at least, doesn't have to worry about this until 2028. But MAGA, embodied both in Trump and the movement, would not forget, and would not forgive.\n\nThe only Republicans who have voted against any key nominee so far have been Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who have moderate coalitions to satisfy with votes here and there, and Mitch McConnell, who's gone YOLO in his final two years in office. No one, though, has shown the willingness to be that decisive vote to nix a Trump nomination in committee, or to be the decisive fourth vote to do so on the full Senate floor. Don't expect that figure to materialize.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Mitch McConnell Could Have Stopped This\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nIt's a toss-up which is more pathetic: that just one Republican senator opposed the confirmation of Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence or that the GOP's lone naysayer was Mitch McConnell.\n\nNow 82, in his seventh term, McConnell was a dominating force and shrewd tactician in the 18 years that he ruled as the party's Senate leader (longer than any party leader in U.S. history). When he stepped down this year from his vaunted position, McConnell chose to become chairman of the Rules Committee and of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee-suggesting an intent to retain a good deal of power.\n\nYet in the Gabbard vote on Wednesday, he showed himself unable to sway a single colleague to his side. The same was true late last month, when McConnell was one of three Republicans to oppose Pete Hegseth's confirmation as secretary of defense, forcing Vice President J.D. Vance to break the 50-50 tie. Had the former leader pressured just one more Republican to step up and be sensible, he could have blocked a manifestly unqualified nominee from taking the Pentagon's helm.\n\nThe larger story in all this, of course, is that today's Republican Party is very different from the GOP of even a few years ago, not least in the sense that Donald Trump leads it with an iron fist, the likes of which hasn't been seen in American politics since Lyndon Johnson's time 60 years ago, if then.\n\nYet McConnell could have blocked Trump's reascension to the White House-and so, in that sense, his political enfeeblement is largely of his own making. In February 2021, when the Senate took up Trump's second impeachment, McConnell delivered one of the most blazing speeches against the man, calling him \" practically and morally responsible for provoking \" the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, adding, \"This was an intensifying crescendo of conspiracy theories orchestrated by an outgoing president who seemed determined to either overturn the voters' decision or else torch our institutions on the way out.\"\n\nIt is often forgotten that a majority of senators- 57 in all, including seven Republicans -voted to convict Trump. But 67 votes were needed to do the deed. The tragedy here (and it's worth wondering whether McConnell now regrets his decision) is that McConnell voted not to convict. Had he voted the way he clearly felt, his aye would have made for 58, and, as the party's leader, he probably could have twisted nine more arms to make it 67.\n\nHad 67 senators voted to convict, Trump would have been legally barred from running for president again. He would not be president now. No matter who might be in the Oval Office instead, it is a sure bet that Tulsi Gabbard would not be director of national intelligence and Pete Hegseth would not be secretary of defense, to mention only a couple of risible improbabilities that Trump has willed into being.\n\nBut McConnell said at the time that Congress shouldn't impeach a former president. (Trump had left office, and Joe Biden had been sworn in, by the time the Senate debated the measure.) Trump's crimes, he said, should instead be taken up by the Justice Department and the courts.\n\nThe fact that this didn't happen is also, to a large extent, McConnell's fault. Back in 2016, as Senate majority leader, McConnell had blocked Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to be a Supreme Court justice, from getting a committee hearing, much less a floor vote. Afterward, the leader proudly hailed his obstruction as \" the most consequential thing I've ever done .\"\n\nIndeed it was, in ways expected and unexpected. Not only did his move shift the balance of the court, it also piled more momentum onto McConnell's political downfall. For, as a consolation prize, President Biden made Garland his attorney general, and Garland turned out to be woefully incompetent at that job. His Justice Department took so long to piece together a prosecution against Trump for his criminal attempts to overturn the 2020 election that by the time a case was nearly ready, it was too late .\n\nIf Trump had been properly tried, he may well have been convicted. And while a felony conviction doesn't automatically bar a citizen from the White House, a conviction on this set of charges might have turned more voters against Trump than did the other 34 guilty verdicts stemming from his attempt to influence the election through payoffs to a porn actor.\n\nWhen McConnell decided to oppose conviction, Trump was facing a bevy of trials, civil and criminal. The senator probably figured that the ex-president's political career was over. He figured wrong.\n\nThe loss McConnell must be feeling now is not just one of political power. It's also one affecting his sense-and he's not alone in this-of what the United States is about.\n\nGabbard believes that Edward Snowden should be pardoned; at her confirmation hearing, she declined to call him a traitor or even to acknowledge that his leaks damaged national security. (Most of his leaks had nothing to do with the National Security Agency's violations of American citizens' privacy.) She also opposes Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows collection of communications made by suspected foreign agents and terrorists. She believes the discredited views of an MIT professor , over the unanimous conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies, about former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons against his own people. She parrots Vladimir Putin's pronouncements that he invaded Ukraine over legitimate concerns about NATO expansion.\n\nWhatever your views about these matters, they are anathema to U.S. and allied intelligence officials. Yet as the official who coordinates all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies and who has access to all of their secrets, she must earn the confidence of those who share their files and analyses. She also prepares the president's daily intelligence briefing, meaning that she funnels all this intelligence through her frame of mind-and what she knows the president wants to hear. (There will be no \"speaking truth to power\" from her quarter; that wasn't why she was put in the position.)\n\nA few Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee expressed grave concerns about Gabbard's views. (To her credit, in a way, she stuck to her positions; she didn't claim that she had changed her mind or had been taken out of context.) Yet they all wound up voting for her.\n\nIn some ways, Hegseth must have struck McConnell as an even more appalling choice. At least Gabbard will be merely coordinating intelligence agencies; she won't be running agents or conducting analyses. Hegseth actually will be the top civilian leader of a department with 3.5 million employees and a budget approaching $1 trillion. Yet he's never run an organization with more than 100 people, and allegedly mismanaged that; his military experience doesn't extend beyond that of a major in the National Guard; and in a recent report, he said that the U.S. is no longer \" primarily focused \" on the security of Europe, including Ukraine.\n\nMcConnell has long been a stalwart advocate not only of continued funding for Ukraine but also of treating European security as very much a primary focus for the United States. In this sense, McConnell has more in common with Biden and Obama-for whom he might now be feeling uneasy pangs of nostalgia-than with his fellow Republicans.\n\nBut feel no pity for Mitch McConnell, not even when he casts his vote against Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., perhaps recalling, as he does so, his own childhood bout of polio, and quaking with disgust that an anti-vaxxer-a reckless conspiracy theorist who once claimed that the polio vaccine had killed many more people than the disease it eliminated-is on the verge of taking over the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nMcConnell made his own bed. He is to blame, as much as anyone, for the calamities facing us all.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Effort to Suppress the Vote Is Spreading to the Republican Mainstream\n\nIt's bad enough when a trio of voter suppression groups led by charlatans gets together at an annual secret conference that is sponsored, in part, by a group created by the Federalist Society's Leonard Leo to talk about all the ways they might make it harder for people to register or vote in future elections. But it is much worse when the participants in that secret conference also include secretaries of state and other top election officials from 13 Republican-led states, plus Don Palmer, a member of the United States Election Assistance Commission, plus counsels to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and the House Administration Committee's Republican staff, and a sitting Texas state senator. The entire conference-whose existence was revealed in a blockbuster report by the Guardian and Documented last week-shows that there is a thriving network of interlocking organizations working with elected and election officials to use unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud to try to mess with fair elections for partisan advantage.\n\nIt is understandable if this particular report flew below the radar for you. We are all living in Steve Bannon's Trumpian dreamworld in which \"flooding the zone with shit\" has become a remarkably successful political tactic. From the past week's stories of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas failing to report lavish free vacations, including a $500,000 jaunt on a private plane, to a bonkers anti-abortion ruling from a Texas judge that bans an abortion drug and lays the groundwork for recognizing a fetus as a human being entitled to full constitutional protection, to the expulsion of two Black state legislators from the Tennessee Legislature because they had the temerity to protest gun violence fueled by a Supreme Court stuck in the 1790s to-yes-more mass shootings, it is too easy to be distracted. But that doesn't change the fact that there are people meeting, behind closed doors, to plot out new paths to voter suppression, with direct implications for the type of democracy that we may have in the United States in 2024 and beyond.\n\nIn some ways, this everything-everywhere-all-at-once vibe is simply, well, everywhere : Dark money donors capture the courts and the levers of government to make actual vote tallies irrelevant to who holds power. This story didn't start in Tennessee or the Amarillo district court. For nearly two decades, we have been chronicling the actions of members of the Fraudulent Fraud Squad who have been active in perpetuating claims of voter fraud to make it harder for people to vote. Members include people like Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation and J. Christian Adams of the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF), who have long lied or exaggerated claims of pervasive election fraud to support their efforts to crack down on normal voting.\n\nThese hucksters have been at this for a long time. Von Spakovsky, for instance, served with Adams and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach on former President Donald Trump's aborted Voter Fraud Commission. Documents from that commission later revealed a purposeful effort to generate enough smoke around nonexistent election shenanigans to cajole Congress into allowing states to require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote. In other words, the commission was an elaborate search for a solution to a problem that never existed, but it made a play that has since been repeated elsewhere. Kobach tried to enforce just such a law in Kansas before a court found it illegal; it had already stopped about 30,000 people from successfully registering to vote at that point. But despite losing in courts, facing sanctions, and having their blue-ribbon commission debunked and disbanded, these zombies searching for a reason to make voting harder never fail to reemerge whenever there is someone someplace seeking to toss an election result for partisan gain. Arizona, of course, is trying to put in place the same discredited system of \"show us your papers\" voter registration that the courts roundly rejected in Kansas.\n\nAll of this voter suppression requires an infrastructure. To help support it, Heritage and PILF have teamed up with Leonard Leo's Orwellian-named \"Honest Elections Project \" (HEP), headed by Jason Snead, to run a new conference for election officials and the representatives of Republican lawmakers. Leo, lest we forget, has been in charge of reshaping the federal courts , selecting Donald Trump's judicial nominees, and figuring out how best to spend gobs of billionaire-donated money to reshape culture and democracy . The chillingly dishonest HEP not only supports these efforts to make voting harder but also the \"independent state legislature theory,\" which suggests that state legislatures should be able to pass whatever laws they like for running federal elections, unconstrained by state constitutions protecting the right to vote and state supreme courts that enforce the right. They even filed a brief to the Supreme Court favoring it.\n\nWhat's clear from the new reporting, and what may have flown somewhat under the radar last week, is that this is no longer just a lobbying effort shored up with big, often untraceable money, coming from players outside the system. What's no longer hidden is the involvement of lawmakers and their staffs, who say the quiet parts out loud. Their enthusiastic participation in these efforts shows that these groups are not offering false and exaggerated claims of voter fraud merely to raise funds or even to delegitimize Democratic electoral victories by convincing the Republican base that when Democrats win elections, it is inevitably by fraud. Instead, the conference is powerful evidence of coordination between the decades-old voter fraud-industrial complex and state and government officials who actually have the power to make rules over how elections are run. To put it in the simplest terms, the election suppression noises are truly coming from inside the house.\n\nParticipants at the conference no doubt learned the lesson we all gleaned from the aftermath of the 2020 election: No matter how much proof investigators, courts, and journalists amass to show that voter fraud is rare and almost never swings American elections, significant portions of the Republican base will always believe the false claims. Indeed, the more evidence they hear that there is no such thing as large-scale Election Day vote fraud, the more it leads them to distrust the investigators, courts, and journalists who attempt to debunk them. Those false claims then serve as the predicate to pass yet more laws intended to make it ever harder to vote for some voters who are seen as likely to vote for Democrats-including poor voters, minority voters, and students. Never mind that sometimes these laws deter Republican voters and could actually cost Republicans elections. The important thing is to puff up the lie in order to justify draconian state legislative responses. And the participation of state entities that once took pride in serving as nonpartisan officials who sought only to administer elections fairly and efficiently prove that it is becoming vanishingly rare for election officials in the Republican Party to distance themselves from whatever formulation of the Big Lie best serves them, whether they personally believe it or not.\n\nFinally, the very existence of this conference also highlights the coming together of the fringe elements of the Republican party with its allegedly saner mainstream. As the Guardian noted, on PILF's board sits attorney Cleta Mitchell, who was deeply involved in Donald Trump's efforts to reverse the results of the 2020 election in Georgia and elsewhere , based upon ridiculous and unproven claims of voter fraud. Sober election officials should be running away from organizations in which Mitchell and her ilk are involved. The choice to embrace them, and in so doing to help rehabilitate them, is to invite repeat performances of Jan. 6, 2021, in the future.\n\nWhen the fringe gets to meet with top election and elected officials and their representatives, these ideas enter the Republican mainstream. They also lay the groundwork for future unwarranted voting crackdowns. One can speculate whether serious state actors are unaware that they are playing with fire by asking \"hard questions\" about how to deal with the nonexistent problem of massive voter fraud. But convenings such as this one suggest that they are willing and even eager to use whatever means are at their disposal to both foment national mistrust in future election contests and also to weaponize that mistrust into partisan election-suppression efforts to come.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Low-Key Republican Officials Quietly Dismantling All of Our Rights\n\nOne of the greatest destabilizers of democracy that almost nobody knows about is a little tax-exempt group called RAGA , which stands for the Republican Attorneys General Association. It represents more than half the states' chief legal officers, and its members are on the front lines of pretty much every single important legal movement in the country. Its moves and funding are directed, of course, by everyone's favorite little Monopoly Man Money Guy, Leonard Leo. Yet the group receives almost no sustained public attention or accountability. Recently, Heidi Przybyla at Politico reported on how RAGA tried to run a D.C. official who had dared investigate Leo out of office. And once you actually train your focus on RAGA, they tend to pop up everywhere, over and over again. The group was behind amicus briefs in the outrageous social media case Murthy v. Missouri. They are driving the efforts to get around federal emergency treatment laws for abortion in the forthcoming EMTALA cases. They're pushing for Texas-style S.B. 4 legislation in several states. And that doesn't even get you to the whole raft of RAGA interventions when it came to trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nOn this week's Amicus podcast , Dahlia Lithwick spoke with Lisa Graves, founder and executive director of True North Research, to try to shine a light on an obscure group that works hand in glove with Leo and dark-money interests to stymie democracy and roll back environmental protections, civil rights, reproductive rights, and other freedoms for the very citizens they are elected to serve. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nTo listen to the full episode of Amicus, join Slate Plus .\n\nDahlia Lithwick: Attorneys general were once kind of nonpartisan. They were apt to work across political lines, for the interests of the residents of the state.\n\nLisa Graves: All state attorneys general once belonged to the National Association of Attorneys General, NAAG, and it was a bipartisan group, a group of all the state attorneys general conferring about the practices in their state and cases that transcend jurisdiction.\n\nThere was a significant set of lawsuits in the 1990s around tobacco because there had been a long-standing effort by the tobacco industry to deny the carcinogenic effects of smoking, despite the fact that the tobacco companies knew full well that their products did cause cancer. In fact, one of the things that had a fundamentally disruptive effect on U.S. law and policy in the past 50 years is that a then-tobacco lawyer named Lewis Powell wrote something called the Powell Memo to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, circa 1971. This was in response to a decade of environmental regulation to protect against rivers that were on fire, and smoke stacks, and pollution, in addition to efforts to try to regulate smoking. And so the tobacco lawyer, Lewis Powell, wrote a memo basically saying businesses need to get more involved in policy, and lobbying, and universities in order to change our laws to benefit corporations. He was rewarded shortly after with an appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, and so that's 1971.\n\nFast forward to 1991. Finally, there is concerted effort by attorneys general across the country to hold the tobacco industry liable for the consequences to people's lives, but also to our health care system. As that was ongoing, the Republican attorneys general decided to create their own attorney general association to pursue their own agenda and actually raise money from industries that they were supposed to regulate in order to fund this operation, which was designed to fuel their campaigns. The history is deeply embedded in antipathy to public regulation, government regulation of industries that have literally killed thousands, if not millions, of Americans in the form of the tobacco industry, for example.\n\nThere's the Leonard Leo piece in the middle of this, which is also just incredibly familiar, and this is your job, follow the money. So help us understand who's paying to play and who are they paying?\n\nLeonard Leo's network is the largest funder of RAGA. There are corporations that have funded RAGA, Koch Industries, tobacco companies, energy companies . And some of my research about Leonard Leo showed that there's this group called the Judicial Education Project-and it is now known as the 85 Fund because these names are all disposable names for them. But back then it was called the Judicial Education Project, and we'd been looking into it in part because it's the group that Leonard Leo used to pay Ginni Thomas secretly through Kellyanne Conway's firm from a secret donor. That was after Harlan Crow staked Ginni Thomas with $500,000 to fund her group , Liberty Central, while the Citizens United decision was pending.\n\nAnd what you see is this group that was deployed to basically pay Ginni Thomas secretly, starts filing amicus briefs, and it notes in its filing that it's paying particular attention to the potential of the state of West Virginia to have a new attorney general, who became the attorney general who was basically deployed to attack the Clean Power Plan: Patrick Morrisey. So, here's a group that is intimately tied to Leonard Leo's operation. It's the group he trusts to get the money into the hands of Ginni Thomas, the wife of a sitting Supreme Court justice. It's a group focusing on the election of a particular attorney general investigating what the powers of the attorney general of West Virginia might be. And then Morrisey gets elected and he becomes the tip of the spear in attacking the effort by the Obama administration to write reasonable rules about power plants.\n\nFast forward eight years, and suddenly in 2022, just as the court is destroying Roe that same term, it's saying you can regulate basically women's bodies, but you can't regulate corporations to force utilities to at least put some of their money into renewable energy under the Clean Power Plan.\n\nIt is really full circle. It is a sort of surround sound in terms of their intention and their focus. It does show how long this plan is in place before its major victories.\n\nWe sometimes think that Leonard Leo to the Supreme Court is a one-way vector. But it is in fact a triangle, right? Because the third vector is to the state AGs who are bringing these cases, who are as much a part of this deregulatory agenda and this anti-choice agenda, and the anti-LGBTQ+ agenda as the court itself. The other thing is this is a move so disaggregated from state welfare and state politics. We're now doing just straight up partisan Republican Party politics, and that turn is really evident in terms of RAGA's participation in the events of Jan. 6.\n\nSo RAGA had an arm called the Rule of Law Defense Fund, deployed to do robocalls, to urge people to go to the Jan. 6 events that Trump said would be wild, to go there on the day that Congress was supposed to be certifying the election, as he was mounting this intimidation campaign against [Vice President Mike] Pence, unleashing his followers to assail him. And this is in the context of weeks of efforts by Trump and his lawyers and advisers. trying to help him execute a coup. You had the state attorneys general actively involved in some of this litigation to try to stop other states from certifying the election. The group itself through this Rule of Law Defense Fund was actively involved in peddling the big lucrative lie about the election to push people to go to the mall on Jan. 6. There was sort of shock and horror that a group of state attorneys general would be involved in trying to aid the precursor events to the violent insurrection at the Capitol. And big companies said they weren't going to fund RAGA. And so for a moment there, there was a bright light shining on RAGA and on the events around the capital and these AGs.\n\nBut then months later, some of those companies came back to fund RAGA . The accountability light was on and then off for the companies that were funding RAGA in 2020. In addition to Leonard Leo's network, Koch Industries, Comcast, Walmart, Home Depot, Amazon, TikTok, 1-800-CONTACTS, Chevron, the National Rifle Association, Monsanto, Facebook, Fox, Uber, Coca-Cola, Exxon, and Google were some of the main funders of it.\n\nOf course it didn't last. Leonard Leo continues to be the biggest subsidizer of RAGA through the money that is coming through his network, but it's also the case that they're facing no consequences, basically allowing them to just get away with it. There's been no consequence for them, and the Rule of Law Defense Fund still exists. RAGA still exists, and many of these attorneys general have been actively involved in other efforts that make it harder for Americans to vote, and they may well be involved this fall in a repeat of 2020 in terms of their efforts to protect Trump at any cost.\n\nTexas AG Ken Paxton, the mayor of RAGA Town, brings this emergency motion to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2021 trying to set aside the vote in four other states Biden had won. We had 17 Republican attorneys general sign on to that brief. This is an election that the actual United States attorney general, Bill Barr, had repeatedly said there's no fraud there. These guys knew better and got in on the action of pressuring the court. Fast forward, these same RAGA actors are somehow neck deep in the Trump immunity suit at the Supreme Court now.\n\nThey have continued to attack our democracy in a variety of ways. This notion that Trump has some sort of unlimited immunity, or this very broad conception of immunity, and it goes back to this notion that they claim to be adherents to the rule of law, and yet the immunity case reveals the lie of that. If the rule of law means anything, it means a president is not above the law.\n\nClearly all those puff pieces from the winter about the great distance between Leo's agenda and Donald Trump's and how there was one time when they wouldn't make eye contact at Mar-a-Lago ... These are Leonard Leo's foot soldiers who are presumably all in for MAGA, for Project 2025, for whatever the Heritage Foundation is doing. There's no distance to be found between Leonard Leo's project and RAGA's project and Donald Trump's project should he win in 2024?\n\nThere is no distance on the real policy, this agenda to use the Supreme Court to strip us of our rights, to use the court to make it harder for us to deal with climate change, to use the court to roll back reproductive rights, gay marriage, and more. These are all part and parcel of Leo's agenda and these attorneys general are on that agenda. And Trump, he's the author of that by basically deferring to Leo in who gets on the Supreme Court. One of the things that was happening in the past decade was that we know that Barry Seid, who's the Chicago billionaire who ultimately gave Leo control of a $1.6 billion trust fund to deploy at his will, was also secretly funding briefs by RAGA.\n\nWe helped document that in 2020 during the Amy Coney Barrett hearings, the Bradley Foundation was funneling some of that money toward briefs, not just by Republican attorneys general, but by Republican senators sitting on the judiciary committee and ultimately in 2020, after Leo gets somehow dramatically richer. So you have Leo himself and the people around Leo getting a lot of money from people who were interested in what they were doing to the courts. Leonard Leo doesn't need to be friendly with Donald Trump anymore. He's got what he wanted. He has a court that has six Republican appointees on it with a reliable vote, in essence, for his long-term agenda and that court could remain in power for 20 to 30 years. He has captured the U.S. Supreme Court. He doesn't need to be buddies with Donald Trump.\n\nLast week the court heard the mifepristone case. EMTALA is the other abortion case that's coming next month at the court. RAGA's sticky little fingers are all over EMTALA too.\n\nSome of these state attorneys general are involved in amicus briefs in this case, and you have a person who is now the attorney general for Idaho, who has spearheaded that effort. His name is Raúl Labrador. He was formally part of the Freedom Caucus when he was in Congress. He was picked to take over the state AG role in Idaho over a Republican who maybe was not playing enough ball with the powers that be. He decided after Dobbs that he was going to be imposing his personal views against abortion as a matter of law, as the attorney general. So the attorney general of Idaho, who is a lawyer who has lawyers who work for the state of Idaho, decided he was going to use Idaho taxpayer dollars to hire the Alliance Defending Freedom to defend the state of Idaho in its efforts to not comply with the federal regulations under EMTALA, which tells hospitals not to turn people away who need care. In this instance, this regulation has been extended by the Biden administration in response to Dobbs to make sure that pregnant people who present themselves in an ER have a right to have their health protected.\n\nAnd Idaho has a law on the books that bars abortion except if someone's life is in danger, and that has been sort of interpreted to be at the brink of death. EMTALA says you don't have to wait to the brink of death to give someone an abortion. But Idaho doesn't want to apply that law and has sought out, with the help of Erin Hawley and Alliance Defending Freedom, to take that case to the U.S. Supreme Court. It really pierces through the rhetoric that these people care about the health of women. Because these people like Raúl Labrador believe that their personal view on abortion as embodied in the law of Idaho should only allow someone to get an abortion if they're at the brink of death.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Republican National Convention Suddenly Has an Unprecedented Task\n\nThe Republican National Convention was set to be pretty straightforward this year.\n\nDonald Trump had become his party's undisputed leader, without the in-party doubters of previous runs. Even those Republicans who pointedly went for years without speaking to Trump were set to use this convention to project unity behind their nominee . This year, it was the Democrats who had been melting down over their presumed nominee-so much so that Trump, with an unnatural reservedness, had receded to the background to give them the space they needed to destroy themselves.\n\nThen, late Saturday afternoon, a bullet fired from a rooftop outside Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazed the ex-president and came about an inch away from taking his life.\n\nThe assassination attempt against Trump, which left one rally attendee dead and another seriously injured, is a shocking moment in history that, even a day later, is still hard to fully wrap one's head around. The image of Trump reaching for his right ear, hitting the deck, and emerging, bloody and disoriented, from a protective layer of Secret Service to raise his fist and repeatedly scream \"FIGHT!\" is one of the most stunning visuals I've ever seen. It will reverberate through American politics, in ways that are hard to predict, for days, months, years.\n\nFor the moment, the presidential campaign is in a holding pattern as the principals of U.S. politics cease hostilities. President Joe Biden gave brief remarks Saturday night condemning the act and cut short his weekend in Delaware; he also was able to speak on the phone with \"Donald,\" as he called him, Saturday night. His campaign has pulled its ads. Former Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton, along with congressional leaders of both parties, issued statements offering their sympathies to Trump and his family. Trump's first posts since the incident have eschewed any calls for vengeance or retribution, instead offering thanks to law enforcement and to those who have reached out.\n\n\"In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win,\" Trump posted Sunday morning . \"I truly love our Country, and love you all, and look forward to speaking to our Great Nation this week from Wisconsin.\" He would be arriving in Wisconsin Sunday afternoon as planned.\n\nNow Trump will be entering the RNC not just the race's polling leader or its certain favorite-even, arguably, the clearest Republican favorite to win a presidential election, at this point in the cycle, of any Republican in the 21 st century. His stance, heading into the week, is one of a survivor of deadly political violence. The most recent presidential assassination attempt in the U.S. was made on Ronald Reagan in 1981. In other words, Democratic infighting will not be the biggest story of the week.\n\nHow the RNC will change, both from a security standpoint and in regard to its programming, is still an open question-and has likely been the subject of a great many conference calls involving the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign. Trump's campaign co-managers, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, did release a memo to staff noting that they were enhancing security for the campaign and calling on staffers to \"recognize the political polarization in his heated election.\"\n\n\"Please do not comment publicly on the occurrence of today,\" they wrote. \"We condemn all forms of violence, and will not tolerate dangerous rhetoric on social media.\" (LaCivita himself had stumbled on this front in the shooting's aftermath with an incendiary tweet. He deleted it .)\n\n\"The RNC Convention will continue as planned in Milwaukee,\" Wiles and LaCivita wrote in their memo, \"where we will nominate our President to be the brave and fearless nominee of our Party.\"\n\nThe convention \"as planned\" featured themes for each day. Monday would be \"Make America Wealthy Once Again\"; Tuesday is \"Make America Safe Once Again\"; Wednesday is \"Make America Strong Once Again\"; and Thursday-you get one guess-is \"Make America Great Once Again.\" Adherence to themes, though, is only as strong as the planned speakers' willingness to adhere to them, so expect similar themes around crime, the border, deregulation, tax cuts, and China to be hammered home each day. The only difference now is how Trump's near-death experience is worked into previously drafted speeches, themes, scheduling, production, lighting-everything. And to what extent it's used as a cudgel. Partisan politics won't be on hiatus for long.\n\nWe'll also soon learn the answer to one of the biggest remaining questions of the campaign: Who will be Trump's running mate?\n\nEach of the leading contenders-Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin-has been given a speaking slot at the convention. (And if you'd like to keep a dark horse in mind, it's worth observing that the runner-up to Trump in the primary, Nikki Haley, will reportedly be speaking at the convention after all.) According to reports, Trump had been mulling a reality show-style reveal of his pick at the convention on Monday night, should the campaign be able to keep the name under wraps until then. Whether the shock of the assassination attempt mitigates Trump's otherwise insatiable appetite for elaborate television reveals remains to be seen. Perhaps the campaign will just send out an email.\n\nA convention is more than just speeches, running-mate announcements, a roll call of delegates, and the ratification of a platform that, for all the work and negotiating that is put into it, goes on to collect dust. A convention is a takeover of a major American city by people who seek salvation in politics. It's prayer breakfasts, protests, traffic, fundraisers, live music, watch parties, overeating, undereating, adrenaline, and alcohol. This RNC in particular was lined up to be a pure celebration for Republicans at having unequivocally obtained the upper hand ahead of November's election. Beyond the selection of a VP, there weren't any pressing questions to be answered, a contrast in itself to the many that Democrats would have to answer by the end of their convention in August.\n\nWell, there's a question for the RNC now: How does a party, all gathered together, digest the near killing of its leader?\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Republican Party is less white than ever. Thank Donald Trump.\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThis is how Donald Trump made inroads with voters of color ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nIs Donald Trump on track to win a historic share of voters of color in November's presidential election?\n\nOn the surface, it's one of the most confounding questions of the Trump years in American politics. Trump - and the Republican Party in his thrall - has embraced anti-immigrant policies and proposals, peddled racist stereotypes, and demonized immigrants. So why does it look like he might win over and hold the support of greater numbers of nonwhite voters than the Republican Party of years past?\n\nIn poll after poll, he's hitting or exceeding the levels of support he received in 2020 from Latino and Hispanic voters. He's primed to make inroads among Asian American voters, whose Democratic loyalty has gradually been declining over the last few election cycles. And the numbers he's posting with Black voters suggest the largest racial realignment in an election since the signing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964.\n\nThere are a plethora of explanations for this shift, but first, some points of clarification. The pro-Trump shift is concentrated among Hispanic and Latino voters, though it has appeared to be spreading to parts of the Black and Asian American electorate.\n\nSecond, things have changed since Vice President Kamala Harris took over the Democratic ticket in late July. Polling confirms that Harris has posted significant improvements among nonwhite voters, young voters, Democrats, and suburban voters. In other words, Harris has managed to revive the party's standing with its base, suggesting that a part of Trump's gains were due to unique problems that Biden had with these groups of voters. Thus, it's not entirely clear to what extent this great racial realignment, as some have described the Trump-era phenomenon, will manifest itself in November.\n\nStill, Democrats aren't in the clear. That same polling suggests that, despite Harris's improvements, she is still underperforming both Biden's support at this point in the 2020 polls and the margins of victory Biden ended up winning on Election Day. These numbers, especially the results among Latino and Hispanic voters, should be worrisome to Democrats: Biden did rather poorly among Latino voters relative to other candidates from the current century, resulting in Trump posting numbers not seen by a Republican since George W. Bush ran for reelection in 2004, and Harris could perform even more poorly.\n\nWhy? Putting aside environmental factors and shifts in the American electorate that are happening independent of the candidates, there are a few theories to explain how Trump has uniquely weakened political polarization along the lines of race and ethnicity.\n\n1) Trump has successfully associated himself with a message of economic nostalgia, heightening nonwhite Americans' memories of the pre-Covid economy in contrast to the period of inflation we're now exiting.\n\n2) Trump and his campaign have also zeroed in specifically on outreach and messaging to nonwhite men as part of their larger focus on appealing to male voters.\n\n3) Trump and his party have taken advantage of a confluence of social factors, including messaging on immigration and cultural issues, to shore up support from conservative voters of color who have traditionally voted for Democrats or not voted at all.\n\nTrump's loudest message - the one that gets the most headlines - is his bombastic attacks on immigrants and his pledge to conduct mass deportations. His most successful appeal to voters, though, which he has held on to despite an improving economy under Biden, is economic. Trump claims to have presided over a time of broad and magnificent prosperity, arguing that there was a Trump economic renaissance before Biden bungled it.\n\nThat pitch doesn't comport with reality, but it may be resonating with voters who disproportionately prioritize economic concerns in casting their votes, particularly Latino and Asian American voters.\n\nPolling suggests that voters at large remember the Trump-era economy fondly and view Trump's policies more favorably than Biden's. Black and Latino voters in particular may have more negative memories about Biden and Democrats' economic stewardship because they experienced worse rates of inflation than white Americans and Asian Americans did during 2021 and 2022.\n\nThose memories came up constantly on a recent Black Voters for Trump voter outreach swing this September through predominantly Black neighborhoods in Philadelphia.\n\n\"We have got to get somebody in the White House that has been there, knows our economy, knows what a bad economy looks like, and will get us where we need to go,\" Signa Griffin, who described herself as a Black Trump supporter living in Philadelphia, told me.\n\nSharita White, another Black voter planning to support Trump, said not enough people want to admit how much better life was when Trump was president. \"They talk so bad about him, but they forgot what happened,\" she said. \"I don't know too much about politics, but the only thing I know, my income changed, and if I need that man to get in here to fix my income, I'm all down.\"\n\nPolling suggests Hispanic and Asian American voters are feeling economic concerns especially keenly, and Hispanic voters in particular seem primed for an economic pitch from Trump: More than half said they trusted Trump over Biden to \"make good decisions about economic policy,\" according to research conducted by the Pew Research Center this summer. It was the topic on which Trump had the biggest advantage.\n\nOf course, Trump has long inflated his economic record and conveniently ignores the economic devastation he presided over during the Covid-19 pandemic and recession. That deflection provides an additional point that further complicates the blame Biden has received on the economy. Presidents, in general, have limited ability to control the economy (or inflation) , given the independence of the Federal Reserve and how interconnected our economy is with the world at large. But sour perceptions still helped drag down Biden's approval rating and electoral support as a candidate.\n\nAnd it hasn't stopped Trump from making a big deal about the opportunities his administration secured for minority-owned small businesses - he talks about cutting regulations, providing emergency assistance during the pandemic, and keeping unemployment low.\n\nAll of this resonates with Hispanic and Asian American communities, James Zarsadiaz, a professor of history and researcher on conservatism at the University of San Francisco, told me. \"As [these entrepreneurs] feel the punch of inflation, fees, taxes to run a business in very expensive metro areas, the GOP is starting to look more attractive to them again because they're seen as the party on the side of the small-business owner, as opposed to the Democrats who are seen as the party of protecting workers.\"\n\nOnce again, things have changed since Harris became the nominee, and polls specifically focusing on economic sentiment have tracked an improving national mood and growing trust in Harris's ability to handle economic issues. But Trump is still benefiting from a sense of nostalgia and has tried his best to tie Harris to Biden's economic record, asking voters routinely if they are better off today than they were four years ago.\n\nThe political realignment of women voters has been one of the major stories of 2024; the gender gap in American politics exploded in 2016, took a break in 2020, and seems like it's about to be historic in 2024, with a huge pro-Democrat shift among women. At the same time, though, the rightward drift of men, including men of color, is a quiet undercurrent that may end up explaining what happened if Trump wins in November.\n\nPlenty of theories have been raised in the past about what kind of appeal Trump might have specifically to men and to men of color: Does his businessman persona resonate with upwardly mobile, financially aspirational men? Is there a \" macho \" appeal there for Hispanic men? Could his gritty, outsider, everyman posturing and brash rhetoric resonate with Black and Latino men, particularly those living in traditionally Democratic cities?\n\nAll of those could play a factor, but more significantly, pre-Harris, Trump's campaign and allies doubled down on reaching out to men , especially men of color , as part of an effort to exploit the growing gender gap and fuel disillusionment with Democrats.\n\nIt's the \"Jamal and Enrique\" strategy that the Trump campaign appears to believe in, that \"for every Karen we lose, we're going to win a Jamal and an Enrique,\" as Trump allies explained it to the Atlantic's Tim Alberta in July . That includes speaking to, campaigning with, and getting endorsements from TikTok stars , sports personalities , and popular Black and Latin musicians who have large young male audiences.\n\nIntentionally or otherwise, this strategy could exacerbate movement by traditionally Democratic constituencies that were already slipping. Among young Black , Asian American , and Latino men, loyalty to the Democratic Party has faded. Younger Latinos in general are more likely than older Latinos to identify as independents , and younger Latino men have tended to support Republican candidates at higher rates than young Latinas. An example: A Brookings analysis of the 2022 midterms found Latinos under the age of 30 \"supported Republican candidates for Congress (40%) at nearly double the rate of young Latinas (21%).\" And Pew Research has routinely found that younger Black men are more likely to identify as Republicans than older Black men .\n\nTrump and the GOP may also have found the right social issues to emphasize and campaign on in order to exploit some of the cultural divides between conservative and moderate nonwhite voters, and liberal white voters who also make up part of the Democratic base (in addition to liberal nonwhite voters). In 2021 and 2022, that looked like fearmongering on gender identity and crime, playing up concerns over affirmative action, and campaigning on the overturning of Roe v Wade.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, the Trump focus has shifted strongly toward immigration, an issue that has divided the Democratic coalition as hostility toward immigration has grown. That's true even for Latino and Hispanic voters - long seen as being the voting group most amenable to a pro-immigrant, Democratic message - and it's being used as a wedge issue by Republicans among Black voters as well.\n\nThough it was seen as a gaffe, Trump's \"black jobs\" comment during the first presidential debate got to this tension - the idea of migrants taking jobs, resources, and opportunities from non-white citizens. Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds, one of Trump's go-to Black surrogates, explained the argument to me like this: \"If you're a Black man, Hispanic man, white man, you're working hard every day, and the money you earn doesn't go as far. That hurts your family, that hurts your kids. So they look at this situation, this immigration problem. People are saying, 'Wait a minute. Why are illegal aliens getting food, getting shelter, getting an education, while my family and my child is struggling. It's not right, and it's not fair.'\"\n\nAnd for Asian American voters, now the fastest growing ethnic segment of the electorate, immigration is also becoming a wedge issue, Zarsadiaz told me.\n\n\"This feeling, 'I've waited my turn, I waited my time' - there's long been Latino and Asian American immigrants who have felt this way. The assumption has long been that if you're an immigrant, you must be very liberal on immigration, and that's definitely not the case,\" Zarsadiaz said. \"Some of the staunchest critics of immigration, especially on amnesty or Dreamers, are immigrants themselves, and with Asian Americans that's an issue that has been drawing more voters to Trump and Trumpism - those immigrant voters who feel like they're being wronged.\"\n\nDemocrats are now moderating on immigration , but only after years of moving left. And that shift left has been true on a range of issues , contributing to another part of this theory of Trump's gains: that Democrats have pushed conservative or moderate nonwhite Americans away as they embraced beliefs more popular with white, college-educated, and suburban voters. The political scientist Ruy Teixeira and Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini have been theorizing for a while now that a disjuncture over social issues in general - and Trump's seizure of these issues - has complicated the idea that Democrats would benefit from greater numbers and rates of participation from nonwhite America. It may explain why conservative and moderate voters of color, who may have voted for Democrats in the past, are now realigning with the Republican Party.\n\nThese three theories try to describe how Trump specifically has been able to improve his and the GOP's standing among a growing segment of the American electorate. They place Trump as the central cause for the majority of this racial political shift. But would these dynamics still be happening if he weren't involved?\n\nThere are signs that some of this shift may be happening independently of Trump. It could be a product of the growing diversification of America, upward mobility and changing understandings of class, and growing educational divides.\n\nFor example, as rates of immigration change and the share of US-born Latino and Asian Americans grows, their partisan loyalties may continue to change. Those born closer to the immigrant experience may have had more of a willingness to back the party seen as more welcoming of immigrants, but as generations get further away from that experience, racial and ethnic identity may become less of a factor in the development of political thinking.\n\nConcepts of racial identity and memory are also changing - younger Black Americans, for example, have less of a tie to the Civil Rights era - potentially contributing to less strong political polarization among Black and Latino people in the US independently of any given candidate - and creating more persuadable voters in future elections.\n\nAt the same time, younger generations are increasingly identifying as independents or outside of the two-party paradigm - a change in loyalty that stands to hurt Democrats first, since Democrats tend to do better with younger voters.\n\nRegardless of whether Trump just happens to be the right kind of populist at the right time of racial and ethnic change in America or if he's a unique accelerator and contributor to the changes America is experiencing, November may offer more evidence that something has fundamentally changed in US politics. As America diversifies, it makes sense for its political parties to diversify too - and that poses a reckoning for Democrats in elections to come.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nGOP lawmakers will have a pivotal say over judges - and policy priorities.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nRepublicans have won a majority in the Senate, flipping the body after four years of Democratic control.\n\nThis was the predicted outcome given how vulnerable Democrats were this cycle: While they were defending nine battleground seats, Republicans were defending only three. The GOP successfully flipped key states , including Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia, while holding off unexpectedly competitive challenges in places like Nebraska and Texas .\n\nThe new Republican Senate majority will have a chance to govern with a Republican in the White House, after former President Donald Trump won a second term early on Wednesday morning, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIn their campaigns, Republican Senate candidates leaned heavily on critiques of Democrats' economic policies as many voters continued to grapple with inflation and high costs of living. They also kept up fear-mongering on immigration, arguing that only they could offer solutions to border crossing surges , like the one in 2023. Overall, because they weren't in control of the Senate, Republican candidates were able to capitalize on anti-incumbent sentiment - and current discontent - as they campaigned to take back certain seats.\n\nRepublicans' gains will have major implications for the incoming Trump administration. A Republican Senate will offer him a nearly blank check on appointments, and allow him to resume stacking the courts with his judges. Depending on the outcome of House races, a GOP Senate could also enable the second Trump administration to pursue policy priorities like rolling back the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and renewing corporate tax cuts .\n\nThe first Trump presidency was a showcase for what happens when both the White House and Senate are held by Republicans - and a preview of what's to come.\n\nIn his first term, Trump was able to advance his judges at a rapid pace, reshaping the Circuit Court and Supreme Court with conservative picks. In total, Trump was able to get 234 judges confirmed , including the three who now sit on the Supreme Court who proved integral to overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nSimilarly, Trump faced little backlash or accountability for his rhetoric or policy decisions throughout his term, including attempts to implement a Muslim travel ban or to shut down the government as leverage for funding for a wall along the US-Mexico border . Although some Republican senators spoke out, few truly vocalized their opposition to Trump or scrutinized his actions. When Trump was impeached for his role in fomenting the January 6 insurrection , for example, only seven Republicans voted to convict him - the rest voted to acquit, and only three of those votes to convict will return in the new Congress.\n\nIf Republicans maintain control of the House, a unified GOP Congress could also help Trump advance his legislative agenda.\n\nTrump has focused more on executive actions he'd like to take (such as tariffs , immigration , and international relations ) than on a congressional agenda. However, Republicans have long expressed an interest in curbing access to the ACA. One issue lawmakers will weigh in the next year is the expiration of ACA premium subsidies, Stat reports . House Speaker Mike Johnson has emphasized already that he's interested in major \" reform \" to the health care act as well.\n\nThe tax cuts that Republicans passed in 2017 are also up for renewal, and will be another issue lawmakers in the next Congress will need to tackle. Trump has suggested cutting the corporate tax rate and has floated some income tax cuts too. Regardless of whether they take the House, Senate Republicans will likely advocate for those cuts. And Republicans could push, too, for expanded oil and gas drilling leases that Democrats had previously curbed.\n\nMany of those priorities will depend on the outcome of the race to control the House - but with Trump in the White House, the upper chamber will have a significant role to play no matter what.\n\nUpdate, Wednesday November 6, 9:15 am ET: This piece has been updated to reflect the results of the presidential election.\n\n[Fearless journalism needs your support now more than ever.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA second Trump loss would change the GOP, but probably not in the ways conservative purists hope.\n\nby Eric Levitz\n\nMost conservatives are as interested in voting for Kamala Harris as they are in eating a bowl of tofu marinated in motor oil.\n\nAfter all, the Democratic nominee has vowed to legalize abortion nationwide , ban assault weapons , regulate prices , and increase federal spending . As Donald Trump - in his own wildly exaggerated fashion - would put it, she wants \"this country to go communist immediately, if not sooner.\"\n\nAnd yet, some on the right are quietly rooting for Trump's defeat. To this contingent, preventing Trump and JD Vance from remaking conservatism in their image takes precedence over keeping Harris out of the White House.\n\nTheir reasoning is simple: Trump has revised GOP orthodoxy, to the detriment of core conservative interest groups. His contempt for NATO and affinity for Vladimir Putin have incensed national security hawks. His enthusiasm for tariffs has dismayed economic libertarians. His gestures of moderation on abortion have dispirited the religious right. And his affection for mobs that threaten to kill Mike Pence has alienated Mike Pence.\n\nAll this might not amount to a case for Harris were it not for Trump's running mate. With the notable exception of abortion rights, JD Vance is even more ideologically hostile to traditional conservatism than the GOP nominee is. The Ohio senator has advocated for (some) labor unions, expansions in social welfare benefits, industrial policy, steep tariffs, stricter antitrust enforcement, and choking off aid to Ukraine . A Trump victory would make Vance the GOP's heir apparent, thereby rendering traditional conservatives politically homeless for a decade or more.\n\nA Harris presidency, by contrast, might be a fleeting irritation. Even if the Democratic nominee wins, Republicans are likely to take the Senate . In that scenario, conservatives could block all of her judicial nominees and partisan legislation, build large congressional majorities in the 2026 midterms, and claw back the presidency two years later.\n\nSummarizing the perspective of unnamed anti-Trump conservatives in his orbit, the right-wing commentator Erick Erickson posted on X , \"We can hold off Harris for two years and get more reinforcements then fight in 2028 for the White House. If Trump gets in, we set back the pro-life cause and free markets by a generation at least.\" Various anonymous Republicans have expressed similar sentiments to Politico .\n\nSuch conservatives, though, are at once too optimistic about their ideology's outlook should Trump lose and too pessimistic about its prospects should he win.\n\nOn the first count, right-wing purists rooting for Trump's defeat overrate the contingency of his heresies. Many of Trump's deviations from conservative orthodoxy derive not from personal whims but rather from political realities that any future GOP nominee would also confront.\n\nOn the second count, Trump's hostility to traditional conservative policy goals is often exaggerated. For better or worse, the differences between Trumpism and traditional conservatism are largely ones of degree rather than kind.\n\nA Trump defeat could change the ideological trajectory of American conservatism, but any shift would happen at the margins of Republican thinking. The GOP is all but certain to remain a party of, by, and for reactionary business interests and social conservatives.\n\nMuch of what conservative purists disdain about Trump's ideological positioning has less to do with his personal impulses than the electorate's preferences. For this reason, it's plausible that some distinctive aspects of Trumpism will outlive his political career.\n\nThis dynamic is clearest on the issues of reproductive rights and entitlement spending. Trump has insisted that questions of abortion policy should be left to the states , while in-vitro fertilization (IVF) should be accessible and publicly subsidized nationwide. The religious right opposes both these stances, as it considers fertilized eggs to be persons entitled to full constitutional rights, and IVF sometimes involves discarding such eggs.\n\nTrump is therefore less aligned with the anti-abortion movement than any Republican nominee in recent memory. In theory, his willingness to defy the Christian right might stem from his personal irreligiosity and less-than-traditional sexual morality. But then, Trump has run for president twice before and in neither instance did he put so much distance between himself and abortion prohibitionists.\n\nThe more likely explanation for Trump's current posture is that the right's position on abortion has become much more politically toxic since he last ran for president. The overturning of Roe v. Wade dramatically increased the salience of abortion policy while triggering a leftward lurch in public opinion on the issue. Following the Supreme Court's decision, both Gallup and Pew polling found support for abortion rights jumping to its highest point on record. Meanwhile, voters in red states like Kansas and Ohio have backed referendums ensuring abortion's legality. Many political operatives have argued that the GOP's vulnerability on reproductive rights drove its mediocre showing in the 2022 midterms.\n\nIn this context, any Republican nominee would recognize a tension between honoring the Christian right's demands and maximizing their own odds of victory.\n\nIt is possible that future GOP nominees may champion federal abortion bans anyway. Some Republican politicians are true believers in fetal personhood and others may see indulging the religious right as indispensable to their primary campaigns. Liam Donovan, a former Republican consultant, told Vox that he believes future GOP candidates would have a harder time defying anti-abortion activists, as Trump's cult of personality renders him uniquely capable of defying core Republican interest groups. \"He singularly has the ability to basically tell the base to pound sand and do whatever he wants,\" Donovan said. \"Yeah, there might be a marginal penalty, but he has the standing to do that in a way no one else does.\"\n\nNevertheless, it is far from certain that Republican triangulation on abortion would end with Trump's defeat. The incentives for moderation on the issue are only liable to grow stronger, as the less-religious millennial and zoomer generations continue displacing their more socially conservative forebears.\n\nTrump's position on entitlement spending is also dictated by political expediency. An overwhelming majority of Americans oppose reducing Medicare or Social Security benefits. Trump is scarcely the first Republican nominee to bend to the popular will on this subject. In 2012, Mitt Romney (misleadingly) criticized Barack Obama for cutting Medicare.\n\nForthrightly championing entitlement cuts isn't going to get politically easier. As the nation ages, those with a direct stake in sustaining Medicare and Social Security benefits will increase. In the past, Republicans have sought to mitigate blowback to entitlement cuts by maintaining existing benefit levels for current recipients. Yet the modern Republican coalition is disproportionately composed of Americans between the ages of 45 and 64 - a group that tends to be highly conscious of entitlement policy and would stand to lose out from any Medicare or Social Security cut that began with the next generation of seniors. Trump losing in November would do nothing to eliminate these political realities. It is therefore unlikely that the GOP's next nominee would be an unabashed proponent of entitlement reform.\n\nTrump's old-school conservative skeptics have raised few complaints with his militantly nativist positions on immigration. That aspect of Trumpism, though, is likely to endure due to popular demand. Republican primary voters were mobilizing for a more restrictionist party long before Trump launched his first campaign. They are all but certain to reject any future Republican candidate who attempts to revive comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nOther aspects of Trumpism owe less to political expediency than personal instinct. For this reason, a second Trump loss would give conservative purists a fighting chance to restore their movement's orthodoxy on certain fronts. Even in such areas, their victory would be far from assured.\n\nTrump did not become a nationalist skeptic of free trade merely because he wanted to win an election and saw protectionism as politically expedient in 2016. Rather, he has argued since the late 1980s that America's trade partners were taking advantage of the United States. Likewise, Trump did not embrace a 10 percent tariff on all foreign imports this year because doing so was necessary to win the Republican primary or general election. The GOP nominee could have appealed to protectionist sentiment in the Midwest through myriad less-extreme policies. The extremity of his avowed hostility to trade is more ideological than pragmatic.\n\nFor this reason, a Trump loss in 2024 could clear the way for a less protectionist Republican Party. In any scenario, the GOP is liable to remain more trade-skeptical than it was under Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush. So long as Rust Belt states crown the Electoral College's winner - and Democrats continue their Biden-era turn toward economic nationalism - Republicans will find it difficult to fully repudiate Trumpian sentiments on trade.\n\nThe prospects for a full reset on foreign policy are more favorable. The American public remains too intolerant of US casualties to countenance a return to the imperial misadventures of the Bush era (at least, barring another foreign attack on US soil). But no mass constituency has ever demanded Trump's idiosyncratic skepticism of NATO or sympathy for various authoritarian strongmen. \"Find me a voter that is voting specifically on Trump's foreign policy,\" Patrick Ruffini, a pollster with the Republican firm Echelon Insights, told Vox. \"The fact is that voters like Trump's style, his demeanor, his aggression toward what they perceived as encroaching liberal elites,\" as opposed to his perspective on US-Russia relations, Ruffini argues\n\nThus, were voters to repudiate a Trump-Vance ticket, Republicans could plausibly return to conventionally conservative positioning on foreign affairs. This is not guaranteed. If GOP primary voters aren't passionately opposed to aiding Ukraine, they also aren't passionately supportive of Ukrainian democracy, either. After a second Trump loss, the Republican nominee in 2028 would likely have leeway to chart their own course on foreign affairs, though of course, that nominee might well be Donald Trump . (Officially, Trump has no intention of running in 2028 should he lose in 2024, but the Republican nominee is not exactly a man of his word.)\n\nPerhaps Trumpism's most alarming innovation is the extremity of its contempt for liberal democratic norms. The GOP standard-bearer has cultivated distrust in the democratic process, attempted to obstruct the peaceful transfer of power by fomenting an insurrection, declared that the Justice Department's first loyalty should be to the president, encouraged his supporters to beat up protesters, and committed myriad other affronts to (small-l) liberal values.\n\nRepublican primary voters in some areas eventually came to demand complicity in Trump's election denialism. Trump, though, did not dispute the legitimacy of the 2020 election because Republican voters agitated for such authoritarian conspiracy theorizing; rather, Republican voters agitated for authoritarian conspiracy theorizing because Trump denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n\nSome partisans have always responded to electoral defeat by grumbling about alleged cheating by the other side, but it took presidential leadership to put such paranoia at the very heart of Republican politics.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has further fueled right-wing contempt for democratic institutions by amplifying the \"great replacement\" conspiracy theory: the idea that Democrats are in the process of permanently disenfranchising \"real\" Americans by creating an artificial majority through unfettered immigration.\n\nPromoting the idea that Republicans' votes might not count - as the election could be stolen - is not a political imperative for the GOP. If anything, it is counterproductive to the project of winning elections. Thus, should Trump lose in November and retire from politics thereafter, Republicans may nominate someone with an iota of civic responsibility.\n\nIt is worth noting that Trump's authoritarianism is not a chief concern for the conservative purists who are secretly rooting for his defeat. There is a small but substantial cohort of Republicans who've publicly endorsed Harris, on small-d democratic grounds. Among conservative purists who remain actively involved in Republican politics - and are thus only willing to root for Harris in secret - Trump's appetite for autocracy is not especially disconcerting; neither Erickson nor Politico mentioned Trump's authoritarianism as a source of concern for this contingent.\n\nThat reality, combined with the pre-Trump Republican Party's forays into blocking vote counting and targeted disenfranchisement - and the fact that much of the conservative media is now invested in election denialist narratives - should temper optimism about its post-Trump posture toward the republic's bedrock norms.\n\nThere is no question that Trump's ideological positioning is distinct from that of previous GOP standard-bearers. He is more demagogically anti-immigrant, protectionist, putatively moderate on abortion, supportive of entitlement spending, anti-democratic, and hostile toward America's European allies.\n\nYet even on many of these fronts, the practical distinctions between Trumpism and conventional conservatism are often exaggerated.\n\nDuring his first term in office, Trump did impose a variety of tariffs on America's geopolitical allies and adversaries alike. He also made marginal changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), renamed it, and then gave largely open trade with Canada and Mexico his stamp of approval .\n\nIn a second term, Trump would surely pursue more restrictive trade policies than free-market economists would recommend. Whether he'd actually follow through on imposing a de facto 10 percent sales tax on all imported goods, however, is far from clear. After all, Trump failed to act on a great many of his more radical campaign pledges during his first stint in the White House.\n\nOn reproductive rights, meanwhile, there is little doubt that Trump will continue to appoint anti-abortion judges, perhaps even forging a Supreme Court majority that deems the procedure unconstitutional. During his debate with Harris, Trump pointedly refused to say that he would veto a national abortion ban were one to reach his desk.\n\nAs Trump's noncommittal remarks on that subject indicate, the real obstacle to national abortion restrictions is not Trumpism so much as Congress. To get a ban ready for a Republican president's signature, the GOP would need to find either 60 votes in the Senate or 51 votes for abolishing the legislative filibuster and restricting abortion nationwide. The party is unlikely to find either in the near term. As Ohio's and Kansas's recent abortion referendums made clear, the religious right's views are unpopular even in solidly red states. Plenty of Republican senators would prefer to dodge a vote on an issue that cleaves their base from the median voter; the filibuster gives them cover to avoid such a vote. Abortion prohibitionists who believe Trump is the one thing standing between them and total victory have fallen prey to wishful thinking.\n\nLikewise, the obstacle to entitlement cuts is that idea's political toxicity, not Donald Trump's unshakeable commitment to seniors' welfare. What Republicans need to cut Medicare and Social Security is not a more conventionally conservative standard-bearer but a forcing mechanism. Trump's fiscal priorities would help provide them with precisely this. The Republican nominee is committed to slashing federal revenue across the board and has repeatedly flirted with payroll tax cuts that would gut funding for Social Security and Medicare. These measures would expedite the programs' insolvency.\n\nIf Republicans control Congress when the conflict between avoiding all tax increases and sustaining entitlement benefits becomes irreconcilable, they will be liable to cut the latter, no matter how \"Trumpist\" the party remains.\n\nFinally, during his first term, Trump's rhetoric about foreign affairs was decidedly more heterodox than his policies. This gap was especially pronounced on matters concerning Russia. For all Trump's expressions of affection for Putin, during his tenure, the United States assented to NATO enlargement, armed the Ukrainian military, and bombed Syria, a Russian client state. His administration still made some deferential gestures toward Moscow, and it's plausible that a second Trump administration would chart a more unconventional course on foreign affairs. But whether Trumpism constitutes a drastic break from traditional conservative foreign policy in practice (rather than rhetoric) remains unclear.\n\nIt is true that JD Vance's policy positions diverge from conservative orthodoxy much more significantly than Trump's. Were Vance to inherit leadership of the party following a second Trump administration, that could plausibly change the Republican Party's economic and foreign policy positioning, at least marginally. And yet, given how radically (and, arguably, opportunistically) Vance has revised his views since 2017, it's far from clear that he would stick by more heretical populist ideas if they became an impediment to his political ambitions.\n\nUltimately, American conservatism's precise trajectory in the event of a Trump defeat or victory cannot be known. In any event, its core commitments are likely to remain the same. It is, and (almost certainly) will be, an ideology dedicated to maximizing the after-tax income of the wealthy, restricting immigration, and advancing as much social conservatism as an increasingly secular electorate will allow (in part, by outsourcing social policy to a democratically unaccountable judiciary). Whatever else Trumpism does and does not entail, these objectives give doctrinaire conservatives cause for supporting the Republican nominee - and everyone else reason to hope for his defeat.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHow the Trumpified GOP resembles Frankenstein's monster.\n\nby Zack Beauchamp\n\nThroughout the entire Republican National Convention, I struggled with one big question: What is the Republican Party for?\n\nThat it was for former President Donald Trump went almost without saying. Look at the way that solidarity ear bandages became the RNC's must-have fashion accessory , or how long the audience managed to put up big cheers during his historically long and rambling acceptance speech on Thursday night.\n\nBeyond Trump worship, the RNC has been billed as proof that the populist takeover of the Republican Party is complete. On issues like trade, immigration, and foreign alliances, this analysis is surely correct; the Trumpian insurgency has gone head-to-head with the party old guard and defeated them.\n\nYet elements of the old Republican Party remain thoroughly in place.\n\nThe ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.\n\nUnlike Europe's far-right populist parties, the GOP remains unyieldingly opposed to the welfare state and progressive taxation . It remains committed to banning abortion , an issue where its actions at the state level speak for themselves. It remains deeply hostile to unions ; vice presidential nominee Sen. J.D. Vance, allegedly the avatar of the party's pro-worker populism, has a 0 percent score from the AFL-CIO . On foreign policy, it is by no means strictly isolationist: it seeks to ramp up military spending and aggressively confront China even as it tears down both military alliances and the American-led global trade regime.\n\nIdeologically, the GOP is a mess, a political party constructed less out of one cogent worldview than an assemblage of different parts, a zombie given life by the lightning of Donald John Trump. It is Frankenstein's party. And while Trump and his loyalists are clearly our Shelleyian monster's head , they do not (yet) have full control over all its limbs.\n\nThe Trump coalition is so new that it has yet to produce an equilibrium, a stable set of policy commitments that will endure as long as it aligns. It basically works by Trump getting his way on issues he really cares about - like democracy, trade, and immigration - while others claim what they can when they can claim it. The monied class is still calling the shots on taxes and regulation; the social conservatives are still in the driver's seat when it comes to issues like abortion and LGBT rights.\n\nYou can see this at work in documents like the RNC platform and Project 2025 , which together help us understand the GOP's ambitions going forward.\n\nSome of the most notable policies in them, like Project 2025's proposal to end the Justice Department's independence or the platform's call for \"the largest Deportation Program in history,\" is pure Trump (right down to the random capitalization).\n\nBut in issue areas where other elements of the right prevail, things sound a bit more old Republican. Project 2025's chapter on the EPA is about as old-school business friendly as it gets ; the GOP platform promises to \"slash Regulations\" and \"pursue additional Tax Cuts.\" Project 2025 calls on the next president to \"rescind regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, and sex characteristics.\"\n\nWhen there's tension between Trump's instincts and the old Republican agenda, the result is not always clear.\n\nOn trade, Trump has simply won; the issue is central enough to his political identity that his protectionism has become party orthodoxy. But on abortion, where Trump wants the party to moderate, signals are more mixed. He succeeded in, for example, taking a call for a national abortion ban out of the GOP platform - but banning abortion remains central to the party identity. Both Vance and Project 2025 support using an obscure 1873 law to ban the distribution of mifepristone , the abortion pill, by mail.\n\nPartly, this confused state of affairs is a product of Trump's own personality. The conservative writer Ramesh Ponnuru argues , correctly, that he simply doesn't have the character necessary to run a strict and doctrinal ideological movement.\n\n\"It's not just that he lacks the discipline and focus to carry out an objective, although he does lack both, or that flatterers easily manipulate him, although they do. It's also that his objectives are malleable to start with,\" Ponnuru argues.\n\nBut partly, it's a result of coalitional politics - how the American right has always worked.\n\nPost-World War II American conservatism was a \"three-legged stool\" formed of three groups: free market libertarians, social conservatives, and foreign policy hawks. These groups often disagreed with each other on matters of both principle and policy. Hence an ideology contradiction: a \"small government\" conservatism that aimed to build the world's largest army and police consenting adults in their homes.\n\nThere was nothing natural about this alliance, no reflecting of an enduring and transhistorical American tradition. \"Movement conservatism,\" as it was called, was a movement - one built, like any other political faction, by people molded by a specific time and place (Cold War America) in response to its particular challenges.\n\nMoreover, movement conservatism was not the entirety of the American right . In his recent book Taking America Back , historian David Austin Walsh argues that respectable conservatives actually depended on the radical fringe for their success. Extremist groups like the John Birch Society, which saw a communist plot behind every bush, worked in tandem with the mainstream conservatives to fight the liberals - what Walsh calls a right-wing \"popular front.\"\n\nThe American right was thus an alliance on top of an alliance: the three-legged stool, itself already unwieldy, acting in concert with a fringe right willing to go to dark places where mainstream conservatism dared not tread.\n\nToday, the power relationship has flipped: The far right is now the senior partner setting the tone in Washington, with the fusionists following its lead. But the coalition remains a coalition, and it will act accordingly.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nInitial GOP defections point to the party's divides.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nHouse Republicans - after some initial drama - successfully reelected Rep. Mike Johnson as speaker on Friday.\n\nJohnson's victory in the first round of voting came as something of a surprise, after three Republicans initially voted against him, depriving him of the 218-person majority he needed to win the speakership. After conferring with Johnson, however, Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Keith Self of Texas flipped their votes in favor of his candidacy, and Johnson secured the job.\n\nEvery Democrat - 215 total - voted for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), while the lone Republican holdout, Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, voted for Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN).\n\nThe tight vote and its last-minute resolution are both indicative of the challenges that House Republicans will continue to face this term given their narrow majority, and their hard-right flank's penchant for casting disruptive votes. Johnson's difficulties were initially reminiscent of the House GOP's struggles in 2023, when it took 15 rounds of voting for former GOP Speaker Kevin McCarthy to be elected after ultra-conservative Republicans rebelled.\n\nAt stake in the speakers' race was Republicans' ability to get pretty much anything done in the near term. The House isn't able to function without a speaker, which meant that key tasks, like certifying the presidential election on January 6, were at risk of being delayed . The narrow and short-lived Republican revolt also sent a pointed message about the enduring divides within the party and how they could pose a real obstacle when it comes to the GOP's attempts to pass actual policies in the coming year.\n\nAny speaker chaos would have impeded the basic functions of the House.\n\nAs laid out by a 1789 law, a speaker is required for everything from swearing in members to organizing committees to passing new legislation. The speaker election - which takes place via a public roll call vote - ultimately needed to happen prior to any other congressional business.\n\nThe January 2023 fight over McCarthy's election offered a preview of the potential consequences: As the voting process stretched to multiple days, members grew concerned about their inability to provide constituent services and to receive classified briefings, since they hadn't technically been sworn in yet.\n\nUnlike in 2023, however, there were considerations beyond the day-to-day work of Congress this term. The speaker role likely needed to be filled for the House to certify the presidential election results on Monday, and a failure to do so could have delayed the certification of Trump's victory. As CNN reported Thursday, Johnson's allies cited this concern as a reason for his detractors to stand down.\n\nIf the House failed to elect a speaker by January 6, lawmakers could have tried to push the certification date to later in the month or tested other unprecedented alternatives, like electing a temporary speaker, to clear this procedural hurdle. It's not certain, however, that the House parliamentarian, a nonpartisan official who advises Congress on interpreting the rules, would have gone along with such workarounds, according to George Washington University professor Sarah Binder, an expert on congressional rules.\n\nBinder notes that there are ways the House could have utilized a temporary speaker to conduct urgent business but that the parliamentarian might have advised against doing so. If they did, lawmakers would likely have abided by this judgment since the parliamentarian's decisions have typically held significant weight. (The parliamentarian's advice isn't binding, and lawmakers have ignored it in the past , but these instances have been rare.)\n\nThe early rumblings of GOP dissent on Friday signaled just how deep Republican divides go, and how chaotic efforts to advance their policies are poised to be. It shows, too, the power of the party's right flank, which twice held the speaker's contest hostage in 2023 in order to make demands about coveted positions on committees and the power to depose House leadership.\n\n\"It's a reflection of the underlying disagreements and factionalism within the House Republican Conference,\" Binder told Vox. \"Whether we date them to Donald Trump, whether we date it to MAGA, whether we date it to the Tea Party [movement in 2009] or beyond ... [or] activist conservatives versus the establishment, the Republican Party has long been wrought by this central faction.\"\n\nMcCarthy's contentious election - and governance - last term provided a vivid preview of these fault lines. In January 2023, it took multiple rounds of voting across four days - resolving early in the morning on January 7 - before McCarthy was elected speaker, thanks to conservative opposition to his leadership. To win the speaker's gavel, McCarthy eventually offered significant concessions to far-right members, including seats on the Rules Committee and the ability for any Republican member to unilaterally force a vote on the removal of the speaker.\n\nConservatives eventually succeeded in toppling McCarthy from the speakership in October 2023, igniting another round of fighting over the position. It then took more than three weeks for Republicans to fill the position again, with multiple nominations and multiple floor votes prior to Johnson's elevation.\n\nMcCarthy's decision to work with Democrats to pass a short-term funding measure precipitated his ouster, and on multiple occasions since then, Johnson has also had to rely on Democratic votes to keep the government open and to pass major foreign aid packages because his own conference was simply too fractured to agree on them.\n\nThese splits, coupled with narrow margins in the House - which will get even narrower soon, as two Republican House members join the Trump administration - are set to be tested again and again in 2025. The speaker's race was Republicans' first hurdle, but any GOP efforts to pursue ambitious immigration and tax bills during Trump's administration, or even to keep the government open, could prove fraught.\n\n\"The stakes are higher for them [now],\" Binder says, \"because they've got Trump in the White House, and they have a policy agenda.\"\n\nUpdate, January 3, 2:30 pm ET: This story was originally published on January 2 and has been updated with the results from the House speaker vote\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHow Trump's Republican Party left conservatism behind.\n\nby Sean Illing and Zack Beauchamp\n\nIt's been two weeks since the presidential election and there has been no shortage of autopsies. If anything surprised me about the outcome, it's not that Donald Trump won, but how he did it. The president-elect won all seven swing states and the popular vote, and seemed to gain ground with basically every demographic except college-educated women. That is a political reckoning for the Democratic Party.\n\nAll we can definitively say at this point is that there are many reasons for this electoral defeat and we just don't know enough right now to parse it out in a satisfying way. But that doesn't mean that we have no idea what happened.\n\nWhat is fairly clear is that the roughly 76 million people who voted for Trump were saying \"no\" to something - or, to be more precise, they were saying \"no\" to lots of things. And I am genuinely interested in understanding what - apart from the Biden administration - so many people were rejecting, and what lessons we might be able to draw from that.\n\nSo in the aftermath of the election, I invited Vox's own Zack Beauchamp on The Gray Area to talk about what we know and what it could mean for our political future. Beauchamp writes a newsletter for Vox called On the Right , which is all about the evolving nature of conservatism and the various ideas and movements driving it. He's also the author of a recent book called The Reactionary Spirit .\n\nWe discuss the competing accounts of this election, the differences between conservative and reactionary parties, as well as some of the broader trends in democratic societies across the world. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Pandora , or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nNow that we've all had a little time to process it, what do you make of the election results?\n\nI would say we should separate out two different things. One is our analysis of what's happening, and the other is how we feel about what happened. Analytically, I think it's still pretty early to have any really strong conclusions, but I will say that most of what people are saying as a result of that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. If you notice, there's a one-to-one correlation between someone's very detailed account of what happened in the election and their own priors about how politics works.\n\nYou mentioned that Trump gained ground with basically every group, right? Well, that only happens, this kind of uniform swing, when there's some big structural factor at play. The candidates that make sense to explain a shift from 2020 to 2024 are inflation, right? That's new and has been politically potent everywhere, and historically, in the US it matters. And anti-incumbent sentiment , which is a worldwide fact and true in democracies around the world. But Harris's biggest losses were in blue states, and that suggests that something is going on beyond messaging. Something else is happening.\n\nLet's set aside the election for a minute, though we're going to keep coming back to it. When someone asks you what is American conservatism in 2024, what is your answer?\n\nIt's not conservatism. What we call the conservative movement today is not what the conservative movement historically has been in the United States. It's a species of reactionary politics. The distinction rests in the party's fundamental attitude towards democracy and democratic institutions.\n\nThe old Republican Party, for all of its faults, played by the political rules. It had faith in the idea that elections determine the winner, and that when elections happen, you accept the verdict of the people and you adjust based on that regardless of whether or not you like the policy preferences.\n\nReactionary parties are different from conservatism. They both share an orientation towards believing that certain ways in which society is arranged - certain setups, institutions, even hierarchies - are good and necessary. There's value in the way that things are. What differs between the two of them is that conservative parties don't see potential social change as an indictment of democracy. That is to say, even if a democracy or an election produces an outcome that they don't like, that threatens to transform wholesale certain elements of the social order, a conservative would not throw out the political order as a consequence of that. Reactionaries are willing to do that.\n\nMy view is, at the core of the Trump movement, which I want to distinguish from every Trump supporter because they're not the same, but the people who have given Donald Trump an iron grip on the Republican Party, that base of hardcore support, are animated primarily by reactionary politics, by a sense that things have gone too far in a socially liberal and culturally liberal, and even in some cases economically liberal direction, and they want things to go back to partially a past that never existed, but also a past that did exist where there was a little bit more order and structure in terms of who was in charge and what the rules were.\n\nWhat Trumpism seems to be, increasingly, is a rejection of the ruling elites, a rejection of the professional managerial class, which is more about class and culture than race and the preservation of traditional hierarchies. So how do you make sense of that?\n\nWhen we talk about what Trumpism is, we need to specify what we're talking about. And I don't think [that means] looking at a general election and saying that every person who voted for Trump is necessarily a Trumpist. If somebody was considering voting for Harris or maybe voted for Democrats down ballot, it might not make sense to think of their behavior through a purely ideological lens, because they may not even have firm ideological beliefs. Many swing voters, if you look at the way they talk about politics, it's sort of jumbled. Again, I'm not saying that they are bad for having jumbled views, but this is just a fact about people who don't pay attention to politics very much.\n\nIf you look at Trump's core supporters though, the story of racial and social grievance , anger about immigration, a sense of alienation from the United States after Obama really personalized the changing social order - all of that is remarkably consistent among the people who will turn out to vote for Trump in a Republican primary. It's been true over and over again. The evidence is overwhelmingly strong. This is their core motivation in Trump politics and in being engaged in this movement. And nothing about this election result changes that.\n\nWhat that part of the story does is help us understand why Trump has gained control over one of our two major political parties, why it is that he crushed traditional Republicans who were unwilling to give those voters what they wanted in such clear terms, and those voters had become a majority of the Republican Party internally. And more than that, it's why the bulk of Republicans rejected the 2020 election when previously they had believed elections were legitimate. It's why so many people were willing to swallow the idea that Obama wasn't born in the United States.\n\nSo that's one category of explanation, but then we're talking about shifts in coalitions between different elections, and here the analysis becomes a lot trickier because we're not talking about what makes up the core of an ideological movement, because all of those voters are baked into voting for Trump no matter what. I mean, you have 46 or 47 percent of the electorate that's not going to change their mind no matter what on both sides. Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but not much. So you end up having these voters in the middle, and what causes someone to change their votes between elections is not the same thing as what engages really highly motivated, highly ideological voters who make up a political movement. They're swing voters, right? They're not Trumpists in the clear sense just because they voted for Trump once. So collapsing that distinction leads to analytic mistakes.\n\nI continue to have a hard time parsing out all the forces that are combining to scramble our politics. There's so much alienation. It's a very lonely society. Our democracy doesn't feel very participatory for lots of people, so there's not enough investment in it. I think social media, media fragmentation more generally, the collapse of consensus reality - it's all been very destabilizing. And I'm just going to keep saying that I think millions of people have never experienced real political disorder, so they take liberal democracy for granted and frankly don't take politics very seriously. They're entertained by Trump. They think he's funny, and maybe he'll make eggs a little cheaper and also drive annoying coastal elites insane and that's kind of it for plenty of people.\n\nYeah, I think that's true for a lot of people. Especially that point about taking liberal democracy for granted. When you live in a political order for a long period of time, you start to take it as a baseline. This is the way that things are. It's not that you can't even envision fundamental change - it's that you don't even have the vocabulary necessary or the sense of perspective necessary to believe that you should be envisioning radical change. It just doesn't enter into your daily life.\n\nIf you look at interviews with swing voters and the way that they talk about politics or when you talk to them yourselves, the sense that you get is not that these people are like, \"I want to burn American democracy to the ground.\" It's that they've got a choice between two candidates, like they do every election, and they pick the one who represents whatever their grievances are at this moment in time or whatever their anger or frustration or even hopes and dreams are at this moment in time. Lots of different things go into for a voter that changes their mind election to election, what speaks to that. And the stuff about who Trump really is and what he really stands for, the system-threatening part of it, just doesn't even register because it seems too remote to feel real.\n\nI don't think Trump is really committed to anything. I have always felt that his political genius consists in making himself into an avatar onto which people can project whatever they need to project and he's so well-equipped to be this kind of vehicle. I genuinely do not think he cares about anything other than himself. I mean, if the man had to choose between preserving liberal democracy for another century or building a beautiful new golf course in Saudi Arabia, is there any doubt he'd build the fucking golf course?\n\nNo, but I think that that's a mistake. Because it's not that he doesn't have a commitment to democracy in the sense that he's not attached to it. He doesn't like it. He doesn't like the idea that he can't do whatever he wants when he gets power. He gets very angry when people say, \"You can't do that,\" or, \"That's illegal.\" And he openly admires leaders in other countries who have either always been authoritarians, like Xi Jinping in China, or who have torn down their own democracies like Putin [in Russia] or Viktor Orbán in Hungary. He thinks that they're strong and that it's great that they get to do stuff like that.\n\nThis is not an ideological commitment to authoritarianism, either. It's not like Trump has a sincere belief that authoritarian systems work better or deliver better in some kind of meaningful sense. It's a gut level \"I like that. I want to be like that.\" It's when he said in those comments that were recently reported, \"I want generals like Hitler's generals,\" it's not like he was saying, \"I want generals who will follow my orders to exterminate the Jews.\" He's saying, \"I want people who listen to me and do the things that I say, whatever those things are, however crazy they might seem.\" In that sense, he has a gut-level authoritarianism, and it's reactionary in the sense that he very clearly hates a lot of the social change that has happened.\n\nDo you think our institutions will continue to hold?\n\nYeah. I mean, I don't think there's any reason to expect that elections will be formally abolished by 2028 in the way that some wild-eyed commentators in social media have suggested. I think there is a moderate chance that the fairness of our elections will be severely undermined by then. And I think there is a very high chance that some of the core institutions of American democracy will be damaged in ways that have significant long-term consequences.\n\nPut differently, I don't think this election itself is the end of American democracy. I do think it is the beginning of the greatest test American democracy has seen since the Civil War of its resilience, and the outcome of that test is not determined and there is a range of probabilities, ranging from truly catastrophic to merely somewhat bad.\n\nWhat makes this to you a more significant test than the first Trump administration?\n\nIt's the degree to which they have clear and cogent plans about what they want to do, and the anti-democratic nature of those plans. Coming into office last time, Trump didn't have a vendetta against large chunks of the government. He didn't believe an election had been stolen from him and that needed to be rectified. At the very least, he thinks it is a public blemish that needs to be shown to be false to many people, because if many people believe that he won, then that's good enough. It doesn't matter if he actually did. What matters, to put it differently, is Donald Trump's honor, and the honor of Donald Trump must be avenged at all costs, and the insult of 2020 must be erased from the history books. That's the kind of thing that he cares about.\n\nThe degree and scope of the planning that has gone into this and the willingness to take a hammer to different institutions and the specificity of the plans for doing so is not normal. To name just one example from Project 2025 , they want to prosecute the former Pennsylvania secretary of state who presided over the 2020 elections using the [Ku Klux] Klan Act, which was passed to fight the first Klan. It's basically alleging that by trying to help people fix improperly filed mail-in ballots in 2020, this Pennsylvania secretary of state was rigging the election, trying to undermine everyone else's fair exercise of their votes in a way akin to the Klan intimidating Black voters in the 1860s by threatening to lynch them.\n\nWhen I speak to legal experts about this, they're like, \"No credible prosecutor I know would bring such a charge.\" It's a real abuse of power and anti-democratic in many ways because it's trying to wield federal power to prevent local authorities from administering elections properly and helping people vote. So in order to try to even begin an investigation on this front, let alone actually prosecute, what you need to do is fire the people who would do that kind of job, which would typically be in the Justice Department Civil Rights Division role, so the Election Crimes Unit and the Criminal Division, fire those people who work on these cases, bring in attorneys who are willing to do what you say, even though it's ludicrous on the basis of a traditional read of the law, and then initiate an investigation, try to get charges spun up, and then get them to a judge like Aileen Cannon , who's presiding over Trump's documents case and has clearly shown herself to not really care about what's going on, but rather just to interpret the law in whatever way is most favorable to Trump.\n\nAll of that stuff, and this is just one specific example, illustrates the ways in which doing what Trump and his allies have outlined as part of their revenge campaign requires attacking very fundamental components of American democracy: the building blocks, like the rule of law, like a nonpartisan civil service that treats all citizens equally, like a judiciary that's designed with interpreting the law as best as it can, rather than delivering policy outlines, you need all of those things in order to act on already offered promises in what is widely understood to be the planning document for the Trump administration.\n\nAs hard as it is to believe, there's a shelf life to Trump's political career and there are people who think our situation will be drastically better the day he leaves. I'm not so sure about that. Are you?\n\nWell, I agree with you in brief, but to build on what you're saying, let's say Trump dies in office. Then you get President JD Vance, who shares some very similar ideological commitments to the people who want to tear down American democracy. So there's that. There's the fact that Trumpist politics have paid off in two presidential elections for Republicans, and I just can't imagine being a Republican strategist right now and saying what we need to do is go back to 2012. Because even if all you care about is narrowly winning elections, then you're going to try to be Trump rather than the pre-Trump GOP. There will be a lot of people trying to take up the mantle of Trump's successor in the Republican Party, and that means doing a lot of the same things that he did.\n\nBut can they do that effectively? Can anyone else do what Trump has done?\n\nI'm very skeptical of that. If you look comparatively at authoritarian parties that work inside democracies, many of them are led by singular charismatic figures. Not all, but many of the successful ones. There's this saying in Indian politics that Narendra Modi is the man who has a 56-inch chest. And it's not literally true, but it's one of many things that isn't about him that his supporters say when you talk to them. This sort of mythologizing and grandiose comments stem from Modi's outsized personality and his ability to connect as a figure with supporters of his party and with a lot of ordinary Indians who might not have supported his party in the past. And I think Trump is much the same way. And that appeal, first of all, is not fixed. Modi, while he won reelection this year, his party took a major hit. They lost their parliamentary majority, and of course Trump lost in 2020.\n\nBut second is, what happens when he's gone? We know that this is a huge problem for authoritarian parties in authoritarian countries. They're often nasty fights over what happens after the big man dies. That seems equally true in authoritarian factions inside democracies, because part of what makes them authoritarian is that they put one guy in charge, and it's not clear who's next unless you have something like a monarchy where the rules of succession are clear. But even then, who doesn't know about nasty fights inside monarchies over who is the true heir to the throne? It's just a fact of life when you're not having things settled through a normal democratic procedure.\n\nSo I just don't know what's going to happen after Trump is gone. I can guess, and I think a lot will depend on how his administration manages American public opinion. Not only did Trump end his presidency historically unpopular, but even now, he's unpopular. There's a lot of people who really don't like him, and many of the swing voters could be turned off by things that happened during his presidency, especially if it's as disruptive as it seems like it might be to ordinary people's lives.\n\nListen to the rest of the conversation and be sure to follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Pandora , or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

The Court has always been a political institution, but for most of its history there were not the hardline distinctions between justices chosen by a president of one political party, and justices chosen by the other party that we see today. As recently as 2010, for example, the Court included Justice John Paul Stevens, a Gerald Ford appointee who typically voted with the Court's liberal wing.\n\nGet the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.\n\nGone as well are relatively moderate jurists like Justices Lewis Powell, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Anthony Kennedy. These were the sorts of justices who voted to limit abortion rights , but not to eliminate them . They placed strict restrictions on affirmative action , but didn't kill it entirely .\n\nNow, however, this kind of moderation is anathema, especially to Republican legal elites, many of whom still use the battle cry \" No More Souters \" to describe their approach to judicial appointments - a reference to Justice David Souter, a George H.W. Bush appointee who turned out to be a moderate liberal.\n\nThe Republican Party's highest officials certainly haven't behaved as if they think that justices are nonpartisan. Why else would Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell make up a fake rule to stop President Barack Obama from confirming a Supreme Court justice in the final year of his presidency? McConnell claimed that justices may not be confirmed in a presidential election year. Then he abandoned this fake rule four years later to place Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett on the high court.\n\nNor have Democrats failed to police their own nominees' ideological conformity. None of the Supreme Court justices appointed by presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, or Joe Biden broke with the Democratic Party's approach to judging in the same way that Souter broke from the GOP's. All of them generally supported abortion rights, affirmative action, marriage equality, and the Affordable Care Act. Every Democrat on the Supreme Court opposed Donald Trump's claim that he could commit crimes while he was in office . All of the Court's Democrats oppose the Republican justices' decisions giving themselves a veto power over any regulatory decision made by the executive branch.\n\nThe word \"conservative,\" which is typically used to signal caution or an allegiance to the status quo, is a particularly inappropriate term to describe this Court's Republican majority. What, exactly, are the Republican justices \"conserving\" when they overrule multiple seminal precedents in a single term ? What is \"conservative\" about abandoning the Court's procedural norms to hand down revolutionary new legal rules on the Court's shadow docket ? What is \"conservative\" about rushing out half-baked legal standards that are incomprehensible to lower court judges ?\n\nI am a journalist. That means it is my job to convey truth to my readers, and to describe the Court that I cover as accurately as I possibly can. And the unfortunate truth is that the Supreme Court of the United States is now a partisan institution. I would do my readers a disservice if I covered up this reality. Or if I used euphemistic language like \"conservatives\" and \"liberals\" to describe fundamentally partisan political appointees.\n\nAnd so I will not. And I encourage other journalists to do the same.\n\nIt's astonishing how little thought many past presidents put into their Supreme Court appointments. In the past, justices were often chosen for idiosyncratic personal reasons, or to please a particular interest group or voting bloc, and without much, if any, inquiry into how the nominee was likely to decide cases.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson, for example, appointed Justice James Clark McReynolds - an awful judge and an even worse human being who Time magazine once described as a \" savagely sarcastic, incredibly reactionary Puritan anti-Semite \" - in large part because Wilson found McReynolds, who was US attorney general before he joined the Court, to be so obnoxious that the president promoted him to get him out of the Cabinet .\n\nSimilarly, President Dwight Eisenhower complained late in his presidency that appointing Justice William Brennan, one of the most consequential left-liberal jurists in American history, to the Supreme Court was among the biggest mistakes he made in office . But Ike's White House never vetted Brennan for his ideological views, and Brennan was selected largely because Eisenhower was running for reelection when he made the nomination, and he thought that appointing a Catholic like Brennan would appeal to Catholic voters .\n\nEven in 1990, after top Republican officials had published lengthy documents laying out their party's vision for the Constitution, they still hadn't developed a reliable system for vetting Supreme Court nominees to ensure that they were on board with the party's agenda. Bush chose the center-left Justice Souter over other, more right-wing candidates largely due to misguided advice from his top legal advisers.\n\nAs journalist Jan Crawford Greenburg reported in a 2007 book , Souter beat out early frontrunner Ken Starr - the same Ken Starr who would go on to hound President Bill Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky investigation - in large part because Bush's right-wing advisers feared that Starr was too liberal. According to Crawford Greenburg, then-Deputy Attorney General Bill Barr opposed Starr because of a low-stakes dispute over \"a federal law that permitted private citizens to sue for fraud against the federal government.\"\n\nMuch has changed since 1990. On the Republican side, the Federalist Society - a kind of bar association for right-wing lawyers with chapters on most law school campuses and in most major cities - now starts vetting law students for elite legal jobs almost as soon as they begin their studies. And Republican presidents can rely on the Federalist Society to identify ideologically reliable candidates for the bench. As Trump said in 2016 while campaigning for president, \"We're going to have great judges, conservative, all picked by the Federalist Society.\"\n\nNor is the Federalist Society the only way Republicans vet potential Supreme Court nominees. Every single one of the Court's current Republican members except for Barrett previously served as a political appointee in a GOP administration , roles that allowed high-level Republicans to observe their work and probe their views.\n\nDemocrats' vetting process, meanwhile, is more informal. But it's been no less successful in identifying Supreme Court nominees who reliably embrace their party's stance on the most contentious issues. The last Democrat appointed to the Supreme Court who broke with the party's pro-abortion rights stance, for example, was Justice Byron White - a dissenter in Roe v. Wade appointed by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 .\n\nThe result is a modern-day Supreme Court where every single member was carefully selected by their party to ensure that they will not stray on any of the issues where the two parties have settled views. Every Republican justice voted to abolish affirmative action on nearly all university campuses, with every Democratic justice in dissent. Every Republican voted to give the leader of the Republican Party broad immunity from criminal prosecution , with every Democrat in dissent. Every Republican except for Roberts voted to overrule Roe (and Roberts merely argued that the Court should have waited a little longer), while every Democrat dissented.\n\nSo, with all this evidence that the Supreme Court has become no less partisan than Congress or the presidency, what are the arguments against speaking of the justices in the same way we speak of presidents or members of Congress?\n\nLet's start with the worst - albeit fairly common - argument for labeling the justices as nonpartisan actors: the claim that the justices are merely carrying out a particular \"judicial philosophy\" when they make decisions, and not making decisions based on what outcome their political party would prefer.\n\nAs a descriptive matter, it's probably true that most of the justices imagine themselves as devotees to a particular philosophy of judging, rather than as partisans carrying out a predetermined agenda. The six Republican justices who ruled that Trump was allowed to do crimes while he was in office, for example, would probably claim that they were applying a legal theory known as the \" unitary executive \" when they ruled in Trump's favor - and not that they were reflexively protecting their own party leader.\n\nBut this distinction is entirely academic, and it says nothing about how judges actually behave on the bench. As a practical matter, the difference between a hypothetical justice who consistently votes for the Republican Party's preferred outcomes because they've adopted a \"judicial philosophy\" that reliably leads to those outcomes (we'll call this hypothetical justice \" Clarence Thomas \"), and a hypothetical justice who votes for the same outcomes because they are a party loyalist (we'll call this hypothetical justice \" Samuel Alito \"), is nonexistent.\n\nA slightly more sophisticated rebuttal is that the Court's Republicans often vote with the Court's Democrats. This is especially true in cases that do not raise politically contentious issues, but it also occasionally happens in cases involving divisive issues such as abortion . As Sarah Isgur and Dean Jens argue in an early June article making this claim, in the Court's 2022-23 term, \"about 50 percent of the court's cases were decided unanimously.\"\n\nIt is true that the Court still hears a decent share of cases involving technical legal questions - such as when someone seeking certain veterans benefits should file a particular form, or when certain bankruptcy cases may be appealed - that do not divide the justices along partisan lines. But the same can be said about the other branches of government.\n\nIn the month of July alone, for example, Congress enacted, and President Joe Biden signed, 13 new laws . None of these laws divided the two parties, and all of them were passed overwhelmingly - in some cases by a voice vote or by unanimous consent. Yet political reporters have no problem with labeling members of Congress \"Democrats\" or \"Republicans\" even though those members frequently agree about which bills should become law.\n\nSimilarly, if you look at the schedule of, say, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, you will find that it is dominated by the sort of ordinary governance issues that come before governors of either party. DeSantis recently awarded an $8 million grant to help build roads in a Miami park , for example. And he touted the fact that emergency responders in Florida \"pumped more than 194 million gallons of floodwaters\" from Florida communities hit by Hurricane Debby.\n\nIt's likely that, if Florida's governor was a Democrat, the state would have had a similar response to a hurricane. But the fact that DeSantis frequently oversees nonpartisan activity does not make him any less of a Republican.\n\nIt's also true that the Supreme Court, despite its Republican majority, sometimes reverses lower court decisions that would have moved the law aggressively rightward. In its most recent term, the justices reversed several fairly extreme decisions from the far-right United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, including one that could have triggered a second Great Depression .\n\nBut, again, the fact that the Republican justices do not always take maximally right-wing views does not make them less Republican. Nor does it distinguish them from Republicans in other parts of the government. Many GOP members of Congress, for example, oppose providing military aid to Ukraine. But, when a Ukraine aid bill finally reached the House and Senate floors this spring, it was supported by 101 Republican House members and 31 Republican senators .\n\nSimilarly, in 2023, DeSantis proposed unconstitutional legislation that would have limited press freedom in the state of Florida . Yet, while some Florida Republicans backed DeSantis, the bill died after conservative media organizations lobbied Republican lawmakers , warning them that the bill might hurt right-wing outlets.\n\nIt is entirely normal, in other words, for Republican officials to disagree about specific issues, even if they share a partisan identity and a general approach to governance. The fact that the Republican justices also sometimes disagree with each other, or with more extreme Republicans elsewhere in the judiciary, does not make them any less Republican.\n\nThe Republican justices, in other words, behave just like Republicans in other policymaking roles. They sometimes disagree with their fellow Republicans on important issues, but they also share a broad theory of governance, as well as a fairly granular agenda that includes (among other things) eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion, implementing a \" colorblind \" theory of the Constitution, and centralizing regulatory authority in the judicial branch of government.\n\nThis shared agenda, moreover, did not happen by coincidence. It happened because Republicans developed a coherent view of the Constitution and the role of the judiciary, and then built sophisticated institutions to ensure that their judicial appointees share this view.\n\nJournalists do not hesitate to label, say, former Attorney General Bill Barr a \"Republican\" just because he was appointed to high office and not elected, and we should not treat the political appointees on the Supreme Court any differently. We should call the Republican justices \"Republicans,\" and the Democratic justices \"Democrats,\" because that is the best way to educate our readers about how the modern-day Supreme Court actually functions.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nTrump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate his ban on trans military service, after a lower court blocked it.\n\nMany of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools.\n\nThe two Republican justices appeared open to an attack on Obamacare, but ultimately seemed likely to reject it.\n\n﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nThe Oklahoma charter school case is one of two April cases seeking to remake schools in the religious right's image.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAlready distrusted on the economy, Trump's tariffs will be a liability with the voters who put him in office.﻿\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nAs markets tank and the prospect of higher prices becomes more real, the future of President Donald Trump's winning coalition might be on a precipice, too.\n\nTrump's tariff policy, unpopular with the American public in general , is even more unpopular among the voters who gave him the boost he needed to win the 2024 election.\n\nThey include young voters, voters of color, and independents - people who prioritized economic concerns and the price of goods enough to take a wager on a second Trump term. These voters weren't necessarily hardcore MAGA fans - some, such as young voters, aren't necessarily conservative ideologically, for example - but they were dissatisfied with the post-pandemic status quo and the Democratic Party's handling of inflation. Trump and Republican candidates promised them lower prices, and these voters expected them to deliver.\n\nAs the president has focused on immigration, tearing apart the government bureaucracy, and threatening, then delaying, tariffs, these voters, like the American public in general, have said consistently that they want him to focus on lowering costs and beating inflation for good instead.\n\nOver the last few weeks, polling has shown that voters think Trump isn't focusing enough on their top issue: the economy.\n\nAnd the data also show a clear warning sign for Trump and Republicans ahead of next year's midterms: the non-MAGA voters that diversified and expanded their winning 2024 coalition are at risk of defecting, and throwing the future of this popular majority into uncertainty.\n\nThough he's more popular than he was at this point in his presidency in 2017, Trump has been steadily losing support from the American public as perceptions of his economic stewardship have worsened.\n\nImmigration policy remains his strength - just over half of the country supports his harsh, restrictionist approach. But opinions of how he's handling jobs, the economy, and inflation have been steadily dropping.\n\nAmong Trump's voters, a stark divide is emerging between his core base of (primarily white, non-college educated) MAGA supporters, and the less ideological, more diverse (albeit smaller) group of Republican voters who do not consider themselves MAGA-aligned ( YouGov pollsters ask respondents if they identify as MAGA followers ).\n\nFinancial Times data journalist John Burn-Murdoch captured this dynamic last week , noting an \"economic disconnect between Trump's Maga on the one hand and the wider conservative Republican party on the other\" in polling data shared with him by YouGov.\n\nThis shows that the narrow subset of voters who identify as Maga Republicans continue to approve of the president at astronomically high levels, even after the tangible turmoil of the past 10 weeks. But the larger group of other voters who backed Trump last November is rapidly souring on his economic policies and overall record.\n\nThat disconnect is huge when it comes to \"jobs and the economy\" and \"inflation/prices,\" where the MAGA base's approval of Trump's job performance hasn't really budged at all between February and April, while in the category of \"other Trump 2024 voters,\" Trump's approval has plunged.\n\nOne key driver for all of this? Trump's tariff policy specifically. Among all American adults, these tariffs are really unpopular, and respondents specifically think they'll worsen inflation. YouGov's most recent polling from April 2 - the so-called Liberation Day that Trump hyped up to announce his universal tariffs, show this - though it's still early and we'll get more data points in the days to come. More than half, or 51 percent of American adults said they \"somewhat\" or \"strongly\" disapprove of the tariff policy. Just 34 percent said they approved - a nearly 20-point net negative rating.\n\nAnd more than two-thirds of these respondents said they expect the price of everyday goods will increase as a result, including 47 percent of Republicans.\n\nBreaking down these figures by the cohorts of voters that Trump made gains with last year paints a similarly startling picture for the GOP:\n\nAll this suggests that tariffs really are a wedge issue for the kinds of voters Trump needed to pad his tiny popular-vote margin last year, and who helped to deliver him victory.\n\nThey are girding for the opposite of what they expected from his presidency: more economic uncertainty, higher prices, and, potentially, job losses.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue. But the benefits of fighting his lawless deportations are worth the political risks.\n\nTrade wars are easy to win - if you're China.\n\nWhy the executive order on \"disparate impact\" matters.\n\nWith near daily strikes against Yemen's Houthis, is there an end in sight?\n\nThe latest on the trade war.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe Trump years revealed a dark truth: The Republican Party is no longer committed to democracy. These charts tell the story.\n\nby Zack Beauchamp\n\nGraphics by Tim Williams\n\nThe Republican Party is the biggest threat to American democracy today. It is a radical, obstructionist faction that has become hostile to the most basic democratic norm: that the other side should get to wield power when it wins elections.\n\nA few years ago, these statements may have sounded like partisan Democratic hyperbole. But in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol and Trump's acquittal in the Senate on the charge of inciting it, they seem more a plain description of where we're at as a country.\n\nBut how deep does the GOP's problem with democracy run, really? How did things get so bad? And is it likely to get worse?\n\nBelow are 13 charts that illustrate the depth of the problem and how we got here. The story they tell is sobering: At every level, from the elite down to rank-and-file voters, the party is permeated with anti-democratic political attitudes and agendas. And the prospects for rescuing the Republican Party, at least in the short term, look grim indeed.\n\nThis chart shows results from a two-part survey, conducted in late 2020 and early 2021, of hardcore Trump supporters. The political scientists behind the survey, Rachel Blum and Christian Parker, identified so-called \"MAGA voters\" by their activity on pro-Trump Facebook pages. Their subjects are engaged and committed Republican partisans, disproportionately likely to influence conflicts within the party like primary elections.\n\nThese voters, according to Blum and Parker, are hostile to bedrock democratic principles.\n\nVox's German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration's burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday .\n\nThey go further than \"merely\" believing the 2020 election was stolen, a nearly unanimous view among the bunch. Over 90 percent oppose making it easier for people to vote; roughly 70 percent would support a hypothetical third term for Trump (which would be unconstitutional).\n\n\"The MAGA movement,\" Blum and Parker write , \"is a clear and present danger to American democracy.\"\n\nThe ultimate expression of anti-democratic politics is resorting to violence. More than twice as many Republicans as Democrats - nearly two in five Republicans - said in a January poll that force could be justified against their opponents.\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss this kind of finding as meaningless were it not for the January 6 attack on Capitol Hill - and the survey was conducted about three weeks after the attack. Republicans recently saw what political violence in the United States looked like, and a large fraction of the party faithful seemed comfortable with more of it.\n\nThese attitudes are linked to the party elite's rhetoric : The more party leaders like Trump attack the democratic political system as rigged against them, the more Republicans will believe it and conclude that extreme measures are justifiable. A separate study by political scientists Lilliana Mason and Nathan Kalmoe found that \"Republicans who believe Democrats cheated in the election (83 percent in our study) were far likelier to endorse post-election violence.\"\n\nDemocracy is, among other things, a system for taming the disagreements inherent in politics: People compete for power under a set of mutually agreeable rules, seeing each other as rivals within a shared system rather than blood enemies.\n\nBut in the United States today, hyperpolarization is undoing this basic democratic premise: Sizable numbers of Americans on each side see the members of the other party not as political opponents but as existential threats.\n\nThe rise of this dangerous species of \"negative partisanship,\" as political scientists call it, is asymmetric. While many Democrats see Republicans in a dark light, a majority still see them more as political rivals than as enemies. Among Republicans, however, a solid majority see Democrats as their enemy.\n\nWhen you believe the opposing party to be an enemy, the costs of letting them win become too high, and anti-democratic behavior - rigging the game in your favor, even outright violence - starts to become thinkable.\n\nAmerica's founders designed our political system around compromise. But for years now, majorities of Republican voters have opposed compromise on principle, consistently telling pollsters that they prefer politicians who stick to their ideological guns rather than give a little to get things done. It's no wonder the past decade saw unprecedented Republican obstructionism in Congress (more on that later).\n\nThe hostility to compromise on the GOP side has at least two major implications for democracy.\n\nFirst, it has rendered government dysfunctional and ineffective - and consequently has decreased public trust in government . Second, it has pushed Democrats in a more polarized direction; in 2018, Pew found, Democratic support for political compromise plummeted to roughly Republican levels. This seems in part like a reaction to years of GOP behavior: If they aren't going to compromise with us, the Democratic logic goes, then why should we compromise with them?\n\nBut the more Democrats eschew compromise, the more cause Republicans have to see them as fundamentally hostile to conservative values - and to redouble their intransigence. It's a doom loop for political coexistence .\n\nThe Global Party Survey is a 2019 poll of nearly 2,000 experts on political parties from around the world . The survey asked respondents to rate political parties on two axes: the extent to which they are committed to basic democratic principles and their commitment to protecting rights for ethnic minorities.\n\nThis chart shows the results of the survey for all political parties in the OECD, a group of wealthy democratic states, with the two major American parties highlighted in red. The GOP is an extreme outlier compared to mainstream conservative parties in other wealthy democracies, like Canada's CPC or Germany's CDU. Its closest peers are almost uniformly radical right and anti-democratic parties. This includes Turkey's AKP (a regime that is one of the world's leading jailers of journalists ), and Poland's PiS (which has threatened dissenting judges with criminal punishment ).\n\nThe verdict of these experts is clear: The Republican Party is one of the most anti-democratic political parties in the developed world.\n\nSupport for authoritarian ideas in America is closely tied to the country's long-running racial conflicts.\n\nThis chart, from a September 2020 paper by Vanderbilt professor Larry Bartels, shows a statistical analysis of a survey of Republican voters, analyzing the link between respondents' score on a measure of \"ethnic antagonism\" and their support for four anti-democratic statements (e.g., \"the traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it\").\n\nThe graphic shows a clear finding: The higher a voter scores on the ethnic antagonism scale, the more likely they are to support anti-democratic ideas. This held true even when Bartels used regression analyses to compare racial attitudes to other predictors, like support for Trump. \"The strongest predictor by far of these antidemocratic attitudes is ethnic antagonism,\" he writes.\n\nFor students of American history, this shouldn't be a surprise.\n\nThe 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act cemented Democrats as the party of racial equality, causing racially resentful Democrats in the South and elsewhere to defect to the Republican Party. This sorting process, which took place over the next few decades, is the key reason America is so polarized .\n\nIt also explains why Republicans are increasingly willing to endorse anti-democratic political tactics and ideas. In the past, restrictions on the franchise served to protect white political power in a changing country; today, as demographic change threatens to further undermine the central place of white Americans , many are becoming comfortable with an updated version of the Jim Crow South's authoritarian tradition.\n\nThis chart is a little hard to parse, but it illustrates a crucial finding from one of the best recent papers on anti-democratic sentiment in America: how decades of rising partisanship made an anti-democratic GOP possible.\n\nThe paper , from Yale's Matthew Graham and Milan Svolik, uses a number of methods to examine the effect of partisanship on views of democracy. This chart shows a particularly interesting one: a \"natural experiment\" in Montana's 2017 at-large House campaign, during which Republican candidate Greg Gianforte assaulted reporter Ben Jacobs during an attempted interview just before Election Day.\n\nBecause many voters cast their ballots by mail before the assault happened, Graham and Svolik could compare these to the in-person votes after the assault in order to measure how the news of Gianforte's attack shifted voters' behavior.\n\nThe blue lines represent precincts where Gianforte did worse on Election Day than in mail-in ballots; the red lines represent the reverse. What you see is a clear trend: In Democratic-leaning and centrist precincts, Gianforte suffered a penalty. But in general, the more right-leaning a precinct was, the less likely he was to suffer - and the more likely he was to improve on his mail-in numbers.\n\nFor Svolik and Graham, this illustrates a broader point: Extreme partisanship creates the conditions for democratic decline. If you really care about your side wielding power, you're more willing to overlook misbehavior in their attempts to win it. They find evidence that this could apply to partisans of either major party - but only one party nominates candidates like Trump and Gianforte (who won not only the 2017 contest but also his reelection bid in 2018 and Montana's gubernatorial election in 2020).\n\nThe chart here is from a study covering 1997 to 2002 , when Fox News was still being rolled out across the country. The study compared members of Congress in districts where Fox News was available to members in districts where it wasn't, specifically examining how frequently they voted along party lines.\n\nThey found that Republicans in districts with Fox grew considerably more likely to vote with the party as it got closer to election time, whereas Republicans without Fox actually grew less likely to do so. The expansion of Fox News, in short, seemingly served a disciplining function: making Republican members of Congress more afraid of the consequences of breaking with the party come election time and thus less inclined to engage in bipartisan legislative efforts.\n\n\"Members with Fox News in their district behave as if they believe that more Republicans will turn out at the polls by increasing their support for the Republican Party,\" the authors conclude.\n\nThe Republican policy agenda is extremely unpopular. The chart here, taken from Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson's recent book Let Them Eat Tweets , compares the relative popularity of the two major legislative efforts of Trump's first term - tax cuts and Obamacare repeal - to similar high-priority bills in years past. The contrast is striking: The GOP's modern economic agenda is widely disliked even compared to unpopular bills of the past, a finding consistent with a lot of recent polling data .\n\nHacker and Pierson argue that this drives Republicans' emphasis on culture war and anti-Democratic identity politics. This strategy, which they term \"plutocratic populism,\" allows the party's super-wealthy backers to get their tax cuts while the base gets the partisan street fight they crave.\n\nThe GOP can do this because America's political system is profoundly unrepresentative. The coalition it can assemble - overwhelmingly white Christian, heavily rural, and increasingly less educated - is a shrinking minority that has lost the popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential contests. But its voters are ideally positioned to give Republicans advantages in the Electoral College and the Senate, allowing the party to remain viable despite representing significantly fewer voters than the Democrats do.\n\nThis map from the Brennan Center for Justice shows every state that passed a restriction on the franchise between 2010 and 2019. These restrictions, ranging from voter ID laws to felon disenfranchisement, were generally passed by Republican majorities with the intent of hurting turnout among Democratic-leaning constituencies.\n\nRepublican state legislators were sometimes explicit about this: \"Voter ID ... is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania,\" then-state House Majority Leader Mike Turzai bragged during the 2012 presidential election cycle .\n\nBecause Republicans dominated the 2010 midterm elections, Republican statehouses got to control the post-2010 census redistricting process at both the House and state legislative level, leading to extreme gerrymandering in Republican-controlled states unlike anything in Democratic ones.\n\nConservative control of the Supreme Court enabled this state-level push. In 2013, the Court struck down the Voting Rights Act's \" preclearance \" requirement - that states with a history of racial discrimination would be required to get permission from the Justice Department on their maps and other major changes to electoral law. In 2019, another Court ruling paved the way for further partisan gerrymandering.\n\nToday's Senate, where you need 60 votes to get virtually anything done, is a historical anomaly. Its roots can be traced to the unyielding GOP opposition to President Barack Obama in 2009 and 2010, when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell turned the Senate into a dysfunctional body in which priority legislation was routinely subject to a filibuster. When Republicans won a Senate majority in 2014, McConnell found a new way to deny Obama victories: blocking his judicial appointments.\n\nThese actions were an expression of an attitude popular among Republican voters and leaders alike: that Democrats can never be legitimate leaders, even if elected, and thus do not deserve to wield power.\n\nThe Trump presidency was a test of Republican attitudes toward democracy. Time and again, the president abused his authority in ways that would have been unthinkable under previous presidents. Time and again, members of Congress, state party leaders, right-wing media stars, and rank-and-file voters looked the other way - or even cheered him on.\n\nThe chart here, which shows two NBC polls taken about a year apart, is particularly striking. It shows that support for Trump's first and second impeachment among Republicans remained exactly the same among Republicans: 8 percent.\n\nTrump was impeached the first time because he tried to interfere with the integrity of the 2020 presidential election - attempting to strong-arm the Ukrainian president into opening up a bogus investigation into Joe Biden. Trump was impeached the second time because he ginned up a mob to attack the Capitol to disrupt the counting of the votes from the Electoral College.\n\nAnd yet in both cases, the percentage of Republicans who supported impeaching him was the same - a measly 8 percent. There's just very little popular appetite in the GOP for punishing anti-democratic excesses by Trump, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThis chart shows the results of a Morning Consult poll on the 2024 Republican primary held after Trump's second impeachment trial. It found that 54 percent of Republicans would choose Trump again, even when given a wide range of alternative possibilities. Six percent would choose his son Donald Trump Jr. - who obviously wouldn't run if his father did - putting the Trump family support in the GOP primary electorate at around 60 percent.\n\nThis shouldn't really be surprising.\n\nAll the reasons for the GOP's turn against democracy - backlash to racial progress, rising partisanship, a powerful right-wing media sphere - remain in force after Trump. The leadership is still afraid of Trump and the anti-democratic MAGA movement he commands.\n\nMore fundamentally, they are still committed to a political approach that can't win in a majoritarian system, requiring the defense of the undemocratic status quo in institutions like the Senate and in state-level electoral rules. Republicans still control the bulk of statehouses and are gearing up for a new round of voter suppression bills and extreme gerrymandering in electorally vital states like Georgia and Texas.\n\nIt's very hard to see how any of this gets better.

Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and ardent Trump supporter, made headlines when he spoke out -- first on Fox News last week and in recent days on his podcast \"Verdict.\"\n\n\"Tariffs are a tax on consumers, and I'm not a fan of jacking up taxes on American consumers, so my hope is these tariffs are short-lived, and they serve as leverage to lower tariffs across the globe,\" Cruz told Fox Business host Larry Kudlow.\n\nCruz reiterated that point on his podcast, saying it would be a win if the administration used the policy as leverage to quickly negotiate down tariffs imposed by other nations but if it stays in place long term it could increase inflation, hurt job growth and possibly put the U.S. into a recession -- the latter of which Cruz said would result in a \"bloodbath\" for the Republican Party in the 2026 midterm election.\n\n\"If we're in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now with massive American tariffs and massive tariffs on American goods in every other country on Earth, it's a terrible outcome,\" he said on Friday.\n\nDuring an episode of his podcast on Monday, Cruz said that while Trump's tariffs were \"important\"-- especially in order to bring manufacturing jobs back to America -- it would be \"really bad\" for the country if they remain permanent rather than used as a short-term negotiation tool.\n\nCruz suggested there was a \"very active debate within the White House\" over how to move forward.\n\n\"Do we use this as leverage to lower other countries' tariffs and then lower our own tariffs to reflect that? Or do we leave these tariffs up forever and ever and ever?\" Cruz said. \"There are angels and demons... on each of President Trump's shoulders, urging him to use them as leverage or keep them forever.\"\n\nCruz said that Elon Musk was one of the \"angels,\" based on recent comments the tech billionaire made about his hope for lower tariffs and \"complete freedom of trade between the United States and Europe.\"\n\n\"So when I talked about angels and demons ... Elon is one of the angels. This is a good, good voice that is focused on us, jobs that I hope the president is listening to. I hope the president is listening to Elon Musk.\"\n\nAsked on Monday to respond to the comments from his fellow Texas Republican, Sen. John Cornyn told reporters, \"Obviously nobody wants a recession, but I expect -- it looks like here at least in the near term -- that there's deals to be made. And President Trump if he's anything he's a deal maker and I remain hopeful that a deal can be made on many of these tariffs that will avoid any negative economic consequences long term.\"\n\nTrump officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Agriculture Secretary Broke Rollins, were confronted with his comments during Sunday morning news shows. They largely sidestepped the comments as they projected optimism about the policy's long term impact.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, voiced similar concerns as Cruz.\n\n\"Tariffs are taxes and Americans are paying the price,\" Paul wrote on X last week.\n\nPaul also spoke on the Senate floor criticizing Trump's argument that the tariffs are necessary because of what he claimed was a \"national emergency\" regarding trade deficits. Paul said Congress needed to reassert its constitutional power to regulate tariffs and foreign trade.\n\n\"I am a Republican. I am a supporter of Donald Trump ,\" Paul said. \"But this is a bipartisan problem. I don't care if the president is a Republican or a Democrat. I don't want to live under emergency rule. I don't want to live where my representatives cannot speak for me and have a check and balance on power.\"\n\n\"One person can make a mistake and guess what -- tariffs are a terrible mistake,\" Paul said.\n\n\"Tariffs are like whiskey: A little whiskey, under the right circumstances, can be refreshing -- but too much whiskey, under the wrong circumstances, can make you drunk as a goat,\" Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said last week.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, introduced a bill last week that would require Congress to approve any new tariffs. Grassley teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell on the legislation.\n\nCantwell said on CBS News \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that seven Republicans were on board with the bill. Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told CBS he was \"beginning support\" for a similar measure in the House.\n\nBut the legislation faces an uphill battle, as it would need significant Republican support in both chambers to pass and Speaker Mike Johnson opposes the the idea.\n\nAnd so far, there are limited signs of any widespread cracks in overall support for Trump.\n\nSen. John Barrasso, a member of Republican leadership, said on Sunday that he believed Trump's actions on tariffs were constitutional.\n\n\"So, in terms of the tariffs, I believe they're a tool, and I think we have to go after China,\" Barrasso said on CBS. \"They have been abusing us for years, and I believe the President is on firm constitutional grounds.\"\n\nOn Monday, according to a White House statement sent to Senate Republicans and obtained by ABC News, Trump vowed to veto a bipartisan bill seeking to limit his authority to impose tariffs\n\n\"If passed, this bill would dangerously hamper the President's authority and duty to determine our foreign policy and protect our national security,\" the statement reads.\n\nHouse and Senate lawmakers are returning to Washington on Monday.\n\nABC News' Allison Pecorin and Jay O'Brien contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Senate Republicans pass budget blueprint after all-night session\n\nDemocrats warned the blueprint could lead to cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nAfter about six hours of amendment votes, the Senate approved a budget blueprint Saturday morning by a vote of 51-48.\n\nRepublican Sens. Rand Paul and Susan Collins cast votes against the resolution. Every other Republican in the chamber voted for it, and every Democrat voted against it.\n\nThe resolution only needed a simple majority of votes to pass, so it now heads to the House for further consideration.\n\nIf the House also approves the proposal, it will unlock the next step in the reconciliation process and will allow committees in both the House and the Senate to begin drafting legislation aimed at accomplishing Republican wish-list items such as raising the debt ceiling, increasing border security and extending President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts.\n\nHouse Republican leaders are urging their conference to support the measure. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and top leaders said the Senate-passed resolution will come up for a vote in the House next week, according to a \"Dear Colleague\" letter obtained by ABC News.\n\nHowever, this is contingent upon House Republicans being able to adopt a \"rule\" on the floor to advance legislation, which is unclear amid a standoff over parental proxy voting .\n\n\"Adopting the Senate's amendment to the House resolution will allow us to finally begin the most important phase of this process: drafting the reconciliation bill that will deliver on President Trump's agenda and our promises to the American people,\" the GOP leaders wrote in the letter.\n\nIf all members are voting and present, Johnson can only afford to lose three members of his caucus on the vote -- a fourth would tank the bill.\n\nSeveral Republicans have publicly expressed opposition to the Senate bill. House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, slammed the measure, calling it \"unserious\" and \"disappointing\" in a statement on Saturday.\n\n\"If the Senate's 'Jekyll and Hyde' budget is put on the House floor, I will vote no,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, posted on X, later adding, \"Failure is not an option. And the Senate's budget is a path to failure.\"\n\n\"The Senate is free to put pen to paper to draft its reconciliation bill, but I can't support House passage of the Senate changes to our budget resolution until I see the actual spending and deficit reduction plans to enact President Trump's America First agenda,\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., posted on X.\n\nJohnson will have his work cut out for him to try to get this bill across the finish line next week and will likely rely on help from Trump.\n\nThe final package, if Republicans can agree on it, will be able to be passed with a simple majority of votes in both chambers.\n\nDemocrats were powerless to stop the resolution from moving forward Saturday morning, but they put up a fight by forcing votes on a number of amendments, including amendments on protecting access to Medicare and Medicaid, modifying or eliminating some of Trump's tariffs and protecting funding for caregivers for children and the elderly.\n\nThe Senate completed its vote-a-rama just after 2:30 a.m.\n\nThough Republicans defeated the most eye-popping of the Democratic amendments, some that were offered got a sprinkling of across-the-aisle support from a handful of GOP defectors, signaling the challenges ahead in drafting legislation that's palatable to enough Republicans to pass muster when it comes up for a final vote.\n\nThough an amendment that would have struck the instructions governing massive spending cuts to the House Energy and Commerce Committee failed, it got the support of three GOP senators: Collins, Josh Hawley and Lisa Murkowski.\n\nThis is the budget instruction that many Democrats say presents a risk to Medicare and Medicaid funding, signaling a possible hazard on the path ahead for any package that is cobbled together. Collins has signaled that concerns about cuts in this area of the package is why she voted against the entire resolution.\n\nCollins, Murkowski and Hawley also supported the amendment to protect funding for caregivers.\n\nWith Vice President J.D. Vance's tiebreaking vote, Senate Republicans will only be able to lose three members of its caucus when a final package is put together.\n\nThe Senate will return to Washington on Monday for one more week of work before a two-week recess.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "The GOP is Trump's party now\n\nMost Republicans in Congress were elected in the Trump era.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump nominated anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of health and human services and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, political observers - us included - wondered whether the Republican-controlled Senate would sign off on these controversial nominees . We likely got our answer last week, when both of their nominations passed out of committee , a good omen for their chances on the Senate floor. No Republican senators voted against them.\n\nIn retrospect, this shouldn't have been surprising. Traditional Republicans who might be willing to stand up to Trump are a dying breed in Washington. The GOP caucus saw a record amount of turnover during Trump's first term, with the result that a majority of Republicans in Congress today were first elected in the Trump era - and these new members are more conservative than those they replaced.\n\nLet me take you back just eight years ago to Jan. 20, 2017. On the day Trump took office for the first time, there were 293 Republican members of the House and Senate. Few, if any, of them were products of the Trump movement; the new president had won the Republican nomination over the opposition of many GOP elites, and few had expected him to win the general election and actually serve alongside them.\n\nBut Trump proved his doubters wrong and quickly got to work refashioning the Republican Party into the party of Trump . The proof of his success is in the numbers: Today, only 121 of those 293 B.T. (Before Trump) Republican legislators (41 percent) still have an office on Capitol Hill.\n\nSome of this, of course, is normal attrition. Nineteen of the Republicans who left Congress did so to seek another office, something House members do all the time. Thirty lost a general election, indicating they didn't want to leave Congress. Some of the 70 who retired from elected office, such as 82-year-old former Rep. Kay Granger, probably did so for age or health reasons rather than political ones. There were even four Republican members of Congress who died in office.\n\nBut some undeniably left because they no longer fit in in Trump's GOP. Most obviously, 10 lost a primary election to a fellow Republican, including former Reps. Liz Cheney, Jaime Herrera Beutler and Tom Rice, who all faced a Trump-backed primary challenger after voting to impeach him in 2021. Several others, like Trump critics former Sen. Jeff Flake and former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, likely chose not to run for reelection because they were worried they would meet the same fate. Other departed Republicans, like former Sen. Rob Portman , former Speaker Paul Ryan and former Rep. Ken Buck , expressed frustration with the direction of their party on their way out the door. Two, former Reps. Justin Amash and Paul Mitchell , even left the Republican Party before retiring from Congress.\n\nWe can't give truth serum to every retired Republican to ascertain exactly why they decided to leave, but the data speaks for itself. According to data collected by Ballotpedia and 538, more members of the president's party left the House during 2017-2020 than during any president's first term over the last 60 years.\n\nWhat's more, the 172 B.T. Republicans no longer in office were, on the whole, a bit more moderate than the 121 who remain. DW-NOMINATE is a metric that quantifies the ideology of members of Congress using their voting records, placing them on a scale from 1 (most conservative) to -1 (most liberal). The average DW-NOMINATE score of the 172 departed members was 0.480, but the average score of those who remain is 0.493. And while 59 percent of B.T. Republicans overall are no longer in office, over two-thirds of those who had DW-NOMINATE scores under 0.300 are now gone.\n\nBut the departure of this generally more moderate bloc of Republicans is only half the story. Equally important is how conservative their replacements are. In addition to the 121 holdovers, 150 Republicans have been elected to the House or Senate since 2017.* Thirty-two of them were just elected for the first time in 2024, so they don't have a DW-NOMINATE score yet because they haven't taken enough votes, but the other 118 of them have an average DW-NOMINATE score of 0.544 - significantly more conservative than not only the 172 Republicans they replaced, but also their 121 longer-tenured colleagues.\n\nThis group includes 21 recently elected Republicans with DW-NOMINATE scores above 0.700, including firebrands like Reps. Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Sen. Tommy Tuberville. It includes only 10 Republicans with DW-NOMINATE scores under 0.300. This is virtually the mirror image of the B.T. Republicans they replaced: 10 of them had scores above 0.700, while 23 had scores below 0.300.\n\nMore conservative voting records don't necessarily equate to \"Trumpier\" (although the term \"conservative\" has been redefined in recent years to be basically synonymous with pro-Trump ), but this new cadre is pretty Trumpy, too. Trump endorsed 69 percent (104 of 150) of them in their most recent Republican primaries, compared with 74 percent (89) of the 121 holdovers from before his first term. Granted, Trump is not stingy about handing out endorsements - especially to incumbents who are already virtually guaranteed to win their primary - but he does bestow them only on people who are in his good graces. So it's fair to say that a majority of these newcomers, and of Republicans as a whole, are at least tolerant of Trumpism - if not full-throated fans of it.\n\nWith Republicans in full control of the federal government, Trump's opponents are basically powerless to do anything but hope that people within his own party will check his power. But the days of former Sens. Mitt Romney and John McCain standing up to Trump are largely over, because people like Mitt Romney and John McCain aren't in Congress anymore. The Republican caucus is mostly not the same as it was in Trump's first term, so don't expect the president to meet the same resistance.\n\n*The remaining 22 B.T. Republicans from 2017 were replaced by Democrats.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "House Republicans narrowly pass budget blueprint for Trump's agenda after last-minute drama\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson faced a major test to rally enough GOP votes for passage.\n\nFollowing chaos and delay, the House on Tuesday passed the Republican budget resolution to start the process to enact President Donald Trump's legislative agenda by a vote of 217-215 -- a big and critical win for Speaker Mike Johnson, who was dealing with an extremely narrow GOP majority.\n\nGOP leaders were able to successfully flip Reps. Tim Burchett, Warren Davidson and Victoria Spartz, three of four holdouts. The other, Rep. Thomas Massie, was the only Republican who voted against the resolution. Republicans could afford to lose only one vote.\n\n\"A lot of work yet to be done, but we're going to celebrate tonight, and we'll roll up our sleeves and get right back at it in the morning,\" Johnson said to reporters after the vote.\n\nIt was not clear whether Republicans would have the votes to pass the measure on Tuesday afternoon and into the evening. At least four Republicans members had said they would vote no on the plan and Johnson could afford only one defection.\n\nHouse Republicans held open their first vote Tuesday night for more than an hour as leadership tried to wrangle votes for the funding resolution and Democrats protested.\n\nGOP leaders then briefly pulled the budget resolution -- the next vote in a series -- from the schedule and rescheduled it a few minutes later and called the entire House back to the chamber.\n\nDemocratic leaders were able to get more of their members to attend the critical vote. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, who is on maternity leave, showed up to vote with her son. Rep. Kevin Mullin, who has a medical condition, showed up with a walker. House Democratic leaders complained in a message to Democrats that Johnson was trying to \"jam\" the budget resolution through after assuring them there would be no further votes in the House for the night.\n\nBefore the vote, Johnson told reporters, \"We are trying to work through concerns and issues. A lot of people want to make sure we are cutting an appropriate amount ... it's a very complicated negotiation ... we will get there.\"\n\nThe resolution now heads to the Senate, where it is an open question as to what leadership will do with the blueprint. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has a different approach in the upper chamber -- focusing one bill on defense and border security spending and a later one that would deal with tax cuts and the debt ceiling, although the president has wholly endorsed the House Republican blueprint.\n\nRepublicans plan to use reconciliation, a tactic that requires only a simple majority to pass. But under reconciliation, both chambers must adopt the exact same resolution.\n\n\"This is the first important step in opening up the reconciliation process. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us,\" Johnson said after the vote. \"We are going to deliver the America First agenda. We're going to deliver all of it, not just parts of it, and this is the first step of that process.\"\n\nRepublicans leaned on Trump to pressure the holdouts and other GOP members who were undecided.\n\n\"The president has talked to a number of members. He's made his intentions well known and he wants them to vote for this and move it along so we can start the process,\" Johnson said.\n\nBut later Tuesday, while signing executive orders in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm not involved in that. They know what I want.\"\n\nBurchett told ABC News that he spoke to Trump, but declined to divulge details on the conversation.\n\nJohnson earlier was uncertain if the vote would happen Tuesday, suggesting it could get pushed.\n\n\"There may be a vote tonight. There may not be. Stay tuned. That's why you get paid. Hang around here,\" he said to reporters.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise defended the budget -- contending that Democrats were \"lying\" when they asserted that Republicans are primed to make deep cuts to Medicaid.\n\n\"This bill doesn't even mention the word 'Medicaid' a single time, and yet, all Democrats are doing is lying about what's in the budget because they don't want to talk about the truth,\" Scalise said. \"Instead of just sitting back and licking their wounds that they're completely out of touch with the American people, their only choice is to resort to lying about what's in this vote today. There is no Medicaid in this bill. There are no Medicaid cuts in this bill. Yet that's all they're saying.\"\n\nWhile the blueprint itself does not mention Medicaid directly, it sets a goal of at least $2 trillion in cuts to mandatory federal spending, which includes funding for entitlement programs like Medicaid and Medicare, though Social Security is exempt from the process.\n\nJohnson and his leadership team worked for weeks to mollify concerns.\n\nFollowing a closed-door conference meeting Tuesday, Massie quipped that GOP leaders have \"convinced him\" to vote no -- predicting the measure would actually increase the deficit by billions of dollars.\n\nNevertheless, Johnson defended the blueprint.\n\n\"The objective and our commitment has always been deficit neutrality. That's the goal here. If we can reduce the deficit, even better,\" Johnson said responding to accusations that the plan would increase the deficit.\n\nSome additional Republicans were undecided, including New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, stressing she was acting on behalf of her aging constituency.\n\n\"I'm still undecided, but I'm leaning more towards yes because I've gotten some clarity and assurances that make me feel comfortable allowing this process to move forward,\" she said. \"We have to make sure that leadership includes those of us who have large Medicaid populations in that process.\"\n\nSelf-proclaimed \"budget hawk\" Georgia Rep. Rich McCormick said earlier he was still \"in discussions\" on whether or not to back the resolution.\n\n\"I'd like us to be more aggressive on spending cuts so we can save on things like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,\" he said.\n\n\"I am trying to figure out exactly what this entails... how this bill is going to affect the actual hard numbers, and that's what I'm interested in,\" he said.\n\nHouse Democrats gathered on the Capitol steps Tuesday afternoon to protest an \"assault\" on democracy and the \"reckless Republican budget.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries led the group of lawmakers, declaring that Democrats have unified their opposition against the measure.\n\n\"So let me be clear, House Democrats will not provide a single vote to this reckless Republican budget, not one, not one, not one. They will not get a single Democratic vote. Why? Because we're voting with the American people,\" he said.\n\nJeffries said the GOP budget plan \"represents the largest Medicaid cut in American history,\" adding that \"children will be devastated. Families will be devastated. People with disabilities will be devastated. Seniors will be devastated. Hospitals will be devastated; nursing homes will be devastated.\"\n\n\"Everything we care about is under assault. The economy is under assault. The safety net is under assault. Our very way of life as a country is under assault. Democracy itself is under assault. Donald Trump, the administration and House Republicans are hurting the American people,\" he said.\n\n-ABC News' Lalee Ibssa contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Republicans start 2025 with the smallest House majority since 1931\n\nNarrow margins will challenge Speaker Mike Johnson and test Trump's influence.\n\nLast Friday, we got a first look at how the closely-divided U.S. House of Representatives may have to operate in 2025. Republican Rep. Mike Johnson held onto the speakership by the skin of his teeth: He needed support from all but one sitting member of the House Republican Conference to win the absolute slimmest of victories.\n\nThe GOP is going to have to get used to this reality: House Republicans begin the 119th Congress with just about the narrowest majority that any party has had since the House expanded to 435 seats after the 1910 census . Wrangling the Republican conference and maintaining party unity will be critical for Johnson, President-elect Donald Trump and other party leaders to have the necessary working majority to achieve their legislative plans. Plus, that could get even harder in the next few months, as Trump is expected to tap at least two more House Republicans as he continues filling out his Cabinet.\n\nAt the moment, Republicans have 219 sitting members, just one more seat than the minimum 218 necessary to pass legislation in the 434-member House, where Democrats hold 215 seats and there's one vacancy (due to the resignation of former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz). Tellingly, Johnson won the speakership on the first ballot with exactly 218 votes, leaving him no room to spare. In fact, it initially looked like Johnson was two votes short of that threshold, and the House held the vote open for about two hours so that Johnson could parley with a couple of holdouts who eventually switched their votes to him. As a result, Johnson became the first speaker candidate in the past 112 years to win without a single vote beyond the bare minimum needed for a majority.\n\nThat said, close speaker elections have become commonplace in recent years: six of the 10 narrowest wins since the House expanded to 435 seats happened in the past 12 years. Johnson knows about this firsthand: In October 2023, Johnson won the speakership with five votes to spare on the fourth ballot after the leadership post came open following the maneuvering of a small cadre of hard-right Republicans to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy from office . McCarthy himself had only won the speakership in January 2023 with just one vote to spare, and after no small amount of maneuvering - that victory came after a modern record of 15 ballots , with six House Republicans voting \"present\" on the final ballot, lowering the number of votes McCarthy needed to reach a majority (he won 216 votes while needing 215).\n\nInternal strife has played a role in the other recent highly-contested speaker elections, too. In January 2013, Republicans held 233 seats, but Speaker John Boehner encountered difficulty thanks to 10 House Republicans who voted for other candidates or \"present.\" Two years later, Republicans had a bigger majority (246 seats), but opposition to Boehner more than doubled , to 25. The constant pushback against Boehner eventually prompted him to leave office in October 2015. Some Democrats, meanwhile, opposed Rep. Nancy Pelosi's return to the speakership after her party won back the House in the 2018 midterms, with 15 Democrats voting against her.\n\nAs these examples illustrate, disagreements within the majority party have regularly complicated recent speaker elections - this despite living in an era of greater division between the parties, with Republicans having moved further to the right and Democrats to the left. And as the first vote taken in each new congress, the dynamics of a contentious speaker vote could very well give us some clues to the road ahead for the new majority party.\n\nNow, the good news for Johnson is that Trump's influence clearly compelled some Johnson critics in his party's right-most flank to stay in line to a greater extent than we might have expected. During the roll call vote for speaker, seven Republicans initially didn't answer and three voted for other candidates. But Trump brought the holdouts home for Johnson using both olive branches and arrows . Two of the three who voted for other candidates - Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Keith Self of Texas - switched their votes to Johnson after receiving phone calls from Trump . As for those who initially withheld their votes, the move seemed mostly symbolic in the wake of Trump's endorsement of Johnson . For example, Texas Rep. Chip Roy, one of Johnson's sternest intraparty critics , had already reluctantly agreed to vote for Johnson after Trump told the Texan that he wouldn't attack Roy on social media as he did last month when Roy opposed Trump's proposal to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nNevertheless, just because Johnson has Trump's backing now doesn't mean he will keep it. Johnson faces the difficult task of advancing Trump-backed legislation addressing border security, immigration, taxes and energy - which Trump has pushed to happen in one, or perhaps two , large bills - and which would require Johnson to maintain almost complete Republican support at every point in the process.\n\nEven with Trump's seemingly unifying presence among House Republicans, the potential for intraparty discord to trip up the GOP is especially outsized right now because of how slim their majority is. In fact, Republicans' current 219-seat majority is the narrowest House majority held by either party in nearly a century, giving them just one more seat than the 218 votes necessary to pass a measure if all 434 sitting members vote.\n\nPlus, the math may get even harder for Johnson right after Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Around that time, Florida Rep. Mike Waltz will resign to become Trump's national security adviser , while New York Rep. Elise Stefanik looks on track to secure Senate confirmation as the country's next ambassador to the U.N. With those two leaving office, House Republicans will hold just a 217-to-215 seat edge for at least a couple of months, meaning that Johnson won't be able to lose a single Republican on any measure, assuming every sitting member casts a vote and all Democrats are opposed. The picture should improve slightly for the GOP as they will likely win the three vacant or soon-to-be vacant seats in spring special elections to return to a 220-seat majority - but all of this is sure to be a thorn in Johnson's side as he navigates the start of Trump's new presidency.\n\nThat reality is in part a result of our current era of highly competitive elections , which have often produced a House where the majority party holds just a small advantage, making any intraparty disunity all the more impactful. The 119th Congress actually marks the third straight time the House has opened with the majority party holding 222 or fewer seats, which is the first time three consecutive congresses have been this closely divided since the House expanded to 435 seats in 1913.\n\nOf course, the House has been narrowly divided in the past. Most recently, Republicans began the 106th and 107th congresses with 222 or fewer seats around the turn of the millennium. But contrary to the intraparty discord we've seen in the last handful of speaker elections, Republican Rep. Dennis Hastert won the speakership with little GOP opposition in both of those cases (albeit the first time after the party's initial speaker nominee, Bob Livingston, withdrew and resigned ).\n\nAnd beyond that, you have to go back nearly a century to find a majority party holding an edge on par with - or even slimmer - than the one Republicans have to start the 119th Congress. Although Democrats made huge gains in the November 1930 midterms amid the start of the Great Depression, it looked like Republicans would just hold onto a majority. But because the 72nd Congress didn't hold its first session until December 1931, vacancies and special elections in the interim produced a 219-to-214 seat Democratic majority that elected Rep. John Nance Garner as speaker.\n\nGoing even further back, the 65th Congress (which opened in April 1917) was the last time neither major party held an outright majority on its own: House Democrats lost their outright majority in the 1916 election, falling to 213 seats, but they retained control of the chamber over the 214-seat GOP thanks to cooperation from five third-party House members (three Progressives, a Prohibitionist, and a Socialist).\n\nIt remains to be seen just how much intraparty factionalism and the GOP's slim majority will affect Republican efforts to implement Trump's plans. But there's little question that the incredibly narrow GOP edge in the House leaves the party little room for error.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Republican voters look like they're sticking with Trump: Is the primary too 'boring' to matter?\n\n\"It's almost like it's already been decided,\" said one operative.\n\nKurt Kreuger attended a presidential campaign event for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Thursday -- not that he felt it would make much of a difference.\n\nKreuger, a 33-year-old from the city, is still deciding who to vote for in Monday's caucuses , which kick off the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination after months of candidates on the trail. Kreuger said he's leaning toward backing entrepreneur and commentator Vivek Ramaswamy but is seriously weighing all of his options after voting for former President Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nBut while his personal ballot is still up for grabs, he said, the race overall isn't.\n\n\"Trump's going to win the caucus,\" Kreuger predicted to ABC News. \"There's no chance anybody else wins.\"\n\nThat sentiment was echoed in recent interviews with a dozen voters and Republican operatives in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina which, along with the Nevada caucuses, encompass the first phase of the primary election.\n\nAccording to voter and expert interviews -- and nearly all polling -- Republicans prefer one candidate to the others: Trump, who has campaigned on pledging to dismantle the Biden administration's record. The former president often focuses on a message of \"retribution\" and touts anti-immigrant and anti-government policies.\n\nDespite the initially crowded field of candidates running against him and despite the intensive media coverage and despite the frequent campaign stops and impassioned pitches from candidates like Haley and Florida Gov. Ron Desantis -- despite all of that and despite Republican voters voicing concerns about having Trump be their White House nominee again, pre-vote polls show he remains the favorite choice.\n\nWith hours to go until ballots start being cast, Trump maintains double-digit leads not just in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina but across the rest of the country, as well as nationally, according to 538's averages .\n\nAll of that has added up to a technically competitive contest that feels like anything but, some voters and operatives said.\n\n\"It is boring,\" New Hampshire GOP strategist Dave Carney said. \"It's technically open, but it's really running against a two-time presidential nominee.\"\n\nFor more signs of how secondary the run-up to the Iowa caucuses has recently felt, look no further that the streets of the state's capitol city just days before the main event that has for years been positioned as key on the road to the White House (despite history showing otherwise ).\n\nOn one midday afternoon last week, blustering winds whipped blankets of snow from the once-in-a-decade storm around Des Moines, where the streets were deserted, save for a handful of vehicles dotting the roads.\n\nDue to the treacherous weather, nearly all campaigns altered or flat-out canceled events -- further overshadowing their final pitches to voters. Trump, the front-runner, who has decided to campaign much less than some competitors, canceled three of his four scheduled in-person appearances this weekend, opting instead for telerallies and off-the-record stops.\n\nFew campaign signs dotted the sidewalks heading into Monday. The lively caucus pre-parties and raucous organizing events that would light up the city in past cycles have not returned; even the large-scale watering holes and popular hotel bars for the throngs of out-of-state media were seen teeming with dozens, rather than hundreds.\n\nThat atmosphere marks a stark departure -- both from the 2016 Republican nominating contest, in which first-time candidate Trump ultimately emerged victorious, and the 2020 Democratic primary, when President Joe Biden won out only after months of closely watched campaigning in a bustling field.\n\n\"This time eight years ago, we had tons of candidate events and stops where you would have two and three things that day. They would be doing local county party events, they'd be doing meetings, they'd be doing coffees and meet-and-greets and bus tours. And so, I just don't know if the tone is the same as it was eight years ago in that it's almost like it's already been decided,\" said one well-connected South Carolina GOP operative who asked for anonymity to speak about the race.\n\nThat has even some of the most ardent supporters of Trump's rivals managing their expectations in the early states.\n\nWhen asked what the best-case scenario would be for Haley in Iowa, Sanford Owens, a volunteer from Oregon who traveled all the way to Cedar Rapids, told ABC News it would be Haley getting \"within five to eight points\" of Trump -- a margin that polling suggests would be a massive upset.\n\n\"I would be popping the champagne. I'm popping it baby. And I'm getting the good stuff: the Veuve!\" Owens said.\n\nTo be certain, Trump's rivals are working to motivate Iowans to vote in the caucuses.\n\n\"The blizzard is not going to stop us, we will fight. The wind chill is not going to stop us, we will fight,\" DeSantis said at an event in Davenport on Saturday night. \"The media's not going to stop us, we will fight. The polls won't stop us, we will fight. We have in our power to fix this country.\"\n\nStill, others sounded less certain.\n\n\"I just am hopeful that a lot of people will participate on Monday, and we'll see where that goes,\" said Debbie Neumeyer of Robins, Iowa, who plans on caucusing for Haley.\n\nSome Republicans warned of apathy.\n\nBeyond Trump's yawning lead, Iowans are expected to continue to face dangerously cold weather on Monday, sparking speculation that could dampen turnout.\n\nSome operatives have questioned if Trump's voters will feel emboldened enough to brave the elements or if they feel comfortable that the caucuses are in the bag.\n\nHowever, others warned the cold and Trump's advantage combined could make supporters of other candidates wonder if it's even worth voting if the contest is already considered out of reach.\n\n\"My dad specifically told me he wanted to vote for Haley, but he isn't sure that it's going to be worth going to caucus on caucus night because he thinks that Trump is gonna run away with it anyway. So, what's the point?\" said one GOP strategist with experience working in Iowa, who asked not to be quoted by name because of professional relationships. \"So, I literally told him, 'It's gonna come down to turnout from people like you. If you think that it's not worth showing up, then he is going to run away with it.'\"\n\nABC News' Hannah Demissie and Will McDuffie contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Nikki Haley is projected to win Washington, D.C.'s Republican primary on Sunday, ABC News reports, her first primary win over former President Donald Trump , but one that does little to ameliorate the daunting task of actually leapfrogging him in the race for the GOP nomination.\n\nThe projected win will make Haley the first woman to ever win a Republican presidential primary or caucus.\n\nAccording to research from the Rutgers University Center for American Women and Politics about major female presidential candidates, Republican candidate Margaret Chase Smith (1964) was the first woman to have her name placed into nomination for President but hadn't won any primaries.\n\nElizabeth Dole ran as a Republican in 1999 but withdrew before the primaries.\n\nMichele Bachmann ran as a Republican in 2012 but withdrew after the Iowa caucuses.\n\nCarly Fiorina ran as a Republican in 2016 but withdrew after New Hampshire (and lost in Iowa and New Hampshire).\n\nHaley campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas highlighted this milestone on X, writing : \"This makes Nikki Haley the first woman to win a Republican primary in U.S. history.\"\n\nNineteen delegates were up for grabs.

      "text": "Senate adopts GOP budget plan after marathon vote series\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  April 5, 2025 / 3:55 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nWashington - Senate Republicans adopted a budget resolution on Saturday after an all-night voting marathon, putting Congress one step closer to enacting President Trump's agenda.\n\nSenate Republicans unveiled a new 70-page budget blueprint Wednesday that lays out a path toward implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities. The resolution aims to make tax cuts that were enacted during Mr. Trump's first term permanent while also authorizing $1.5 trillion in additional tax cuts and raising the debt ceiling by as much as $5 trillion.\n\nThe Senate cleared a procedural hurdle Thursday with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky as the only Republican defection, setting it up for final approval this weekend after senators exhausted all amendment votes during what's known as a \"vote-a-rama.\"\n\nDuring the vote-a-rama, Democrats offered amendments that forced the majority party to cast vote after vote through the night on highly charged political issues, including Medicaid, Social Security and tariffs. The Senate adopted the resolution in a 51-48 vote, teeing it up for a vote in the House as soon as next week. Paul and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine were the only two Republicans who voted against it.\n\nThe Republican blueprint is just the first step in the complicated reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance legislation in the Senate. Taking this route allows Republicans to pass the bill without help from Democrats. Both chambers must adopt identical budget resolutions that direct committees to submit their proposed spending plans before passing a bill meeting Mr. Trump's priorities. The entire process is expected to take months.\n\nSen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 ranking GOP senator, said voters gave Republicans a mission in November, and the Senate budget plan delivers.\n\n\"It fulfills our promises to secure the border, to rebuild our economy and to restore peace through strength,\" Barrasso said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement Saturday that Congress was taking \"smart action to strengthen America's economy and repeal wasteful government spending.\"\n\n\"By advancing this budget resolution, the Senate sends a strong signal to every small business and every working family: President Trump's economic agenda will provide long-term tax certainty,\" he said. \"I look forward to working with House leadership to finish this crucial first step and unlock legislation that strengthens our economic and fiscal foundations.\"\n\nThe compromise resolution comes after Republicans in the House and Senate forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year, before coming together on the path forward. Still, differences exist over where and how to make spending cuts, as leaders have opted to push some of the lingering disagreements down the line.\n\nThe Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just a few billion dollars, while it calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years in the House. The Senate is expected to find far more than the floor outlined in the resolution, but the figures are aimed at giving them flexibility moving forward.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune defended the resolution on Thursday as laying the groundwork for \"transformational investment\" in border security, national defense and the energy sector.\n\nThe South Dakota Republican criticized Democrats, whom he said are \"losing their minds\" over the measure, for claiming the tax relief is \"about handouts to billionaires.\" He said Democrats' \"latest hysteria\" centers on an accounting tactic known as a \"current policy baseline,\" which makes it appear as if making the tax cuts permanent costs nothing.\n\n\"Using the current policy baseline is not some bizarre new gimmick,\" Thune said, adding that \"Democrats' sudden concern for saving money and protecting the character of the Senate is touching.\"\n\nBut Congress usually uses a \"current law baseline\" for budget measures, as required under the 1974 Budget Control Act. This takes into account the expiration of spending provisions. So, the current policy would treat the extension of the Trump tax cuts, which are expiring this year, as a policy that will continue indefinitely and won't cost any new taxpayer dollars. However, the tax cuts were passed in accordance with a current law baseline, which set an expiration date. So extending the cuts would mean incurring new costs, in this case, about $4.5 trillion over the next decade.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Thursday that \"Republicans, in essence, want to pretend like their trillion dollar tax cuts are free - like magic.\"\n\n\"Middle school math students would tell you this is ridiculous,\" Schumer said.\n\nThe framework now goes to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana could bring it up for a vote as soon as next week as he works toward a resolution by Memorial Day.\n\nCaitlin Yilek is a politics reporter at CBSNews.com, based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "The origin of the Republican Party\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJuly 15, 2024 / 5:52 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nWhat happens at the Republican National Convention, being held this week at Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum , will help determine whether Donald Trump - whose vision of America differs sharply from that of President Joe Biden - will return to the White House. But it was a much smaller meeting, in a much smaller town about 90 miles away, that proved every bit as consequential.\n\nOn March 20, 1854, around 50 concerned citizens gathered inside the Little White Schoolhouse in Ripon, Wisconsin, widely believed to be the birthplace of the Republican Party. \"These were people who wanted to form a new party,\" said Russell Blake, a history professor emeritus at nearby Ripon College. \"They were a combination of merchants, farmers, lawyers. It was a town that was only four, five years old. People had only recently moved here.\"\n\nAnd all of them were alarmed by the prospect of slavery spreading westward. \"They believed that the nation had been founded on the supposition that slavery would eventually disappear - they really did believe in what they called a free society,\" Blake said.\n\nBut earlier that same year, Congress had introduced the Kansas-Nebraska Act, allowing settlers in those territories to decide whether slave-holding would be permitted. The earlier Missouri Compromise had prohibited slavery in those areas. For anti-slavery Americans like the ones meeting in Ripon, the Kansas-Nebraska Act was a profound betrayal. The Ripon Herald newspaper, in March 1854, denounced the bill as a \"nefarious scheme.\"\n\nHistorian Richard Brookhiser, senior editor at the National Review, said it fueled outrage at the existing political parties: \"The old parties had failed, and there needed to be some new force in American politics,\" he said, calling the Kansas-Nebraska Act the kind of \"earthquake\" needed to start a new major party.\n\nRipon wasn't the only place where citizens were mobilizing. Ordinary Americans who felt politically homeless were meeting throughout the North. The movement grew so quickly that in 1856 the Republicans fielded a presidential candidate, John Frémont, who came very close to winning, with 114 electoral votes compared to winner James Buchanan's 174 and Millard Fillmore's 8. \"You compare it to other third parties - Ross Perot, or George Wallace, or the Libertarians - no one has had a debut like that,\" Brookhiser said.\n\nJust four years later the Republicans' second candidate for president, Abraham Lincoln, went all the way.\n\nFor nearly 70 years after the Civil War, the GOP dominated the White House. Only two Democrats - Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson - won election during that span.\n\nThat run came to a crashing halt in the early 1930s.\n\n\"The Great Depression practically eliminates it for a while,\" Brookhiser said. \"Hoover is president when the bottom falls out of the stock market, and Roosevelt wins in a landslide in 1932. After World War II, there is a competitive two-party system once again.\"\n\nSo, who makes up the Republican Party today? \"Donald Trump, and those who admire him,\" Brookhiser said. \"That's the short answer.\"\n\n\"That sounds like a party shaped by a single person,\" said Rocca.\n\n\"It is.\"\n\nAsked if the earliest Republicans would recognize today's GOP, Blade said, \"Probably not. I think they would be surprised at the corporatization of America in general, whether that's represented by Republicans or Democrats. Theirs was a world in which everything was on a small scale. The idea of large corporations, like the idea of large slave plantations, probably would have made them nervous.\"\n\nSo, where might the party be in ten years' time? Brookhiser said, \"I don't think either party will implode. I think they've been around too long. There's too much infrastructure, so to speak. When Trump retires or steps down, there'll be plenty of Republicans who are officeholders who'll be lookin' after number one.\"\n\nFor more info:\n\nStory produced by Michelle Kessel.

      "text": "As Democrats overperform in off-year elections, GOP frets over Trump voter turnout\n\nFollow:\n\nA trio of election results this week have Republicans confronting a new reality: not only are they facing political headwinds as the party in power but simultaneously grappling with a dramatic reversal in the partisan preferences of the country's most reliable voters.\n\nFor years, Republicans were seen as the party that dominated lower profile elections outside presidential years, while Democratic voters were less consistent. But under President Donald Trump, Republicans worry their base has shifted to include low propensity voters who turn out for him but are not as motivated as Democrats to show up when he's not on the ballot.\n\nDemocrats have overperformed the top of the 2024 ticket in nearly every special election this year, flipped control of two state Senate seats in Iowa and Pennsylvania, halved the margins for two open US House seats in Florida and won a high-profile Wisconsin state Supreme Court race by a resounding 10 points. While Democrats have said those results are a sign that voters are rejecting the Trump administration's agenda, some top Republicans have raised alarms about turning out the base.\n\n\"The political problem on the Republican side of the aisle is how to get our base to vote in off-cycle elections,\" Vice President JD Vance wrote on X , adding that it was time for the GOP establishment to learn from Trump's political success.\n\nCharlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, argued that Republicans must acknowledge that they are the party of low propensity voters, or people who don't consistently show up to vote.\n\n\"Special elections and off-cycle elections will continue to be a problem without a change of strategy,\" he wrote on X.\n\nKirk, whose organization worked to engage low propensity voters in swing states during the 2024 election cycle, said politics is an \"afterthought\" for many of their voters and Republicans needed to \"begin to fully fund the infrastructure to match the Democrat machine\" ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nTurning out Trump loyalists who vote infrequently could be key to Republicans' electoral fortunes, especially as the president's agenda risks pushing away independent and moderate swing voters.\n\nRepublicans are also hoping to maintain control of the Virginia governor's seat, despite the state's Democratic lean and potentially build on their narrow House and Senate majorities.\n\nThe party that wins the White House historically loses seats in midterm cycle that follows, and voters have become increasingly willing to back split government - Presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden all lost the House two years after first being elected.\n\nOne GOP political operative familiar with House campaigns said the party is still on offense and pointed to the 13 US House districts Trump won in 2024 that are held by Democrats. Republicans have also noted it's too early to say what the political climate, the economy or Trump's approval ratings will look like next year.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that Trump had a 43% approval rating, with 52% of Americans saying they agree tariffs on imported goods would do more harm than good and 57% viewing the president's moves to shake up the economy as too erratic.\n\nThroughout the Trump era, Democrats have pointed to special and off-year election victories and closer-than-expected losses as evidence of a momentum advantage. During Trump's first term, Democrats won a GOP-held Pittsburgh-area US House seat and an Alabama US Senate seat in special elections ahead of winning back the House in 2018. The party also significantly cut into GOP margins in a handful of special elections for deep-red US House seats in states such as Kansas and South Carolina.\n\nMike DuHaime, a former political director of the Republican National Committee, said Republicans would have to learn the same lesson Democrats did under Obama. Despite his 2008 and 2012 wins, Democrats suffered substantial downballot losses in the 2010 and 2014 midterms.\n\n\"When it comes down to turning out Republicans, it takes money, it takes a message, and it takes an exciting candidate,\" DuHaime said.\n\nHe pointed to Wisconsin, where Brad Schimel, a conservative state Supreme Court candidate endorsed by Trump, lost to liberal Susan Crawford. Though Schimel won 63% of the number of votes Trump received in November - exceeding the 60% mark Republicans estimated they needed to win - Crawford won 78% of the number of votes Vice President Kamala Harris received. Schimel lost despite Trump hosting a tele-rally to back him and Tesla CEO Elon Muskcombining with allied groups to spend more than $20 million to boost him .\n\n\"In Wisconsin, the money was certainly there,\" DuHaime. \"Whether or not the message and the candidate were there, that's where the question lies.\"\n\nSean Noble, an Arizona-based Republican strategist, said Republicans have failed over the years to build up a long-lasting get-out-the-vote infrastructure to compete with Democrats.\n\n\"Democrats have an advantage over Republicans on what I would call a permanent infrastructure of turnout that Republicans have never taken the time or effort or money to really build and sustain over the long term,\" he said.\n\nIn 2024, the Trump campaign and its allies made the risky decision to focus on turning out infrequent voters for the president. That bet paid off for the president, but Republicans in other races struggled to harness that support for themselves, even when they shared the ballot with Trump.\n\nWhile Trump won in Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin last year, the Republican Senate candidates he endorsed in those states lost after receiving several thousand fewer votes than the president. The Democratic Senate candidates were able to hold onto most of Vice President Kamala Harris' support or, in the case of Ruben Gallego in Arizona, surpass it.\n\nRepublican pollster Whit Ayres dismissed the idea that the Republican Party as a whole had become the party most likely to benefit from turning out infrequent voters.\n\n\"Donald Trump is president in no small part because of low propensity voters who turn out to vote for him,\" he told CNN. \"That doesn't mean they're going to turn out to vote for other Republicans.\"\n\nAyres said Democrats' performance in recent special and off-year elections was reminiscent of the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats made huge gains in the House of Representatives. To avoid a similar fate next year, he said Republicans would need to avoid unpopular agenda items.\n\n\"You might want to not tank the entire world economy with massive tariffs,\" he said. \"That might be a good start.\"\n\nDemocrats have argued that the issue for Republicans isn't with infrequent voters, but with swing voters who elected Trump to lower prices and improve the economy.\n\n\"Their problem is not that they plan for low propensity voters to vote in these special elections and they're not showing up,\" said Heather Williams, the president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. \"What they're losing is Republicans, either to inaction or questioning their policies.\"\n\nJennifer Konfrst, Iowa's Democratic House Minority Leader, said Democrats in her state wereable to flip a Republican-held state Senate seat thanks to solid candidate recruitment - Democrat Mike Zimmer was an elected school board leader and longtime high school principal in district - and connecting with Democrats who are ready to re-engage in politics after their defeat in November.\n\n\"There are some folks who have just been kind of unplugging for a while,\" she said. \"They are plugged back in now, and they are ready to fight.\"\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democrats pointed to high turnout and Crawford's success in red areas as evidence that she'd won over Trump voters. Crawford won ten counties that backed Trump in November, including Green Bay's Brown County, where Musk gave out two $1 million checks to voters at an event the weekend before the election.\n\n\"There were clearly MAGA voters that were voting for Brad Schimel, but there were a lot of Republican voters that were voting for Susan Crawford,\" Patrick Guarasci, a senior advisor to Crawford's campaign, told CNN.\n\nNational Democrats have become increasingly bullish on their chances of winning back the House after Tuesday's races.\n\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin said recent special elections showed \"voters moving en masse towards the Democratic Party,\" during a press call this week.\n\nState party leaders are echoing that optimism . Florida Democratic Party chair Nikki Fried said this week's special election results should scare any Republican who won by less than 15 pointslast November, while in Wisconsin, chair Ben Wikler said voters in his state sent a clear message: \"Democrats are back.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "The GOP's Trump-centered platform, annotated\n\nBy Zachary B. Wolf and Curt Merrill, CNN\n\nPublished July 9, 2024\n\nRepublicans adopted a new platform for Donald Trumpâs third White House run that mainlines the former presidentâs policies and makes Trump himself a focus of the party. It is a fraction of the length of the 2016 platform and written in Trumpâs voice. Republicans also softened their language on the issue of abortion â angering some anti-abortion activists â and made clear that, like Trump, the party will favor a state-by-state local approach to the issue, meaning they will support efforts to ban abortion outright in some states and allow it to exist in others. Hereâs a look at the full Republican Party platform â their first new platform since 2016.\n\nTrumpâs signature motto is now the official tagline of the Republican Party.\n\nThe idea that the modern United States is leaving people behind is central to Trumpâs populist message. His base of support is built on White voters without a college degree.\n\nPutting the United States above all other countries is central to Trumpâs populism. There are echoes of that in US history. The isolationist effort to keep the United States out of World War II, for instance, was also called âAmerica First.â\n\nThis two-paragraph history of the United States is meant to inspire. It fails to mention the Civil War or the civil rights movement and idealizes the past. It asserts that whatâs needed is not to improve what we have, but to go back to what weâve lost.\n\nIn addition to remaking the Republican Party, this platform is interested in remaking punctuation. All caps, random capitalizations and extreme usage of exclamation points â the mechanics of a Trump social media post â are now the official style rules of the GOP.\n\nMany of the nationâs leaders in recent decades have also been Republicans. This platform criticizes all who came before Trump, and the anti-elitist view is in keeping with the growing fringe claim that an entrenched uniparty has been controlling the country.\n\nHere is some extreme nostalgia for Trumpâs four years in office. Itâs fair to say not everyoneâs spirit was reignited by his presidency.\n\nCiting truth and justice is ironic given Trumpâs demonstrated history of misstating facts and his argument that he would be justified in using the judicial system to go after his political enemies.\n\nImmigration and the border are the issues that have motivated Trumpâs political career, so it makes sense they get top billing in this platform. Elements of his message remain the same from his first run in 2016, but much has changed.\n\nTrump is still promising to build more wall along the southern border, but thereâs no longer any talk of Mexico paying for it. Instead, Republicans say it will be affordable.\n\nThere is also more of a focus on Trumpâs promise to deport millions of undocumented people currently in the United States, for which he has previously floated the idea of using local police forces.\n\nThis is not exactly the same as Trumpâs claim, echoing âMein Kampf,â that some undocumented immigrants were âpoisoning the bloodâ of the country. But arguing that the country would be irrevocably changed by such migrants is adjacent to the controversial â replacement theory â popular with the far right.\n\nRestoring manufacturing jobs has been a promise of both parties. President Joe Biden also points to a resurgence of manufacturing jobs under his watch.\n\nBut it is interesting to see Republicans argue they have been the party of workers. It is at odds with the history of Democrats appealing to union workers. But the evolving base of the GOP now lies among Rust Belt households that feel left behind.\n\nThe United States is an energy superpower. While China, with its reliance on coal and the growth of its renewable energy production, is the worldâs top energy producer, the United States is the second-largest energy producer and the top oil and natural gas producer. This is a matter of disagreement between Republicans and Democrats, particularly as Democrats push the United States to invest more heavily in renewable sources of energy and Trump opposes electric vehicles and actively supports more oil production.\n\nKeeping things simple and putting them in all caps is effective communication. Accomplishing all of these things very quickly would be impossible.\n\nTrump already enacted a large tax cut during his time in the White House. It gave corporations permanent tax breaks, but the tax cuts for workers actually expire after next year. He will have to work to extend his own earlier tax cuts or it will feel like Americans are getting a massive tax hike.\n\nThis pledge to end a tax on tips is a new plank for Republicans. Democrats have long argued for raising minimum wages. The Republican alternative to that seems to be a further tax cut.\n\nIron Dome is the missile defense system in Israel, which the United States helps fund. The US already has missile defense capabilities meant to counter the threat of long-range nuclear weapons. Itâs not clear if Republicans are talking about something completely different here, but the geography of the United States, a massive nation with oceans to the east and west and allies to the north and south, is very different compared with Israel.\n\nNo cuts to Social Security or Medicare AND large tax cuts for workers. It is not surprising there is no mention in these 20 platform priorities of the spiraling national debt. That used to be a major issue for Republicans.\n\nVoter ID laws will no longer suffice for Republicans. Instead of requiring a driverâs license to vote, they are now pushing proof of citizenship.\n\nAnother all caps list, but this is not the same as the 20 promises above.\n\nHow exactly? Simply saying you can bring down prices is one thing. Accomplishing it is something else. The Federal Reserve has tried to tamp down inflation by raising interest rates. Plus, Trumpâs plan to enact new tariffs on goods coming into the United States would, according to many economists, drive up inflation rather than ease it.\n\nThe United States did become the worldâs No. 1 oil producer during Trumpâs presidency. And it has continued to increase oil production under Biden, despite his efforts to push EVs and renewable energy.\n\nThe idea here is that simply having Trump as president and further increasing US defense spending would bring countries such as Russia and China into check. Itâs a debatable idea.\n\nTrump did enact policies meant to cut down on illegal immigration. But as the libertarian CATO institute wrote in 2021, those policies did not end illegal immigration. In fact, Trumpâs focus on the border led to a decrease in the removal of undocumented immigrants during his term in office. There have been more removals under Bidenâs watch, although there has also been a larger volume of undocumented border crossings in recent years.\n\nTrump has said he would model a deportation initiative on âOperation Wetback,â a 1950s government program with a racist and insensitive name launched under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. CNN wrote about that program in 2016, when Trump first mentioned his immigration plan.\n\nThis is quite a phrase to be part of the official Republican Party platform. Is an influx of communists, presumably from China, threatening the United States? It is reminiscent of Trumpâs pledge in 2016 to bar all Muslims from coming to the United States, something that led to a travel ban on several mostly Muslim countries.\n\nA major storyline in the immigration debate has been the busing of migrants by Republican-led states to major Democratic-run cities, including Washington, DC, Chicago and New York. Mayor Eric Adams of New York, in particular, has said that the migrants sent by Texas has created a crisis in his city.\n\nInterestingly, there is nothing in this platform about working toward a comprehensive reform of the immigration and border security system.\n\nWhile Trumpâs 2017 law made tax cuts for corporations permanent, it allowed tax cuts for people to expire after 2025. This was, in large part, to make it appear on paper like the tax law would not wreck the US balance sheet in the ensuing years. Now, Biden also wants to extend most of the tax cuts, although he would allow them to expire for people making more than $400,000. Read more.\n\nAgain, the lack of any discussion of deficit spending or the national debt in this document is a stunning departure for Republicans.\n\nPursuit of cryptocurrency is portrayed here as a personal right. Within this innovation section, with regard to both crypto and artificial intelligence â two developments that are changing how the world works â Republicansâ fear of government regulation is greater than the fear of untethered technology companies.\n\nBut how? These are broad goals, and thereâs not much here to explain how all this will happen. Reducing mortgage rates by slashing inflation is an optimistic goal but easier said than done. Presidents for decades have been trying to bring down prescription drug prices. Biden and Democrats, for instance, gave Medicare the ability to negotiate drug prices and set price caps on drugs such as insulin. What would Trump and Republicans do about drug prices? Itâs not clear here.\n\nBiden and Democrats have tried to forgive student loans as a way to retroactively make college more affordable. Republicans say they will help develop alternative education options, but that is far from a concrete plan.\n\nBiden left Trump-enacted tariffs in place after taking office and has pursued additional tariffs on Chinese goods, which has kept prices on some goods high. Trump and Republicans would go further, with tariffs on more foreign-made goods. That would, in theory, drive prices up rather than bring them down. Read more.\n\nFlorida has a law to prohibit Chinese nationals from buying real estate. CNN has reported on the results.\n\nAt the center of Bidenâs climate policy is an effort to cut down on tailpipe emissions and push the United States more toward hybrid and electric vehicles. Itâs a proposal that requires fewer new gas-powered vehicles but tries to give flexibility to manufacturers and also protect American jobs, though companies such as Toyota have complained. Trump, on the other hand, is a climate change skeptic whose main energy goal is to keep gas prices low and who opposes electric vehicles.\n\nThese programs are already on an unsustainable path. Within the next decade , lawmakers will have to figure out how to continue to fund them in order to keep paying full benefits. Neither party is talking seriously about that issue this year. One problem is that the US population is aging . New and younger workers â i.e., immigrants â could be needed to put the programs on a more sustainable path.\n\nAt the state level, this movement has included allowing parents to use taxpayer funds to pay for nonpublic education. Critics argue that those efforts only hurt public schools, which are already starved for funding. Hereâs an argument in favor of universal school choice at CNN Opinion.\n\nGiving more deference to parents over what is taught in school has been a key issue since the pandemic, and â parental rights â have morphed into a key grassroots issue for Republicans.\n\nEfforts to neutralize â critical race theory ,â which is not technically part of K-12 curricula but has become shorthand for a view of US history that highlights inequality and slavery, are a big part of the parental rights movement. Another flashpoint is gender. The Biden administrationâs effort to protect LGBTQ students under Title IX , the federal gender equality law, has been stalled in court.\n\nConservatives on the Supreme Court have shown a willingness to reevaluate the principle of separating church and state and keeping religion out of public schools. Oklahoma is experimenting with teaching the B ible in classroo ms as a ânecessary historical document.â In Louisiana, a new law requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms. Keep an eye on this issue.\n\nUnlike previous Republican platforms, this one does not refer to marriage as between a man and a woman, though it does refer to the âsanctityâ of marriage.\n\nViolent crime in the U nited S tates is on the down swing , but there are undeniable problems in many American downtowns, which are still reeling from a lack of workers in offices since the pandemic.\n\nHow much control to give Washington, DC, residents over their city has been a recurring debate in US history. DC residents only gained the power to elect a mayor in 1973. They gained more power in 2012, and Democrats have largely supported making DC a state. But now Republicans will try to assert more control over the city.\n\nItâs not clear when or how Republicans feel American beauty ended, but they clearly want to restore it.\n\nThe 250th anniversary of 1776 hits in 2026. Great time for a national party.\n\nThere are serious efforts to reform the makeup of the US Supreme Court, but they do not currently have the bipartisan momentum that would be needed to enact them.\n\nIt is wrong, however, to say that the high court was always meant to have nine justices; it has had as few as six, according to the White House. The current number, nine, has been in place since 1869.\n\nTrump has said he would pardon people convicted of storming the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. This is a promise to go further and use the Justice Department for retribution. Donât forget that Trumpâs two federal criminal indictments were handed down by separate grand juries and overseen by a special counsel, not anyone in the Biden administration. Both trials have also been delayed until after the election.\n\nMost Americans â 68% in a 2023 Gallup poll â identify in some way as Christian, which seemingly would make widespread bias against them difficult to achieve.\n\nThe word âabortionâ appeared 35 times in the 2016 Republican platform . It only appears one time in this document. The de-emphasis of language opposing abortion restrictions, along with following Trumpâs lead to turn the issue wholly over to state governments, is controversial among conservatives.\n\nFederal law already prohibits voting by noncitizens.\n\nThe foreign policy section of this America First platform reads like an afterthought. There is no mention of Russia or Ukraine and only glancing mention of âalliances,â which we can assume includes NATO. Defending democracy in other countries is not mentioned.\n\nA key concern raised about a second Trump term is that he will fire a large portion of the federal workforce and instead hire loyalists. Trump denies any involvement with the Project 2025 plan , which was written and publicized by the conservative Heritage Foundation. But this line in the platform suggests he will certainly try to fire people at the Pentagon who he does not view as loyal."

      "text": "GOP rift grows over Cornyn's Senate seat as Trump pressured to take sides\n\nFollow:\n\nRepublicans are growing anxious about an emerging Texas primary engulfing one of their longest-serving senators, fearful that a hugely expensive intraparty feud will have major ramifications across the map in next year's midterms.\n\nAnd they want President Donald Trump to stop it.\n\nBehind the scenes, Senate GOP leaders have personally asked Trump to back Sen. John Cornyn, who has occupied his seat for more than two decades and narrowly lost his bid to become Senate majority leader last fall.\n\nBut the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, is sending loud signals that he plans to enter the race, endearing himself to MAGA loyalists who want Trump to back the controversial firebrand.\n\nRelated article As Democrats overperform in off-year elections, GOP frets over Trump voter turnout\n\nAdding to Cornyn's challenges: Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt is now also making moves to enter the GOP primary and has privately contended to White House political advisers that he's the only one who can win both a primary and a general election, according to a person involved in the discussion.\n\nAll that has added up to one overriding fear: that a Texas Senate GOP primary could end up costing their party at least $100 million, siphoning money from other critical battlegrounds, according to several Senate GOP sources. Plus, they worry that a wounded GOP nominee could end up giving Democrats a chance in what would otherwise be a long-shot pickup opportunity as former Rep. Colin Allred weighs another Senate run.\n\nTop Hill Republicans hope Trump can help clear the field with a Cornyn endorsement. Senate Majority Leader John Thune confirmed to CNN that he's spoken to Trump about it in recent weeks.\n\n\"I'm hoping that in the end, he can,\" Thune said when asked about Trump supporting Cornyn. \"Obviously we're supporting Sen. Cornyn. He's done a great job for Texas and for the country. And we need him back.\"\n\nThe battle puts Trump at the center of the simmering feud between the party's insurgent and establishment wings that has dominated GOP primary politics since the 2010 midterms, forcing him to pick sides and risk angering some of his most loyal supporters.\n\nCornyn, 73, a longtime fixture in Texas politics with deep ties to the business and donor community, has taken steps to try to align himself closely with the president, including a launch video featuring footage of Trump praising him from 2019 and even posting a photo on X of him reading \"The Art of the Deal.\"\n\nIn an interview last week, the Texas senator told CNN he is \"prepared\" for a primary fight, but he would not comment on Paxton or Hunt until they formally enter the race. (He said he would speak \"endlessly\" about Paxton if he jumps into the race.)\n\nAsked about Trump, Cornyn said he speaks to the president regularly and believes he will \"make an endorsement when he's ready.\"\n\nRelated article Vulnerable Senate Democrat Ossoff seeks to channel Trump outrage on tough road to reelection\n\n\"I have a very good relationship; look forward to supporting him and his agenda as I always have,\" Cornyn said of Trump. Asked whether the president's backing could make a difference in the race, Cornyn said: \"I think his endorsement would be important, yeah.\"\n\nBut both Paxton and Hunt have tried to show daylight between Cornyn and Trump.\n\nIn perhaps the clearest sign of his intentions to run against Cornyn, Hunt argued the senior senator was ready to \"move on\" from Trump after the 2020 elections.\n\n\"Now, he's scrambling to rewrite history - hoping voters will forget he ever turned his back on the very movement that built our momentum and delivered the majority for Republicans, specifically the Senate,\" Hunt, a hard-right Republican and combat veteran, told CNN.\n\n\"The United States Senate is not a retirement community. It's a battleground for the soul of this nation,\" said Hunt, 43, who won his Houston-area House seat in 2022. \"And in times like these, President Trump doesn't need fence sitters - he needs warriors.\"\n\nAnd Hunt is now benefiting from a seven-figure ad buy from an outside group looking to bolster his name ID across the state, something that will be critical given how infrequently House candidates win statewide in Texas.\n\nBehind the scenes, multiple conservatives are making the case to Trump's political team to ditch the long-serving senator - some equipped with private polling showing Cornyn losing in a primary, according to three people familiar with the outreach. They argue Cornyn has lost the GOP base in recent years, after voting with most Republicans and all Democrats to certify Joe Biden's election win and partnering with Democrats to pass a major gun safety bill , a move that came in the wake of the Uvalde school massacre in 2022.\n\n\"There are high-level people who are behind Paxton in a way they're generally not in primary challenges,\" said one Senate GOP operative.\n\nBut this person also outlined a scenario that is worrying national leaders, describing Paxton as a \"very rough general election candidate in what looks like could be a bad cycle.\"\n\nAfter previously criticizing Trump over the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, Cornyn worked through the last election cycle to rebuild his ties with the president, appearing with him at a campaign event in Nevada - and waiting on the tarmac last October when the president arrived in Austin for a podcast interview with Joe Rogan. Cornyn often points to his work as the Republican whip during Trump's first term to help usher through the 2017 tax law and many of his nominees, including to the Supreme Court, and boasts of voting with Trump more than 90% of the time in his first term.\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who leads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and his team have made this case to White House officials, according to a person familiar with the discussion. And Scott has made clear to Hunt that they are fully behind Cornyn as their nominee when the pair met in recent weeks, according to two people briefed on that meeting.\n\nThe goal: curtail GOP primaries and focus the party's limited resources on critical pickup opportunities such as Georgia, Michigan and New Hampshire - while defending Republican seats in places like Maine and North Carolina.\n\n\"We worked hard to try to clear primaries to try to minimize the amount of money spent in Republican primaries, and that strategy proved effective and allowed us to pick up the United States Senate in the last cycle,\" Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, who led the NRSC in the 2024 cycle, told CNN last week. \"So any time we can try to minimize the impact of a primary like in Texas, that's going to help us win the general election.\"\n\nCornyn, for his part, recently told CNN he can defeat any possible challengers: \"There's a reason why I've won 19 contested elections: Always be prepared.\"\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are salivating at the idea of running against Paxton, who is a lightning-rod figure in Texas. Paxton, 62, was nearly removed from office by fellow Texas Republicans less than a year ago amid a long-running federal corruption probe. (Those charges were dropped by the Biden administration in its final weeks in office, and Paxton has denied wrongdoing.)\n\nBut the cloud of allegations will undoubtedly give Paxton's opponents ample fodder in a Senate campaign, according to GOP and Democratic operatives.\n\nAllred, a former congressman who lost by 8 points to GOP Sen. Ted Cruz last year, is \"seriously considering\" another run and will make a decision this summer, according to a person familiar with his thinking.\n\nIn a recent memo obtained by CNN, the Texas Democratic Party praised Allred's race against Cruz, in which Allred overperformed the 2024 presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, in \"nearly every county, demographic and metric\" and did \"particularly well\" in the competitive turf along the Texas border that would be critical to a 2026 race.\n\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who leads the Senate Democrats' campaign arm, said her party is building a \"blue wave\" because of \"anger\" toward Trump.\n\n\"A large blue wave can affect any state,\" she told CNN when asked last week about her party's chances to pick up the Texas seat.\n\nBut many conservatives discount talk that Allred could win in a state that hasn't elected a Democrat statewide since 1994. And given that, they argue Texas should elect an unyielding conservative firebrand - like Paxton, dismissing his political baggage.\n\nIndeed, as conservatives flocked to Washington in February for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, a small band of MAGA supporters arrived early to hear Trump's longtime political ally Caroline Wren talk about the right's potential 2026 primary targets.\n\nIn her view, moderate GOP Sen. Susan Collins wasn't a worthy target because of Maine's blue tilt:  \"Let's just leave her alone. Don't waste your time.\"\n\nThen she turned to Texas. \"But how about John Cornyn in Texas? He's up. Who would like to see a Sen. Ken Paxton?\" she said as the crowd cheered.\n\nIt's that burst of right-wing enthusiasm that has put Republicans on Capitol Hill in an awkward spot when asked about Cornyn's reelection bid.\n\nA number of Republicans in the delegation refuse to say whether they will back Cornyn, with some clearly waiting for Trump to tip his hand and others unsure how the primary fight will shape up.\n\n\"I'm gonna stay out of that minefield,\" Rep. Keith Self, a Texas GOP member of the House Freedom Caucus, told CNN.\n\nCruz has been noticeably silent - even though Cornyn raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Cruz's reelection bid last year. Cruz's initial silence is reminiscent of Cornyn's 2014 reelection, when the senior senator faced a tea party-inspired challenger whom he vanquished in the primary. Cruz stayed neutral in the primary before backing Cornyn in the 2014 general election.\n\nTwice in recent weeks, Cruz refused to respond when asked whether he'd back Cornyn. Asked by CNN last week whether he would endorse Cornyn, Cruz said: \"Call the press office.\" And then he let the elevator doors close when asked whether he had spoken to Paxton or Hunt about their potential bids.\n\nBut a Cruz spokesperson didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

You know, the Republican Party of 10 years ago was nothing like the Republican Party of today,\" Cuban added.\n\nCuban told Palmeri that he is \"not a fan of either party,\" but running as a Republican will be the \"path of least resistance\" for him.\n\nCuban declined to comment when approached by Business Insider.\n\nThe \"Shark Tank\" star has considered a presidential bid several times but has held back from mounting one in earnest.\n\nCuban told CNN in June 2020 that he seriously considered running for president as an independent candidate that year. Cuban said he gave up on the idea after his \"family voted it down.\"\n\nIt also isn't the first time Cuban has talked about running as a GOP candidate.\n\nIn 2017, Cuban told Fox News that he would probably run as a Republican if he wanted to contest the 2020 presidential elections.\n\nCuban said then that his party choice was based on his belief that \"there is a place for someone who is socially a centrist\" but also \"very fiscally conservative.\"\n\nSpeculation over Cuban's interest in politics arose again in 2023 after he sold his majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks and announced his departure from \"Shark Tank.\"\n\nCuban, however, did not contest the 2024 presidential election. He initially endorsed President Joe Biden's reelection bid but switched his support to Vice President Kamala Harris after Biden dropped out of the race.\n\n\"Who would put themselves through that? I can do more from the private sector,\" Cuban told Wired in an interview published in September, during which he was asked if he would run for office.\n\n\"You can't be president and change healthcare. You've got to get Congress behind you, and this, and that. As an entrepreneur, you can change anything,\" Cuban added.\n\nCuban actively campaigned for Harris, giving rally speeches in the battleground states of Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin. He also volunteered to serve in her administration if she won.\n\n\"I told her team, look, put my name in for the SEC,\" Cuban told CNBC in September, referencing the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nCuban's highly visible role on the Harris campaign paralleled what Elon Musk was doing for President Donald Trump . During Trump's 2024 run, Musk gave rally speeches at GOP events and actively campaigned for him on social media.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2024 vote, Musk and Cuban also faced off on X, trading barbs and advocating for their candidate of choice.\n\nJump to"

Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was the only Republican in the upper chamber who voted for an amendment to defund the White House DOGE office.\n\nDespite the political pressure that GOP lawmakers face in backing President Donald Trump 's agenda, Murkowski in a recent interview told The Washington Post that she wasn't afraid of any pushback.\n\n\"We've got to stop being so anxious and looking over our shoulders and saying, 'Oh, my gosh, am I going to offend somebody and there's going to be political retribution?'\" Murkowski said.\n\n\"This is the United States of America,\" she continued. \"Political retribution should not be something that even exists.\"\n\nMurkowski - who voted to convict Trump in his impeachment trial after the January 6, 2021, attack at the US Capitol and who won reelection to a fourth term over a Trump-backed GOP challenger - has been able to thrive politically as a moderate Republican in a party dominated by the president.\n\nIn the interview, Murkowski said she backed Trump's efforts to reduce government spending but was opposed to the more aggressive tactics employed by DOGE, which has rattled Washington and caused uncertainty for the millions of federal workers across the US.\n\nMurkowski said her vote to defund DOGE was a result of concerns that her constituents raised about federal job cuts. The amendment, which was sponsored by Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, failed in a 48-52 vote, falling far short of the 60 votes needed to advance .\n\nStill, Murkowski said her critiques of DOGE hadn't stopped her from having a working relationship with the Trump administration.\n\n\"Everybody has their own approach,\" she told the newspaper.\n\nDuring a press conference in Alaska earlier in March, Murkowski said she wouldn't let up on her criticism of DOGE , even with Elon Musk threatening to fund primary challenges against Republicans who aren't fully on board with Trump's agenda.\n\nMurkowski isn't up for reelection again until 2028.\n\n\"It may be that Elon Musk has decided he's going to take the next billion dollars that he makes off of Starlink and put it directly against Lisa Murkowski,\" she said at the time. \"And you know what? That may happen.\"\n\n\"But I'm not giving up one minute, one opportunity, to try to stand up for Alaskans,\" she added.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Why these 7 Republican senators still aren't endorsing Trump\n\nWith the 2024 presidential election just around the corner, a solid chunk of the Senate Republican conference still won't get behind former President Donald Trump.\n\nHe's not alone in failing to lock up the formal support of the entire group. Four members of the Senate Democratic caucus also haven't endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, including three of the four independents who caucus with Democrats - Sens. Angus King of Maine, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jon Tester has also opted to remain neutral, he has said, in order to remain focused on his tough reelection fight in Montana.\n\nBut Trump's lack of support among some Republican senators is notable, given that many of the holdouts condemned him in strong terms since he attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nIn fact, four of the senators who haven't endorsed Trump were among the original 7 Republicans who voted to convict Trump after the January 6 insurrection.\n\nHere's a closer look at each Republican senator who has declined to endorse Trump - and why.\n\nThe Louisiana senator, who voted to convict Trump after January 6, has been strikingly coy about who he will vote for this year.\n\nHe has been staunchly critical of Trump over the last several years, including declaring a year ago that the former president should drop out of the race.\n\nAll the while, he has declined to say who he would eventually vote for in 2024, simply saying it would be \"a Republican.\"\n\nOver the summer, Cassidy said in a statement that he would \" commit to working with President Trump if he is the next president-and it appears he is going to be-to make things better for all.\"\n\nIn September, when Business Insider asked Cassidy about who he would vote for this November - including whether he was ruling out voting for Trump - the senator repeated three times that he's \"not voting for Harris.\"\n\nCollins, the Maine senator who's among the most moderate figures in the contemporary GOP, said in July that she will be writing in former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley for President this November.\n\n\"I publicly endorsed Nikki Haley, and I wanted her to win. She's still my favorite candidate, and I think she could do a great job,\" Collins told a local news outlet. \"She's my choice, and that's how I'm going to express it.\"\n\nCollins voted to convict Trump after January 6, and she has never endorsed him. In 2016, she wrote in then-House Speaker Paul Ryan. She has refused to say who she voted for in 2020.\n\nMoran, a long-serving Republican senator from Kansas, won't say who he's voting for this November and has declined to endorse Trump.\n\nThat's not necessarily because he's against Trump.\n\n\" I don't endorse candidates,\" Moran told Axios in July. \"Never have.\"\n\nMoran did not vote to convict Trump after January 6, though he said the former president was \" wrong to continue to spread allegations of widespread fraud and not immediately discourage the reprehensible and unpatriotic behavior\" at the Capitol that day.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Trump endorsed Moran for reelection in 2022. His campaign touted the endorsement at the time as stemming from \" the confidence President Trump has in Sen. Moran to continue to put Kansas and America first.\"\n\nMuch like Collins, Murkowski is a more moderate Republican senator - one who voted to convict Trump after January 6.\n\nEarlier this year, she made clear that she would not vote for Trump in 2024, and seemed to indicate an openness to leaving the GOP. She later clarified that she felt that she's \"in the right place\" as a Republican.\n\nMurkowski wrote in another name in 2020, declining to say who. She also did not support him in 2016.\n\nDespite her opposition to Trump, she's managed to survive politically in her conservative-leaning home state of Alaska, winning reelection against a Trump-backed candidate in 2022.\n\nKentucky's libertarian senator isn't endorsing Trump. But that doesn't mean he doesn't support him.\n\nPaul told CNBC in September that there's \" no question that Donald Trump is better than Kamala Harris\" but that he remains enthusiastic about the former president's candidacy.\n\n\"You know, I'm a deficit hawk. The Trump administration added 8 trillion,\" Paul said on CNBC.\n\nThe Utah Republican and 2012 presidential candidate, who's retiring from the Senate in January, is perhaps the most anti-Trump GOP voice in the upper chamber.\n\nHe voted to convict Trump not once, but twice - for inciting an insurrection in 2021, and for abusing his power in 2020 in connection with his efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden's family.\n\nRomney says he did not vote for Trump in 2020, though he has declined to say who he did vote for. Last year, Romney said that if the 2024 election were to be a rematch between Biden and Trump, he would do the same thing he did in 2016: Write in his wife, Ann.\n\nBut this election isn't a rematch after all: It's Harris versus Trump.\n\nWhen asked if he might endorse Harris in September, he told a reporter that he's \"got nothing more on that front,\" adding \"we'll see\" if he writes in Ann Romney again.\n\nThe Indiana senator is an interesting case: He didn't vote to impeach Trump, but he doesn't seem to be a big fan of the former president either.\n\nIn March, he said he would not support Trump during the 2024 GOP presidential primary.\n\nYet unlike most of the other Republicans on this list, he's largely refused to discuss his vote any further.\n\nIn September, he told reporters that he'll \"talk to you after the election\" when asked about the debate between Harris and Trump.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Welcome back to Trump's America. It's so much different this time around.\n\nWhen President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in for a second term on January 20, a lot will have changed since his 2017 inauguration, when he came into office as a political outsider who still elicited skepticism from many in Washington's Republican political class.\n\n\"They just weren't expecting to win,\" Peter Loge, an associate professor and the director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, told Business Insider about Trump's victory in 2016. \"This time, there's an entire infrastructure. He has plans. There's Project 2025. He's much more like a traditional candidate who's ready to start governing on Day One.\"\n\nHere's a look at how Trump and the country have entered a whole new era as the start of the president-elect's second term approaches:\n\nFrom Meta and Amazon to Ford and GM, a wide range of businesses and CEOs have contributed to Trump's inaugural fund.\n\nIn 2017, Trump raised $107 million for his inaugural committee, a staggering sum at the time. Just four years earlier, then-President Barack Obama's inaugural committee raised roughly $43 million.\n\nTrump has so far raised at least $170 million for his second inaugural , according to The Associated Press. A full accounting of his inaugural funds isn't due until after he takes office.\n\nAhead of Trump's first term, there was optimism among many in the business community over what they saw as his pro-growth agenda.\n\nTrump's $1.5 trillion tax bill , which cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, was applauded by leaders who had been vocal about the need for American businesses to remain competitive in a global marketplace.\n\nHowever, Trump's relationships with many of these leaders fizzled after the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., where white nationalist groups unleashed a wave of violence . And many top leaders steered clear of Trump in the immediate aftermath of the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, where legions of pro-Trump supporters stormed the complex in an effort to stop the certification of President Joe Biden's 2020 electoral victory.\n\nAfter Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in November, though, many business and tech leaders actively began to renew or establish relationships with the incoming commander-in-chief.\n\nElon Musk , the chief executive of Tesla, was ahead of the curve. He spent lavishly to help elect Trump and other GOP candidates last year, and Musk is now seemingly never too far away from the president-elect during major public appearances.\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg , Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , Apple chief executive Tim Cook, and Musk will be guests at Trump's inaugural, according to NBC News and Bloomberg.\n\nLoge told BI that many businesses have decided that it's \"better to be on the Trump train than under it,\" pointing to the president-elect's penchant for dismissing the traditional workings of Washington and the desire for business leaders to have access to power.\n\n\"As a result, a lot of businesses are lining up behind Trump pretty rapidly,\" he said.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, several high-profile members of his Cabinet, like onetime Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and ex-Attorney General Jeff Sessions , had turbulent tenures and were fired by the president.\n\nThis time around, Trump is leaning heavily on loyalists and longtime supporters in selecting his second-term Cabinet picks and other high-level appointees.\n\nMany of the names stand out. Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York has been tapped to serve as US Ambassador to the United Nations, pending Senate confirmation. Defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth underwent a tough confirmation hearing but is likely to win enough GOP votes to secure the post. And ex-presidential candidate and Health and Human Services secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - who backed Trump's campaign after ending his own candidacy - has emerged as a popular figure in Trumpworld over his stances on food and vaccine policies.\n\nThe million dollar question of Trump's second term is whether or not picking loyalists for his Cabinet will give him the sort of stability that he lacked in his first administration.\n\nMany Americans, who saw the multitude of national polls showing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ahead of Trump in 2016, were genuinely surprised when he won that November.\n\nDan Schnur, who teaches political communication at the University of Southern California and the University of California-Berkeley, told BI that Trump's first election \"caused much more disruption\" than it did in November 2024.\n\n\"The idea of Trump beating Clinton was inconceivable to most of the political universe,\" Schnur said.\n\nAfter Trump's tumultuous first term and his lonely exit from Washington after losing to Biden in 2020, a large segment of the public saw the president-elect's political career as finished.\n\nStill, Trump retained his hold over the GOP base, which powered his dominant caucus and primary wins last year. This was the case despite his myriad legal problems , which threatened his general election campaign.\n\nEven as Harris' presidential candidacy spiked enthusiasm among Democrats after Biden stepped aside as the party's nominee, Trump still retained an advantage on the economy - which was a top issue for voters last November.\n\nSo when Trump won, it wasn't a shock to many. And the results showed that Trump broadened his appeal, as he won every major swing state and even secured a plurality of the national popular vote.\n\nTrump is entering his second term with perhaps his strongest influence over Republicans to date. Lawmakers who may have been reluctant to align themselves with Trump in the past have largely put old feelings aside, embracing the fact that Republicans will now control the levers of power in Washington.\n\nRepublicans who defy the party on critical votes are more likely to be met with swift repercussions this time around, mostly in the form of primary challenges and pressure campaigns on social media platforms like X .\n\nTrump is also going to be reliant on GOP leaders in Congress - namely House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota - to get his ambitious immigration and tax legislation passed.\n\nHowever, while Republicans will enjoy a 53-47 edge in the Senate, they currently have a razor-thin 219-215 House majority, which is set to shrink even further following the expected departures of two members for roles in the Trump administration.\n\nIn 2017, Trump was still a political novice and leaned on the legislative relationships that then-Vice President Mike Pence had amassed during his years on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"Back then, he tended to rely on establishment figures whom he felt would give him the necessary credibility in Washington,\" Schnur told BI. \"But he learned over the course of those four years that many of those figures weren't nearly as loyal to him as he had expected.\"\n\n\"This time, he's put much more of a premium on personal relationships and loyalty. He's much more confident that the team around him is motivated toward the same goals as he is,\" Schnur added.\n\nTrump now has a unified Congress, and he won a second term on the strength of his prior economic record, giving him a level of public support that he lacked early on in his first term.\n\nOnce he's is back in office, it'll clearly be a new day in Washington.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Meet 'Republican hair': It's blonde, bouncy, and really doesn't have a political party\n\nTelevision figure Tomi Lahren, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, and Donald Trump's daughter, Tiffany Trump, all have one noticeable thing in common.\n\nNo, it's not the fact that they're prominent members of the Republican Party . It's their blonde, bouncy, blown-out hair.\n\nThe three conservative figures are among many in their orbit who regularly wear the classic hairstyle. In fact, the look has become so synonymous with these women that everyone from hairstylists to observers has taken to simply calling it \"Republican hair.\"\n\nDespite its partisan moniker, the hairstyle is not reserved for news pundits and Republican politicians - especially in 2025. As two hairstylists told Business Insider, you'll probably see it everywhere this year.\n\nRenee Benedict , a hairstylist who works in Kansas City, Missouri, and Washington, DC, described \"Republican hair\" to BI as a classic blowout with long, rounded layers and weight at the bottom.\n\n\"When I think of this style, it's one that shows you have thick, healthy hair. That's really the goal, and you want to see shape,\" she said.\n\nThat flowing, lightly-curled form can be styled onto short haircuts but is most recognizable on longer tresses - especially when they're blonde.\n\nThat's why it was no surprise that Tiffany Trump , Lara Trump, and Carrie Underwood wore nearly the same hairstyle at Donald Trump's inauguration .\n\nDC hairstylist Bethany O'Connell said the most Republican-esque shades are \"high-maintenance\" and \"old-money driven.\" In other words, they're bright, bleached, and require salon visits to maintain.\n\n\"The clean girl aesthetic was slicked back and harsh for so long,\" Benedict said. \"Feminine softness is really starting to come back.\"\n\n\"Republican hair\" is the ultimate contrast, and Benedict says it's even better at portraying how much you care about your appearance.\n\n\"It's polished, refined, professional,\" Benedict said of the Republican-adjacent hair. \"You want to look like you have your stuff together and like you care. You want to look like you invest in your appearance. The biggest part of it is the effort.\"\n\nThe Republican-style blowout matches the political party's core values in many ways: It's traditional, gendered, and subtly portrays wealth.\n\nAnd more Republicans in office means that conservative styles are becoming more prominent and influential in the media than they have been over the last four years.\n\nO'Connell told BI that while some people in DC specifically request \"Republican hair\" and bring photos of politicians as references, most seek celebrity-style blowouts and \"Barbie blonde.\"\n\n\"Here in DC, it's a lot of Margot Robbie,\" O'Connell said.\n\nStill, to buy in, you have to spend. Coloring services are expensive - they can cost upward of $200 - and require regular maintenance appointments.\n\nIt's also worth noting that fashion trends have shifted to suit wealth and modesty in recent years.\n\nQuiet luxury accessories and old-money outfits are just two examples of trends - both influenced by politics and the economy , whether fashion fans realize it or not - that were especially popular in 2023 and 2024.\n\nOf course, the traditional, old-money look isn't reserved for Republicans. One of the most common sources of inspiration for the trend was former first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis, who was married to a Democratic president.\n\nHowever, it's clear that fashion and politics in the US are changing. \"Hair has to change with it,\" Benedict said.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump is retaking power with a much more obedient GOP this time\n\nThis may not be President-elect Donald Trump's first time in the White House, but his second term is bound to look much different than his first term.\n\nThe biggest factor in that difference: Trump is dealing with a GOP that's much more friendly to him and his priorities than it was eight years ago.\n\nWhen Trump was elected in 2016, he faced substantial pockets of opposition within his own party. Dozens of prominent Republicans had called on Trump to withdraw from the race in the wake of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, there were essentially zero Republicans in Congress who owed their political careers to him, and the direction of the party seemed very much up for debate.\n\nBut over four successive election cycles - the 2018 midterms, the 2020 election, the 2022 midterms, and this year's election - Trump has steadily remade the party in his image.\n\n\"This Republican Party is not the Republican Party of 2010,\" said Daniel Schuman, a Congress expert and the Executive Director of the American Governance Institute. \"It's got some of the same constituent people, but who is in charge, and what issues come to dominate is totally different.\"\n\nConsider the difference between House Speaker Paul Ryan, who Trump had to work with during the first half of his first term, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who is expected to remain in his role if Republicans keep control of the lower chamber.\n\nRyan had already been serving in the House for 18 years when Trump took office, and the two men had different ideas for the direction of the party, with Ryan's small-government, traditionally conservative views clashing with Trump's more populist ideas.\n\nJohnson was elected in 2016, at the same time as Trump. He played a major role in Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. He became speaker after Trump single-handedly tanked the candidacy of the man who Republicans chose immediately before him. And he was among the Republicans who flocked to Manhattan to attend Trump's \"hush money\" trial. In other words, he's personally loyal to, and dependent upon, the once and future president in a way that Ryan was not.\n\nThe same is true when it comes to the Senate. While Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell's disdain for Trump is well known, his two most likely successors - Sens. John Thune of South Dakota and John Cornyn of Texas - have each gone to great lengths to forge a strong relationship with the president-elect ahead of leadership elections next week.\n\n\"Trump has a much stronger grip on the Republican Party than he did in 2016,\" said Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist who worked on Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential run, noting that Johnson is more willing to work with Trump than Ryan.\n\nAnd it's true all the way down. In the last eight years, scores of GOP lawmakers whose tenures predated Trump, and who were dissatisfied with the direction of the party under his watch, either retired or went down to defeat. That includes all but two of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him after January 6.\n\nAlmost all who remain are either loyal supporters or willing to accommodate Trump. Large swaths of both the House and Senate GOP conference were elected after Trump took office, and every Republican in Congress has had to run in an election cycle where Trump was the leader, officially or unofficially, of the party.\n\nStill, some divisions remain among Republicans. While the party has grown more populist on economics under Trump's watch, there are still some Republicans who are traditional fiscal hawks .\n\nThere are also major divisions within the party on national security, with some preferring a more restrained approach to foreign policy as others continue to argue for intervention abroad. One proxy for this divide is the issue of Ukraine: Just over half of House Republicans voted against a more than $60 billion Ukraine aid package last year, while most Senate Republicans voted for it.\n\nBut when it comes to Trump the person, Republicans are likely to be far more deferential than in the past, both out of loyalty and fear.\n\nThat's likely to have major implications when it comes to Trump's plans to reshape the federal bureaucracy and alter American institutions.\n\n\"There are Republican institutionalists, but the Republican institutionalists are largely too afraid to do anything about it,\" said Schuman.\n\nBrent Griffiths contributed reporting to this story.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump says he plans to visit Springfield - its Republican mayor isn't so keen\n\nFormer President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday night that he plans to visit Springfield, Ohio, in the coming weeks.\n\nBut the town's Republican mayor is not so enthusiastic about the idea.\n\n\"I'm going to Springfield, and I'm going to Aurora,\" Trump said at a rally in Long Island, New York, on Wednesday, adding that he planned on visiting within the next two weeks.\n\nThe former president thrust the small town of Springfield into the national spotlight earlier this month after making baseless claims about its Haitian migrant community eating pets during a presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris .\n\nIn a moment that has since gone viral, Trump said: \"In Springfield, they are eating the dogs. The people who came in, they are eating the cats. They're eating - they're eating the pets of the people that live there.\"\n\nA debate moderator fact-checked him, noting that city officials had said there were \"no credible reports\" of the Haitian community doing such a thing.\n\nBut the unfounded claims have, nonetheless, created a tense atmosphere in Springfield, which has faced bomb threats and has had to cancel numerous events, including an annual cultural festival.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine, also a Republican, recently deployed state troopers to Springfield to be stationed around public schools amid the rise in threats.\n\nOn Tuesday, amid reports that a Trump visit was being planned, Springfield's Republican mayor, Rob Rue, expressed concerns about the idea.\n\nHe said during a news conference that the former president's visit would be an \"extreme strain\" on the town's resources.\n\n\"So it'd be fine with me if they decided not to make that visit,\" Rue said, per NBC News.\n\nNBC News reported that DeWine, who also spoke at the press conference, said that while a presidential candidate's visit would usually be welcomed, this particular visit may further strain the town's resources.\n\nEarlier this week, DeWine labeled the pet-eating claims as \"garbage\" and called for an end to the discussion, though he avoided directly criticizing Trump or his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, for their role in spreading the falsehoods.\n\nNeither Trump's campaign nor the mayor's office immediately responded to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "The Republican senators who could be headaches for Trump's nominees\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has begun rolling out nominees for his administration, and some of them - particularly those nominated for Cabinet-level positions - will have to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nTrump has begun pushing the idea of \"recess appointments,\" which would allow him to staff up his administration without the Senate's input. But it's unclear whether senators will acquiesce to that demand.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump will have to deal with a 53-47 Republican-controlled Senate. If he nominates a candidate whom Democrats uniformly oppose, he'll be able to lose only three votes from his own party.\n\nSome of his appointees are likely to have an easy time. For example, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida appears likely to get significant Democratic support in a confirmation vote to be secretary of state.\n\nBut others are far more controversial, including Pete Hegseth's nomination to be the secretary of defense and former Rep. Matt Gaetz's nomination to be attorney general.\n\nTrump is dealing with a more obedient party than he was during his first term, owing to successive election cycles in which some of his intraparty antagonists have either retired or gone down in defeat.\n\nStill, there's a handful of senators to watch as the Senate begins holding confirmation hearings in January.\n\nSen. Susan Collins perhaps has more reason to oppose Trump's nominations than any other Republican senator.\n\nFor one, she's up for reelection in 2026 in Maine, a Democratic-leaning state that Republicans have not won at the presidential level since 1988. In other words, she needs the support of a significant number of Democrats to win if she chooses to run again.\n\nIdeologically, Collins is one of the most moderate members of the Senate GOP conference. Over the past several years, she's been involved in several bipartisan deals, including the bipartisan infrastructure law and a law to protect same-sex marriage. She has also frequently crossed the aisle to vote for President Joe Biden's nominees.\n\nDuring Trump's first administration, she voted against two of his Cabinet nominees and Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice. She has also said she didn't vote for Trump in 2016 or 2024.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, is also a major name to watch. She has said she's never voted for Trump and has been highly critical of him.\n\nThough she's not up for reelection until 2028, she has historically relied on crossover support from Democrats and independent voters.\n\nMurkowski also voted against confirming Betsy DeVos as education secretary, and she voted against confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis doesn't have a strong reputation for bucking his own party, particularly on nominees, but there's some reason to believe this year could be different.\n\nThe North Carolina senator is up for reelection in 2026, and his Senate seat will almost certainly be one of the Democrats' top targets. Though Vice President Kamala Harris lost the state in 2024, several Democratic candidates won statewide offices.\n\nUpon hearing about Gaetz's nomination on Wednesday, Tillis expressed some skepticism, telling reporters that it would \"take a lot of work\" for the Florida Republican to get a majority of votes and that it would be a \"popcorn-eating confirmation hearing.\"\n\nUnlike the other prospective roadblocks, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky doesn't have political reasons to oppose Trump's nominees.\n\nBut he isn't your average Republican. He has staunchly libertarian views on foreign policy and surveillance issues, and during Trump's first term, he voted against two of his Cabinet picks: Mike Pompeo for CIA director and Dan Coats for director of national intelligence.\n\nPaul will be a vote to watch when Rubio is up for confirmation as secretary of state, given that the two have divergent views on foreign policy. Earlier this week, he declined to comment on Rubio's nomination.\n\nOtherwise, Paul is likely to be an easy vote for most of Trump's nominees.\n\nHe's set to become the chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and he told colleagues in a letter on Thursday that his committee would \"expeditiously move President Trump's critical nominees\" through the committee by Inauguration Day, including Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, Trump's nominee to be the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nMost Republican senators are likely to give Trump the rubber stamp when it comes to his nominees.\n\nBut there's reason to believe that the president-elect's more extreme picks could draw opposition from more senators than the usual suspects.\n\nGaetz, for example, has drawn immediate criticism from Republicans who are otherwise likely to support Trump and his nominees.\n\nJump to"

John James of Michigan is running for governor, he announced Monday, as one of the most pivotal elections on the ballot in 2026 continues to draw big-name politicians.\n\nIn a message posted on his social media channels , James lamented Democratic governance in the state and argued that \"it's time to get Michigan's government out of fantasyland and back to common sense.\"\n\n\"Our state has suffered long enough. Michigan is strong. Our people are strong. But we are being held back by a lack of strong, competent leadership,\" he wrote.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nAhead of a potentially crowded primary, James signaled he would run as an ally of President Donald Trump, who narrowly won the state in 2016 and 2024 and lost there in 2020.\n\n\"President Trump and I have been in each other's corner through thick and thin for eight years - no reason that will end now. He's doing his part to Make America Great Again, and I'll do mine to bring prosperity and sanity back to Michigan,\" James' statement added.\n\nTrump has not publicly weighed in on the race.\n\nJames came to Washington after a successful House campaign in 2022, when he won a competitive race for an open seat. He had previously launched two unsuccessful Senate bids in the state and his recruitment to the House was a boon for Republicans who had sought to convince the Army veteran and businessman to run.\n\nIf his gubernatorial bid is successful, he would be Michigan's first Black governor .\n\nMichigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is term-limited and cannot run again. The race to replace her has drawn a handful of prominent politicians in the state.\n\nRight now, James' top opponent is state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt. But others could run, too, like former state Attorney General Mike Cox and 2022 gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon , who are both exploring bids.\n\n\"More and more folks from every corner of Michigan are joining our 'Michigan First' movement,\" Nesbitt said in a written statement that an adviser provided in response to questions about James' candidacy. \"We all know Michigan families deserve far better than what they've been getting from Lansing under Governor Whitmer.\"\n\nTwo statewide Democratic officeholders are also running in what's expected to be a high-profile primary on that side of the aisle as well. Both Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson have announced gubernatorial bids. Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson is also running .\n\nWhile James is casting his candidacy as running against Democratic politicians in the state, Gilchrist and Benson are leaning heavily on their experiences in statewide office and the accomplishments of the party, which won every major statewide office in the 2018 election and again in 2022, and held control of both legislative chambers through 2024.\n\nThe winner of the two party primaries will have to deal with an interesting wrinkle: Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who is running as an independent and not in the Democratic primary - the party he'd previously affiliated with.\n\nJames' decision opens up a potentially competitive House seat in the southeastern corner of the state, one that Democrats and Republicans have fought furiously over in recent elections.\n\nBen Kamisar is a national political reporter for NBC News\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Read the Constitution.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who ran for president against Trump in 2016, gave a similar answer. \"The 22nd Amendment is clear and unequivocal,\" Cruz said in a brief interview Monday.\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., a close Trump ally, said Trump \"can say he's not joking, but it's tongue in cheek of the president.\"\n\n\"I've known him for a long time, and I consider him a friend, Mullin told NBC News.\n\nAsked whether he would object if Trump sought a third term, Mullin replied: \"I don't play hypotheticals, guys.\"\n\nAcross the Capitol in the House, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., dismissed the idea, suggesting that Trump floats ideas and concepts not necessarily with the hope of achieving them but to get discussions going.\n\n\"I don't know what he was referring to. I never saw it,\" Scalise said when he was asked about Trump's comments. \"But, you know, you see it like with Greenland, like with Panama Canal. There's a lot of things the president talks about. Ultimately, it gets people talking and addresses some other issues, too.\"\n\nPressed whether he would support changing the Constitution to let Trump run for a third term, Scalise quickly dismissed the idea. \"There's no proposal to change the Constitution right now,\" he said.\n\nBut at least one Republican is taking Trump seriously - and literally - about a potential third term. Rep. Andy Ogles, of Tennessee, introduced a constitutional amendment three days after Trump was sworn in this year. The amendment would allow presidents to serve a maximum of three terms, with the caveat that the president would no longer be eligible after having been elected to two consecutive terms.\n\n\"He has proven himself to be the only figure in modern history capable of reversing our nation's decay and restoring America to greatness, and he must be given the time necessary to accomplish that goal,\" Ogles said upon introducing the measure.\n\nThe measure is extremely unlikely to pass, as it would require the support of two-thirds of the House and the Senate, as well as three-fourths of state legislatures. Democrats could easily block it in Congress.\n\n\"The Constitution isn't optional, sir. This isn't a reality show - it's reality. Two terms, that's it,\" Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, said on X in response to Trump's comments.\n\nIn recent months, Trump has repeatedly raised the specter of a third term. During House Republicans' Jan. 27 retreat at Trump's resort in Doral, Florida, he mused before the television cameras about another term in the White House.\n\nSpecifically, Trump asked Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., a former constitutional lawyer: \"Am I allowed to run again?\"\n\nBut he quickly added, \"Mike, I better not get you involved in that.\"\n\nThe remarks elicited laugher from Johnson and other Republicans in the room, who brushed it off as a joke. It \"was clearly tongue in cheek,\" Johnson said the next day.\n\nDays before his comments at Doral, Trump joked to a crowd of supporters in Las Vegas: \"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve not once, but twice or three times or four times.\"\n\nAnd shortly after he defeated Kamala Harris in November, a triumphant Trump huddled with House Republicans on Capitol Hill and told them, \"I suspect I won't be running again - unless you do something.\"\n\nHouse Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., said the chances of Trump's running for a third term are extremely low and suggested his comments have more to do about staying \"politically relevant\" given his limitations.\n\n\"I've learned never to dismiss out of hand anything the president says, but it would take a constitutional amendment, and I think it's unlikely we get the Democratic support, state by state, that that would require,\" Cole told NBC News on Monday.\n\nCole added: \"Look, a lot of this is about keeping yourself politically relevant. ... We made a decision as a country that two term limits seems to be the appropriate limit. I think it's going to be very hard for anyone to break that.\"\n\nAn idea bouncing around Washington is that Vice President JD Vance could run in 2028, name Trump his running mate and then resign after they are sworn in, handing the presidency back to Trump.\n\nCole called that idea \"interesting\" but \"too fanciful to really discuss seriously at this point.\"\n\nFrank Thorp V is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the Senate.\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\nMelanie Zanona is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News.\n\nRyan Nobles is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Richard Hudson, R-N.C., compared the moment to 2017, when a series of GOP town halls made headlines after angry attendees confronted lawmakers.\n\nThe committee's communications director, Will Kiley, said in a post o n X that Hudson \"supports members reaching and helping as many of our constituents as possible, using technology makes this a heck of lot easier.\"\n\n\"Chairman Hudson opposes attention seeking Move On and Indivisible activists hijacking these events,\" he added.\n\nLater Tuesday, Hudson told reporters that \"in-person town halls are no longer effective because Democrat activists are threatening democracy by disrupting the actual communication at town halls.\"\n\nProgressive groups have previously pushed for their supporters to attend town halls, but it is unclear whether those initiatives influenced the attendees who raised issues with the lawmakers to join the events.\n\nSeparately, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Tuesday that House Republicans were encouraging members to \"communicate directly with their constituents\" in telephone town halls and small groups rather than open forums.\n\n\"They're professional protesters,\" Johnson said, though there is not evidence to back up that claim. \"So, why would we give them a forum to do that right now? The best thing that our members can do is communicate directly, frequently, consistently with their constituents, and there are other avenues to do it.\"\n\nHudson also claimed without evidence that the disruptions were by paid protesters. His and Johnson's cautions against in-person town halls are just the latest warnings by top Republican leaders about participating in the events, which give constituents the opportunity to ask questions and voice concerns.\n\nNBC News previously reported that House GOP leaders have urged lawmakers to stop engaging in town halls, according to a GOP aide. Party leaders have also suggested that lawmakers instead participate in tele-town halls or vet attendees, according to GOP sources.\n\nSen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., faced strong criticism from attendees at a town hall at a Kansas hospital last weekend who were angry with the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nIn videos obtained by NBC News, Marshall argued that DOGE employees had been vetted, prompting boos and jeers from the crowd. Later, Marshall argued that the audience has been \"fed so much information,\" prompting another outburst from the attendees.\n\nShortly before the end of the town hall, one attendee criticized the job cuts, including the firing of veterans. Sweeping federal worker cuts have affected veterans, who comprise about 30% of the federal workforce, according to publicly available data .\n\nMarshall then left the town hall, citing other obligations. As he left, attendees booed and yelled that he had not completed the full hour he said he would stay.\n\nRep. Keith Self, R-Texas, also faced criticism at a Saturday town hall. A video posted to X by the Collin County GOP showed attendees booing Self and chanting, \"Vote you out.\" Collin County GOP attributed the scene to Democrats, but the party of the attendees is unclear.\n\nDemocrats criticized Republicans' cautions against in-person town halls.\n\n\"So House Republicans' political strategy is 'see no families nor workers,' 'hear no protesters,' 'speak to no one' and hope everyone gets less angry at them when they rip away Americans' health care? Got it,\" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Viet Shelton said in a statement.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin took aim at Marshall's town hall as well, saying in a weekend statement that \"it comes as no surprise that Republicans like Roger Marshall are hiding from their own constituents, because Americans are rightfully furious about what's happening in Washington right now.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has also weighed in on the town halls, claiming in a Monday post to his social media site, Truth Social, that people were being paid to cause trouble, although there is no evidence to suggest that.\n\nMarshall later reposted Trump's comment, writing, \"can confirm.\"\n\nMelanie Zanona is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News.\n\nMegan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

But the Republicans who did hold town halls back home got an earful.\n\nAt events from Georgia and Wisconsin to Oklahoma and Oregon, House Republicans faced sometimes-hostile crowds furious about the sweeping budget cuts and mass firings of federal workers that President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency are carrying out.\n\nWith the House on recess and many lawmakers returning to their districts, this week was the first opportunity for them to hear directly from constituents about Trump and Musk's scorched-earth strategy to cut spending and shrink the federal government's footprint.\n\nAt City Hall in Roswell, a suburb of Atlanta, on Thursday night, attendees jeered and talked over Republican Rep. Rich McCormick as they peppered him with tough questions about the cuts - and the seemingly indiscriminate way some of them are being carried out.\n\nOne man asked McCormick how Musk's DOGE could fire employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration , which safeguards America's nuclear weapons, and other federal employees who had been working to combat the bird flu outbreak . More than 1,000 workers also have been laid off from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , a major employer in Atlanta.\n\n\"Why is the supposedly conservative party taking such a radical and extremist and sloppy approach to this?\" the man said as the room erupted in applause, according to videos posted on X by Greg Bluestein, a journalist with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and a NBC News contributor.\n\n\"A lot of the work they do is duplicitous with AI,\" responded McCormick, referring to artificial intelligence, a remark that sparked disagreement from the crowd. \"I happen to be a doctor. I know a few things, OK?\"\n\n\"If we continue to grow the size of government, and we can't afford it, it's going to have shortfalls in your Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security,\" the congressman continued. \"We have to make some decisions.\"\n\nAt the start of the town hall, a woman told McCormick, who represents a safe Republican seat outside Atlanta, that it was Congress' job to direct and appropriate federal spending, \"not the president, and you are doing a disservice to set that down and not stand up for us.\"\n\nMany of these issues \"will be litigated in court,\" McCormick said, prompting more jeers.\n\n\"But we're pissed!\" another attendee yelled out.\n\nThe contentious town halls could be an early sign of political backlash to come for elected Republicans as thousands of federal workers around the country begin getting pink slips and Americans start to feel the impact , as the GOP-controlled Congress largely yields to Trump and Musk .\n\nOne Republican lawmaker said it appeared that constituents who've been \"quiet\" since Joe Biden's 2020 victory are back out in force.\n\n\"Too much too fast seems to be a common refrain,\" the lawmaker continued. \"Need to review each program, department or agency first and then make calculated decisions. But generally frustrated right now by lack of clarity.\"\n\nSome House Republicans hosted virtual or tele-town halls, which can be moderated more easily. But at the few in-person town halls around the country this week, GOP lawmakers were on the defensive as they were quizzed about the mass firings and potential future cuts to Medicaid .\n\nIn West Bend, Wisconsin, GOP Rep. Scott Fitzgerald faced several tough questions at a town hall Thursday, including from attendee Michael Wittig, who was holding a sign reading, \"Presidents are not kings.\"\n\n\"Are you going to subpoena him at some point? Are you willing to use your subpoena power to tell Musk to stand in front of Congress and answer some hard questions?\" Wittig asked, according to a report from W TMJ , the NBC News affiliate in Milwaukee.\n\nThat same question came up in Glenpool, Oklahoma, where attendees told Rep. Kevin Hern, a member of GOP leadership, that he wasn't doing his job standing up to the executive branch. \"We're seeing the administration undermining Congress,\" a mother with a baby in her lap told Hern, according to News9 in Oklahoma City . \"Will you call Elon Musk in to testify under oath to explain what he's doing?\" asked another attendee.\n\nAt a town hall in Baker City, Oregon , a man who identified himself as Terry Strommer, a military veteran from Oxbow, told GOP Rep. Cliff Bentz that his office had been unresponsive when he raised concerns about Musk.\n\n\"I'll just ask you, if you think that he's doing it right. Would you like all of your private records revealed and pulled up by a bunch of people that weren't elected, they're just randomly appointed, a bunch of 20-year-olds?\" the man said. \"I know that when I was in the service, there was a chain of command and we answered to somebody. I don't see him answering to anybody.\"\n\nBentz defended Musk, calling him \"an absolute world-renowned expert\" who could overhaul the government's \"antiquated systems.\" Some in the crowd laughed at Bentz's description.\n\nAnd back in Wisconsin, attendees confronted GOP Rep. Glenn Grothman about potential cuts in Trump and congressional Republicans' spending plans.\n\nAsked whether cuts to Social Security or Medicaid would push him to oppose a GOP spending bill, Grothman said, \"Well, certainly if Social Security is cut, and Medicaid, we'll have to see about that.\"\n\nThe raucous town halls conjured memories of those in 2009 - the start of the tea party movement - when constituents protested over Democrats' massive health care bill, which became the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe next year, a red wave gave House Republicans a staggering 63-seat gain and swept Democrats out of power. Democrats hope that the palpable frustration could be an accelerant for them in next year's midterms, though the specifics of the modern House battlefield, shaped by two rounds of precise redistricting since 2010, make the kind of tsunami Republicans rode then hard to replicate.\n\nAt this juncture, some Republicans are also questioning just how deep the backlash in these congressional town halls runs.\n\n\"I love how the media takes a few critics when the overwhelming response from the American people is support for what this administration is doing,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in response to questions from NBC News.\n\nShe added: \"There should be no secret about the fact that this administration is committed to cutting waste, fraud and abuse. The president campaigned on that promise. Americans elected him on that promise, and he's actually delivering on it. And this is something that Democrats promised they would do for decades.\"\n\nStill, a Republican strategist on the front lines of the tea party wave said he sees early glimmers of a similar phenomenon now, with the GOP facing voter anger over the economic situation the same way the Democratic trifecta did in 2009.\n\n\"The Republican mandate coming out of the 2024 election was pretty clear: Tackle the rising cost of living in America,\" said Ken Spain, who served as communications director for the House Republican campaign arm in 2009 and 2010. \"As exciting as it may be for the Republican base, most voters don't naturally make a connection between aggressively cutting the size of the federal workforce and their pocketbooks.\"\n\nSpain also said Republicans still have time to avoid getting swamped like Democrats did in 2010.\n\n\"We're one month into the new administration, so it's too early to start drawing immediate parallels to the tea party protests of 2009, but Republicans must pivot to connecting the dots between their actions and the tangible economic benefits for the working class,\" Spain said. \"Otherwise, the echoes of 2009 could become increasingly louder.\"\n\nRecent surveys show some potential peril for Republicans because of Trump's early actions, particularly his efforts to thin the ranks of the federal workforce.\n\nNarrow majorities of American adults in polling from CNN and The Washington Post/Ipsos said they believe Trump has overstepped as president.\n\nBoth polls also found a majority disagreeing with his attempts to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development. And the Post's poll found that 58% opposed his efforts to lay off large numbers of federal government workers.\n\nJesse Ferguson, a veteran Democratic strategist who worked on House races during the Obama era, said he sees parallels to the 2018 cycle, when Trump's party faced a backlash in the midterms.\n\n\"Republicans are taking heat cause people feel like things are out-of-control and see the GOP as becoming responsible for the problem instead of being part of the solution,\" he said. \"When life feels out of control, the last thing you want is Trump and Musk chainsawing apart everything you depend on.\"\n\n\"In 2010, Democrats felt the backlash from owning a bad status quo, and in 2018, Republicans felt the backlash for trying to take important things away,\" Ferguson said. \"In 2025, Republicans are managing to do both.\"\n\nOne outstanding political question is whether voters take any  frustration over those actions out on largely powerless Democrats, too.\n\nStuck in the minority in Congress, House and Senate Democrats have been protesting the firings and cuts , holding rallies and in some cases confronting security personnel outside federal agency buildings around Washington. But some Democrats are also feeling the heat from constituents who urged them to fight harder against Musk's DOGE efforts.\n\nAt a packed town hall in Albany, New York, a man told Democratic Rep. Paul Tonko that he had watched the congressman on TV protesting the cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Education. But he called on Tonko to do more because Musk and Republicans \"are not playing by the rules.\"\n\n\"If you ask us to show up, Congressman Tonko, we will show up. ... We have to take it to them,\" the man said, according to a video posted on Facebook . When he turned on the TV, \"I was so proud that my representative was on the front line. But I thought about Jimmy Carter and I thought about John Lewis, and I know what John Lewis would have done. He would have gotten arrested that day.\n\n\"Make them outlaw you,\" he continued as the applause grew louder. \"We will stand behind you, we will be there with you. I will get arrested with you.\"\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\nSyedah Asghar is a Capitol Hill researcher for NBC News and is based in Washington, D.C.\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nBen Kamisar is a national political reporter for NBC News\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Others, reflecting a broader debate inside the administration and the GOP over the wisdom of embarking on a stepped-up campaign against the militant group, are upset about the side he took.\n\nTrump has campaigned and governed on the idea that America should be put first and its traditional allies and conflicts overseas second. But his administration is now making moves that reflect the potential for a protracted military campaign against the Houthis.\n\nObservers say the debate over the Yemen strikes is the difference between MAGA world, which tends to be against helping the Europeans while focusing on Asia, and garden-variety Republicans, who think the U.S. should not abandon issues in the Middle East.\n\nThe Pentagon has moved an additional aircraft carrier and its attendant ships into the region, joining the USS Harry Truman carrier strike group already there. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized at least two Patriot missile defense batteries from Asia to be moved to the Middle East, two U.S. officials and one defense official told NBC News.\n\nAnd in a move that suggests thoughts of a sustained campaign in the Middle East, NBC News has also learned from one U.S. official and another person familiar with the matter that defense officials have approved the relocation of a large missile system known as a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, a more complex effort.\n\nAt the same time, the military has acknowledged in a statement that it quietly moved multiple B-2 bombers, C-17 cargo jets and KC-135 refueling tankers to Diego Garcia, a tiny island in the Indian Ocean that has been used as a hub for operations in the Middle East in the past. The B-2 bombers can carry the largest bombs in the U.S. arsenal, including bunker buster bombs that could be useful against Houthi militants, who are known to bury sites deep into the ground to protect them.\n\nAll of these moves signal a commitment to a sustained fight against the Houthis with the purpose of finally neutralizing the group, which is armed by Iran and has caused havoc to shipping routes through the Red Sea, and potentially deterring Tehran.\n\nMany Republicans on Capitol Hill are generally happy to see the Trump administration take the fight to the Houthis.\n\nVance's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nThe fact that Vance had questioned Trump's directive to conduct the strikes has largely been lost in the controversy over top administration officials discussing the military plans over Signal, and the inadvertent inclusion of The Atlantic's editor-in-chief in that chat.\n\nTaking what some believe is a pro-MAGA, anti-European position, Vance argued in the discussion on Signal that with the strikes, the U.S. was doing the work of European freeloaders, since, he said, the lion's share of Red Sea shipping is attributed to their economies.\n\nThat has angered some Republicans who believe Vance was about to obstruct the president's wishes in a way they see as comparable to how some top Trump aides acted during his first administration .\n\n\"I think we are making a mistake,\" Vance wrote in the Signal chat , later published by The Atlantic. Vance argued that although Trump wanted to send a message with the strikes, \"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now.\" He did say, though, that he was \"willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,\" but went on to say \"there is a strong argument for delaying this a month.\"\n\nMinutes later, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller shut down the conversation, writing, \"As I heard it, the president was clear.\"\n\nVance's questioning of the move on the Signal chat, which did not include Trump, has angered hawkish Republicans who were frustrated with what they felt were the Biden administration's muted efforts to go after the Houthis and who celebrate Trump's intention to go after senior leaders.\n\n\"Capitol Hill Republicans still have their jaws on their floor with how actively the VP worked to try and undo a Trump decision,\" one senior Republican official on Capitol Hill said in a text. \"Thank goodness Miller stepped in and put him in his place.\"\n\nThe senior Republican official added: \"It's one thing to have a healthy interagency debate before a decision is made. It's another to try and undo a Commander-in-Chief decision once Trump gives the execute order. This is the latter, and it's very [John] Bolton-esque.\"\n\nSome Republicans believe Vance raising questions about an action the president had already agreed to amounted to a form of obstruction, the same senior Republican official said.\n\n\"The president was not aware how inconsistent this is with his own messaging?\" another Republican on Capitol Hill asked, quoting Vance. \"These are the president's policies, and for JD Vance to question them like that is ridiculous. He is the commander in chief.\"\n\nBut some Trump administration officials believe privately that the U.S. should wash its hands of the conflict and move on. They worry that if he doesn't, Trump could get himself mired in a campaign that will prevent him from extracting the U.S. from the Middle East's problems, according to one current administration official, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\n\"It's 2002 all over again,\" the official said, referring to the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nDana Stroul, who was the top policy official in the Pentagon for the Middle East under Biden and is now a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said, \"I think Yemen will be the first test case of these opposing ideological positions in the Trump administration. This is the beginning of a campaign, and for the campaign to be successful, you need to be prepared to go for months if not longer.\"\n\nAfter Trump pours resources into the region, it will be difficult to pull them back out again, she said.\n\n\"When the president realizes months from now how tied down he is in the region, he might be frustrated to learn it is difficult to quickly change course without tremendous risk.\"\n\nBiden was often criticized by both Senate and House Republicans for being overly careful when it came to targeting the Houthis, but Stroul said the Biden administration's strategy was to keep a lid on the Houthis without getting pulled in altogether.\n\nGen. Michael Erik Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, presented strike packages to the Pentagon several times last year that included targeting Houthi leaders, specifically those involved in the militants' drone and missile program, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials.\n\n\"The Biden White House wasn't approving targets even when they had solid intel with multiple U.S. agencies and allies backing up the info, specifically when they include targeting people,\" said a former U.S. official with knowledge of the operations.\n\nBut two former U.S. officials, who worked in the White House during the Biden administration, said some of Kurilla's plans were not approved because they weren't based on solid intelligence, the possibility of civilian casualties was high, and Kurilla was consistently prepared to accept higher risk than the Pentagon and White House. The two former U.S. officials said obtaining actionable intelligence was hard because the U.S. lacked sources on the ground and drones were often jammed or shot down.\n\nStill, there was no \"knee-jerk opposition\" to targeting Houthi leaders, one of the former U.S. officials said.\n\nRepresentatives for Kurilla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThings changed in January 2025, when the combination of good intelligence shared by Israel and stepped-up intelligence by the U.S. put Washington in a better position to strike the Houthis, the two former U.S. officials said. They said Biden administration officials believed that they could have acted at that point, but that executing the plan correctly would have taken months and would have meant starting an operation just before Inauguration Day and boxing in the Trump administration. So Biden administration officials essentially bequeathed the plan to the Trump administration, which is now beginning to execute it.\n\nDefense Department officials say the strikes in Yemen will continue. \"This is a sustained, ongoing operation targeting Houthi leadership,\" a defense official said in a statement. \"At the direction of the president, CENTCOM continues to conduct strikes across multiple Iran-backed Houthi locations every day and night to restore freedom of navigation and restore American deterrence.\"\n\nGordon Lubold is a national security reporter for NBC News.\n\nCourtney Kube is a correspondent covering national security and the military for the NBC News Investigative Unit.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Chuck Edwards, R-N.C., faced a rowdy crowd at a town hall with constituents Thursday evening, the latest such event to go viral on social media as Republicans face backlash over President Donald Trump's mass layoffs of federal workers and budget cuts.\n\nIn video captured by NBC News affiliate WYFF , Edwards spoke in front of a packed auditorium in Asheville, North Carolina - until he was drowned out by the jeers of attendees.\n\n\"I was proud to vote recently for the House budget resolution, which provides the framework\" - Edwards told the crowd before cutting himself off as boos washed over him, while other attendees raised their hands to give him a thumbs-down.\n\nAfterward, Edwards was greeted outside by protesters holding Ukrainian and Palestinian flags and signs that read \"Fire Elon,\" referring to Trump adviser Elon Musk, who has led the Department of Government Efficiency's effort to fire thousands of federal workers in recent weeks.\n\nEdwards represents North Carolina's 11th Congressional District, a solidly Republican area that includes Asheville and surrounding rural communities. The congressman won it by mo r e than 13 percentage points in 2024.\n\nBut he decided to hold Thursday's town hall after the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, which works to get Republicans elected to the House, advised Republican lawmakers against doing such in-person meetings because of repeated constituent confrontations. House Speaker Mike Johnson.R-La., also cautioned lawmakers against holding such open forums to connect with their constituents.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News on Friday, Edwards said, \"Being accessible, listening, and answering questions for the people of Western North Carolina are among my favorite activities. We may not agree on every issue, but hearing the concerns of Western North Carolinians and answering their questions will continue to be a priority of mine.\"\n\n\"I was able to answer questions from multiple different constituents at the town hall, and dispel some of the misinformation currently being spread around. I look forward to doing so again soon at my upcoming tele-town hall,\" the congressman added.\n\nOther congressional Republicans have faced similar disruptions at their town hall events. Generally, the protests have centered around the mass layoffs of federal workers, President Donald Trump's criticisms of Ukraine's leadership as his administration pushes for a ceasefire in the country's war with Russia and the House Republicans' passage of a budget blueprint that would make deep cuts, potentially includ ing to programs like Medicaid .\n\nEarlier this month, Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, left a town hall early after constituents confronted him about the employees working at DOGE.\n\nAnd in Texas, GOP Rep. Keith Self faced criticism and chants of \" Vote you out, \" during a town hall in his district a few weeks ago.\n\nIn response, Republicans have accused Democrats of organizing protesters to disrupt their events, which Democrats have denied.\n\nBut on Friday, the House Democrats' campaign committee, alongside the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties, announced a series of town halls in Republican-held districts across the country, accusing GOP lawmakers of dodging their voters.\n\nKen Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, accused Republican House lawmakers of being \"terrified to be in the same room as the people who sent them to Washington,\" citing the advice from the NRCC for GOP lawmakers to avoid town halls.\n\n\"If they won't talk to their own voters, then Democrats will. That's why we'll be hosting People's Town Halls in all 50 states across the country, starting now with vulnerable GOP-held target districts,\" Martin added.\n\nEdwards' district is not one of those that Democrats will be appearing in, as they plan to focus on competitive districts that tend to be decided by more narrow margins that North Carolina's 11th.\n\nAlexandra Marquez is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

And the new reluctance to hold them indicates there are bubbling concerns about the impact the cuts could have on the GOP's chances of holding its thin majority in the House next year.\n\nThe viral nature of video clips spreading from one district to another means a bad confrontation in safe Republican territory could influence voters in battlegrounds.\n\nThe GOP-led House is trying to enact even deeper spending and tax cuts through legislation that could add as much as $4.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. But much of the tension focused on billionaire Elon Musk, the face of President Donald Trump's effort to unilaterally eliminate jobs, contracts and grants. Musk, who is a \"special government employee\" advising Trump, did not require Senate confirmation to take his temporary post.\n\n\"Obviously we're very aware of those headlines,\" a Republican National Committee official familiar with the dynamics said.\n\n\"I don't know that a specific edict is going to come down from on high that they need to stop or anything, but a message I believe has been clearly sent that this narrative should end very soon,\" the official said. \"Probably the best way for that to happen is no more town halls. Elon Musk's work still has the administration's support, period.\"\n\nBeyond that, White House and party officials say the majority of the public wants the budget cuts.\n\n\"The president's policies are incredibly popular, and the American people applaud his success in cutting the waste, fraud and abuse of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars,\" said Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser at the RNC. \"Pathetic astroturf campaigns organized by out-of-touch, far-left groups are exactly why Democrats will keep losing.\"\n\nA Republican lawmaker who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity to avoid publicly divulging internal party strategy, said that the RNC has been helpful in making suggestions about how House Republicans can handle the situation but that it stopped short of trying to impose an impossible-to-enforce moratorium.\n\nLawmakers are spooked enough about the prospects of heated exchanges that most of them do not want to do town halls anyway, this Republican said.\n\nA chief of staff to a House Republican who has won handily compared the dynamics with tough town halls in the 2018 midterms. While Democrats won control of the House that year, GOP lawmakers in Republican-heavy districts may have benefited from a backlash to the criticism.\n\n\"It's 2018 all over again,\" the aide said. \"The town halls, if anything, helped in districts like ours.\"\n\nMelanie Zanona is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News.\n\nJonathan Allen is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News.\n\nMatt Dixon is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News, based in Florida.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Chuck Schumer says he won't block Republican funding bill amid Democratic divisions over shutdown strategy\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., indicated Thursday he would vote to advance Republicans' six-month funding bill that passed the House to avert a government shutdown Friday night.\n\nThe move is a major concession from Schumer, yielding to the GOP measure just one day after he vowed that Democrats wouldn't allow it to pass. It means the bill is likely to find enough votes to clear the 60-vote threshold and eventually pass with a simple majority, even as a growing number of Senate Democrats came out in opposition to it Thursday.\n\n\"There are no winners in a government shutdown,\" Schumer said in a floor speech. \"It's not really a decision; it's a Hobson's choice: Either proceed with the bill before us or risk Donald Trump throwing America into the chaos of a shutdown.\n\n\"For sure, the Republican bill is a terrible option. It is not a clean CR [continuing resolution]. It is deeply partisan. It doesn't address far too many of this country's needs. But I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,\" he added. \"I will vote to keep the government open and not shut it down.\"\n\nSchumer informed his colleagues in a closed-door meeting that he would vote for the procedural motion to advance the funding bill when it comes to the Senate floor Friday, according to a source familiar with his remarks. The New York Times first reported Schumer's private comments .\n\nIf the Senate passes the bill, it would then go to President Donald Trump's desk for a signature. A shutdown occurs after 11:59 p.m. ET Friday if no law is enacted by then.\n\n\"We have a choice between terrible and awful,\" said Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga.\n\nIt's unclear what, if anything, Schumer got in return for his decision to allow the House bill to proceed. He told reporters after his Senate speech that Democrats would \"try to get some amendments on the bill.\"\n\nBefore his comments, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., hinted that Democrats could try to secure a vote on an amendment to the House bill to turn it into a 30-day, rather than a six-month, stopgap measure. But he didn't commit to dropping opposition to the bill if the amendment were voted down.\n\nJohn Fetterman, of Pennsylvania, is the only Senate Democrat who has said he'd vote to advance the House bill; several others have stayed quiet about how they would handle a procedural vote. Schumer told reporters that \"members are making their own decisions right now.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, a growing number of Senate Democrats vowed to oppose the legislation. They included John Hickenlooper, of Colorado, who called the bill \"dangerous\"; Mark Kelly, of Arizona, who said it would \"give unchecked power to Donald Trump and Elon Musk\"; Ruben Gallego, of Arizona, who blasted it as \"a grab bag of extreme policies\"; and Mark Warner, of Virginia, who called it \"a terrible deal\" that would hurt Virginia.\n\n\"One thing is certain: If we pass this continuing resolution for the next half year, we will own what the president does,\" said Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. \"I am not willing to take ownership of that.\"\n\nFrom outside the Democratic lunch meeting, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., could be heard yelling about devastating impacts of a government shutdown, particularly now.\n\nSenators have faced heavy pressure from House Democratic colleagues and liberal advocates outside of the Capitol to hold the line against the funding bill, which was crafted by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and the White House.\n\nEarlier this week, just one House Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, voted for the bill, which party leaders in the chamber railed against.\n\nAfter Schumer spoke on the Senate floor, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told reporters there is a \"deep sense of outrage and betrayal\" from House Democrats.\n\n\"There are members of Congress who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territory in the United States, who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people, in order to defend Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. ... Just to see some Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think it is a huge slap in the face, and I think that there is a wide sense of betrayal if things proceed as currently planned,\" she said.\n\nYet even as some Democrats were rallying against the House GOP bill, they struggled to offer a plausible endgame to avert a shutdown - or reopen the government if funding lapses after Friday night. They demanded a 30-day stopgap measure to continue funding at status quo levels to reach a full funding deal for fiscal year 2025.\n\nThat discombobulated approach clashes with the fact that Trump and Johnson have said they don't want an appropriations deal for a fiscal year that is already half over, as they want to move on to their party-line budget bill to address taxes, immigration and other priorities.\n\n\"We're trying to convince them. Now, they can be convinced or unconvinced,\" Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., said about the GOP's rejection of a new appropriations deal.\n\nDemocratic senators have cited numerous objections to the House bill.\n\nFirst, they had no input in developing it - some in the party fear that voting for it would empower Johnson and Trump to dictate outcomes without negotiating with Democrats to earn their votes.\n\nSecond, they object to provisions that would cut nondefense domestic spending by billions of dollars, including a hit to Washington, D.C.'s budget, while boosting military spending - a move they see as sacrificing Democratic priorities for GOP priorities.\n\nThird, they worry that voting for the measure without guardrails on executive power would green-light Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk's moves to dismantle parts of the federal government or refuse to spend money directed by Congress.\n\nA new memo Thursday from the Center for American Progress Action Fund, led by longtime Democratic adviser Neera Tanden, called on the party to hold the line against the House Republican bill, making the policy and messaging case for it.\n\n\"While the consequences of a shutdown are real, Democrats bear no responsibility in fact or in public perception if they continue to support a clean CR or clean 30-day CR. However, supporting the MAGA plan will sap momentum that is building against Republicans,\" said the memo, which NBC News obtained from a congressional Democratic source who received it. \"Lawmakers must focus on connecting the so-called CR to how the Administration and DOGE are actively causing radical harm.\"\n\nSome Democrats believe voters will blame Republicans in the event of a government shutdown. In a new Quinnipiac University national poll , 53% of registered voters said they would blame Trump or Republicans in Congress if the government shut down; 32% said they would blame Democrats. Another 15% didn't know or wouldn't say.\n\n\"Jiminy Christmas! Republicans control the House, Senate and White House,\" said Sen. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M.\n\nBut Senate Republican leaders say it's time to dispense with the debate over fiscal 2025 funding, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Thursday on the floor that the House bill was the only path to prevent a shutdown.\n\n\"Democrats need to decide if they're going to support funding legislation that came over from the House or if they're going to shut down the government,\" he said.\n\nSchumer told reporters after his floor speech that he's convinced he made the right decision because of how difficult it would be to reopen the government.\n\n\"There is no off-ramp,\" he said. \"Anyone who thinks there might be an off-ramp knows it depends on the Republicans, and I don't trust them at all. I think they want a shutdown, and I think they want to use the shutdown to decimate the federal government.\"\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nFrank Thorp V is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the Senate.\n\nRyan Nobles is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\nKate Santaliz is an associate producer for NBC News' Capitol Hill team.\n\nJulie Tsirkin is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

It represents a stinging blow to Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats, who now will have virtually no check on Trump, a man they warned on the campaign trail is a threat to democracy, an extremist and a fascist.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, Republicans flipped seven seats, while Democrats flipped six seats, for a net GOP gain of just one seat. So far, Republicans have captured the 218 seats needed to secure the majority to Democrats' 208 seats. Last week, Republicans flipped three Democratic Senate seats to win control of the upper chamber .\n\n\"It is a beautiful morning in Washington. It is a new day in America,\" a celebratory Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on the steps of the Capitol, flanked by his leadership team, as the House returned to Washington on Tuesday. \"The sun is shining, and that is a reflection about how we all feel.\"\n\nDemocrats had believed they were in a good position to win back the majority they lost just two years ago. They needed a net gain of only four seats to flip control of the House given that Republicans now hold 220 seats to the Democrats' 212 - one of the smallest majorities in modern history .\n\nBut the two parties basically have fought to a draw in the House, preserving a status quo that favored Republicans.\n\nIn New York, Democrats were able to knock off a trio of vulnerable freshman GOP incumbents : Rep. Brandon Williams in the Syracuse region, Rep. Anthony D'Esposito on Long Island, and Rep. Marc Molinaro, whose district includes parts of the Hudson Valley and the Catskills. They were among the 18 GOP House districts that President Joe Biden carried in 2020.\n\nDemocratic challenger George Whitesides also ousted vulnerable GOP Rep. Mike Garcia in Southern California.\n\nBut Trump's triumph - including wins in battlegrounds like Pennsylvania and Michigan where there were key House races - helped buoy GOP incumbents and new candidates in the places that mattered.\n\nTwo of the biggest GOP prizes came in the Keystone State. Republicans unseated two vulnerable, veteran Democrats in neighboring districts in eastern Pennsylvania. GOP businessman Rob Bresnahan ousted six-term Rep. Matt Cartwright, a former member of leadership, in the 8th District, which Trump carried in 2020. In the neighboring 7th District based in Allentown, GOP state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie upset Democratic Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the House Ethics Committee.\n\nIn the state capital, Harrisburg, Democrats believed they had a good chance to knock off former Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry, a Trump ally who played a role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. But the six-term incumbent beat back a strong challenge from former local TV anchor Janelle Stelson, who attacked Perry on everything from the Jan. 6 Capitol attack and abortion rights to his votes on veterans issues.\n\nRepublicans also captured a Michigan seat that had been held by Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who successfully ran for an open Senate seat. And GOP challenger Gabe Evans narrowly defeated freshman Rep. Yadira Caraveo, D-Colo., by less than 1 percentage point in a heavily Hispanic district north of Denver.\n\nThe tiny House victory is hugely consequential as Republicans turn to the task of governing. When Trump and his congressional allies take the reins in January, they will have another rare opportunity to push through major policy initiatives through \"reconciliation\" - an arcane process that will allow the GOP to fast-track legislation without Democratic support.\n\nDiscussions about what reforms to pursue began even before the election, with some Republicans pushing to use reconciliation to renew expiring Trump tax cuts and others like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally, calling for Republicans to take up border security legislation. It's not yet clear what would be in that border bill, but Trump has said repeatedly that he will \"seal\" the southern border on Day One as president and launch \" the largest deportation program in American history .\"\n\nIn the closing days of the campaign, Johnson told supporters a \"massive\" reform of the Affordable Care Act would be part of the GOP's first 100-day agenda, though he has since denied that Republicans would try to repeal Obamacare as they failed to do in 2017.\n\nWith little wiggle room, Republicans are sure to run into challenges. And Trump has already selected two members of the new majority to serve in his administration, Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York and Mike Waltz of Florida . Both are in solidly Republican districts the party will likely carry in special elections to replace them, but vacancies following their departures could be an issue for Johnson.\n\nThe GOP had a minuscule majority in this Congress, and it struggled to push its agenda forward. Instead, the past two years were defined by a successful conservative coup against Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California, the expulsion of a New York Republican congressman and intraparty squabbling over GOP spending bills.\n\nJohnson and Republicans will now have partners in a Senate majority and the White House, which they hope will allow them to rally behind Trump and put some of that infighting behind them. Johnson and his top lieutenants - Majority Leader Steve Scalise, also from Louisiana, and Majority Whip Tom Emmer, of Minnesota - all ran unopposed for re-election to their posts on Wednesday.\n\nJohnson will still need to secure 218 votes on the House floor on the first day of the new Congress, in early January, to win his first full term as speaker.\n\n\"If there's unified government ... if we have a bicameral approach - Republicans in both chambers working together to develop that agenda and implement it, and President Trump is guiding the way - I think you will certainly have a lot less dissension in the ranks on our side,\" Johnson said in an interview with NBC News at a Pennsylvania campaign stop before the election.\n\n\"I think everybody's going to want to be a part of that majority that is solving the problems of the country,\" the speaker added. \"And I think governing is going to be a whole lot easier come January.\"\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Senate Republicans have unveiled a budget blueprint they hope to pass as they look to enact key elements of President Trump's domestic policy agenda. Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images hide caption\n\nSenate Republicans have unveiled their proposed policy and budget package, setting up a fight with members of their own party and their House counterparts in a race to implement a key piece of President Trump's legislative agenda.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, released the 70-page Senate budget resolution text on Wednesday. Senators expect to start voting on the sweeping legislation by this weekend.\n\nIt would raise the country's debt limit by $5 trillion to avoid a catastrophic financial default this summer, and make tax cuts that passed under Trump's first term permanent. The House-passed $4.5 trillion Trump tax plan is included in the package.\n\n\"Today is one of the most important steps toward ensuring the Republican majority fulfills its promise to the American people that we will secure our border, strengthen our national security, make President Trump's tax cuts permanent, and reduce spending,\" Graham said in a statement.\n\nIf approved, the multitrillion-dollar plan could become a hallmark of Trump's second term, reimagining the U.S. budget through defense, energy, immigration, and tax policy.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the legislation would pave the way for \"generational investment\" in border security, national defense and the energy sector.\n\n\"Republicans in the Senate and the House are committed to working with President Trump to stop Democrats from imposing an automatic $4 trillion tax hike on the American people at the end of this year,\" Thune said of the extension of the Trump tax cuts.\n\nThune said the plan also aims to reduce the size and scope of the federal government.\n\nEarlier this year, Senate Republicans, impatient with delays tied to intraparty divisions in the lower chamber, jumped ahead of their GOP House counterparts in crafting the package. That's left House Republicans, with a much tighter margin for their majority, worried the Senate version may lose support.\n\nSenate Republicans crafted a resolution with some flexibility on spending cuts, but that could still face problems in the House, where a group of conservatives want to push for a higher figure.\n\nEarlier this week South Carolina Republican Rep. Ralph Norman, asked about supporting a Senate resolution with a range of spending cuts, told reporters, \"To me it's dead on arrival.\"\n\nOn the amount of cuts, he said, \"It's gotta be the $2 trillion - we have to be on lockstep with that.\" Norman also said he opposed the $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling, telling reporters, \"I had trouble with 4 [trillion]. I went along with that [for the House budget reconciliation plan in February].\"\n\nTo avoid a filibuster in the Senate and pass new policy, Republicans are using a feature of the budget process called reconciliation . The provisions that they include must have a substantial impact on the budget in order to be eligible for the simple majority vote.\n\nHowever, even if they pass this resolution, there will be several procedural hurdles between now and when they could potentially pass any new policies.\n\nRegardless, Thune on Wednesday said he was hopeful Republicans would be able to move ahead.\n\n\"The Senate parliamentarian has reviewed the Budget Committee's substitute amendment and deemed it appropriate for consideration under the Budget Act,\" Thune said. \"It is now time for the Senate to move forward with this budget resolution in order to further advance our shared Republican agenda in Congress.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, like other Democrats, slammed the proposal, claiming it will trigger major cuts.\n\n\"As Americans start to feel the pain from the brazen Republican cuts, Republicans are running full speed ahead to pass their plan to gut vital programs, throw Americans off Medicaid, to give massive tax breaks to billionaires,\" he said in a statement.\n\nNPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "As Trump takes office again, he has even more sway over the Republican Party\n\nStephen Fowler\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump talks to reporters after a meeting with Republicans at the Capitol on Jan. 8. Steve Helber/AP hide caption\n\nWhen President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House on Monday, he'll have firm control over a Republican Party that controls both chambers of Congress.\n\nMany of Trump's most vocal opponents within the party, like former Rep. Liz Cheney, are no longer in office. And other onetime campaign rivals, like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , are set for key roles in his administration.\n\nWith the GOP now lined up behind Trump, the most visible internecine squabbles playing out in Congress and in conservative circles are instead among those vying to prove their visions are the best implementation of Trump's MAGA agenda.\n\nOne of those fights erupted last month online around the topic of H-1B visas for skilled tech workers.\n\nTrump backers like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who've been tasked by the president-elect to find ways to cut government spending, say Trump's \"America First\" agenda includes recruiting top talent from outside the country.\n\nBut some far-right activists argued, sometimes with racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric, that the visas are an example of why legal immigration needs to be drastically curbed to protect American workers. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon is one voice railing against the visas.\n\nTrump suspended the H-1B program during the pandemic in 2020, arguing that certain visa programs were being abused to bring in foreign workers at the expense of Americans. But his second term could be different, thanks in part to the increasing influence of Musk and other prominent tech leaders who want Trump's agenda to aid the industry. Trump's own view of H1-B visas is not exactly clear .\n\nInside the halls of Congress, the debate among Republicans is less about tackling Trump's political priorities and more the legislative logistics of making it happen.\n\nHouse Republicans have a razor-thin majority, and its leaders favor one massive bill that would include everything from border security and energy policy to tax cuts and raising the debt ceiling.\n\nSenate leaders prefer splitting his proposals into two bills, seeking to pass border legislation as soon as possible while finalizing complicated tax proposals will take longer.\n\nAnd then there's Trump, who told reporters last week after a meeting with GOP lawmakers that the final outcome is more important than the process to get there. \"We had a great meeting, there's great unity,\" he said. \"Whether it's one-bill or two-bill, it's going to get done one way or the other.\"\n\nElsewhere in Washington, D.C., there are more signs of Republicans rowing in one direction: Trump's.\n\nThe Senate this week began confirmation hearings for Trump's Cabinet nominees, with even controversial picks like Pete Hegseth for defense secretary getting broad GOP support.\n\nNo Republican senator has signaled opposition to any of the picks thus far, though some have indicated that nominees like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the proposed health secretary and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as the director of national intelligence will face more scrutiny throughout the process.\n\nThis week, the Republican National Committee will hold its winter meeting in Washington, D.C., where the party will tick through mundane business, like rules and budget discussions, as well as celebrate the party's 2024 election victories. While Republicans were outraised and outspent in the multibillion-dollar cycle, the RNC and Trump campaign's combined organizing efforts saw success in turning out new voters and making inroads with almost every demographic group, compared with Trump's 2020 defeat.\n\nThere will also be officer elections, with few notable changes after Trump pushed for new leadership of the party in March 2024.\n\nHis pick, former North Carolina Republican Party Chair Michael Whatley, is expected to stay on as the chair of the RNC. Current RNC Treasurer KC Crosbie of Kentucky has Trump's backing to serve as the new co-chair and succeeds his daughter-in-law Lara Trump.\n\nThat level of coordination and integration with Trump's political views has also filtered down to many state and local Republican parties, where a shift in leadership and membership since the last presidential election has activated a new crop of grassroots support and minimized the influence of those who are critical of his actions and message.\n\nThe continued alignment of the national and local party infrastructure with the vision of Trump as leader of the GOP is in contrast to the Democrats, where Democratic National Committee members will elect a new chair at their winter meeting at the end of the month.\n\nThe new leadership comes as Democrats look to regroup their focus and future direction after Vice President Harris' loss to Trump was attributed to lower Democratic voter turnout and the unpopularity of President Biden, among other factors.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Steve Helber/AP hide caption\n\nDedicated to the \"To the Forgotten Men and Women of America,\" the Republican Party's 2024 platform reads like the transcript of a Trump rally speech.\n\nThe Republican National Committee's Platform Committee adopted former President Donald Trump's platform, a document that leans into Trump's preferred \"America First\" stances and steers away from traditional GOP social issues.\n\nThe platform starts with 20 promises, largely pulling from the tag lines of the former president, including \"STOP THE MIGRANT INVASION\" and the simplistic \"END INFLATION.\" Trump's campaign sought to pare down the party platform.\n\nMore recently, Trump has made sure to try to distance himself from the controversial (and lengthy) Project 2025 policy document put together by some of his allies .\n\nNotably, the promises don't mention anything about abortion, as Trump attempts to de-emphasize the issue and appeal to swing voters. In the entire platform, the word appears just once, in a statement about the party's dedication to protecting \"the issue of life.\" It reads: \"We will oppose Late Term Abortion.\"\n\nAfter appointing the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the constitutional right to abortion, he's said the issue should now be up to states.\n\nOther social issues appear more frequently, including promises related to limiting federal funding for schools teaching so-called Critical Race Theory and keeping \"men out of women's sports.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Exit polls, which are not that reliable, but it's what we have - exit polls show President-elect Trump drew support from voters without a college degree and those who make less than $100,000 per year. Here's independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with the Democrats, speaking on NBC's \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: If you're an average working person out there, do you really think that the Democratic Party is going to the mats, taking on powerful special interests and fighting for you? I think the overwhelming answer is no, and that is what has got to change. FADEL: Paul Clark, a labor and employment relations professor at Penn State University, has been following how working-class people vote for years. He spoke with our colleague Michel Martin, and says the trend of blue-collar workers voting Republican instead of Democrat started in the early 2000s. PAUL CLARK: It predates Trump, but I think Trump really tapped into it and accelerated the transition. I think the economic issues are certainly part of it. These workers feel like they've been left behind. Globalization has benefited many groups, but not them. There's a certain resentment and anger, and I think Trump has tapped into that. I also think that he's touched on some changes in terms of working-class voters prioritizing social and cultural issues - DEI and racial issues, the number of immigrants coming into many working-class communities, transgenderism, guns, abortion. Trump has really become a part of working-class culture in this country. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: How do you know that? CLARK: You can look at the data in terms of - by income that defines working-class voters. In the 2008 election, Obama got 63% of voters making less than $50,000, and McCain got 35%. That's a 28% margin. In 2012, Obama got 60%. It fell to a 22% margin. In 2024, Harris got 48.5% and Trump 49%, meaning that between 2008 and 2024, the Democrats lost almost 30% of working-class voters. And that's enough to explain the outcomes of the election by itself. MARTIN: And that's voters making less than $50,000 a year? CLARK: Yes. MARTIN: OK. CLARK: You also see something similar with $50,000-100,000. It's not as dramatic, but Democrats went from having a majority of those voters in 2008 to, in 2024, Trump having a majority of those voters. MARTIN: So let me just go back a little bit to the economic questions. Trump's record in his first administration was business-friendly. That's not a secret. I mean, his Supreme Court nominees were very focused on, say, curbing the power of regulatory agencies, for example. He promises more of the same. He's talked about tax cuts, which advantage higher earners, although he does say he's going to eliminate taxes on tipped wages. Is that message not getting through? Or do these Trump supporters just not care so much about that, as long as they feel that he's handling their business? CLARK: Well, I think there's been a little amnesia or looking back at the Trump economy as being rosier than it is. The economy has changed, and people are dealing with inflation. But the fact that Trump is speaking to them is seeming to connect with them, that he's listening and he's going to do something for them in terms of the economy. I think that's had an impact. But I also think behind that are the social and cultural issues. MARTIN: Before we let you go, we started our conversation talking about where the Democrats fell short. And you identify the fact that this has been a long-term trend of Republicans having more appeal to voters without college degrees, with voters who make less income. Obviously, it's not your job to advise the Democrats, but if you were, what should they be thinking about? CLARK: I think as the Democrats go forward, they have to think about candidates who have a closer connection to working-class voters. I'm not sure that that was a strong suit of Harris. And if they want to reclaim those voters, they're going to need someone who's more like a Joe Biden, who connected very well with those groups of workers. He could sit down and talk to them. They felt that he understood them. MARTIN: That is Paul Clark. He's a professor of labor and employment relations at Penn State University. Professor Clark, thanks so much for talking with us.

He spoke with our colleague Michel Martin, and says the trend of blue-collar workers voting Republican instead of Democrat started in the early 2000s. PAUL CLARK: It predates Trump, but I think Trump really tapped into it and accelerated the transition. I think the economic issues are certainly part of it. These workers feel like they've been left behind. Globalization has benefited many groups, but not them. There's a certain resentment and anger, and I think Trump has tapped into that. I also think that he's touched on some changes in terms of working-class voters prioritizing social and cultural issues - DEI and racial issues, the number of immigrants coming into many working-class communities, transgenderism, guns, abortion. Trump has really become a part of working-class culture in this country. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: How do you know that? CLARK: You can look at the data in terms of - by income that defines working-class voters. In the 2008 election, Obama got 63% of voters making less than $50,000, and McCain got 35%. That's a 28% margin. In 2012, Obama got 60%. It fell to a 22% margin. In 2024, Harris got 48.5% and Trump 49%, meaning that between 2008 and 2024, the Democrats lost almost 30% of working-class voters. And that's enough to explain the outcomes of the election by itself. MARTIN: And that's voters making less than $50,000 a year? CLARK: Yes. MARTIN: OK. CLARK: You also see something similar with $50,000-100,000. It's not as dramatic, but Democrats went from having a majority of those voters in 2008 to, in 2024, Trump having a majority of those voters. MARTIN: So let me just go back a little bit to the economic questions. Trump's record in his first administration was business-friendly. That's not a secret. I mean, his Supreme Court nominees were very focused on, say, curbing the power of regulatory agencies, for example. He promises more of the same. He's talked about tax cuts, which advantage higher earners, although he does say he's going to eliminate taxes on tipped wages. Is that message not getting through? Or do these Trump supporters just not care so much about that, as long as they feel that he's handling their business? CLARK: Well, I think there's been a little amnesia or looking back at the Trump economy as being rosier than it is. The economy has changed, and people are dealing with inflation. But the fact that Trump is speaking to them is seeming to connect with them, that he's listening and he's going to do something for them in terms of the economy. I think that's had an impact. But I also think behind that are the social and cultural issues. MARTIN: Before we let you go, we started our conversation talking about where the Democrats fell short. And you identify the fact that this has been a long-term trend of Republicans having more appeal to voters without college degrees, with voters who make less income. Obviously, it's not your job to advise the Democrats, but if you were, what should they be thinking about? CLARK: I think as the Democrats go forward, they have to think about candidates who have a closer connection to working-class voters. I'm not sure that that was a strong suit of Harris. And if they want to reclaim those voters, they're going to need someone who's more like a Joe Biden, who connected very well with those groups of workers. He could sit down and talk to them. They felt that he understood them. MARTIN: That is Paul Clark. He's a professor of labor and employment relations at Penn State University. Professor Clark, thanks so much for talking with us.

And that's enough to explain the outcomes of the election by itself. MARTIN: And that's voters making less than $50,000 a year? CLARK: Yes. MARTIN: OK. CLARK: You also see something similar with $50,000-100,000. It's not as dramatic, but Democrats went from having a majority of those voters in 2008 to, in 2024, Trump having a majority of those voters. MARTIN: So let me just go back a little bit to the economic questions. Trump's record in his first administration was business-friendly. That's not a secret. I mean, his Supreme Court nominees were very focused on, say, curbing the power of regulatory agencies, for example. He promises more of the same. He's talked about tax cuts, which advantage higher earners, although he does say he's going to eliminate taxes on tipped wages. Is that message not getting through? Or do these Trump supporters just not care so much about that, as long as they feel that he's handling their business? CLARK: Well, I think there's been a little amnesia or looking back at the Trump economy as being rosier than it is. The economy has changed, and people are dealing with inflation. But the fact that Trump is speaking to them is seeming to connect with them, that he's listening and he's going to do something for them in terms of the economy. I think that's had an impact. But I also think behind that are the social and cultural issues. MARTIN: Before we let you go, we started our conversation talking about where the Democrats fell short. And you identify the fact that this has been a long-term trend of Republicans having more appeal to voters without college degrees, with voters who make less income. Obviously, it's not your job to advise the Democrats, but if you were, what should they be thinking about? CLARK: I think as the Democrats go forward, they have to think about candidates who have a closer connection to working-class voters. I'm not sure that that was a strong suit of Harris. And if they want to reclaim those voters, they're going to need someone who's more like a Joe Biden, who connected very well with those groups of workers. He could sit down and talk to them. They felt that he understood them. MARTIN: That is Paul Clark. He's a professor of labor and employment relations at Penn State University. Professor Clark, thanks so much for talking with us.

He spoke with our colleague Michel Martin, and says the trend of blue-collar workers voting Republican instead of Democrat started in the early 2000s. PAUL CLARK: It predates Trump, but I think Trump really tapped into it and accelerated the transition. I think the economic issues are certainly part of it. These workers feel like they've been left behind. Globalization has benefited many groups, but not them. There's a certain resentment and anger, and I think Trump has tapped into that. I also think that he's touched on some changes in terms of working-class voters prioritizing social and cultural issues - DEI and racial issues, the number of immigrants coming into many working-class communities, transgenderism, guns, abortion. Trump has really become a part of working-class culture in this country. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: How do you know that? CLARK: You can look at the data in terms of - by income that defines working-class voters. In the 2008 election, Obama got 63% of voters making less than $50,000, and McCain got 35%. That's a 28% margin. In 2012, Obama got 60%. It fell to a 22% margin. In 2024, Harris got 48.5% and Trump 49%, meaning that between 2008 and 2024, the Democrats lost almost 30% of working-class voters.

He's talked about tax cuts, which advantage higher earners, although he does say he's going to eliminate taxes on tipped wages. Is that message not getting through? Or do these Trump supporters just not care so much about that, as long as they feel that he's handling their business? CLARK: Well, I think there's been a little amnesia or looking back at the Trump economy as being rosier than it is. The economy has changed, and people are dealing with inflation. But the fact that Trump is speaking to them is seeming to connect with them, that he's listening and he's going to do something for them in terms of the economy. I think that's had an impact. But I also think behind that are the social and cultural issues. MARTIN: Before we let you go, we started our conversation talking about where the Democrats fell short. And you identify the fact that this has been a long-term trend of Republicans having more appeal to voters without college degrees, with voters who make less income. Obviously, it's not your job to advise the Democrats, but if you were, what should they be thinking about? CLARK: I think as the Democrats go forward, they have to think about candidates who have a closer connection to working-class voters. I'm not sure that that was a strong suit of Harris. And if they want to reclaim those voters, they're going to need someone who's more like a Joe Biden, who connected very well with those groups of workers. He could sit down and talk to them. They felt that he understood them. MARTIN: That is Paul Clark. He's a professor of labor and employment relations at Penn State University. Professor Clark, thanks so much for talking with us.

Bloomberg/Getty Images hide caption\n\nRepublicans have officially won a full trifecta of power in Washington, D.C., following GOP victories in several key U.S. House contests.\n\nThe Associated Press on Tuesday night called the final race in California, guaranteeing Republicans a narrow majority in the House and a three-seat majority in the Senate.\n\nRepublicans will have just a 220-215 majority, one less seat than this past Congress. A party needs 218 for a majority. That means Republicans lost a seat in a year when President-elect Donald Trump won the White House.\n\nThe result raises questions about how the GOP will fare in a post-Trump political world. Trump is term-limited and unable to run again in 2028.\n\nThat could mean Trump priorities, like tax cuts, take longer to pass until special elections are held to fill potential GOP vacancies. The party has struggled to pass legislation with a narrow majority and even ousted a speaker just last year.\n\nThe campaign for control of the House was waged on a narrow playing field of roughly three dozen competitive districts. While the presidential campaign was centered on seven purple states in the Midwest and the Sun Belt, the contest for the House featured a cluster of critical swing races in the blue states of New York and California.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump will once again have allies on Capitol Hill in place to enact key items on his agenda, like border security. Republicans are also already planning an extension of the tax cuts Trump enacted in 2017 - the last time he and his party had control of the White House and Congress.\n\nPreviously, House Republicans selected Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., for his first full term in the role. Johnson must still be elected with 218 votes on the House floor on Jan. 3, 2025. An expected narrow majority means Johnson will need near unanimous support from GOP members to be reelected.\n\nRepublicans picked Johnson to lead the party in the House just over a year ago, after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was removed by his own members.\n\nJohnson will work alongside Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., who was elected to lead the 53-47 GOP majority in the Senate next year. Thune succeeds Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who announced earlier this year that he would step aside from party leadership after nearly 20 years.\n\nThune told reporters that his priority will be advancing Trump's agenda.\n\n\"This Republican team is united. We are one team, we are excited to reclaim the majority and get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump's agenda,\" Thune said after his closed-door election. \"We have a mandate from the American people - a mandate not only to clean up the mess left by the Biden-Harris-Schumer agenda, but also to deliver on President Trump's priorities.\"\n\nLoading...\n\n- NPR's Domenico Montanaro contributed to this story.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nVice President JD Vance will assume the role of finance chairman for the Republican National Committee - an unconventional move for a sitting vice president, but one that also places a top ally of President Trump within the party's campaign wing ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\n\"Last year, President Trump won an historic election victory, taking back the White House and helping Republicans regain control of the Senate and retain control of the House,\" Vance said in a statement provided by the RNC on Tuesday. \"But to fully enact the MAGA mandate and President Trump's vision that voters demanded, we must keep and grow our Republican majorities in 2026.\"\n\nPresidents and vice presidents typically hold indirect influence over their party's national committee, rather than serving within the ranks. According to the RNC, Vance will be the first sitting vice president to serve as finance chairman.\n\n\"Vice President Vance is not only one of our Party's most talented messengers, he is also a thought leader who has helped remake the GOP into the party of working Americans representing the forgotten men and women of our country,\" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement.\n\nAs finance chairman, Vance will play a key role in the GOP's fundraising efforts, getting valuable facetime with some of the most influential conservative donors - a potentially beneficial role for the vice president as he weighs his political ambitions for the 2028 presidential race.\n\nIt could also be a boost for his resume, said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, if Vance can bring in considerable cash during a high-stakes time for the party.\n\n\"Hard jobs are usually given to the vice president,\" Bonjean said. \"Raising money in a midterm where it's going to be tough to keep the House of Representatives for Republicans - that are the party in power - is going to be a difficult job.\"\n\n\"If Vance can pull it off, it really gives him a leg up going into '28,\" he added.\n\nThough still years away, Vance is currently considered a front-runner in what may be a packed Republican presidential primary. However, Trump told FOX News in February that he does not see Vance as his successor - at least not yet.\n\n\"I think you have a lot of very capable people,\" Trump said. \"So far, I think he's doing a fantastic job. It's too early. We're just starting.\"\n\nVance is not the first member of Trump's inner circle to work within the RNC. The president's daughter-in-law Lara Trump previously served as a co-chair of the committee but stepped down in December.\n\nVance will succeed former investor Duke Buchan as finance chair. Trump has selected Buchan to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Morocco. Buchan served as ambassador to Spain during Trump's first administration.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

They want to galvanize support for Harris among Republicans wary of former President Donald Trump. The thing is, they're also reluctant to vote against the party they've long belonged to. From the Democratic National Convention, here's NPR's Ben Giles. BEN GILES, BYLINE: In Chicago, there's a growing list of Republicans bucking the GOP in favor of Harris, from former Congressman Adam Kinzinger to Republican strategist Ana Navarro, to Rich Logis, a conservative commentator from Florida who describes himself as an ex-MAGA activist. He addressed the convention Monday evening via video. RICH LOGIS: So this is my message to all the Republicans and independents who are watching, people like me who voted for and believed in Trump. I made a grave mistake, but it's never too late to change your mind. You don't need to agree with everything you hear tonight to do what is right. B GILES: Beyond Chicago, the Harris campaign is trying to harness that growing dissatisfaction with Trump and disenchantment with a Republican Party molded in his MAGA image by creating an inclusive environment for Republicans to support the Democratic ticket. Republicans like Kinzinger have lent their voice to the movement in places like Arizona. Voters who select candidates from different parties could be the deciding votes in a once solidly Republican state President Joe Biden won by roughly 10,000 votes four years ago. ADAM KINZINGER: While we may not agree with Kamala Harris on all policies or even most of the policies, in my mind this is about, do we want our kids and our grandkids to be raised in a democracy that is as healthy as the one we were raised in or not? And I think I do. B GILES: On a Zoom call to rally more Arizona Republicans to Harris' cause, Kinzinger acknowledged there's plenty to disagree with the vice president about when it comes to policy. But those concerns are secondary to what he called the imminent threat of a second Trump term in the White House. KINZINGER: If I'm sitting in a trench and I have an enemy that's 5 meters away and I have an enemy that's 40 meters away, well, I'm going to focus all my attention on the guy that's 5 meters away from me. That's my threat. And that's what we're doing now is that threat to democracy. That 40 meters away are the things we disagree about. We can deal with that later. B GILES: In Arizona, the effort is growing by word of mouth. When the state coalition of Republicans for Harris launched more than two weeks ago, it boasted about 40 members. Membership doubled in about 48 hours, according to the Harris campaign, and now has about 100 Republicans backing the vice president. The Republicans in control of the state party view this as nothing short of betrayal. And the reaction has been merciless and, in some instances, vulgar. The Maricopa County Republican Committee formally censured the local Republicans in the coalition. And State Senator Jake Hoffman, the leader of the local Freedom Caucus, described them as prostitutes as well as another similar term. To Mesa Mayor John Giles, it's the kind of behavior that underscores his disillusionment with the party under the reign of Trump. JOHN GILES: I didn't leave the Republican Party. I'm still a member of the Republican Party, but I believe in a lot of ways the Republican Party left me. B GILES: The once big tent of the Republican Party, Giles says, is getting smaller and smaller. So for now, he'll join the Harris and Walz cause. Giles is scheduled to speak to the convention this evening. He'll deliver a message like the one he shared at a Harris rally in the Phoenix suburbs last week. Republicans owe nothing to a party he says has abandoned them. J GILES: And by all means, you owe no displaced loyalty to a candidate that is morally and ethically bankrupt. (CHEERING) B GILES: It's a matter, he says, of putting country over party, at least for now, to stop Trump. Ben Giles, NPR News, Chicago.

He addressed the convention Monday evening via video. RICH LOGIS: So this is my message to all the Republicans and independents who are watching, people like me who voted for and believed in Trump. I made a grave mistake, but it's never too late to change your mind. You don't need to agree with everything you hear tonight to do what is right. B GILES: Beyond Chicago, the Harris campaign is trying to harness that growing dissatisfaction with Trump and disenchantment with a Republican Party molded in his MAGA image by creating an inclusive environment for Republicans to support the Democratic ticket. Republicans like Kinzinger have lent their voice to the movement in places like Arizona. Voters who select candidates from different parties could be the deciding votes in a once solidly Republican state President Joe Biden won by roughly 10,000 votes four years ago. ADAM KINZINGER: While we may not agree with Kamala Harris on all policies or even most of the policies, in my mind this is about, do we want our kids and our grandkids to be raised in a democracy that is as healthy as the one we were raised in or not? And I think I do. B GILES: On a Zoom call to rally more Arizona Republicans to Harris' cause, Kinzinger acknowledged there's plenty to disagree with the vice president about when it comes to policy. But those concerns are secondary to what he called the imminent threat of a second Trump term in the White House. KINZINGER: If I'm sitting in a trench and I have an enemy that's 5 meters away and I have an enemy that's 40 meters away, well, I'm going to focus all my attention on the guy that's 5 meters away from me. That's my threat. And that's what we're doing now is that threat to democracy. That 40 meters away are the things we disagree about. We can deal with that later. B GILES: In Arizona, the effort is growing by word of mouth. When the state coalition of Republicans for Harris launched more than two weeks ago, it boasted about 40 members. Membership doubled in about 48 hours, according to the Harris campaign, and now has about 100 Republicans backing the vice president. The Republicans in control of the state party view this as nothing short of betrayal. And the reaction has been merciless and, in some instances, vulgar. The Maricopa County Republican Committee formally censured the local Republicans in the coalition. And State Senator Jake Hoffman, the leader of the local Freedom Caucus, described them as prostitutes as well as another similar term. To Mesa Mayor John Giles, it's the kind of behavior that underscores his disillusionment with the party under the reign of Trump. JOHN GILES: I didn't leave the Republican Party. I'm still a member of the Republican Party, but I believe in a lot of ways the Republican Party left me. B GILES: The once big tent of the Republican Party, Giles says, is getting smaller and smaller. So for now, he'll join the Harris and Walz cause. Giles is scheduled to speak to the convention this evening. He'll deliver a message like the one he shared at a Harris rally in the Phoenix suburbs last week. Republicans owe nothing to a party he says has abandoned them. J GILES: And by all means, you owe no displaced loyalty to a candidate that is morally and ethically bankrupt.

      "text": "The RNC is over. Here are 5 things you need to know.\n\nSarah McCammon\n\nBalloons drop as the final day of the Republican National Convention ends. Grace Widyatmadja/NPR hide caption\n\nThe 2024 Republican National Convention wrapped up on Thursday night in Milwaukee with former President Donald Trump's address to the delegates. Trump's speech marked the first major public remarks he delivered following the assassination attempt against him less than a week ago.\n\nIt was also the first in-person Republican convention since the COVID pandemic prompted cancellation of most events surrounding the 2020 RNC. The final evening featured a wide range of speakers, from the retired professional wrestler Hulk Hogan to the evangelical leader Franklin Graham, culminating in Trump's speech, which capped off a week of events and speeches in support of the former president's vision of the country. Here's what you need to know from the 2024 Republican convention.\n\nAs he formally accepted his nomination for the third time, Trump began by promising to be a president for \"all of America,\" before ultimately pivoting to attacking his enemies - albeit in an unusually sedate tone of voice.\n\nTrump's speech foregrounded his attempted assassination, which he described moment by moment, telling the crowd he was protected by \"Almighty God.\"\n\nAfter those calls for unity and expressions of gratitude, Trump eventually shifted to attacking Democrats for, in his words, \"weaponizing\" the justice system through the multiple criminal indictments he has faced. Without evidence, he accused his political opponents of using the Covid pandemic to \"cheat\" on the 2020 election - despite the fact that multiple bipartisan reviews have affirmed the legitimacy of the election.\n\nTrump also complained about Democrats who've described his actions including his refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election as a threat to democracy , claiming, \"I am the one saving democracy.\"\n\nTrump's Republican critics were either absent from the convention, or fully converted. The most notable convert to Trump's cause: his new running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who'd once called Trump \"noxious\" and said he was leading the white working class to a \"dark place.\" Several of Trump's former rivals for the nomination, including former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley - who earlier this year said she felt \"no need to kiss the ring\" - appeared on stage and gave speeches endorsing Trump.\n\nAfter surviving the assassination attempt over the weekend, Trump has emerged looking stronger than ever in the minds of many of his supporters. His son Eric Trump attributed his survival to \"divine intervention\" and called his father \"the greatest fighter I have ever seen.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, left, and Senator J.D. Vance, a Republican from Ohio and Republican vice-presidential nominee, during the final night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption\n\nThere had been wide speculation for months that Trump might seek to broaden his appeal by picking a female running mate, such as New York Rep. Elise Stefanik or even former rival Nikki Haley; or another person of color, such as South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Instead, Trump chose another white man - and one seen as someone who will be an aggressive fighter on Trump's behalf.\n\nVance's evolution from Trump critic to Trump supporter, and his Ohio roots, could help him make a case for Trump to swing voters in key states in the Midwest and Rust Belt.\n\nTrump's 17-year-old granddaughter, Kai, addressed the convention Wednesday night, giving her first public speech and marking the first time any of his grandchildren have spoken publicly.\n\nTrump's daughter-in-law Lara, co-chair of the Republican National Committee, now dominated by Trump allies, delivered Tuesday night's keynote speech, describing him as an \"amazing grandfather.\" Lara Trump also thanked her father-in-law for always supporting her, saying \"thank you for never giving up on me.\"\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump's former press secretary, spoke that same night, painting the picture of a compassionate boss who empowered women in his White House.\n\nFormer First Lady Melania Trump, who is seen in public infrequently, made her first appearance on the convention floor Thursday night. Trump praised his wife during his speech, thanking her for releasing a letter calling for national unity after the assassination attempt.\n\nRepublicans know that Gen Z voters, as a group, do not feel especially beholden to either major party, and they see an opening.\n\nVance, at 39, is the first millennial to be on a major party presidential ticket.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, a former rival for the Republican nomination, spoke directly to millennials and Gen Z in his speech on Tuesday. Ramaswamy, who's 38, told millennials, \"we can't just be cynical about our country because the United States of America is still the last, best hope that we have.\"\n\nTo Gen Z voters, Ramaswamy said \"you're gonna be the generation that actually saves this country,\" telling younger voters that the best way to be a \"rebel\" is to be a conservative on college campuses.\n\nThe convention also highlighted a group of fraternity brothers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who gained attention recently for holding up an American flag after anti-Israel protesters tried to replace it with a Palestinian flag.\n\nThe outreach from Republicans to younger voters comes as recent polling shows Biden and his party apparently losing ground with younger Black and Latino voters, particularly men.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former President Donald Trump.

Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe historic numbers of immigrants arriving at the southern border and seeking shelter in cities like New York and Chicago has been making headlines for more than a year. American voters report mixed feelings: 47% have said immigration is a major concern, but two-thirds of Americans continue to see it as beneficial to the country.\n\nThe Biden administration's immigration policy has been described as a \"carrot and stick\" approach: punish migrants who enter the U.S. without documents, and encourage folks to apply to enter legally. In order to alleviate pressure at the southern border, the president has also expanded legal programs for immigrants from countries like Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Ukraine. Many advocates have said asylum seekers fleeing persecution can't wait to apply to enter legally; meanwhile Republicans have accused Biden of executive overreach and are suing in federal court.\n\nBiden's policy has had mixed results. This year, there has been a record rise in people displaced globally, and an unprecedented number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border: more than 2.5 million.\n\nBut those numbers only tell part of the story. Overall, the number of people crossing the border without permission outside legal ports of entry has decreased since September. The number of migrants arriving at legal points of entry has more than doubled. More immigrants than ever before are being placed in deportation proceedings when they go through ports of entry. What this means is people are given a \"notice to appear\" in immigration court at a future date that could be within months or even years later. As NPR has reported, the system, which has an extensive backlog, has the feel of \" a revolving door .\"\n\nWhat happens to immigrants once they are in the country has led to intense friction between the White House and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Earlier this year, several Republican governors began bussing migrants to Democratic-led cities like New York and Chicago. New York alone has received over 150,000 migrants in the last 18 months , and butted heads with the Biden administration, saying its shelter system cannot handle any more. Migrant destination cities like Chicago are finding their homelessness problem compounded.\n\nThe administration has said its hands are tied without Congress coming together on immigration. Republican presidential candidates have said Biden's policies have been disastrous, and made a harder stance on immigration the centerpiece of their campaigns. Notably, the Republican frontrunner, former President Donald Trump, has proposed a historic, radical shift in U.S. immigration policies. He has not only promised to reinstate some of the more controversial policies enacted during his presidency, he's also vowed to expand them. Other Republican candidates' proposals essentially mirror his. As one Los Angeles Times columnist recently described it, immigration promises are a \" contest to out-Trump Trump .\"\n\nLoading...\n\nAt the heart of Republican promises are expanding the immigration detention system, strengthening Border Patrol, deputizing local law enforcement, deploying military to the border, and large scale deportations. One of the main concerns they have expressed has been fentanyl coming over the border - although, as NPR has reported, virtually no migrants or asylum seekers have been caught smuggling fentanyl, and it mostly comes through legal ports of entry.\n\nTrump has said he will expedite deportations at the border and conduct \" the largest deportation operation \" in history, modeled after President Dwight Eisenhower's mass deportation program of 1954. He has also said he would not rule out the practice of family separation at the border, which caused widespread outrage and lawsuits during his presidency - the administration eventually had to rescind the policy. However, a federal judge recently banned this policy for the next eight years.\n\nThe New York Times has reported Trump plans to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities in order to hold people awaiting processing and court appearances. During his presidency, Trump advocated for increased spending on border protection. While he has not clarified his position in this campaign cycle, Trump has said he will give the National Guard and local law enforcement authority to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said, if elected, he too will expand detention. He will increase pay for Border Patrol agents, and recruit former military and police officers. One of the hallmarks of DeSantis' governorship in Florida has been a hardline stance on immigration, which he has called an \"invasion.\" He has criticized Trump for not finishing the southern border wall and promised to do so, saying \"we need to build a wall across the southern border. I'll get it done and I'll make... Mexico is supposed to pay for it, remember?\"\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has often touted her own hardline immigration policies . While she hasn't really said much on deputizing the National Guard or local law enforcement to assist with immigration enforcement, she certainly has the track record for it: using local police forces was one of the hallmarks of her career as governor. Scholars have pointed out that the legality of the military engaging in domestic law enforcement would be questionable.\n\nShe has said she would add 25,000 Border Patrol and ICE agents, specifically taking back the additional federal budget allocated for the IRS . Still, she has positioned herself as the more middle-of -the-road conservative for Republicans who want an alternative to Trump.\n\nShe has also said she supports deporting immigrants who have arrived in the country during President Biden's term, including through legal programs. \"Instead of 'catch-and-release,' we'll go to catch and deport,\" is a common applause line at her rallies. But Haley has also said she would consider leniency towards undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. longer: \"For those that have been here longer than that, we've got to start seeing, who is it? How long have they been here? Have they been vetted? Have they paid taxes? Have they been working? And figure out who else is out there.\" Haley has pointed to her own experience as the daughter of immigrants. \"What I know is my parents came here legally, they put in the time, they put in the price, they are offended by those that are coming illegally. We can't let them skip the line.\"\n\nIn the most recent Republican debate, Vivek Ramaswamy pushed back on any kind of consideration for undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. for longer periods of time. \"What about all of the illegals who are already here?\" h e asked. Ramaswamy too is advocating for deploying the military to protect the southern border, and deputizing local law enforcement. \"There are one million then officials, law enforcement officials in this country, and against that backdrop, we absolutely have the ability to deport anybody who's in this country illegally.\" Novelly, Ramaswamy also announced support for a border wall at the northern border with Canada, something no other candidate has remarked upon.\n\nRamaswamy and DeSantis have also pledged to work to close the Darien Gap, a treacherous jungle region between Colombia and Panama through which many migrants travel on the journey to the southern border. \"Close the Darien Gap through threats of sanctions/tariffs against Colombia, Panama, & Costa Rica,\" Ramaswamy has said , \"which have for years controlled the flow of migrants.\" This is not an entirely new stance. There have been talks of the Biden administration working with local governments to stop the flow of migrants through the gap.\n\nPerhaps the more moderate position on immigration has come from former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Christie has said \"we are not going to be able to apprehend and detain our way out of this problem.\" He has, however, indicated that he would also \"send the National Guard to the southern border,\" as he said earlier this year in an interview with CNN . In fact, he's promised this would be his first move if elected president. \"No matter how hard our Customs [agents] and Border Patrol agents and our Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are working, they need back-up .\" To do that, Christie supports building the border wall. \"At this point, I think we've started to build it; let's finish it... And - and we've put away with the fiction that Mexico is going to pay for it. Right? So that would be one of the priorities.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nOne of the most heavy handed promises to come from Republicans is military action in Mexico in order to confront the narco-trafficking problem. It is not the first time Republicans have considered using military force inside Mexico to attack cartels. According to Trump's former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, the former president proposed sending missiles to Mexico to target cartels.\n\nThe idea has gained traction among Republican candidates, and outraged the Mexican government (there has not been a U.S. military incursion into Mexico in over a century). Still, DeSantis has pledged to \"change the rules of engagement on the border\" and send Special Forces into Mexico to confront drug cartels. Ramaswamy has said he will attempt to negotiate with the Mexican government, but if there is no cooperation, he will send troops in . \"It's like if you have a neighbor who has a dog that comes over to your yard and keeps biting your family members repeatedly. If they keep doing that, at some point you can take a shotgun and shoot that dog,\" said Ramaswamy a few months ago on Fox News. \"You know what you tell the Mexican president? Haley supports a special operation in Mexico, saying earlier this year, \"either you do it or we do it. But we are not going to let all of this lawlessness continue to happen.\" Christie has said he will give Mexico 90 days to take action against cartels, or take matters into his own hands.\n\nExperts have pointed out that sending troops to Mexico without that nation's authorization could be a diplomatic disaster, to which Trump recently responded, \"Mexico is sending their troops into our country in the form of illegal aliens that are killing people, in many cases, that are causing lots of disease and lots of problems.\" The conflation of migrants with drug trafficking - especially the smuggling of fentanyl - is a constant theme amongst all Republican candidates. It's also categorically untrue : the vast majority of illicit fentanyl - close to 90% - is seized at official border crossings. Immigration authorities say nearly all of that is smuggled by people who are legally authorized to cross the border, and more than half by U.S. citizens. Virtually none is seized from migrants seeking asylum.\n\nLoading...\n\nThis is one of the most controversial promises on the campaign trail, albeit not a new one. DeSantis, Trump and Ramaswamy have said that they will take action to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants. As a reminder, Trump wanted to do this during his presidency. Haley has echoed this stance, though with specific distinction: \"For the 5 million people who've entered our country illegally, I am against birthright citizenship,\" she told Fox News in July. \"For those that are in this country legally, of course, I think we go according to the Constitution, and that's fine.\"\n\nLegal scholars have pointed out that it is unlikely this would be possible, given the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States. Ramaswamy has recently balked at this interpretation, saying it's a misreading of the amendment. \"The left will howl about the Constitution and the 14th Amendment. The difference between me and them is I've actually read the 14th Amendment... if the kid of a Mexican diplomat doesn't enjoy birthright citizenship, then neither does the kid of an illegal immigrant who broke the law to come here.\"\n\nAsylum seekers arriving at the southern border in record numbers have driven the national immigration debate in recent years, so this is a focal point for most Republican candidates, who have said they will limit access to asylum significantly.\n\nRamaswamy went so far as to call the refugee problem \"fake.\" In October, he posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, \"TRUTH: we need to admit that the U.S. has a self-created fake refugee problem that is *systemic.* You can't cure a cancer until you acknowledge its existence.\"\n\nOthers are playing silly political \"gotcha\" games on what to do with Gazan refugees, but here's the TRUTH: we need to admit that the U.S. has a self-created fake refugee problem that is *systemic.* You can't cure a cancer until you acknowledge its existence. As President, I will...\n\nRamaswamy then promised to \"implement an asylum & refugee moratorium until our borders are fully secured and our asylum laws are updated - period.\" Ramaswamy has also indicated he would end Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which offers temporary protection from deportation to certain designated groups fleeing unsafe conditions.\n\nTrump, DeSantis, Ramaswamy and Haley have all said they would reinstate \" remain in Mexico ,\" a Trump-era policy which forced asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for their court date. \"We'll go back to the 'Remain in Mexico' policy because, guess what, no one wants to remain in Mexico,\" Haley has said . It was a controversial policy as migrants were staying in border towns and cities, often controlled by Mexican drug cartels.\n\nDeSantis has also said he will reinstate the Asylum Cooperative Agreements with Northern Triangle Countries , a Trump-era agreement with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala that would allow the U.S. to send asylum seekers to these countries and bar them from applying for protection in the U.S.\n\nSeveral Republican candidates are promising to cut off types of aid and government assistance for immigrant communities.\n\nOne DeSantis promise that has received less attention is a plan to cut funding for NGOs that are encouraging mass migration on behalf of the Biden administration.\" He has also pledged to remove undocumented immigrants from U.S. Census apportionment calculations, which provides the data by which federal funding decisions are made, as well as how congressional seats are drawn.\n\nImmigrants and the census was a constant battle for President Trump , who has pledged to stop immigrants from accessing any type of welfare benefits. \"It's all being paid for by the American taxpayer.\"\n\nIn a similar vein, defunding so-called sanctuary cities, or municipalities with protections for undocumented immigrants, has been an ongoing theme for all candidates. As governor of Florida, DeSantis signed a bill in 2019 prohibiting sanctuary policies. He and Ramaswamy have said that they will penalize sanctuary cities, by cutting off millions of dollars in grants. Haley has also said she will \"make sure we defund sanctuary cities once and for all.\"\n\nWith the current national attention on the Israel-Hamas conflict and ongoing protests nationwide on both sides of the issue, several candidates have called on the federal government to revoke visas from students who have supported Palestine or participated in anti-Israel protests.\n\nThen-President Trump's executive order banning entry into the U.S. by people from certain Muslim-majority nations caused international uproar. Trump has said that he will reinstate and expand this policy if elected in 2024. \"No longer will we allow dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots, and maniacs to get residency in our country. We're not going to let them stay here. If you empathize with radical Islamic, terrorists and extremists, you're disqualified. You're just disqualified.\"\n\nTrump has also indicated he will institute ideological screenings for visas. \"We will revoke the student visas of radical anti-American and antisemitic foreigners at our colleges and universities and we will send them straight back home.\"\n\nDeSantis, who recently ordered Florida's university system to shut down a pro-Palestinian group, supports deporting students he deems supportive of Hamas, saying they \"don't have a right to be here on a visa. You don't have a right to be studying in the United States.\" He's said if elected president, he will expel those students from the country. Beyond just students, DeSantis has said \"there needs to be limits on immigration and we should not be importing people from cultures that are hostile... we're not taking anyone from Gaza because of the antisemitism and because they reject... effect American culture, so we've got to get smart about this.\"\n\nAs NPR has reported, it is already quite difficult for Palestinians to come to the US as refugees: since 2014, only around 500 have arrived.\n\nHaley has disagreed somewhat with the Trump administration's ban. Her take : \"It's not about a religion, it's about a fact that certain countries are dangerous and are threats to us... I don't think that you have a straight-up Muslim ban as much as you look at the countries that have terrorist activities that want to hurt Americans. You can ban those people from those countries,\" she said. She pointed to recent migrants coming across the southern border from countries such as Iran, Yemen or Lebanon, which she called \"areas where they say death to America.\"\n\nOne of the major demands from cities like Chicago and New York, which received large influxes of migrants, was that the federal government help expedite work authorizations, and thus move people out of the shelter system quicker. The cry of \"Let them work!\" became ubiquitous in New York Mayor Eric Adams' speeches. Business leaders have also been demanding policies that help alleviate labor shortages. As NPR has reported, the process of getting a work authorization is complicated for migrants and asylum seekers, and this often pushes them into exploitative informal labor. It also means industries in dire need of workers can't legally hire them.\n\nLoading...\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "What a big Republican win Tuesday could mean for Obamacare\n\nFrom\n\nBy\n\nDan Gorenstein\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks as former President Donald Trump listens during a news conference, April 12, 2024, at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. Johnson promised recently that if they gain control in Congress, Republicans' agenda includes \"massive reform\" of the Affordable Care Act. Wilfredo Lee/AP hide caption\n\nThough the fate of the Affordable Care Act has played a role in presidential elections in the U.S. for more than a decade, this race has been different. Apart from a few cameos, the 14-year old law - often called Obamacare - has been largely off-stage, as immigration, the economy and democracy dominate the fight between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut 45 million Americans rely on the health law for their health coverage - either through private plans or Medicaid - and, in these final days of the race the ACA has returned to the spotlight.\n\nAt a campaign stop in Pennsylvania last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson told a crowd that \"massive reform\" of the health law is needed, adding no specifics. But he did promise a \"very aggressive first-100-days agenda\" if Trump wins. \"Health care reform's going to be a big part of the agenda,\" Johnson said.\n\nAs part of a major speech on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., Harris warned Americans of what could happen if the ACA were to be repealed. \"You will pay even more if Donald Trump finally gets his way and repeals the Affordable Care Act - which would throw millions of Americans off their health insurance,\" Harris said, \"and take us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions.\"\n\nThe upcoming elections could have \"enormous\" impact on the law, says Larry Levitt, an executive vice president of the nonpartisan health policy research organization KFF. Levitt has studied the ACA since its inception.\n\n\"I don't think you can overstate the effect the ACA has had on the availability and the affordability of health insurance in this country,\" he says.\n\nHe recently shared insights into the ACA's track record and discussed what \"massive reform\" from Republicans might look like on the health policy podcast Tradeoffs.\n\nHere are highlights from that conversation.\n\nInterview highlights\n\nOn the risks to the Affordable Care Act\n\nIf Republicans sweep this election, I think the ACA, along with Medicaid, will have big targets on their back. If Harris wins or Democrats are able to hold on to one house in Congress, I think the ACA will be safe. And even though the ACA has not been a big topic in this campaign, it is still a fork-in-the-road election for the future of the law.\n\nOn how the American public views the ACA\n\nWe've been polling for more than a decade and a half about the ACA. ... When the ACA was being debated after it passed, it was quite controversial. That changed when Republicans tried to repeal and replace it in 2017. For the first time, the ACA was clearly more popular than not and has grown more popular since then. Now, 62% of the public views the ACA favorably. That's dramatically different than when over half the public viewed it unfavorably. ... It's now over a decade since the ACA's main provisions went into effect and more and more people have benefited from the law.\n\nOn why the ACA marked 'a sea change' in U.S. health care\n\nThe impact has been tremendous. If you had a preexisting condition before the Affordable Care Act - a cancer diagnosis, multiple sclerosis, being pregnant, being overweight - if you tried to buy insurance on your own, you would be denied. If it was a mild preexisting condition, you might be offered health insurance, but have to pay a higher premium, or have benefits associated with your health condition excluded from your coverage.\n\nSo the ACA was a sea change. Insurance companies have to provide coverage regardless of your health. They can't charge you a higher premium if you're sick. And there are a set of essential benefits that all insurance companies have to provide.\n\nOver a quarter of adults under age 65 have a preexisting condition that would have led to a denial of insurance before the ACA. So this is not something that affects a small number of people.\n\nOn how the ACA made good health insurance more affordable\n\nNow, under the ACA, the federal government provides a tax credit that covers at least a portion of the premium for people who are very low-income. ... It's extremely expensive to get health insurance in this country. I mean, health insurance for a family now costs what it would cost to buy a car. For the vast majority [who don't have job-based insurance], without the federal help to pay a portion of the premium, they simply couldn't afford coverage.\n\nOn why the ACA pushed the overall cost of premiums and deductibles higher\n\nWhen the ACA went into effect, the price of health insurance policies you buy on your own went up . That's because insurers had to provide coverage for preexisting conditions, had to provide certain essential required benefits - they had to cover more stuff .\n\nThey had to cover mental health. They had to cover maternity. They had to cover substance abuse treatment. All of that costs money. So premiums went up. Now, the [portion of the premium] that people pay out of their own pockets went down. And that's because of the subsidies the federal government is providing to help people pay for their health care.\n\nOn the quality of health coverage since Obamacare took effect\n\nThe quality of coverage has, I think, largely gone up. The benefits - the stuff that insurance companies have to provide - are now more comprehensive. It covers preexisting conditions. It covers all of these required benefits.\n\nNow, health insurance generally is still far from perfect. Networks - the doctors and hospitals that insurers cover - are often quite narrow . It can be hard to get an appointment. That's not true just under the ACA. It's true for people who get insurance through their employer as well. I don't think you can pin this on the ACA, but health insurance is certainly not perfect.\n\nOn Republican ideas for health care reform\n\nThere are a few different ideas out there . We saw some of this in the comments by Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance - creating high risk pools for people with preexisting conditions, or creating separate [insurance] pools for people who are sick and people who are healthy.\n\nAnd if we look back at President Trump's presidency, his budgets proposed converting both the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid into a block grant to states, meaning removing federal rules and giving states a lump sum of money and giving states flexibility in how to use that money. We've seen similar plans, for example, from a group of conservative Republicans in the House that would also convert Medicaid in the ACA into a block grant to states, remove federal protections in the insurance market, and cut federal spending by $4.5 trillion over a decade.\n\nOn the trade-offs of some Republican alternatives to ACA coverage - like limited-duration health insurance , association health plans and Farm Bureau health plans\n\nAll these ideas have trade-offs. The ACA required mandated benefits. That all costs money, and that raised [monthly] premiums, particularly for younger and healthier people. These ideas - like segregating risk pools or association health plans - have trade-offs in the other direction. People who are young and healthy could get cheaper insurance, but people who are older and sicker would end up paying more.\n\nTradeoffs is a nonprofit health policy news organization. Dan Gorenstein is the executive editor. Reporter Ryan Levi produced this story for the Tradeoffs podcast. Tradeoffs' Deborah Franklin adapted this story for web.

      "text": "Republicans Turn Against the League of Women Voters\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nFor decades, the League of Women Voters played a vital but largely practical role in American politics: tending to the information needs of voters by hosting debates and conducting candidate surveys. While it wouldn't endorse specific politicians, it quietly supported progressive causes.\n\nThe group was known for clipboards, not confrontation; for being respected, not reviled.\n\nBut those quiet days are now over, a casualty of the volatile political climate of the last few years and the league's goal of being relevant to a new generation.\n\nIn 2018, the league's CEO was arrested , along with hundreds of other protesters, for crowding a Senate office building to demand lawmakers reject Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative accused of sexual harassment.\n\nTwo years later, the league dissolved its chapter in Nevada after the state president penned an op-ed in July 2020 accusing the Democrats of hypocrisy for opposing gerrymandering in red states while \"harassing\" the league in Nevada over its activism on the issue.\n\nAnd two days after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, the league's board of directors called then-President Donald Trump a \"tyrannical despot\" and blamed him for inciting the violence and for threatening democracy. The league demanded his removal from office \"via any legal means.\"\n\nAs a result, the league is calling attention to itself and drawing criticism in ways that are extraordinary for the once-staid group. Republicans are increasingly pushing back hard against the league, casting it as a collection of angry leftists rather than friendly do-gooders.\n\nAnd with more right-leaning candidates snubbing the league, voters are less likely to hear directly from those candidates in unscripted and unfiltered forums where their views can receive greater visibility and scrutiny. That pushback sidelines the league at a time when misinformation has become a significant force in elections at every level.\n\n\"The League of Women Voters, while that sounds like a nice organization, they don't do a lot of nice work,\" Catalina Lauf, a Republican candidate for Congress in Illinois, said in a video posted in May on Instagram, explaining her reasoning for refusing to participate in a league-sponsored debate.\n\nThe league, she claimed, \"peddles Marxist ideology\" and is \"anti-American.\" In an interview with ProPublica, Lauf cited the league's support for the rights of transgender student athletes as one reason she is suspicious of the group. She also claimed the league has endorsed the defunding of police departments, though that is inaccurate. The league has, however, taken stands in favor of sweeping police reforms that would address brutality and racial profiling.\n\n\"They need to switch their brand fast,\" Lauf said. \"Because their hyperpartisanship is turning off a lot of women who just want common sense.\"\n\nConservative candidates for school board and county supervisor in Wisconsin have fired similar broadsides when declining to participate in league debates. And in Pennsylvania this year, only 30% of Republican candidates completed the league's VOTE411.org informational guide for the primaries, compared with 70% of Democrats, according to the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania. The guide gives voters the candidates' unedited answers to questions about their qualifications, priorities and stances on certain issues.\n\nElsewhere, Republican-led policies make it harder for groups like the league to add people to the voting rolls. In Kansas, because of a change in law, the league no longer registers voters - a task that has long been central to its mission.\n\nUnder its bylaws, the league does not endorse candidates. And by policy, board members can't run for or hold any partisan elected office . Nor can they chair a political campaign, or fundraise or actively work for any candidate for a partisan office.\n\nJust as its founders were crusaders, however, the league itself is outspoken on a multitude of issues, including supporting universal health care, abortion rights, affordable child care and clean water. The league has pushed for gun control measures since 1990. And it has been a strong voice nationally for campaign finance reform. In some communities, the league has even weighed in on zoning decisions.\n\nIts viewpoints have long branded the league as a progressive organization. \"They're very fine, but they tend to be a little bit liberal,\" the late Sen. Bob Dole, a Republican from Kansas, said of the league during a televised 1976 vice presidential debate in Houston .\n\nThose liberal leanings have been harder to ignore in recent years, forcing the league to defend itself against claims of partisanship.\n\nAfter its CEO was arrested at the Kavanaugh protest in 2018, the league admitted in a statement that openly opposing a Supreme Court nominee was \"an extraordinary step for the League,\" but said it believed the action was warranted.\n\n\"This situation is too important to sit silently while the independence of our judiciary is threatened.\" CEO Virginia Kase Solomón closed her legal case by paying a $50 fine.\n\nThe league's chief communications officer, Sarah Courtney, told ProPublica in a written statement: \"Organizations always need to change with the times and current events in order to stay relevant.\"\n\nShe noted: \"The League has been a force in American democracy for more than a century, and we expect to be around in another hundred years. We haven't gotten this far by doing things the same way we did them in 1920.\"\n\nUCLA professor Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert, said that while it's clear that the league has been more aggressive in taking on controversial issues, it's the group's core mission that puts it at odds with some politicians. Supporting voting rights, he said, can be seen as an attack on the Republican Party, which has pushed for laws that make it more difficult to register and to vote. (Republicans say they are doing so to protect the integrity of elections, though there is no evidence of any widespread voter fraud.)\n\n\"It's hard to be seen as neutral when you have the political parties dividing over questions like voting rights,\" said Hasen, who directs the law school's Safeguarding Democracy Project, which is aimed at researching election integrity.\n\nTo Hasen, the league's evolution is notable. \"Generally, there's kind of a caricature of the league as kind of a group of old women coming together for tea,\" he said. \"Whereas, I think the league has become much more of a powerhouse in terms of advocating for strong voting rights.\"\n\nIt took women more than 70 years of agitating, organizing and marching to convince men to give them the right to vote in 1920. Once the 19th Amendment was ratified, these activist women were wary of the political parties, which wanted their votes but not necessarily their input.\n\n\"Women in the parties must be more independent than men,\" the league's founder, suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt , wrote, according to papers kept by the Library of Congress. \"They must dare to fight for what they believe is right.\"\n\nCatt worried that some women would come to believe that all virtue or all wisdom was held by the party, paralyzing their judgment.\n\nThe league, which was formed the same year women nationwide were finally granted the right to vote, dedicated itself not to political parties , or the men running them, but to specific causes. One cause helped forge its identity: educating league members and other voters at election time.\n\nIts first political agenda was long, numbering 69 items, and was called a \"kettle of eels\" by the league's own president. Many of those items, such as child welfare and access to quality education, have remained league priorities for decades - as has its commitment to voter education. In 2018 and 2020, the league and ProPublica worked together to produce a guide sharing basic, nonpartisan information to help citizens choose among candidates and obtain ballots.\n\nFor nearly a century, the league itself seemed to change little, but by 2018 it found itself at a crossroads.\n\nLeadership hired consultants and began to look for ways to reach disillusioned voters, combat misinformation in elections and effectively respond to society's escalating racial issues, including the disenfranchisement of people of color.\n\n\"Although it remains a trusted household name, many stakeholders cannot describe clearly the purpose of the organization and are unclear about its relevance,\" a league consultant wrote in a 2018 report . \"The membership is much older and whiter than the population at large, and League membership has steadily declined by almost a third over the past few decades.\"\n\nMembership plunged from 72,657 in 1994 to 53,284 in 2017, according to the report. (It has since climbed back up to over 70,000, the league said.)\n\nThe organization also faced greater competition. Dozens of new nonprofits had emerged to protect voting rights , including Indivisible, NextGen America, Color of Change and Hip Hop Caucus.\n\nAccording to the consultant's report, league members long knew that its homogenous membership limited its effectiveness and its appeal to a broader audience. So, in the midst of the Black Lives Matter movement, the league issued a formal mea culpa.\n\nIn an August 2018 blog post , the league's president and its CEO admitted that \"our organization was not welcoming to women of color through most of our existence\" and vowed to build \"a stronger, more inclusive democracy.\" Many of the early suffragists were also abolitionists, but after the Civil War, they were divided over whether to support the 15th Amendment, which at the time gave Black men, but not women, the right to vote. The fissure persisted for decades and had lasting consequences for the league.\n\n\"Even during the Civil Rights movement, the League was not as present as we should have been,\" the post said. \"While activists risked life and limb to register black voters in the South, the League's work and our leaders were late in joining to help protect all voters at the polls.\"\n\nIn recent years, the league has been more visible in advocating for racial equity and fairness. It particularly focused on reducing barriers to voting in marginalized communities. The league has fought, for instance, against reductions in the number of polling places or voting hours in minority communities.\n\nAfter a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd by kneeling on the Black man's neck in May 2020, the league announced the next month that it would strongly push for reforms in the justice system, including changes aimed at preventing excessive force and brutality by law enforcement.\n\n\"The League of Women Voters of Minneapolis is not your grandmother's League,\" Anita Newhouse, the city chapter's league president at the time, wrote in the MinnPost , a nonprofit news outlet, in August 2020. \"We are still the nonpartisan education and advocacy group committed to empowering voters, but with a commitment to identifying racism and dismantling policies that suppress non-white votes.\"\n\nEven within the league, not everyone feels the group applies its principles evenly.\n\nFor five years, Sondra Cosgrove, a College of Southern Nevada history professor specializing in multicultural issues, ran the league in Nevada as it took on issues such as gerrymandering.\n\nBut she's no longer part of the organization, and she wonders whether that's because she was not always clearly in the Democrats' corner.\n\nIn 2019, the league launched a 50-state Fair Maps strategy to combat racial and political gerrymandering. As league president in Nevada, Cosgrove began pushing for a ballot initiative that would create an independent commission to draw legislative district boundaries. The move would have taken power away from the Democrats, who controlled the statehouse and the governor's office.\n\nCosgrove soon found the league's ballot initiative challenged unsuccessfully in court by a Black activist and, later, by the Democratic governor, who did not allow petition signatures to be collected electronically during the pandemic.\n\nAbout a week after her July 2020 op-ed accusing the Democrats of hypocrisy and \"harassing\" the league in Nevada, officials from the national league office emailed Cosgrove, instructing her to \"stop making public statements online and in the media accusing the Democratic party of attacking the League of Women Voters.\" The officials clarified that their position would be no different if Cosgrove was criticizing Republicans.\n\nCosgrove, however, said she told the league's national office she wouldn't seek its input on public statements. The league dissolved the state chapter not long afterward, in December 2020. Cosgrove and others quit the national organization and now are with another voting group.\n\n\"There was always the feeling the league was run by the Democrats,\" said former Nevada league Treasurer Ann Marie Smith. \"We tried to fight that to a large degree, but in my opinion the national league has gone down that road much further than they should have.\"\n\nExecutives in the league's national organization told ProPublica that the decision to shut down the state chapter was not an easy one and was made \"after multiple attempts to resolve policy violations\" that went beyond just the clash with the governor.\n\n\"Ultimately, the board had no choice but to disband the Nevada league to protect the entire organization,\" Courtney, the league spokesperson, said. \"Our northern Nevada local league has remained active with a dedicated group of members who are committed to rebuilding the league's presence in the state.\"\n\nThe league does sometimes call out Democrats.\n\nIn late July of this year, the league released an update on its Fair Maps initiative, saying it had organized public hearings in 24 states, used apps and software to test draw fairer maps in 38 states, and joined 11 state lawsuits and six federal cases challenging maps in California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin. Two of those states feature Democrats in control of the state legislative chambers and the governor's office. Five of them have Republican control. In the rest, control is split.\n\nBut, going forward, the league may find it more difficult to do the work it's always done.\n\nThe league chapter in Mountain Lakes, New Jersey, for instance, has faced what one member there called sustained opposition in recent years.\n\nComplaints from a parent, who is also a Republican on the borough council, derailed the league's annual Running and Winning high school program in 2019, which was to feature female speakers from both parties as a way to encourage young women to pursue careers in politics. The parent argued that the league had a political agenda and was excluding high school boys and male politicians.\n\nUltimately, the school district canceled the event.\n\nPolitical tensions only got worse in the months that followed. When the newly created Laker Republican Club emailed an unsolicited mass membership appeal throughout the community, a league board member replied with an email questioning the morals, courage and patriotism of Trump and his supporters. The league defended her, saying she was speaking as a private citizen and she did not reference her role with the league.\n\nLocal Republicans running for borough council responded by refusing to participate in league debates in 2020. Former Mountain Lakes Mayor Blair Schleicher Wilson wrote in a local publication that she had been a member of the league for 25 years but now supported the candidates who shunned the league.\n\nWilson, a Republican, wrote that the local league chapter \"has sadly lost their way.\" In an interview with ProPublica, she added that she loved being involved with the league but believes it should stick only to voter advocacy. \"I always thought their focus should be more on voter services,\" she said. \"That's a perfect place for them.\"\n\nThe chapter lost about 30 members because of the community tensions and is trying to rebuild, said former Mountain Lakes league President Mary Alosio-Joelsson, now the organization's events leader.\n\nShe believes conservatives in Mountain Lakes have changed, not the league. \"Many have moved so far to the right that anybody who is walking down the middle of the road looks like they're on the left,\" she said.\n\nThe shift in the country's political climate also has far-reaching implications for what the league considers some of its most essential work. In Kansas, the organization halted registration work a year ago after a measure enacted by a Republican-led legislature made it a felony to engage \"in conduct that would cause another person to believe a person ... is an election official.\"\n\nThe league worried its volunteers could be prosecuted if someone mistakenly believed them to be election officials while registering voters. Douglas County District Attorney Suzanne Valdez, a Democrat, agreed there were problems with the law and said she wouldn't pursue cases of alleged violations.\n\n\"This law criminalizes essential efforts by trusted nonpartisan groups like the League of Women Voters to engage Kansans on participation in accessible, accountable and fair elections,\" she said in a statement.\n\nBut Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, a Republican, quickly retorted that his office would, indeed, prosecute alleged violators .\n\nThe league asked the Kansas Court of Appeals for an injunction that would temporarily prevent the law from being enforced, but the group lost and is now requesting a review from the state Supreme Court.\n\nRead More\n\nDespite the setback, Jacqueline Lightcap, co-president of the League of Women Voters of Kansas, said the league intends to continue to work to defend democracy and empower voters. But she said the mission has become harder. Even seeking dialogue with legislators on the ramifications of the registration law is difficult.\n\n\"We are not getting much traction,\" she said.\n\nHelp ProPublica Investigate Threats to U.S. Democracy\n\nWe want to hear directly from the people involved in the administration of our elections - local clerks, canvassers, poll workers and more - about new challenges on the job.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI'm a ProPublica reporter covering issues in Wisconsin and throughout the Midwest.\n\nI'm interested in tips about public corruption, corporate mismanagement or institutional failures that have harmed people in Wisconsin.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "What Idaho's Republican Primary Tells Us About America's Culture Wars\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nFor years, Idaho has been at the vanguard of the culture wars that are playing out in conservative states across the country.\n\nIt was the first state to attempt to restrict transgender girls and women from competing on women's athletic teams, passing legislation that became a model for states across the country . It was among the first to explicitly ban \"critical race theory\" from public schools and target diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in public institutions. And the Idaho Freedom Foundation, a far-right Idaho political group, took an early lead in a nationwide campaign to remove books from libraries based on their content.\n\nBut Idaho Republicans have increasingly disagreed over how far to take these efforts. Capitol police in Boise had to intervene in a 2022 fight over proposed \"parental freedom\" legislation that, among other things, would have created a $1,000 fine if a school didn't give parents what they want. This year, two prominent far-right Republicans were recorded quarreling over the party's direction - an exchange that InvestigateWest said illustrates \"a fracture among key far-right figures in Idaho politics, in a state where many races turn on contests of conservative purity.\"\n\nThe Idaho Republican primary on May 21 continued the Legislature's march to the right. Candidates who were aligned with the highly conservative Idaho Freedom Foundation picked up a net of eight seats, according to the group's own tally. And in a state with so few Democrats, GOP primary winners are typically all but a lock to win in November's general.\n\nYet these GOP purists fell short of one important milestone: enough members to outright control the legislative agenda. Some moderates fended off challengers from the right. Some incumbent hard-liners lost their seats.\n\nThe primary results were the latest reminder that Idaho Republicans remain far from united. And there are signs that the rift is leading frustrated Idaho voters to reject incumbents in general - conservative and moderate alike.\n\nHere are some takeaways, based on local news reports and ProPublica's interviews with experts in Idaho politics.\n\nA surprising number of incumbents were knocked out of office in May. Almost all of the 87 Republicans in office were on the ballot. Of the 47 who faced challengers, 15 lost their seats.\n\nIt wasn't the largest-ever purge, but it included the historic takedown of the GOP Senate leader by a newcomer to Idaho with no legislative experience.\n\nRon Nate, president of the Idaho Freedom Foundation, wrote in a blog post that the primary was \"a good night for friends of liberty and a bad night for establishment good-old-boys.\"\n\nHe noted that 11 of the ousted GOP incumbents had F grades on the group's \" Freedom Index ,\" while three of the losing incumbents had an A grade going into the election.\n\nBut this apparently resounding victory for the group's ideas seems less so considering that prior to the election, the Freedom Foundation gave F's to 47 Republicans who were on the ballot and A's to only 10. In other words, about 23% of the foundation's least-favorite lawmakers lost reelection races, while 30% of its favorites lost.\n\nAt least some of this housecleaning may reflect voter disgust with both warring camps in the Legislature.\n\n\"There's a lot of people who are just frustrated, and so some of it kind of went into an anti-incumbent\" wave, said Jaclyn Kettler, associate professor of political science at Boise State University.\n\nKettler pointed to a recent survey of about 1,000 Idahoans. Although it found that a majority of Republicans thought Idaho was headed in the right direction, a substantial minority - 30% - said it was on the wrong track.\n\nSome of the most important losses for moderates happened in the populous Treasure Valley region, home to Boise and its fast-growing suburbs.\n\nIt's one of few parts of Idaho where Democrats and middle-of-the-road Republicans have traditionally held power, but its electorate has changed with the arrival of more and more right-leaning voters from California .\n\nSen. Chuck Winder, R-Boise, the highest-ranking Republican in the Senate with eight terms of service, lost his seat to Josh Keyser, who was raised in Southern California and moved to Boise in 2018. Keyser's website said he was vice principal at a Christian school.\n\nWinder had clashed with legislators to his right and was a critic of the Idaho Freedom Foundation, which has pushed to slash government spending across the board, worked to repeal the Idaho Medicaid expansion that was enacted by voters, claimed that Idaho's schools are indoctrinating children into leftist politics, and more.\n\nStephanie Witt, professor of public policy, administration and political science at Boise State University, told ProPublica the upset for Winder and other Boise-area incumbents illustrated a stark new reality.\n\n\"It's hard to overstate the number of California relocations and their interest,\" Witt said.\n\n\"We've had people that were good legislators, very conservative, in the Treasure Valley,\" she said, \"but they're being painted like they're Bernie Sanders acolytes.\"\n\nWinder noted the changing politics of Idaho in an interview with the Idaho Press after the election.\n\n\"I think we've had a huge influence from out-of-state people moving here,\" he told the publication. \"All in all, Idaho is going to be fine, but good mainline Idaho people are going to have to get more involved in the party.\"\n\nIn contrast to the wins for right-wing candidates in the capital city and its suburbs, several legislators far from Boise won reelection by wide margins, despite attacks from their county GOP committee claiming they failed to support the Republican platform.\n\nEast Idaho, known for agriculture, a national nuclear laboratory and a large membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also narrowly voted to oust a hard-line conservative incumbent. Julianne Young, an East Idaho Republican who introduced legislation to make \"gender\" and \"sex\" synonymous in state law, trailed her opponent by two votes , though she says she will request a recount.\n\nIn rural North Idaho, voters kicked out Sen. Scott Herndon, a conservative firebrand whose legislative agenda included making abortion illegal for rape victims. Herndon lost to former legislator Jim Woodward, who said he wants to see some health-related exceptions to the state's abortion ban, according to Politico .\n\nThis year's results revealed that some conservative Idahoans went into the voting booth with a \"traditional Idaho trait: that you don't like to be pushed around,\" said Jim Jones, a Republican who previously served as attorney general and chief justice of the Idaho Supreme Court.\n\nJones, an outspoken critic of polarized Republican politics, is pushing for a ballot initiative this fall that would replace party primaries with a single, nonpartisan primary. The top vote-getters would then face off in a ranked-choice vote in the general election. Jones says the initiative would take power away from the fringes and put a premium on appealing to all voters.\n\nThe outcomes also offered a partial verdict on one of the most explosive issues in America's culture wars.\n\nIdaho's GOP last year held a no-confidence vote against 14 legislators statewide who in 2023 failed to support letting parents sue libraries over books considered \"harmful to minors.\" (The no-confidence vote also swept in Idaho's Republican governor.) Nine of the 14 survived the GOP primary.\n\nKettler said the state and local Republican Party members who condemned incumbents over the library issue might be \"more ideologically extreme\" than most voters.\n\nIdaho GOP Chair Dorothy Moon did not respond to interview requests from ProPublica. According to the Idaho Statesman , Moon said in her election night speech, \"I think we're fighting for the heart and soul of the party and the heart and soul of Idaho.\"\n\nThe Idaho Public Policy Survey - the survey of about 1,000 residents conducted in November - found overwhelming support for libraries. About 62% of the 374 self-identified Republicans who responded said they trust the choices of libraries and librarians.\n\nOf the lawmakers who survived the primary despite their party's censure of their library vote, about half were from East Idaho.\n\n\"My view is that, in eastern Idaho, the voters were sick and tired of all of the culture war fighting,\" said Jones.\n\nOne of the highest-profile losses for incumbents was a Boise-area Republican who thwarted tax-funded vouchers that would allow parents to send their children to private school using public funds - a central policy goal of right-wing purists who describe it as \"school choice.\"\n\nJulie Yamamoto led Idaho's House Education Committee when it rejected voucher legislation . Challenger Kent Marmon, who embraces school choice, painted Yamamoto as a liberal.\n\nA Virginia-based political action committee called Make Liberty Win produced fliers saying Yamamoto voted to support \"porn in school libraries being shown to minors,\" Idaho Education News reported , a claim she called \"garbage.\"\n\nThe losses for voucher foes like Yamamoto weren't uniform. The Senate's education chair, who has questioned the benefits of voucher proposals , retained his seat. And the Senate lost a key voucher supporter in Herndon, the North Idaho Republican; his challenger has spoken out against public support for private education, according to Idaho Education News .\n\nIt is unclear what the outcome portends for Republicans when they take up school spending issues next year.\n\nRead More\n\nIdahoans regularly list public education as a top priority. In sparsely populated parts of Idaho, which often lack private schools, the public schoolhouse is a gathering place for football games or performing arts - the \"heart of the community,\" as Jones says.\n\nBut advocates for \"school choice\" in Idaho appear to be finding an audience.\n\nThe recent state policy survey found that 60% of Republicans favored letting Idaho parents use $8,000 of public school money to enroll their student in private or religious school. About twice as many Republicans said they \"strongly favor\" that idea as \"strongly oppose\" it.\n\nKettler said national conservative groups seized on that sentiment and spent heavily on Idaho's primary races this year, seeing Idaho as a place to advance conservative school policies such as vouchers.\n\nThese groups decided, Kettler said, that \"it's worth investing.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nI am a reporter for ProPublica in the Northwest, based in Idaho.\n\nI'm most interested in tips related to state and local government corruption, extremism, policies that put children in danger and systemic failures that harm Idahoans.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "When GOP Attorneys General Embraced Jan. 6, Corporate Funders Fled. Now They're Back.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nAn atmosphere of conviviality greeted Republican attorneys general arriving in New Orleans for their recent winter conference. It was Mardi Gras, and tourists traipsed through the lobby of the historic Roosevelt Hotel wearing colorful beaded necklaces and clutching cocktails.\n\nA few feet from the check-in desk, if any of the attorneys general stopped to notice it, stood a replica of former U.S. Sen. and Louisiana Gov. Huey Long's \"deduct box,\" which reportedly contained more than $1 million in cash donations from businesses and wealthy individuals when the notoriously corrupt Long was assassinated in 1935. The attorneys general were in New Orleans on their own fundraising mission, albeit aboveboard. That evening, in a ballroom one flight up, the Republican Attorneys General Association hosted an invite-only Super Bowl party, where they mixed and mingled with donors, and alcohol flowed freely. There was reason to celebrate. Having endured its worst crisis since it became a standalone entity in 2014, RAGA was thriving again.\n\nRAGA, a tax-exempt political group representing more than half of the states' chief legal officers, had come in for particularly harsh criticism for its support of Trump's election fraud claims in the wake of the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A RAGA sister organization had sent a robocall urging \"patriots\" to join Trump's Jan. 6 rally on the Ellipse in Washington. Then the fuzzy recorded voice went one step further, saying, \"We will march to the Capitol building and call on Congress to stop the steal.\"\n\nOnly a few weeks earlier, Texas' Republican attorney general, Kenneth Paxton, had brought an emergency motion to the Supreme Court to invalidate the results of the vote in four states Joe Biden had won. Seventeen Republican attorneys general, all RAGA members, supported the motion.\n\nThe response from corporate America was swift. A Comcast spokesperson told The New York Times , \"We are appalled and condemn these actions in the strongest possible terms and have communicated that to R.A.G.A.\" The University of Phoenix demanded RAGA return recent contributions. Regular five-figure supporters like Microsoft and Coca-Cola abruptly cut RAGA off, cold turkey. Contributions to the group dropped 36% in 2021 compared with 2020.\n\nRAGA's embrace of Stop the Steal also caused an organizational exodus. RAGA's executive director resigned days after news of the robocall became public. Georgia's Republican attorney general, Chris Carr, who was chairman of RAGA at the time, decided by April 2021 that he could no longer lead the group, citing a \"fundamental difference of opinion\" about \"the significance of the events of January 6.\" At least seven staffers left in the wake of the riot, with one writing a resignation note that said: \"The direction is not one I can honestly stand behind.\"\n\nAt the conference in New Orleans, there was little sign of such chaos. And those corporations that expressed such outrage? While some companies, like Microsoft and Coke, are still staying away, Comcast is more typical. The company resumed giving barely a month after condemning RAGA, and has since contributed close to half a million dollars. Many others are back in the fold as well, including Amazon, Walmart, Visa, Capital One, MasterCard, Intuit, Walgreens, General Motors, Altria, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase's PAC. Even the University of Phoenix, having pulled its donation, is filling RAGA's coffers once again.\n\nOne might imagine that the corporate largesse reflects RAGA having distanced itself from the extremes of its party. Hardly. Since the Jan. 6 controversy, Republican attorneys generals have even more tightly embraced Trumpism and the movement that sows doubt about the legitimacy of elections.\n\nPowered by returning companies, RAGA revenues in 2022 jumped 68%, reaching $21.6 million. The group used some of its funds to boost midterm candidates who pushed the lies that Trump won in 2020 and that the voting system is rife with fraud.\n\nRAGA's rapid return to health demonstrates that some corporations are willing to look past even the most extreme views because access to states' top law officers is just too valuable.  Ethics watchdogs have long been concerned that fundraising shindigs like the one in New Orleans, or at regular retreats at ski and golf resorts, allow corporate donors to buy access to RAGA and its opposite number, the Democratic Attorneys General Association. A 2014 series in The New York Times detailed how corporate lobbyists and lawyers used such access to advocate for lighter regulation and favorable legal settlements.\n\nProPublica reached out to all the companies mentioned in this story. Few returning donors responded to requests for comment. Others, like AT&T, emphasized that they give equally to Democratic attorneys general. An Intuit spokesperson wrote: \"We believe engagement with policymakers is essential to a robust democracy.\"\n\nRAGA did not answer ProPublica's specific questions but offered this written response from executive director Peter Bisbee: \"Our nation's Republican attorneys general are the most effective group of elected officials in combating federal overreach, protecting the Constitution, and stopping the left's woke agenda that targets everything from the innocence of school children to the retirement accounts of hundreds of millions of Americans. I do not believe violence has any place in the political discourse of our country.\"\n\n\"Jan. 6 was a gut punch to our democracy,\" said Chris Toth, the former executive director of the National Association of Attorneys General, a bipartisan group. \"And the fact remains that many of these contributors who said that they were going to cut off RAGA are now contributing money.\"\n\nThe comeback is the product of assiduous courtship.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson and RAGA's executive director scheduled a virtual meeting with four representatives of the pharma and medical devices giant Johnson & Johnson. Wilson had recently become leader of the organization's effort to rebuild relationships with donors: He had taken over as RAGA's chairman after Georgia's Carr, who unambiguously said that Trump lost the election , resigned.\n\nAt the time, Johnson & Johnson was on the record as \"reviewing\" its political giving. The company's then-CEO, Alex Gorsky, said in a statement shortly after the Capitol riot: \"As a U.S. military veteran who served overseas to protect our democracy, I'm devastated by this assault on what our country has stood for since its founding: free, fair and peaceful elections.\"\n\nBut Johnson & Johnson was also facing threats to its bottom line. More than 40 attorneys general were investigating the company's marketing of talc, a mineral that has been linked to cancer. Separately, Wilson was one of 47 state attorneys general actively pursuing a settlement with a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary, Janssen, for its sales and marketing of opioids.\n\nThe calendar invite to the meeting, on Aug. 26, 2021, included two of Johnson & Johnson's top executives handling opioid lawsuits: worldwide vice president for litigation Erik Haas and senior counsel Marc Larkins. The initial email to set up the meeting proposed \"a RAGA call with J&J.\" RAGA executive director Bisbee was invited as well, according to the records, which were obtained by American Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog focused on transparency in government.\n\nIt's not clear what was discussed, but Wilson's consultation appeared to have an effect. Within a month, J&J sent a $285 check to RAGA, followed by a $50,000 donation in November 2021. The law firm that set up the meeting is a longtime RAGA supporter and contributed to Wilson's 2022 reelection campaign.\n\nLegal experts said that attorneys general should not take meetings where active litigation could be discussed alongside appeals for political donations.\"There's an incredible conflict of interest there, and there's certainly an appearance of impropriety,\" said Toth. \"It's not rocket science to stay on the right side of the ethical line here.\"\n\nIn February 2022, Wilson announced an opioid settlement with Johnson & Johnson and three opioid distributors, worth $361 million to the state. Larkins' name appeared on the consent judgment . South Carolina's settlement with Johnson & Johnson followed a formula negotiated jointly by dozens of states. There is no indication that the drug company received preferable treatment because of its support for RAGA.\n\nWilson did not respond to an extensive list of questions from ProPublica.\n\nJohnson & Johnson did not comment, but provided a link to its \" Political Engagement \" webpage, which states, in part: \"Interactions with any government candidate or official must be conducted in a legal and ethical manner consistent with Our Credo, Company policies, and applicable laws.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2021, Wilson courted United Parcel Service as well. After the Capitol riot, UPS had said it \"believes the democratic process is a fundamental and sacred cornerstone for America\" and that \"since our founding, our country has stood for free, fair and peaceful elections.\" The calendar entry for Wilson's July 16, 2021 virtual meeting with two UPS lobbyists was titled, simply, \"Call - RAGA.\"\n\nRAGA laid Wilson's task out for him clearly in a pre-meeting fact sheet on UPS : \"Please remind them that their membership lapsed in February and ask that they renew this quarter,\" it said, noting that the company had donated at the Committee Club level, $15,000.\n\nRAGA also itemized past UPS donations to RAGA and DAGA and identified some of UPS' \"policy interests.\" They included labor issues, the interstate shipment of illegal or illicit goods and a Securities and Exchange Commission proposal to require companies to report on greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThree days after the Wilson-UPS meeting, UPS rejoined RAGA with a $15,000 donation, records show.\n\nIt's not clear what was discussed at the meeting. Michelle Polk, a UPS spokesperson, wrote in an email, \"We support elected officials in both parties with whom we engage on issues relevant to our business.\"\n\nJeff Modisett, a former Democratic Indiana attorney general who now teaches a unit on attorneys general and ethics at UCLA Law School, said both RAGA and DAGA encourage officials to be attentive to donors' priorities.\n\n\"RAGA is a little more blatant about it, but I think both of these organizations try to find areas of concern for the companies,\" Modisett said. \"The whole idea of avoiding the appearance of impropriety seems to have been forgotten by an awful lot of attorneys general.\"\n\nAt the same time it's been winning back donors, RAGA has stayed loyal to MAGA. In April 2021, RAGA selected Bisbee as its new executive director. Previously, Bisbee led the Rule of Law Defense Fund, the sister organization to RAGA that commissioned the Jan. 6 robocall. After refusing to concede that Joe Biden won the 2020 election fairly, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall was elevated to RAGA chairman in late 2022. The vice chairman is Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen. His office in 2021 hosted election denier Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO, who was then looking for a plaintiff to sign on to a lawsuit to overturn the 2020 election. Knudsen's office did not say whether Knudsen attended the meeting.\n\nOver the past two years, some of the attorneys general have signed legal actions aimed at helping Trump in his current legal travails, including an amicus brief objecting to the investigation into the former president's possession of classified documents, which they labeled a \"ransacking\" by the Biden administration. And they filed a brief arguing that Sen. Lindsey Graham should not be forced to testify before the Georgia grand jury probing Trump's election meddling. And even before the Manhattan district attorney's indictment of Trump was unsealed, a number of attorneys general assailed the case, with West Virginia's Patrick Morrisey calling it \"political\" and \"a travesty.\"\n\nIn the 2022 midterms, RAGA funded candidates who baselessly cast doubt on the legitimacy of elections. The group spent more than $3 million in Arizona to boost the attorney general campaign of Abe Hamadeh, who said the 2020 election was \"rigged\"; following his general election loss in 2022, Hamadeh continued to insist he won, despite a recount that confirmed his opponent was the victor. Another RAGA-backed candidate, Matthew DePerno, is under criminal investigation for possibly tampering with voting machines in Michigan. (He also lost.) DePerno told ProPublica \"I did not tamper with any voting equipment.\" Election denialism was not a losing proposition in all races: Kris Kobach, a longtime proponent of the idea that cheating is rampant in elections, was elected attorney general in Kansas, with RAGA spending over $500,000 to support his campaign. In all, RAGA spent at least $8 million to support eight candidates who denied or questioned the outcome of the 2020 presidential race, according to data from AdImpact.\n\nRejoining RAGA hasn't stopped some companies from publicly celebrating their civic engagement. UPS has continued to connect its image with democracy. In 2022, it was listed as the presenter of a \"Democracy Game Show\" hosted by TV personality Terrence J at Democracy Fest in Atlanta. The Sept. 20 event, on Voter Registration Day, aimed to boost civic awareness among high schoolers.\n\nRAGA owes its returning health to corporations like J&J and UPS, but its life force comes from another source entirely: the nonprofits around conservative judicial activist and longtime Federalist Society executive Leonard Leo, including the Judicial Crisis Network and its parent organization, the Concord Fund.\n\nThe Judicial Crisis Network was one of RAGA's very first donors in 2014, and the first to give five figures. In 2021, when many corporations paused their giving, the Concord Fund stepped in with gifts totaling $2.5 million, amounting to nearly 20% of RAGA's income that year, compared with contributing just 15% a year earlier. In 2022, as companies came back, Concord's contribution share dipped only slightly, to 19%.\n\nThe money has gone both ways. A for-profit political strategy company partly owned by Leo, CRC Advisors, has collected payments from RAGA worth about $250,000 since 2020. Expense reports describe its work simply as \"consulting.\"\n\nLeo has not spoken publicly about the unfounded narrative that the 2020 election was fraudulent. But the Concord Fund gave a quarter of a million dollars to the Republican attorneys general as they petitioned the Supreme Court to invalidate the vote in four states in late 2020. And in 2022, Leo wrote a check to support Raúl Labrador, a primary challenger to the incumbent Republican attorney general of Idaho, Lawrence Wasden, who had criticized Texas's effort to challenge the election results of other states. Wasden lost, and Labrador, who said he would have supported the Texas suit, won the primary and then the general election (with support from RAGA) to become attorney general and a RAGA member.\n\nLeo's influence has been felt in other ways, too. In recent months, an obscure controversy has flared up, as some Republican attorneys general have quit the organization that supports bipartisan multistate settlements, the National Association of Attorneys General. In January, a group called the Alliance for Consumers Action Fund ran TV ads assailing NAAG as a \"left wing racket\" and accusing Ohio's Republican Attorney General Dave Yost, who is the group's chairman, of \"protecting NAAG's cash stash.\" The Alliance for Consumers is a trade name for the Concord Fund.\n\nNeither Leonard Leo nor the Concord Fund commented.\n\nWith a solid 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, state attorneys general are able to play the role of batting practice pitcher, lobbing the justices the kinds of cases they need to make precedent-setting rulings on all kinds of matters of law. Paul Nolette, chair of the political science department at Marquette University, notes that state attorneys general are the second most common Supreme Court litigator, behind the federal government itself.\n\n\"They are a perfect vanguard for a bunch of these doctrines and arguments that had been sitting around in law review articles and now you can actually put this into reality,\" Nolette said. \"The Leonard Leo-linked groups or other conservative libertarian ideological groups are realizing the time is right.\"\n\nA case decided in 2022, West Virginia v. EPA, demonstrates that synergy. The Supreme Court endorsed West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey's argument that the Clean Air Act did not give the Environmental Protection Agency broad authority to regulate emissions of gases that cause climate change. The ruling could hobble regulators writing rules at other agencies, too.\n\nLeo has particularly strong ties to RAGA's new executive director. Unlike his predecessor, whose background was in political strategy, Bisbee came to the job as someone steeped in the conservative judicial movement. He worked for more than seven years at the Federalist Society, as membership director and director for state courts.\n\nLast year, Bisbee was a candidate for school board in East Grand Rapids, Michigan. Records show that about half of the $6,350 he raised for his campaign came from staffers at CRC Advisors, the Leo-owned consultancy. (Bisbee lost.)\n\nBisbee has never publicly spoken about his role in the robocall. The fact that he was even considered for the RAGA job caused the organization's then-finance director to resign, writing : \"Pete Bisbee approved the robocall expenditure, and was the only other person accountable for RLDF involvement in the January 6 events. Over the last few months, I have fielded, reassured and assuaged concerns from our core donor base on the future direction of our organization. The result of the executive committee vote to nominate Pete as RAGA's Executive Director is a decision I cannot defend.\"\n\nRead More\n\nThe day after the Super Bowl, the conference at Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans got down to business. The first panel after breakfast was entitled \"Election Law.\" The moderator was Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, who has cast doubt on the result of the 2020 presidential election. The panelists, including a state legislator, a lawyer and a policy specialist, agreed that there is rampant cheating in elections, and that Democrats want to make it even easier to commit voter fraud. One panelist, North Carolina Speaker of the House Tim Moore, was the plaintiff in Moore v. Harper, a closely watched recent Supreme Court case built around the once-fringe doctrine that state legislatures, rather than the courts, should have the last word on how votes are counted. (Many Republican attorneys general joined an amicus brief in favor of Moore's arguments; the case has yet to be decided.) Another speaker was Jason Snead of the Honest Elections Project, a nonprofit that is part of the Leo-linked Concord Fund, who spoke about the need for more restrictive voting rules as a means to restore public trust.\n\nMore than 200 people sat in the ballroom, many of them lobbyists and lawyers representing some of the best-known corporations in America. After about half an hour, the panel ended, and the room was filled with sustained polite applause.\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

Claim Privilege.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nLeer en español.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nEva Bonilla grows furious when she thinks about how Latino voters are treated by the Republican power structure in Texas. At 74, the small business owner watched the GOP Legislature pass a series of measures like a voter ID law that she felt would make it harder for Latinos to cast ballots or run for public office.\n\nTwo years ago, serving as the leader of a Hispanic women's group in Fort Worth, she decided to strike back. The Republican Legislature had just pushed through new election maps that carved up Latino communities and made it even harder for them to elect candidates of their choice. So Bonilla joined other minority voters as plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit alleging intentional discrimination in the 2021 redistricting plan.\n\n\"I wanted to see the right thing done, and this is just not right,\" she said.\n\nThen Bonilla waited.\n\nIn 2022, an election came and went with districts based on the challenged maps. It has now achieved a dubious distinction: Of the 87 lawsuits filed over the 2021 congressional and legislative redistricting plans nationwide, it has dragged on the longest without having held a trial. As another election looms, a trial date has not even been set.\n\nThe reason? Republican leaders asserted their rights to block the most routine give-and-take of lawsuits, resisting handing over documents, providing discovery or submitting to depositions - in effect squashing Bonilla's efforts to uncover how the 2021 maps were drawn. The lawmakers have done so by the rigorous use of two forms of privilege: the better known attorney-client privilege and what is known as legislative privilege, which allows elected members of state legislatures to deliberate in private.\n\nAs the Texas case drags on, legislatures across the country are making new and expansive claims of privilege to keep electoral maps in place and prevent the public from finding out how they made their decisions and why.\n\nTexas lawmakers did not stumble upon these tactics on their own. A national GOP redistricting group helped train Republican lawmakers in Texas on how to approach lawsuits and raised money to pay legal costs. The lawmakers also passed a new law to further protect their deliberations. In addition, they put an outside political operative on the state's payroll so that the legislative privilege could shield his activities. Finally, they relied on GOP map-drawers who worked for law firms, which allowed lawmakers to assert that the maps were \"legal advice.\"\n\nThroughout, the Texas lawmakers have contended they did not discriminate against Latino voters.\n\nIn Louisiana, North Dakota and elsewhere, Republicans have resisted challenges to their maps by asserting privilege. In Washington, Democrats have done the same. Legal experts say the expanding use of privilege robs plaintiffs of key insights. To succeed in court, plaintiffs in many cases have to show legislators intended to discriminate. Without access, explained Harvard Law School professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos, it becomes \"very difficult to prove intent even where it was actually present.\"\n\nThe concept of legislative privilege is protected under the U.S. Constitution's speech and debate clause , and 43 states have embedded it in their constitutions. Originally intended to protect legislators from criminal or civil claims for things they said on the floor, it has come to encompass lawmakers' work-related communications. In theory, affording such protection allowed for frank conversations.\n\nBut in the past, people who wanted to scrutinize a legislature's activities had another, if narrower, way to find out what was going on: They could file open records requests to get access to interactions lawmakers had with outside third parties, such as consultants or political operatives. In Texas and elsewhere, Republicans have succeeded in shielding even these once-public interactions.\n\nConservative judges in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers several states including Texas, and the 8th Circuit, which covers the Dakotas, have recently sided with state legislatures that have used expanded privilege claims to prevent public review. Recently, Arizona Republicans appealed to the 9th Circuit to shield their deliberations .\n\nPartisan battles have long been a staple of redistricting, which happens every 10 years. But as more states craft their new maps out of public sight, the fights are ending up in drawn-out court cases, with enormous consequences for voters. The lawsuits are taking so long to resolve that six states conducted their 2022 elections under maps that had been ruled illegal by lower courts, according to a recent analysis by Democracy Docket, a progressive website that tracks redistricting cases. They await resolution. Lawsuits challenging maps in seven other states were still awaiting court action when the elections took place.\n\nThe Texas GOP undertook its mapmaking effort as the state was undergoing a significant demographic shift. Latinos now slightly outnumber non-Hispanic white people in the state, and they and other minorities account for almost all population growth in the last decade, according to census data. Many of these new residents will likely vote for the Democratic Party. Through aggressive redistricting, however, Republicans have been able to maintain control of the Legislature, all major statewide offices and the state's congressional delegation. And they grabbed one of the two new seats in Congress gained through the population increases.\n\n\"Elections can't really be unwound. You can't go back and change the composition of the Texas Legislature from 2022,\" said Yurij Rudensky, senior counsel with the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan legal institute. The center represents a separate group of minority plaintiffs who are challenging the state's maps. The Justice Department has joined the plaintiffs. \"So using discriminatory districts cuts to the heart of our democracy.\"\n\nTo reconstruct how Texas Republicans stalled the legal fight over their redrawn districts, ProPublica used federal court records in six states as well as interviews with experts, voters and former state officials. Combined they provide the fullest account yet of how state lawmakers hobbled the opposition and hidden their activities.\n\nKeith Gaddie, a former bipartisan litigation consultant, said that in his experience, lawmakers keep their methods secret when they are aggressively gaming the process for political gain. \"The more egregious the gerrymander, the less information can be made available about the process,\" he said. \"It's a nasty, nasty business.\"\n\nRedistricting in Texas was two years away when leaders of the Virginia-based National Republican Redistricting Trust flew into Houston for a poolside briefing for GOP supporters.\n\nEstablished in 2017 to counter a similar Democratic Party redistricting operation, the NRRT and its nonprofit affiliate, Fair Lines America, had many Texas ties. Senior leadership included powerful Texan Karl Rove, a former White House official and longtime consultant to Texas governors.\n\nAt the closed event in 2019 in a Houston suburb, Texas GOP Chairman James Dickey mingled with party loyalists to discuss the two or three new seats they should get in Congress as the state's population boomed, according to social media accounts and interviews. A young supporter took selfies with Washington influencers like James \"Trey\" Trainor , a Texas lawyer whose nomination by President Donald Trump to the Federal Election Commission was being blocked by Democrats because of his criticisms of campaign finance laws. On Instagram, the supporter described it as a helpful session on the \"threats and opportunities redistricting presents.\"\n\nThe NRRT's executive director is Adam Kincaid, a former Republican National Committee strategist. Kincaid had become the go-to conservative voice on redistricting within the party. Soon, he would take a hands-on role in drawing Texas' congressional map. Kincaid declined to comment on his work in Texas \"due to ongoing litigation.\"\n\nOn a party podcast , Kincaid had pushed Republicans to counter what he described as the Democrat's plan to \"sue till it's blue.\" The NRRT distributed talking points asserting that \"Democrats are sitting back counting the cash they plan to use on their trial lawyers to fund their strategy of endless litigation,\" according to a document secured by the watchdog American Oversight .\n\nIn the podcast, Kincaid said the NRRT, which does not have to disclose its donors, would send resources to states facing challenges. Separately, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas promoted a super PAC that raised money to hire redistricting experts and legal counsel and brought in $500,000 in a single day.\n\nTexas had been mired in voting rights litigation for almost a decade. Groups representing Latino and Black voters had sued after the 2010 census too, making similar allegations to today. Then, a district court judicial panel rejected the state's map, ruling that large portions of it were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders and ordering maps to be redrawn. Republicans tried to assert legislative privilege over internal emails, but judges rejected the arguments and ordered the documents released.\n\nEmails exposed GOP staffers plotting about how to draw maps to maximize Republican influence in Latino areas, or as one staffer put it: creating \"Optimal Hispanic Republican Voting Strength.\"\n\nA state lawyer dismissed their plan in Spanish, \"No Bueno,\" slang for \"No Good.\" He warned them not to create a paper trail. The court found discriminatory intent.\n\nThe state appealed. Ultimately, the Supreme Court in 2018 reversed the lower court and sided with the Republicans in a 5-4 ruling.\n\nHaving been embarrassed after 2010, GOP leaders promised transparency this time around. Instead, they took the opposite tack, said Glenn Smith, an author and longtime Houston reporter and Democratic consultant: \"Hide as much as possible.\"\n\nA leader in the buildup to the 2021 redistricting was Republican state Rep. Phil King, a lawyer who has championed religious liberty and Second Amendment issues. King chaired the House Redistricting Committee and set up a tutorial for members in 2019 featuring Ryan Bangert, a hardliner who was appointed by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton. It was obvious, said one attendee, that King was \"preemptively trying to make sure members covered their tracks.\" King's office did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nIn his presentation, Bangert raised what he called \"caution flags,\" according to a tape of the meeting. While judges had differing interpretations of privilege, it was generally waived if information was shared with outside third parties like lobbyists. \"Be very careful,\" he said, of tweets or barroom conversations. Bangert now advises a conservative legal group. His spokesperson said that he had no further redistricting involvement.\n\nKing was the ideal person to lead the fight. He had star billing in 2019 at two sessions of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group of state lawmakers, lobbyists and executives that works to draft and spread conservative legislation. King, a national board member of the council, spoke on a panel that delivered a primer on redistricting challenges. Drawing maps favorable to the GOP while preserving minority rights was tricky, party leaders said at the sessions.\n\nGOP strategist Cleta Mitchell, who later took a lead role in Trump's 2020 election denial effort, worked with the council's redistricting committee. She moderated King's panel at the annual convention, telling the audience sarcastically that it would teach them \"how to gerrymander.\" Slate, which posted leaked audio , said the speakers encouraged \"trashing potential evidence.\"\n\nThe legislators did not want to rely solely on their own discretion, however. In May 2019, a Republican House member from Fort Worth used a routine housekeeping bill to mount a sweeping assault on open records. He slipped a provision into the bill that closed off public access to internal redistricting records. It passed before transparency advocates noticed.\n\nThe bill shielded lawmakers' communications with staff, even interns, as well as outside contractors who might normally be considered third parties. Other legislatures have adopted similar measures. Florida has exempted redistricting documents from its Sunshine Law since 1993, and North Carolina's Republican-led Legislature recently buried a similar exemption in its 625-page budget bill. The Democratic-led Legislature in Washington is under a court challenge for using a loophole in the state constitution to exclude lawmakers from open records requests related to redistricting.\n\nIn addition to passing the law, Texas Republicans assembled legal heavy hitters who, in turn, hired subcontractors who could work behind attorney-client privilege. The House paid more than $1 million to Butler Snow LLP, which hired a Virginia-based demographer to draw maps for the state House of Representatives. (The legal contracts were obtained by American Oversight through an open records request sent before the law was passed.)\n\nThen, for the national congressional seats, 22 GOP members of the Texas Legislature hired Chris Gober, former general counsel for the state Republican Party. It's not unusual for states or members to retain outside counsel. But what Gober then did was hire the NRRT, an outside party, paying the group a mere $5,000. That secured Kincaid's map-drawing services, according to Gober's deposition. He said Kincaid \"had the mouse\" on the computer drawing congressional maps.\n\nGober said he is not proficient with redistricting software and hires subcontractors to work under his direction. \"That arrangement - and our assertion of attorney-client privilege - is not any different than the other circumstances where our firm hires subcontractors,\" he said.\n\nIn the Texas case, NRRT legal counsel Jason Torchinsky argued that Kincaid should not have to give a deposition because it would \"deter full and honest discussions\" between NRRT and partners. After a year of wrangling, a judge ordered Kincaid to answer questions and a deposition is scheduled for early November.\n\nTorchinsky himself has become a key figure in helping Republicans with redistricting. In 2022, he helped devise a new congressional map for the office of Gov. Ron DeSantis . The governor's plan, which faces a federal lawsuit, reduced the voting power of Black residents. A state judge has since ordered the map redrawn. Torchinsky did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nWhile Kincaid focused on drawing a map for the state's congressional seats, GOP map-drawer Adam Foltz arrived from Wisconsin in 2021 to assist the local effort. By then, Republican state Rep. Todd Hunter had succeeded King as House redistricting chairman. Hunter had a checkered history in redistricting; judges in 2011 had criticized him for drawing maps that undermined Latinos , according to The Texas Tribune. Hunter gave Foltz a $120,000-a-year state job, the Tribune reported, and he enjoyed such high-level access that Democrats noticed his car parked in a special driveway for members. Foltz, whose work also fell under the umbrella of privilege, drew a state salary even after map drawing concluded, and he recently got a $6,000 cost-of-living increase.\n\nFoltz had a similar arrangement in Wisconsin, a state lawyers often cite as a poster child for improper government secrecy and prolonged litigation in its 2010 redistricting cycle. Working from a private law firm, Foltz drew maps that later were thrown out, according to local press reports. Foltz remained in a $50,000-a-year state job during litigation. He later gave testimony that a judicial panel called \"almost laughable.\" Foltz declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation. Hunter's office did not respond.\n\nFoltz's deposition in the Texas case remains sealed by order of the court. He is still asserting legislative privilege to try to prevent giving access to his mapping work to the Justice Department, which joined the plaintiffs who are challenging the maps.\n\nThe fight carried over to the Texas Senate as well. Republican-led redistricting helped end the Senate tenure of Beverly Powell, a Democrat. She said she knew she had a target on her back from the time she was elected, unseating a Tea Party Republican in 2018.\n\nPowell's Senate District 10 in Tarrant County, an unpredictable swing district in recent years, was one of several seats Republicans wanted to reclaim to consolidate their power.\n\nShe expected a bad result when the Republican chair of the Senate Redistricting Committee, Joan Huffman, secluded herself to draw a new Senate map. When Powell was finally called in to view it, what she saw outraged her. Her district's minority communities had been split up, diluting their voting strength, while largely white rural counties had been added.\n\n\"I know exactly what you are trying to do,\" Powell said she told Huffman. She dashed off a warning to other senators that Huffman's plan was discriminatory.\n\nSenate District 10 Was Transformed Dramatically After Redistricting in 2021\n\nThe district previously represented racially diverse communities near Fort Worth, but it now encompasses portions of sprawling rural counties with mostly white constituents.\n\nHuffman insisted her map was \"race-blind.\" Her plan sailed through, with a notable dissent from former redistricting chair Sen. Kel Seliger, a Republican then feuding with some fellow Republicans. The Amarillo senator later testified that Huffman's map \"violated the Voting Rights Act.\"\n\nPowell tried unsuccessfully to convince a court to delay the 2022 primary election. She dropped out of the race for reelection, and the powerful House veteran King took her seat.\n\nPowell's complaint about the district is now part of LULAC v. Abbott, the redistricting case now awaiting trial. Her case stands out because \"she has much more information about what happened than any of the rest of us do,\" said Nina Perales, vice president of litigation at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\nRead More\n\nRepublicans have asserted privilege in the Senate mapping fight as well. Overall for all the mapping, their claims cover about two-thirds of the documents the Justice Department wants, including drafts of maps, emails and calendars that reflect protected \"thoughts, opinions and mental impressions,\" documents show. The legislature has disputed that estimate.\n\nThe case stalled for a year while the 5th Circuit weighed privilege in another Texas case. Written by Trump appointee Judge Don R. Willett, its decision defended legislative privilege \"even when constitutional rights are at stake.\" The 8th Circuit also ruled in June in a North Dakota redistricting case that privilege \"protects the functioning of the legislature.\"\n\nJudges in the redistricting case are weighing how these decisions impact 22 outstanding motions for documents and depositions.\n\nFor her part, Bonilla, the Fort Worth small business owner, says she's given up hope. \"The system has failed,\" she said.\n\nJosh Kaplan contributed reporting.

      "text": "Women Made Electoral Gains in Statehouses Across the Country in 2024. The Southeast Is a Different Story.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nA few weeks ago, the clerk of the South Carolina Senate called out each of the 46 members' names, then directed them all to stand and raise their right hands. He needed to swear them in for the new session. Among the supermajority of Republicans, zero women stood.\n\nVoters hadn't elected a single one to the chamber in November.\n\nNow, after more than a decade, the Senate's Republican caucus is once again an all-men's club, one that will make decisions about issues that directly affect women: abortion , in vitro fertilization and Medicaid coverage of lactation specialists , to name a few. November's election ushered in only two women to serve in the entire chamber, and both are Democrats. Given Republicans control what legislation moves forward, neither will wield much power.\n\nWomen aren't represented much more on the other side of the Statehouse. Female lawmakers make up just 10% of South Carolina House Republicans.\n\nSimilar postelection stories are playing out across the Southeast, a region long defined by traditional culture and conservative politics. All but one state that held legislative elections last fall in this region saw losses of Republican women, including Georgia, North Carolina, Arkansas and South Carolina. Tennessee was the lone exception - its voters added a single net Republican woman to their legislature.\n\nMost of the region's legislatures were woefully short of women's representation even before the election, as ProPublica reported at this time last year. Women constitute fewer than 1 in 5 state legislators across much of the Southeast, where most states consistently rank at the bottom of virtually all measures of women's health and well-being.\n\nAcross the country, 2024 again saw gains for female lawmakers. One-third of state legislators nationwide are women, the most in history. In all of the country's statehouses - 7,386 legislative seats - women gained 43 seats in November's elections. Only four were Democrats, although Democratic women still hold almost twice as many seats overall.\n\nBut the gains of Republican women weren't mirrored in the Southeast. The losses weren't huge, 1 to 3 Republican women per legislature. But with small numbers to begin with, losing just one can make a big difference.\n\n\"It has a much more significant effect on the potential for particular voices and lived experiences to be raised in debate and conversation,\" said Kelly Dittmar, a political science professor and director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, a key group tracking women's political participation.\n\nDittmar didn't see this trend in other regions. \"There's not one story,\" she said, \"but rather a lot of unique state-based stories.\"\n\nAs of the counts the center had finished in mid-December, South Dakota and New Hampshire elected far more new women. Wisconsin lost 6 Republican women and added 11 Democratic women. Connecticut lost 5 Republican women while Democrats held steady. Maine lost 5 Democrats but gained 4 Republicans. In California, women from both parties gained seats.\n\n\"We saw a lot of gains around the country for women in legislatures, but the Southeast continues to be a real struggle,\" said Sabrina Shulman, chief political officer at Vote Run Lead, which trains women to run for office. Entrenched gender roles still influence voting decisions, she said, and more tradition-minded Republicans - men and women - tend to see men as stronger, more qualified and able to lead.\n\nDittmar added that President Donald Trump's campaign emphasized masculinity, which had a trickle-down effect. Republican voters seemed to prefer candidates, including female ones, who were perceived as more masculine or at least not \"anti-male,\" she said.\n\nSome Republican women who might have considered running also balked at campaigning in the hypermasculine politics of the moment. The Center for American Women and Politics found the number of female candidates for state legislative seats was down across the board - but the largest drop was among Republican women.\n\nUnlike Democrats, Republicans \"have largely rejected any attempts at targeted support, recruitment, training and funding of women candidates,\" Dittmar said. \"Conservatives are still dominantly white and male. The party is made up of people who don't think it's a problem\" that so few lawmakers are women.\n\nAll three Republican incumbent women in South Carolina's Senate lost their races after they joined with the two other women - one Democrat and one Independent - in the chamber to fight a strict abortion ban. National headlines spotlighted the bipartisan group dubbed the Sister Senators .\n\nSen. Katrina Shealy was the most senior of the three and the Senate's only female chair of a standing committee. When she won her first Senate election in 2012, she arrived in Columbia, the state capital, to an all-male Senate. More than a decade later, she leaves it as such again.\n\nYet, when she was first elected, female leaders had ascended across state politics. Then-Gov. Nikki Haley was a key ally . The state Supreme Court's chief justice was a woman. Now, the governor is, once again, a man. So is the Senate president. And the House speaker. And the chief justice. The state Supreme Court had no men when it upheld the current abortion law in 2023; it recently added a single female justice.\n\n\"I think if men could take the right to vote away from women, they would,\" Shealy said. \"Just look at South Carolina and what we've done. We don't want women to have a say in anything. That's obvious.\"\n\nRead More\n\nAt the South Carolina Statehouse, Shealy was widely known as the top legislative champion for children . She blames her loss in the primary on the paltry runoff turnout - but also the fact that Republican women in her home state still often adhere to traditional gender roles.\n\n\"Women in the Republican Party always put themselves in the position that we need to support our men,\" Shealy said. \"They let themselves be subservient to men, especially in the South.\"\n\nShe wonders how much they realize that men are now exclusively making decisions about issues that specifically affect women, notably reproductive healthcare. South Carolina currently has a six-week abortion ban, but a conservative flank of House members have prefiled a bill that would ban abortions from conception, or basically what Shealy and the other female senators opposed. The bill is sponsored by three women - and 29 men. If it moves to the Senate, not a single Republican debating the restrictions - or voting on them - will be a woman.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI often write about racial inequities across the South but am interested in a broad range of systemic harm.\n\nI am especially interested in Hurricane Helene and issues related to preparedness and rebuilding.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Trump's Near Sweep of Texas Border Counties Shows a Shift to the Right for Latino Voters\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis article is co-published with The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan local newsroom that informs and engages with Texans. Sign up for The Brief Weekly to get up to speed on their essential coverage of Texas issues.\n\nTexas Democrats have long viewed the state's growing Latino population as their ticket to eventually breaking through the Republican Party's dominance. Tuesday night, however, showed that the GOP has made significant gains in peeling away those voters, and nowhere was that more apparent than along the border.\n\nAfter years of losing the statewide Latino vote by double digits, Republicans set a high-water mark with Donald Trump capturing 55% of the critical voting bloc, besting Vice President Kamala Harris' 44% share, according to exit polls .\n\nIn the traditionally Democratic strongholds along the border, Trump managed a near sweep.\n\nHe won 14 out of the 18 counties within 20 miles of the border, a number that doubled his attention-grabbing 2020 performance in the Latino-majority region. He carried all four counties in the Rio Grande Valley just eight years after drawing a mere 29% in the region - a feat that included delivering 97% Latino Starr County to Republicans for the first time since 1896 . And, though he lost El Paso, one of the border's most populous counties, he narrowed margins there in ways not seen in decades.\n\nCounties Along the Border Continue to Flip\n\nTrump was the top vote-getter in a majority of the counties along the Texas-Mexico border in 2024. This continues the trend of border counties voting more conservatively in presidential races. Shown is how many counties have voted for each party's candidate in each race since 1996.\n\n2000\n\n1996\n\nDEM.\n\n12\n\nREP.\n\n6\n\nDEM.\n\n16\n\nREP.\n\n2\n\n2008\n\n2004\n\nDEM.\n\n14\n\nREP.\n\n4\n\nDEM.\n\n10\n\nREP.\n\n8\n\n2016\n\n2012\n\nDEM.\n\n13\n\nREP.\n\n5\n\nDEM.\n\n13\n\nREP.\n\n5\n\n2020\n\n2024\n\nDEM.\n\n11\n\nREP.\n\n7\n\nDEM.\n\n4\n\nREP.\n\n14\n\nHis gains along the border were the most for a Republican presidential candidate in at least 30 years, exceeding even the inroads made by native Texan George W. Bush in 2004.\n\nTrump's success in appealing to heavily Latino communities was evident throughout the country as he became the first Republican presidential candidate to win Miami-Dade County in more than three decades and nearly doubled his share of the Latino vote in Pennsylvania , even after a comedian at one of his rallies called Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage.\" But Trump's performance is particularly striking in Texas, where Democrats have all but tied their fate to the idea that, as long as the state's Latino electorate continued to grow and stayed reliably blue, Republicans would one day cease to win statewide elections.\n\nIn addition to dominating the presidential race, Republicans saw other gains along the border. U.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz , a Republican from Edinburg, held onto a key GOP seat anchored in the Rio Grande Valley, and Republicans picked up a state Senate seat and two state House districts in South Texas that were previously held by Democrats. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz , who won reelection by carrying a majority of Latino voters, said the results amounted to \"generational change.\"\n\nDemocrats saw their own bright spots. Eddie Morales Jr. , a state representative for a sprawling border district that stretches from Eagle Pass to El Paso, held onto his seat on Tuesday, though he narrowly eked out a victory two years after winning by a more comfortable 12-point margin. U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar , a Democrat from Laredo, also won by an unexpectedly narrow margin of about 5 percentage points against a GOP challenger whom he vastly outspent.\n\nJoshua Blank, research director for the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, said it's too early to tell if Republican gains will hold or extend beyond Trump himself. But, Blank said, Democrats would be wise to worry about the possibility that this shift endures.\n\nTrump's success among Latino voters seemed to stem from an understanding that, in places like Texas, many Latinos \"think of themselves as multiracial\" and have grown up in communities where race and ethnicity are not top of mind, Blank said. Trump targeted Hispanic men who rarely vote by appealing \"to their pocketbooks, to their masculinity, to their place in culture and society, but not directly to an identity as a racial and ethnic minority.\"\n\n\"Does that mean that these voters are going to stay in the Republican column? We don't know. Does it mean that they're going to support somebody who's not named Donald Trump? Unclear,\" Blank said. \"But he has changed the terms of the debate in a way that I think Democrats are uncomfortable with.\"\n\nBorder Counties Making Rightward Shift Toward Trump\n\nNine counties within 20 miles of the Texas-Mexico border flipped from supporting Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 to Republican Donald Trump in 2024.\n\nNot unlike his appeal among other constituencies, Trump won over Latino voters by hammering Harris on economic challenges that many of them - rightly and wrongly - blame on President Joe Biden.\n\nUniversity of Houston political science professor Jeronimo Cortina said Trump's challenge now would be to deliver on his promises to improve voters' economic fortunes. And he said he'd expect voters to hold Trump accountable if he doesn't. Cortina noted that many Latinos supported Bush's 2004 reelection, only to desert the Republican Party in favor of Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 amid a flailing economy.\n\n\"Realignments occur when there's a sustainable change, and right now, it's not clear we have that,\" Cortina said.\n\nHe also said it would be premature to say whether Trump's appeal - to say nothing of the Republican Party's - was anything other than fleeting because, in local races, Latinos still tended to prefer Democrats.\n\nOne such example is the race for sheriff in Val Verde County, nearly three hours west of San Antonio.\n\nIn that race, Democrat Joe Frank Martinez held onto his seat, beating his Republican challenger after receiving 57% of the vote, even as Trump won the county with 63% of the vote.\n\nAccording to Martinez, Project Red TX, a GOP-backed PAC, initially tried to get him to switch parties. When he declined, the PAC backed his opponent, who ran a campaign centered around the issue of immigration, even though that is not part of the sheriff's job.\n\nThis year, the group supported more than 50 local candidates, primarily in border counties. The three candidates it backed in Val Verde County lost, though Wayne Hamilton, a veteran GOP operative who heads the group, noted that he also supported a number of local candidates who won their races with Trump carrying the county atop the ballot. One such case was in Jim Wells County, where Trump received 57% and the Democratic sheriff was narrowly ousted by a Republican challenger.\n\nHamilton said Latino voters living at or near the border flocked to Trump over what they see as the Biden administration's \"collapse in border enforcement and failing to do their job\" by preventing more migrants from crossing into Texas.\n\nRecord numbers of arrivals overwhelmed border infrastructure in numerous communities. In Val Verde, some 20,000 mostly Haitian migrants arrived almost at once in 2021, forcing officials to shut the international port of entry while they figured out how to respond to the situation.\n\nPublic outcry was most acute, Hamilton said, in counties with high poverty rates where residents were more likely to feel that their community was \"being overrun by people that are even poorer, with even greater needs.\"\n\nHamilton celebrated that Trump flipped Starr by 16 points this year, a 76-point swing from his 60-point deficit there in 2016.\n\nDown the ballot, though, Democrats, including the incumbent sheriff, managed to hold on to their positions despite aggressive campaigns on the Republican side. \"All of those candidates that ran as Democrats, all won, so the Trump presidency is basically an isolated seat,\" Starr County Democratic Chair Jessica Vera said.\n\nStill, she said, if national and statewide Democrats want to keep the county blue, they need to work together with local leaders to connect with voters there.\n\nHamilton said some newly converted Trump voters might feel less inclined to vote against their local Democratic officials, especially in the smaller border counties, because they tend to be known in the community.\n\n\"The further down the ballot you go, it all becomes more personal,\" Hamilton said. \"It's not a guy I see on TV, right? It's the guy I go to Mass with.\"\n\nRead More\n\nLocal Democratic Party officials, including Sylvia Bruni in Webb County, a longtime Democratic stronghold, said they had warned their state and national headquarters about the advances Republicans were making in their districts. But she said she had gotten little support and instead had to rely almost entirely on whatever funds her group could raise on its own.\n\nThat's not going to be good enough in the future, Bruni said. \"We need help.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nPerla Trevizo is a reporter for the ProPublica-Texas Tribune Investigative Initiative.\n\nDan Keemahill is a data reporter for the ProPublica-Texas Tribune Investigative Initiative.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nDrive an hour south of Nashville into the rolling countryside of Marshall County, Tennessee - past horse farms, mobile homes and McMansions - and you will arrive in Chapel Hill, population 1,796. It's the birthplace of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, who helped found the Ku Klux Klan. And it's the home of Todd Warner, one of the most unlikely and important defenders of America's besieged public schools.\n\nWarner is the gregarious 53-year-old owner of PCS of TN, a 30-person company that does site grading for shopping centers and other construction projects. The second-term Republican state representative \"absolutely\" supports Donald Trump, who won Marshall County by 50 points in 2020. Warner likes to talk of the threats posed by culture-war bogeymen, such as critical race theory; diversity, equity and inclusion; and Shariah law.\n\nAnd yet, one May afternoon in his office, under a TV playing Fox News and a mounted buck that he'd bagged in Alabama, he told me about his effort to halt Republican Gov. Bill Lee's push for private school vouchers in Tennessee. Warner's objections are rooted in the reality of his district: It contains not a single private school, so to Warner, taxpayer money for the new vouchers would clearly be flowing elsewhere, mostly to well-off families in metro Nashville, Memphis and other cities whose kids are already enrolled in private schools. Why should his small-town constituents be subsidizing the private education of metropolitan rich kids? \"I'm for less government, but it's government's role to provide a good public education,\" he said. \"If you want to send your kid to private school, then you should pay for it.\"\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic provided a major boost to supporters of school vouchers, who argued that extended public school closures - and the on-screen glimpses they afforded parents of what was being taught to their kids - underscored the need to give parents greater choice in where to send their children. Eleven states, led by Florida and Arizona, now have universal or near-universal vouchers, meaning that even affluent families can receive thousands of dollars toward their kids' private school tuition.\n\nThe beneficiaries in these states are mostly families whose kids were already enrolled in private schools, not families using the vouchers to escape struggling public schools. In larger states, the annual taxpayer tab for the vouchers is close to $1 billion, leaving less money for public schools at a time when they already face the loss of federal pandemic aid.\n\nVoucher advocates, backed by a handful of billionaire funders, are on the march to bring more red and purple states into the fold for \"school choice,\" their preferred terminology for vouchers. And again and again, they are running up against rural Republicans like Warner, who are joining forces with Democratic lawmakers in a rare bipartisan alliance. That is, it's the reddest regions of these red and purple states that are putting up some of the strongest resistance to the conservative assault on public schools.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nThanks for signing up.

Support independent journalism by donating to ProPublica.\n\nConservative orthodoxy at the national level holds that parents must be given an out from a failing public education system that force-feeds children progressive fads. But many rural Republican lawmakers have trouble reconciling this with the reality in their districts, where many public schools are not only the sole educational option, but also the largest employer and the hub of the community - where everyone goes for holiday concerts, Friday night football and basketball. Unlike schools in blue metro areas, rural schools mostly reopened for in-person instruction in the fall of 2020, and they are far less likely to be courting controversy on issues involving race and gender.\n\nDemonizing public education in the abstract is one thing. But it's quite another when the target is the school where you went, where your kids went. For Todd Warner, that was Forrest High School in Chapel Hill. \"My three kids graduated from public schools, and they turned out just fine,\" he said. \"Ninety-five percent of our students, our future business owners, our future leaders, are going to the public schools. They're not going to private. Why take it away from them?\"\n\nThe response from voucher proponents to the resistance from fellow Republicans has taken several forms, all of which implicitly grant the critics' case that voucher programs currently offer little benefit to rural areas. In some states, funding for vouchers is being paired with more money for public schools, to offer support for rural districts. In Ohio, voucher advocates are proposing to fund the construction of new private schools in rural areas where none exist, giving families places to use vouchers.\n\nBut the overriding Republican response to rural skeptics has been a political threat: Get with the program on vouchers, or else.\n\nThat's what played out this year in Ohio's 83rd District, in the state's rural northwest. Last summer, Ohio adopted universal private school vouchers, with middle- and working-class families eligible for up to $8,407 per high school student and even the very wealthiest families eligible for almost $1,000 per child. Private school leaders urged already enrolled families to seek the money, and more than 140,000 families applied for vouchers. The cost has exceeded estimates, approaching $1 billion, with most of it going to the parochial schools that dominate the state's private school landscape. Voucher advocates are now pushing to create educational savings accounts to cover tuition at unchartered private schools that are not eligible for the vouchers.\n\nSchool leaders in Hardin County - with its cornfields, solar panel installations and what was once one of the largest dairy farms east of the Mississippi - are deeply worried that vouchers stand to hurt county residents. Only a single small private school is within reach, one county to the south, which means that virtually no local taxpayers would see any of that voucher money themselves - it would be going to private school families in Columbus, Cincinnati and other large population centers. (And under Ohio law, the very public schools that are losing students must pay to transport any students who attend private institutions within a half-hour drive of the public school.)\n\nCraig Hurley, the superintendent for Hardin's Upper Scioto Valley District, is a solidly built 52-year-old who calls himself a staunch conservative. He attended the district's schools and has worked in them for 30 years. He knows that they provide meals to 400 students, nearly two-thirds of whom qualify for free and reduced lunch. Even though the high school can muster only 20 players for football - basketball fares better - the fans come out to cheer. \"Our district is our community,\" he told me. \"The more you separate that, the less of a community we're going to be.\"\n\nHurley has calculated that local schools are receiving less state funding per student than what private schools now receive for the maximum possible voucher amount. Yet private schools face almost none of the accountability that public schools do regarding how the money is spent and what outcomes it achieves. \"We have fiscal responsibility on all of it, on every dime, every penny we spend,\" he said. \"There's no audit for them.\" Not to mention, he added, \"a private school doesn't have to accept all students, right? They pick who they want.\"\n\nThirteen miles east, Chad Thrush, the school superintendent in Kenton, the county seat, noted that his school system is the second-largest employer in town, after Graphic Packaging, which makes plastic cups for vending machines. He worries that the rising cost of the voucher program will erode state funding for public schools, and he worries about what would happen to his district if a new private school opened in town. Thrush understands the appeal of vouchers for parents who want a leg up for their kid. But, he told me, \"we need to be looking at how we're preparing all students to be successful, not just my student.\"\n\nAs it happens, the two superintendents have a crucial ally in Columbus: their state representative, Jon Cross. Like Warner in Tennessee, Cross is an ardent pro-Trump conservative and deeply opposed to private school vouchers. At a legislative hearing last year, he cut loose at a lobbyist for Americans for Prosperity - the conservative advocacy group founded by the industrialist Koch brothers - who was testifying for vouchers, one of the organization's long-standing causes. \"Wouldn't we be better off taking some money in our budget to fix the schools?\" Cross said. \"I tell you what, I really like my public schools. I'm really proud that Carson and Connor, my sons, go to Kenton City Schools and get an education from there just like I did.\"\n\nCross' resistance to vouchers earned him the animus of the state Senate president, Matt Huffman, an avid voucher proponent. Huffman encouraged a primary challenge of Cross. So greatly did local school officials value Cross' support that shortly before the March 19 primary, they held a public meeting to explain the threat vouchers posed, with Cross in attendance. \"If the economy goes bad, are we going to pull $1 billion out for private schools?\" Thrush said. Or, he continued, would the public schools be left with less money?\n\nThe schools in Hardin and Marshall counties are majority white. But some rural Republican legislators in other states have been willing to buck their party leaders on vouchers even in more racially diverse districts. In Georgia, of the 15 Republican state representatives who blocked a voucher proposal last year, more than half came from rural areas with substantial Black populations. One of them was Gerald Greene, who spent more than three decades as a high school social studies teacher and has managed to survive as a Republican in his majority-Black district in the state's southwestern corner after switching parties in 2010.\n\nGreene believes vouchers will harm his district. It has a couple of small private schools in it or just outside it - with student bodies that are starkly more white than the district's public schools - but the majority of his constituents rely on the public schools, and he worries that vouchers will leave less money for them. \"I just felt like we were abandoning our public schools,\" he told me. \"I'm not against private schools at all, but I just did not see how these vouchers would help southwestern Georgia.\"\n\nAfter failing to pass a voucher program last year, the state's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, and proponents in the legislature tried again this year, and this time they succeeded, albeit with vouchers more constrained than elsewhere: They can be used only by students in school districts that are ranked in the bottom quartile and whose families make less than 400% of the poverty level ($120,000 for a family of four), and their total cost can't exceed 1% of the state's total education budget, which caps them now at $140 million.\n\nPartisan pressures simply became too strong for some skeptical Republicans, including Greene's counterpart in the Senate, Sam Watson. Seminole County Superintendent Mark Earnest told me about the conversation in which Watson let him know that he was going to have to support the limited vouchers. \"They have turned this into a caucus priority. It's getting very political,\" Watson said. \"Thanks for letting me know,\" Earnest replied, \"but all vouchers are bad for public education.\" Watson's response: \"I know, but I couldn't go with the Democrats. Sorry.\" (Watson did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe highest-profile rural Republican resistance to vouchers has come in Texas, the land of Friday Night Lights and far-flung oil country settlements where the public schools anchor communities. Late last year, the Texas House voted 84-63 to strip vouchers out of a broad education bill. In response, Gov. Greg Abbott launched a purge of anti-voucher Republicans in this year's primaries, backed by millions of dollars from the Pennsylvania megadonor Jeff Yass, a finance billionaire.\n\nAmong those targeted was Drew Darby, who represents a sprawling 10-county district in West Texas and who frames the issue in starkly regional terms: The state's metro areas depend on his constituents to provide \"food, fiber and hide,\" to \"tend the oil wells and wind turbines to provide electricity to people who want to be just a little cooler in the cities.\" But without good public schools, these rural areas will wither. \"Robert Lee, Winters, Sterling, Blackwell,\" he said, listing some hamlets - \"these communities exist because they have strong public schools. They would literally not exist without a good public school system.\"\n\nDarby, a fiscal conservative, is also opposed to a new entitlement for private school families that is projected to soon cost $2 billion a year. \"In rural Texas, there's not a whole lot of private school options, and we want our schools to get every dollar they can. This doesn't add $1, and it's not good for rural Texas.\"\n\nDarby managed to stave off his primary challenge, but 11 of the 15 voucher resisters targeted by Abbott lost, several in races so close that they went to a runoff. Abbott is unapologetic: \"Congratulations to all of tonight's winners,\" he said after the runoff. \"Together, we will ensure the best future for our children.\" Also succumbing to his primary challenger was Jon Cross, in western Ohio. His opponent, Ty Mathews, managed to make the campaign about more than just vouchers, taking sides in a bitter leadership split within the GOP caucus.\n\nAnd for all the concerns that local school leaders have about the effect of vouchers, the threat remained abstract to many voters. \"I'm not worried about it, because we don't have the revenue here anyways in this town for anything to be taken from us to be given to a bigger town,\" one 60-year-old woman told me after casting her vote for Mathews. A younger woman asked simply: \"What exactly are the vouchers?\"\n\nBut in Tennessee, Todd Warner and his allies staved off the threat again this year. To overcome rural resistance, voucher proponents in the Tennessee House felt the need to constrain them and pair them with hundreds of millions of dollars in additional funding for public schools, but this was at odds with the state Senate's more straightforward voucher legislation. The two chambers were unable to come to an agreement before the session's end in April, by which point the House bill had not even made it to the floor for a vote.\n\nFor Democratic voucher opponents in the state, the alliance with Warner and other rural Republicans was as helpful as it was unusual. \"It was strange,\" Rep. Sam McKenzie, a Black Democrat from Knoxville, told me. McKenzie compared it to \"Twins,\" a movie in which Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito played unlikely fraternal twins: \"Representative Warner and I were in lockstep opposition to this voucher scam.\"\n\nOne voucher supporter, Rep. Scott Cepicky, told me he was confident that his side would eventually prevail. \"We'll work on this again next year,\" he said. \"The governor is committed that we're going to run on school choice again.\" And Americans for Prosperity has made clear that it's coming after voucher opponents. Its Tennessee state director, Tori Venable, told Warner during the legislative session that \"I can't protect you if you ain't on the right side of this.\"\n\nRead More\n\nAnother conservative group, the American Federation for Children, sent out a text message in March attacking Warner for his opposition to \"parental rights,\" without using the term vouchers. And a retired teacher in Marshall County, Gwen Warren, told me she and her husband recently got a visit from an Americans for Prosperity canvasser citing Warner's opposition to vouchers. \"She said: 'We're going around the neighborhood trying to talk to people about vouchers. We feel like Tennesseans really want the voucher system.'\" To which, Warren said, her husband replied: \"You're very much mistaken, lady. We don't want vouchers in this county, and you need to go away.\"\n\nWarner remains unfazed by all this. He is pretty sure that his voucher opposition in fact helped him win his seat in 2020, after the incumbent Republican voted for a pilot voucher system limited to Nashville and Memphis. And he notes that no one has registered to challenge him in the state's Aug. 1 primary. \"They tried to find a primary opponent but couldn't,\" he said with a chuckle. \"I was born and raised here all my life. My family's been here since the 18th century. I won't say I can't be beat, but bring your big-boy pants and come on, let's go.\"\n\nHelp ProPublica Report on Education\n\nProPublica is building a network of educators, students, parents and other experts to help guide our reporting about education.

      "text": "Trump Just Endorsed an Oath Keeper's Plan to Seize Control of the Republican Party\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has officially endorsed a plan, created by a man who has self-identified with the Oath Keeper militia, that aims to have Trump supporters consolidate control of the Republican Party.\n\nThe plan, known as the \"precinct strategy,\" has been repeatedly promoted on Steve Bannon's popular podcast. As ProPublica detailed last year, it has already inspired thousands of people to fill positions at the lowest rung of the party ladder. Though these positions are low-profile and often vacant, they hold critical powers: They help elect higher-ranking party officers, influence which candidates appear on the ballot, turn out voters on Election Day and even staff the polling precincts where people vote and the election boards that certify the results.\n\n\"Just heard about an incredible effort underway that will strengthen the Republican Party,\" Trump said Sunday in a statement emailed to his supporters. \"If members of our Great movement start getting involved (that means YOU becoming a precinct committeeman for your voting precinct), we can take back our great Country from the ground up.\"\n\nTrump's email named Dan Schultz, an Arizona lawyer and local party official who first developed the precinct strategy more than a decade ago. Schultz spent years trying to promote his plan and recruit precinct officers. In 2014, he posted a callout to an internal forum for the Oath Keepers militia group, according to hacked records obtained by ProPublica.\n\n\"Why don't you all join me and the other Oath Keepers who are 'inside' the Party already,\" Schultz wrote under a screen name. \"If we conservatives were to do that, we'd OWN the Party.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors in January charged the leader of the Oath Keepers and 10 of its other members with seditious conspiracy in last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol. One of them pleaded guilty, as have several members of the group in related cases who are cooperating with the investigation. The group's leader, Stewart Rhodes, pleaded not guilty.\n\nThere is no indication that Schultz had any involvement in the Capitol riot.\n\nSchultz told ProPublica he never became a formal member of the Oath Keepers organization. \"I have taken oaths to support and defend the Constitution as a West Point cadet, as a commissioned U.S. Army officer and as a practicing attorney,\" Schultz said in a text message. \"Those oaths do not have expiration dates, by my way of thinking, and I have kept my oaths. In that sense, I am an 'oath keeper.'\"\n\nAccording to experts on extremist groups, the Oath Keepers recruit military and law enforcement veterans using the idea that their oath to defend the Constitution never expired. The group then urges people to resist what they say are impending orders to take away Americans' guns or create concentration camps.\n\n\"I don't ever want to be pulling the trigger on an AR-15 in my neighborhood,\" Schultz said in a 2015 conference call with fellow organizers, referring to the semi-automatic rifle. \"Oath Keepers, I love them for instilling the oath. But what they need to do also, I think, is spread the message that hey, we can do stuff politically so we never get to the cartridge box.\"\n\nIn more recent interviews on right-wing podcasts and internet talk shows, Schultz has repeatedly described his precinct strategy as a last alternative to violence.\n\n\"It's not going to be peaceful the next go-round, perhaps,\" Schultz said in a June interview with the pro-Trump personality David Clements. \"But it ought to be, and the way to ensure that it will be is we've got to get enough of these good decent Americans to take over one of the two major political parties.\"\n\nIt was not clear whether Trump or his aides were aware that Schultz has self-identified with the Oath Keepers. Trump's spokesperson, Liz Harrington, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSchultz has spent months trying to get his idea in front of Trump. Steve Stern, a fellow movement organizer, told ProPublica that he met a former Trump administration official for lunch at Mar-a-Lago, the ex-president's private club in Palm Beach, in December. While there, Stern said, he got a chance to briefly mention the project to Trump.\n\nThen, last month, Schultz and Stern landed an interview on a talk show hosted by Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO who promotes conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Lindell said he would discuss the plan with Trump personally. Schultz and Stern followed up with a conference call with Harrington and Bannon, according to Stern. Harrington previously worked at Bannon's \"War Room\" website.\n\n\"I know the president's very jacked up about it,\" Bannon said on his podcast, speaking with Schultz after Trump released the endorsement. \"Help MAGA, help the America First movement, right? Help the deplorables, help President Trump, help yourself, your country, community, your kids, grandkids, all of it. Put your shoulder to the wheel.\"\n\nBannon, who led Trump's 2016 campaign, originally lifted the precinct strategy to prominence in a podcast interview with Schultz last year. After the episode aired, thousands of people answered Bannon's call to become precinct officers in pivotal swing states, according to data compiled by ProPublica from county records and interviews with local party officials.\n\nAs of last August, GOP leaders in 41 counties reported an unusual increase in sign-ups since Bannon's first interview with Schultz, adding a total of more than 8,500 new precinct officers. The trend appears to have continued since then. New precinct officers started using their powers to remove or censure Republican leaders who contradicted Trump's election lies and to recruit people who believe the election was stolen into positions as poll watchers and poll workers.\n\nRead More\n\nBannon received a last-minute pardon from Trump after the former adviser was charged with financial fraud. He has pleaded not guilty to contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack. Bannon's spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn addition to Bannon and Lindell, the precinct strategy has won support from pro-Trump figures such as former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who urged Trump to impose martial law, and lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, who led some of the lawsuits seeking to overturn the election results. Right-wing groups such as Turning Point Action, which organized buses to transport rallygoers on Jan. 6, also joined the effort to recruit precinct officers.\n\nWhile Stern said he's thrilled about Trump's written statement endorsing the precinct strategy, he said he hopes to hear it from Trump's own lips at an upcoming rally.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nLast week, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , the reliably provocative Georgia Republican, declared on Steve Bannon's podcast, \"War Room,\" that if her party wins back a House majority next week, as is quite likely, it will seek revenge on the corporations that curtailed contributions to the 147 congressional Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 election results. \"That's not going to be forgotten by a whole bunch of my Republican colleagues,\" she said.\n\nIt is not clear exactly what form such punishment would take. But there's another complicating factor in this revenge scenario: Many of the corporations that announced with great fanfare their cutoff in contributions after the certification vote and storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, have since resumed giving to some of those 147 Republicans. In other words, if Greene leads a quest for revenge on those companies, she'll be taking aim at the very corporations that have funded many of her allies.\n\nSee The Numbers\n\nFor some of the companies, the resumption of giving to the 147 Republicans (139 in the House, eight in the Senate) started only a few months after they vowed to stop. But ProPublica has now created a tool to track and assess this remarkable shift: an app that has collected all of the campaign contributions that Fortune 500 corporations made to the 147 over the past two years. All told, at least 228 of the Fortune 500 - representing more than two-thirds of the 300-odd companies that have political action committees - have given to the 147, for a total of more than $13 million. (This does not include millions in contributions made to Republican campaign committees for the House and Senate, much of which is making its way to those who voted against certifying the election results.)\n\nThat $13 million sum is a stark testament to business as usual in Washington. These members - more than half of the Republicans in Congress - decided to side with the baseless claim to victory by then-President Donald Trump, thereby exacerbating an unprecedented transition-of-power crisis that threatened to upend the political order. And yet those members have managed to resume receiving substantial contributions from the companies that depend on the stability of that political order, including companies that garnered public relations points after the Jan. 6 riots by saying they were cutting the 147 off.\n\nTake, for instance, General Electric, which issued a particularly strong clarion call in announcing a new post-Jan. 6 policy for its GE Employee Political Action Committee. \"The GEPAC board has voted to suspend donations to those who voted to oppose the Electoral College results,\" said Meghan Thurlow, GE's global director of public affairs. \"This is not a decision we made lightly, but is one we believe is important to ensure that our future contributions continue to reflect our company's values and commitment to democracy.\"\n\nLess than two years later, GE has made contributions to 11 of the Republicans who voted against certifying the results . The company's explanation of the shift? \"The GEPAC board's broad suspension of donations to those who voted to oppose the Electoral College results remains in place,\" said a company spokesperson. \"However, like many other PACs, it will consider individual exceptions on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\nAmong the lucky beneficiaries of those exceptions: Rep. Ken Calvert of California , who said after the 2020 election that Trump \"has the right to ensure vote counts are complete, accurate and legal\"; Rep. Sam Graves of Missouri , who tweeted , \"I stand with President Trump. Every legal vote must be counted in complete transparency\"; and Rep. Ron Estes of Kansas , who decried the FBI search for classified records in Trump's Mar-a-Lago home as an outrage that \"undermines the credibility of the FBI.\" All voted against certifying the election. All are also on committees of importance to GE: Calvert is on the appropriations subcommittees for defense and energy spending, Graves is the top Republican on the committee overseeing transportation and infrastructure, and Estes is on the ways and means subcommittee overseeing taxation.\n\nAlso among the companies jumping on the bandwagon was Home Depot. \"We are pausing to take time to carefully review and reevaluate each of the members who voted to object to the election results before considering further contributions to them,\" said Sara Gorman, the company's senior director of corporate communications, on Jan. 27, 2021.\n\nThat pause, it turned out, lasted only a year, less than many home appliance warranties. Home Depot has given a total of $475,000 to 65 of the 147 , making it the top donor to 2020 election deniers. Asked about this, Gorman said, \"Our associate-funded PAC is bipartisan. It supports candidates and organizations on both sides of the aisle who champion pro-business, pro-retail positions that create jobs and economic growth.\" No more mention of the 2020 election or the denial of such.\n\nStanding in contrast are big companies that have not given to any of the 147 through their corporate PACs during this election cycle, which include tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft and Wall Street powerhouses like JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock.\n\nBut then there is Boeing, which in the idealistic days of early 2021 announced, through then-spokesperson Bradley Akubuiro, \"Boeing strongly condemns the violence, lawlessness and destruction that took place in the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Given the current environment, we are not making political contributions at this time. We will continue to carefully evaluate future contributions to ensure that we support those who not only support our company, but also uphold our country's most fundamental principles.\"\n\nAmong those now apparently upholding the country's most fundamental principles, in Boeing's estimations, are 74 of the Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 election results, who have received more than $390,000 . Asked about the contributions, company spokesperson Connor Greenwood said, \"We do not have anything to add to the story.\"\n\nJoining Boeing in announcing a hiatus in political giving in early 2021 were its competitors in the defense contracting realm: Northrop Grumman, which was \"evaluating the way forward\"; Lockheed Martin, which was updating its strategy to \"reflect our core values\"; and Raytheon, which needed to \"reflect on the current environment.\" All that evaluating and reflecting seems to have gotten old fast: Northrop has given $175,000 to 26 of the 147; Lockheed donated more than $366,000 to 90 of them; and Raytheon has given $309,000 to 66. None of the three companies responded to questions.\n\nOne other defense contractor did respond: General Dynamics, which has given more than $324,000 to 67 of the 147 Republicans. In response to questions about the contributions, spokesperson Jeff Davis noted that the company's recent investor report stated: \"Our employee PAC will not support members of Congress who provoke or incite violence or similar unlawful conduct.\"\n\nAsked to elaborate on how the company determined whether a member had provoked or incited violence, Davis said, \"Sorry, I'm not able to help beyond what is already written there.\"\n\nAmerican Airlines, meanwhile, had put an explicit three-month duration on its own pause in political giving after Jan. 6, but had said that when it resumed making contributions, it would make sure to focus its support on lawmakers who \"support U.S. aviation, airline workers and our values, including bringing people together.\" Those whom it deems to have \"brought people together\" now include 42 of the 147 Republicans, for a total of more than $128,000 . The company had no comment.\n\nRegions Financial, the bank holding company, also had strong feelings about national togetherness as it announced a halt to political giving in January 2021. \"This is a time for us, as a nation, to come together and identify a united path forward,\" said media and public relations manager Jeremy King in that halcyon moment.\n\nThat united path forward led Regions to give to 74 of the 147 Republicans, for a total of more than $258,000 . The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nProPublica also reached out to more than a half dozen other companies that were either among the top 15 donors overall to the 147 or among the top 10 donors on the list of companies that had announced a halt to contributions after Jan. 6: AT&T , Comcast , Honeywell , L3Harris , Marathon Petroleum , Williams and UPS .\n\nNone responded to requests for comment, with the exception of L3Harris, where spokesperson Paul Swiergosz wrote back, \"We will politely decline comment regarding this story.\"\n\nPoliteness is certainly appreciated in this uncivil age. So are \"commitment to democracy,\" \"a united path forward,\" and concern for \"our country's fundamental principles,\" especially if they endure for more than a news cycle or two.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI have been reporting for ProPublica since 2015, most recently covering the post-pandemic schools crisis.\n\nSergio Hernández is a reporter and developer on ProPublica's news apps team.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Scenes From a MAGA Meltdown: Inside the \"America First\" Movement's War Over Democracy\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nStanding in a cafe decorated with tiny American flags and antique cabinets as big as bodyguards, Peter Meijer paused as he considered what to say to the man in the \"Stand for God\" shirt who had just called for his bodily harm.\n\nIt was a snowy morning in February. Meijer was the keynote speaker at a coffee-and-donuts meeting hosted by the Republican Party chapter in Kent County, Michigan, the most populous county on the west side of the state. Dressed in a candidate-casual uniform of jeans, a flannel shirt and an outdoorsy blazer, Meijer was seeking the Republican nomination for an open U.S. Senate seat, a race that could determine control of Congress's upper chamber, in a state that could decide the presidential election. If Republicans wanted to win in November, Meijer told the 40-odd people in attendance, they needed to move on from the past and focus on their shared enemy.\n\n\"Is there anyone who thought that Jan. 6th was good for the Republican Party?\" he asked. \"Did it help us win in 2022?\"\n\n\"We weren't gonna win,\" someone yelled. \"It was rigged.\"\n\n\"The election was stolen,\" another person said. \"It doesn't matter.\"\n\nI watched this exchange from a table near the back of the room. Until that moment, the crowd met Meijer's stump speech with polite nods and gentle applause. But when he brought up elections and Jan. 6th, the mood turned from Midwest nice to hostile.\n\nNot long ago, this setting was friendly terrain for Meijer. For decades, voters here rewarded sensible, pro-business, avowedly conservative politicians. Meijer fit the archetype of a West Michigan Republican when he first ran for Congress in 2020. He was also basically Michigan royalty as an heir to the Meijer grocery store fortune. In one of the state's most competitive districts, he won his debut congressional race by a comfortable 6-point margin.\n\nAt the Kent County event, however, many attendees seemed to feel nothing but scorn for him. That anger flowed from a single decision Meijer had made in Congress: He voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump. In response, he faced a far-right primary challenger who had served in the Trump administration and said Biden's 2020 victory was \"simply mathematically impossible.\" Meijer narrowly lost. Now, as a Senate candidate, he was trying to make amends, even pledging to vote for Trump - whom he had once called \"unfit for office\" - if the former president won the Republican nomination. But to some, he was still a traitor.\n\n\"How did you vote to impeach Trump when he said in his [Jan. 6] speech, 'I want a peaceful demonstration,'\" a man angrily asked. \"You don't have to go any further than that to know that he was right and that he shouldn't have been impeached.\"\n\n\"I was there,\" another man called out. \"We were peaceful.\"\n\n\"No shouting now,\" the emcee said.\n\nOne audience member accused Meijer of taking a bribe in exchange for his impeachment vote.\n\nAnother challenged him to name five \"political prisoners from Jan. 6\" who were \"sitting in prison and falsely accused.\" I watched Meijer struggle to complete a sentence before being cut off.\n\nA third person pointed a finger at him as he questioned whether Meijer was actually in the Capitol complex on Jan. 6, 2021, as he'd claimed.\n\n\"I have a photo I took in the House,\" Meijer said, trying to defend himself without sounding defensive. Mostly, he listened wide-eyed, sipping coffee from a Styrofoam cup.\n\nAn older woman asked, in a gentler tone, if Meijer would redo his impeachment vote if he could. Would he at least have abstained instead of voting \"yes\"?\n\nMeijer responded by saying that when he was in Congress, someone had once joked that they'd throw him off a bridge if he ever voted \"present.\"\n\nA deep voice rang out on the far side of the room. The man in the \"Stand for God\" shirt.\n\n\"Sorry?\" Meijer said, not hearing him.\n\nThe man repeated himself: \"You should've gotten thrown off the bridge.\"\n\nWhat divides the Republican Party of 2024 is not any one policy or ideology. It is not whether to support Donald Trump. The most important fault line in the party now is democracy itself. Today's Republican insurgents believe democracy has been stolen, and they don't trust the ability of democratic processes to restore it.\n\nThis phenomenon is evident across the country, in Georgia and Nevada, in Arizona, Idaho and Florida. But it's perhaps the starkest in Michigan, a place long associated with political pragmatism and a business-friendly GOP, embodied by governors George Romney, John Engler and, most recently, Rick Snyder. It was a son of Michigan, former President Gerald Ford, who once said, \"I have never mistaken moderation for weakness, nor civility for surrender.\"\n\nI grew up in Michigan. My own political education and my early years as a journalist coincided with a stunning Republican resurgence in my home state. Over several decades, Michigan's dynastic families - the DeVoses and Meijers and Van Andels on the west side, the Romneys and Fords on the east - poured money and manpower into the Michigan Republican Party, building it into one of the most vaunted political operations in the country. They transformed Michigan from a bastion of organized labor that leaned Democratic into a toss-up state that, until recently, had a right-to-work law and put Republicans in control of all three branches of government for eight of the last 14 years. Michigan Republicans were so successful that other states copied their tactics. As Dick DeVos, heir to the Amway fortune and a prolific Republican donor, once told a gathering of conservative activists, \"If we can do it in Michigan, you can do it anywhere.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nThanks for signing up.

Support independent journalism by donating to ProPublica.\n\nSeveral years ago, however, my home state stopped making sense to me. I watched as thousands of political newcomers, whose sole qualification appeared to be fervor of belief, declared war on the Republican establishment that had been so dominant. Calling themselves the \"America First\" movement, these unknowns treated the DeVoses and other party leaders as the enemy. I had covered the DeVoses and the Michigan Republican Party long enough to know that they were not just pro-business but staunch conservatives who wanted to slash taxes, abolish regulations and remake the public education system in favor of vouchers and parochial schools. Yet the new \"America First\" activists disparaged prominent Michigan Republicans as \"globalist\" elites who belonged to a corrupt \"uniparty\" cabal. That cabal had denied Trump a rightful second term and needed to be purged from the party.\n\nWith a consequential election looming, I traveled back to Michigan earlier this year to understand how this all happened. I sought out the activists waging this struggle, a group of people who don't trust institutions or individuals except Trump and one another - and sometimes not even that. Could they triumph over the elites? I found chaos, incompetence, strife, a glimpse of a future post-Trump Republican Party and, all around me, danger for our system of government and the state of the country.\n\n\"We can't keep going through election after election like this where a large plurality of the country just does not accept the outcome of the majority and refuses to abide by it,\" said Jeff Timmer, a former executive director of the Michigan Republican Party who now works with the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. \"That's when the system falls apart.\"\n\nAfter Peter Meijer's event in Kent County, I drove west toward Lake Michigan to meet a plumber named Ken Beyer for lunch. Barrel-chested and with a neatly trimmed goatee, Beyer is in his late 50s but looks younger. He's disarmingly earnest, the kind of guy who'd offer to help you fix a flat tire in a snowstorm. In less than two years, Beyer had risen from a political nobody to a district chair in the state GOP and a leader of the \"America First\" movement in Michigan. He is known for his fiery videos, in which he might equate a rival to Adolf Hitler or warn that \"the storm is upon us.\" Like many of his \"America First\" allies, he questions whether democracy still exists in this country. \"I don't know if any election is fair anymore,\" he said.\n\nOver chicken tenders and iced tea, Beyer, a church-going Christian, told me about a series of what he saw as divine revelations that had delivered him to this point. The pandemic and 2020 election had shaken him. He no longer recognized his own country. He feared that the moment had come, he said, \"where freedom and the American dream end.\"\n\nHis next revelation happened on Jan. 6, 2021. Because he was convinced that Democrats stole the White House from Trump, he had gone to Washington to make his voice heard and show support for the president. Standing on the steps of the Capitol, he encountered a reporter with the conservative outlet Newsmax who needed help carrying gear. Beyer grabbed a tripod and backpack and filled in as a makeshift field producer for one of the biggest events of the 21st century. \"What God wanted me to do,\" he later said, \"was help capture the history of what's happening and get the truth out of what really was going on there.\"\n\nBack in Michigan, Beyer enlisted the help of a young videographer who had produced content for Beyer's plumbing business, and together they churned out videos about COVID-19 (overblown), election fraud (rampant) and the \"truth\" of Jan. 6 (\"a big prayer meeting\"). He read about disturbing allegations about voting-machine software changing votes. He listened to poll workers allege that mysterious suitcases of mail-in ballots had arrived overnight at the state's largest ballot-processing site in downtown Detroit (a claim that was later debunked). The more he heard, the more he came to believe that his home state had been central to the Democrats' plan to steal the 2020 election.\n\nIn his free time, Beyer urged Republican lawmakers to investigate the allegations of fraud made by Trump and his allies. Most Republicans brushed him off. A few, like Peter Meijer, had openly turned on Trump, voting for impeachment or dismissing Trump's stolen-election theories. Beyer couldn't understand it. \"Why weren't they fighting for him?\" he said.\n\nAccording to more experienced people in the party, there was a simple answer: Many of the claims brought forward weren't true. A long-awaited investigation by a Republican-led state Senate committee found \"no evidence of widespread or systematic fraud\" in Michigan.\n\nIf Republicans wouldn't act, Beyer reasoned, then they were just as bad as the Democrats. Trump supporters in other states had also encountered Republican indifference in response to Trump's fraud allegations. What were they supposed to do now?\n\nA solution arrived in the form of the \"precinct strategy.\" It was a plan promoted by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon to ensure that the political establishment in both parties didn't \"steal\" future elections. Precincts are the smallest geographical unit in American elections. In Michigan, there are roughly 4,700 precincts typically made up of a few thousand active registered voters. Each precinct elects at least one delegate as its representative to a county convention, and sometimes three or four. In all, there are upwards of 8,000 delegate positions in Michigan.\n\nIf a state political party is a pyramid with a chairperson at the top, precinct delegates occupy the lowest, broadest tier. Until recently, it was an obscure position. Thousands of the seats often sit empty. If enough Trump supporters filled them, Bannon said, they could form a majority within the party, elect allies to leadership positions and, eventually, take control.\n\nKen Beyer had never heard of a precinct delegate until he stumbled across the website for MI Precinct First, a group inspired by Bannon's plan. He decided to run. He believed that this, too, must be part of God's plan for him. \"I believe that He's using people like me throughout the United States to become the re-founding fathers,\" he told me.\n\nThe precinct strategy proved successful. In Michigan, thousands of new activists, many recruited by \"America First\" groups, became precinct delegates in 2022. In Ottawa County, a deeply conservative enclave along Lake Michigan, the number of delegates leapt from 170 to 330. The same trend played out in other battleground states. \"The Trump apparatus did very little correct except infiltrate the party right down to the precinct level,\" said Timmer, the former executive director of the Michigan Republican Party. \"Not just in Michigan but all over.\"\n\nThe first test for the new \"America First\" delegates came in late August 2022. In Michigan, the voters select most nominees for elected office in a normal primary election. But for two key positions with oversight of elections - attorney general and secretary of state - the precinct delegates decide the party's nominees at a statewide convention. These conventions were often sleepy affairs, the outcome predetermined. But this time, when the party's chair, a wealthy donor and former U.S. ambassador named Ron Weiser, took the stage, the cavernous ballroom filled with boos and jeers.\n\n\"How many of you believe we can sweep in November?\" Weiser asked.\n\n\"With the new people!\" a woman wearing a \"Keep America Great\" hat yelled. \"With 'America First'!\"\n\nOver the opposition of Weiser and other longtime party operatives, the \"America First\" contingent nominated two election deniers for attorney general and secretary of state. Matthew DePerno, a combative lawyer who had promoted a viral yet baseless theory about voting fraud in tiny Antrim County, Michigan, vowed to use the power of the attorney general's office to investigate election crimes. Kristina Karamo, a tall, commanding woman in her late 30s with a breathless speaking style, was the \"America First\" pick for secretary of state. A community college instructor and live-trivia host, Karamo had come to prominence after she testified before the Michigan Legislature about irregularities involving ballot counting and voting machines she said she'd witnessed as a poll challenger in Detroit in 2020.\n\nAs a show of political force, nominating DePerno and Karamo was impressive. As an electoral strategy, it was disastrous. Both candidates were trounced in November, and Michigan Democrats won control of all three branches of government for the first time in more than 30 years.\n\nDePerno conceded defeat right away. Karamo did not. To outside observers, her stance was laughable: She had lost by 615,000 votes, roughly the population of Detroit. But Beyer and many other \"America First\" delegates saw Karamo's actions as brave and principled, the opposite of DePerno's cowardly and hypocritical concession. Several months later, she and DePerno ran against each other to be the next chair of the Michigan Republican Party. DePerno won endorsements from Trump and Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO and a funder of the election-fraud movement. But the delegates rallied behind Karamo and delivered her the victory. In just two years, Bannon's precinct strategy had gone from a quixotic scheme to a reality.\n\nNo sooner had Karamo won than paranoia set in. Standing on the convention floor just before her victory, a well-connected precinct delegate approached Beyer to deliver a message. \"He says, 'Leadership is going to let you guys have this one,'\" Beyer recalled. Karamo would be chair, in other words, because party leaders let it happen. Why'd they do that, Beyer asked. \"Because they believe that they can make her fail quicker than they can Matt DePerno.\"\n\nA state political party is like the HVAC unit of American politics. When it does its job, you don't think about it. It hums away in the background, as unsexy as it is essential. State parties recruit candidates to run for office. They mobilize voters. They raise money that helps candidates spread their message and win elections.\n\nKaramo had other priorities when she took over the Michigan Republican Party. Top of the list: \"election integrity.\" She created a new \"election security operations\" team to recruit hundreds of volunteers as poll challengers, dropbox monitors and recount specialists, and to serve on county canvassing boards, which certify the final vote count. To oversee this work, she enlisted grassroots activists best known for filing a lawsuit that accused Detroit's election clerk of running an \"illegal election\" in 2022. (A judge dismissed the case, calling it \"frivolous\" and \"rife with speculation.\") Training and embedding \"America First\" activists in every part of the election process was critical to the future of the party and the state. \"Otherwise,\" one of Karamo's advisers told a group of activists, \"the big money is going to come right back in and start doing all this for us and selecting all the candidates for us again.\"\n\nKaramo's plan to \"secure\" elections had two objectives: Not only did she and her team hope to catch future cheating by the Democrats, but they sought revenge against the Republican establishment. To do that, Karamo turned to a lawyer and political outsider named James Copas. He was given a special project: write a new constitution for the state Republican Party that would give as much power as possible to precinct delegates. People like Ken Beyer.\n\nThere was no greater priority for Karamo's team. \"If you were to look in my records, I opened 82 different project files,\" Copas told me. \"The constitution was file number one.\"\n\nKaramo showed little interest in the day-to-day work of running the party. Bills went unpaid, emails unanswered. When members of the party's state committee, in effect the board of directors, questioned her, she ignored them or removed them from leadership positions. Even her allies were critical. \"I can tell you unequivocally that there was no chance that Kristina was qualified to be the chair,\" Copas said. \"So what? She was elected.\" (Karamo did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)\n\nNear the end of 2023, Copas circulated a draft of his proposed overhaul of the party constitution. The new constitution proposed a radical change: Eliminate open primary elections and replace them with closed caucuses. Under the current system, about a million people voted in an August GOP primary to choose nominees for local elected offices, state legislative seats, judgeships and federal House and Senate races. Instead of those million or so voters casting ballots, fewer than 10,000 precinct delegates - the same precinct delegates who had powered Karamo to victory - would meet behind closed doors and select the candidates.\n\nThe aim of this proposal, said Joel Studebaker, who was Karamo's chief of staff, was to break up the \"corruption club\" that had ruled Michigan Republican politics for far too long. \"We want something that's pure,\" he told me. \"The best answer for that is putting power in the hands of the people.\" The irony, critics pointed out, was that Karamo's proposal would disenfranchise far more people than it empowered.\n\nThere was another reason the closed-caucus model appealed to the \"America First\" faithful: It meant there was no need for voting machines, mail-in ballots, high-speed scanners or any of the other technologies that election-fraud believers had spent the last two years railing against. \"You're eliminating cheating in the election system,\" Beyer told me.\n\nThe backlash was fierce. \"Nothing says 'we respect democracy' like cutting out millions of Michigan voters,\" wrote one prominent Michigan conservative activist.\n\nKaramo's proposed voting reforms and the party's dire finances plunged the organization into turmoil with the 2024 elections less than a year away. Even some of Karamo's own supporters turned against her. Privately, a group of delegates discussed whether to urge her to step down for the good of the party. Karamo had no plans to resign. If her enemies wanted her gone, they would have to try to remove her.\n\nAnd so they did: On Jan. 6, 2024, a group of anti-Karamo delegates on the Republican state committee invoked party bylaws and voted to remove Karamo as chair. Two weeks later, the same faction elected former U.S. representative Pete Hoekstra to replace her.\n\nBy the time Trump walked onstage in Waterford Township, Michigan, in mid-February with his red hat pulled low, the Michigan Republican Party was a national punchline. Karamo had refused to leave office, saying the vote to oust her was \"illegitimate.\" An unsigned statement issued by the state GOP called it a \"political lynching.\" Her critics filed a lawsuit in state court to enforce the removal vote, and Karamo said only a judge's order could make her leave. In the meantime, she urged her followers to travel to Detroit on March 2 for a special convention. There, they would vote on her controversial plan to rewrite the Michigan GOP's constitution.\n\nAt his mid-February rally, Trump waded into the chaotic mess that was the Michigan Republican Party despite his supporters urging him not to. He described Hoekstra as \"your new Michigan Republican Party chairman,\" a line that was greeted with a mix of cheers and boos. The boos continued as Trump said he'd recommended Hoekstra for the job. \"I said, 'Do you think you could ever get this guy Hoekstra? He's unbelievable,'\" Trump said.\n\nThe Trump campaign seemed to recognize that the longer Karamo remained in charge, the weaker the state party was and the less chance he had to win Michigan. For both Trump and Biden, Michigan is arguably a must-win state.\n\nStill, some of Trump's most ardent supporters saw his support for Hoekstra as a betrayal. \"I'm not happy with Mr. Trump right now,\" one voter said at a Republican town hall I attended. \"I think he should keep his nose out of Michigan politics.\" When I asked Beyer what he thought, he said he suspected Trump was playing a double game. \"If you know anything about election integrity, you know it's a rigged program here,\" he said. For Trump to win, \"he's gotta join the riggers.\" I heard a Karamo supporter say she had read on \"Truth\" - meaning Truth Social, the social media platform partly owned by Trump - that Trump hadn't even written the endorsement of Hoekstra that appeared on his account.\n\nAround the time of Trump's visit to Michigan, I went to hear Karamo speak in Saginaw County, an hour and a half north of Detroit. The event was part of a barnstorming tour of the state meant to rally her supporters and assure them that she remained the party's legitimate leader. To her supporters, the date of the vote to remove her, Jan. 6, 2024, had taken on a mythological quality - it was the new Jan. 6. Their Jan. 6. The audience sat rapt as Karamo told them that it wasn't just 2020 and 2022 that were rigged. \"Our election system has been corrupted for decades. There's an entire network protecting the corrupt system.\"\n\nAt the end of her remarks, she reminded her supporters to go to Detroit on March 2. The date had taken on an outsize significance. Not only would delegates choose which presidential candidate received Michigan's 39 remaining delegates on the path to the Republican nomination, but they would vote on Karamo's constitution plan. Hoekstra, who was calling himself the rightful chair, was planning a separate event on the same day in Grand Rapids. The schism in the party would be on full display.\n\nA few days before the dueling conventions, a judge issued a preliminary ruling that Karamo had been properly removed. The Detroit convention was called off, and her constitutional overhaul was shelved for the time being. With Karamo's event canceled, Beyer, now a regional GOP chairman as well as a delegate, said he would carry the torch for the \"America First\" movement. In an act of defiance aimed at \"Adolf\" Hoekstra, as Beyer called him, he and Studebaker announced their own miniconvention.\n\nOn the morning of March 2, Beyer picked me up at a Wendy's on the drive to his breakaway convention. A deluge of text messages lit up his phone as we drove down the highway. Beyer told me that the theme for Hoekstra's convention was \"Up From the Ashes.\"\n\n\"It's fitting,\" he said. \"Because they lit the match. They don't like the new group of people that have come in over the last two years.\" He paused. \"They're burning down the Republican Party to get rid of people like me.\"\n\nAfter Beyer and Studebaker had run their protest convention, they jumped in Studebaker's truck and drove to Hoekstra's event in Grand Rapids. There, Studebaker ran into some operatives aligned with Trump's team in Michigan. Studebaker was furious with them and with Trump for abandoning Karamo and for, as he saw it, thwarting the will of the delegates.\n\n\"He's going to lose Michigan if he keeps doing this,\" Studebaker said. The delegates will still vote for Trump, he added, but they're not going to knock doors and they're not going to give money. They might tune out of state and national elections and focus on local races.\n\nThe operatives were unmoved. \"We gotta go,\" one of them said. \"Trump stuff.\"\n\nNot long afterward, Trump disappointed his grassroots followers again. In Michigan's high-stakes Republican Senate contest, Trump endorsed Mike Rogers, a former representative, all but assuring that Rogers would clinch the nomination in the August primary.\n\nAs for Peter Meijer, that throw-you-off-the-bridge exchange in the cafe in February had proved prophetic: His comeback bid was doomed. In late April, he dropped out.\n\nTrump's endorsement of Rogers left his supporters mystified. Like Meijer, he had been a vocal critic of Trump, once calling the former president \"more gangster than presidential.\" He had chaired the powerful House intelligence committee, which led Trump followers to label him a member of the \"deep state.\" A former aide to Trump had tweeted: \"Can't imagine a worse or more dangerous 'Republican' candidate for Senate than Mike Rogers.\"\n\nJim Copas, who quit his role with the party shortly before Karamo was forced out, told me he was disgusted with Trump's actions. \"I've lost complete faith in the state GOP and I've lost complete faith in the national GOP,\" he said. Speaking of Trump, he added: \"To be honest, I think Don has learned a little bit about being a politician and he's forgotten his soul.\"\n\nRead More\n\nBeyer hadn't given up on Trump. He still \"loved\" the man, he said, but he wasn't taking direction from Trump. \"I'm not gonna always listen to him,\" Beyer told me. \"I'm not part of a cult.\"\n\nHe had his own plans. In one of our last conversations, he laid out a more religious, more uncompromising version of the \"America First\" movement. He had started his own PAC called Faith Family Freedom and he planned to target the precinct delegates around the state who had opposed Karamo and replace them with \"America First\" allies in the next round of delegate elections this August. He had already signed up 350 supporters in various counties, he said, to help with his efforts.\n\nIf the Republican establishment - the DeVoses and the Meijers, Pete Hoekstra and the people who had voted to remove Karamo - fought him and his compatriots, Beyer stood ready. \"They're not after Trump. They're not after Kristina,\" he told me. \"They're after me. They're after everybody like me. That's what this is all about.\"\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?

      "text": "White House and Republican leaders chill momentum for internal tariff rebellion\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe White House and Republican leaders have blunted growing momentum for several efforts to slow down President Donald Trumpâs sweeping tariff regime, even as global economic chaos continues.\n\nIn quick succession on Monday, the GOPâs senior leaders clamped down on the bipartisan Trade Review Act, which would require Congress to vote on new presidential tariffs within 60 days. Trumpâs White House issued a veto threat that said the bill âwould dangerously hamper the presidentâs authority,â House Speaker Mike Johnson said Trump deserves âlatitudeâ on the issue, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune declared that the bill doesnât have a âfutureâ in Congress.\n\nSeven Senate Republicans had already backed the measure, led by Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and a companion House bill was coming from Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb. But after several days of growing support from Republicans, the quick action by the White House, Thune and Johnson appeared to put the bill on ice.\n\nâI donât think a lot of folks believed that was moving towards becoming a law. I think it was more of a statement by some to say, âthis tariff piece is different,ââ Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., told Semafor.\n\nLankford, the No. 5 GOP leader, said he didnât consider signing on to it âbecause I donât think itâs going to become law.â Several Republicans agreed on Monday evening after Trumpâs veto threat, despite another wild day of stock market gyration as investors panic over the tariffs.\n\nItâs a signal that Republican leadersâ jobs arenât just about passing Trumpâs agenda at the moment â theyâre also safeguarding that agenda from potential critics in his own party. Thatâs a delicate task, given the economic warning signs and louder recession forecasts from Wall Street. But so far, tariff critics in the typically pro-free-trade congressional GOP have no viable path to clawing back tariff power from the president.\n\nThe biggest flashpoint so far in the tariff battle came when the Senate approved a resolution overturning Trumpâs tariffs on Canada last week. Under ordinary circumstances, that proposal might have been able to pass the House; however, Republican leaders in the lower chamber already approved language earlier this year that makes it much more difficult for rank-and-file members to force a vote.\n\nâYou all need to be asking the House how they could possibly forbid this from happening,â said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. âThe House really ought to vote on what we passed the other day.â\n\nPaul said that âwithout questionâ Johnson had ceded too much power to the president, adding that even if Trump is issuing veto threats, âit doesnât mean the battles arenât worth having.â Others had a different view.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said âthereâs no way to pass a veto-proof bill. And that doesnât do anything to prevent the president on the front end from doing tariffs.â He added, referring to the timetable in the Grassley-Cantwell bill: âMy hope is this will be over long before 60 days expires.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nPaul said heâd consider supporting the Trade Review Act if it ever came to the Senate floor, though he favored a more aggressive approach because he doesnât want to âacknowledge that any power should be in the presidency for tariffs.â\n\nHe also said he would huddle with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who led the effort to fight Trumpâs Canada tariffs, to discuss whether they could target more of Trumpâs national emergency declarations.\n\nA future Paul-Kaine effort to target Trumpâs broad-based tariffs might pass the Senate in the near future, but not with the sort of margins that would be needed to overturn a Trump veto. As for the Trade Review Act, Thune said there will likely be conversations about it within the GOP but that most senators are âwatching and waiting to see and know what the ultimate policy implementation will be with respect for tariffs.â\n\nSenate Finance Chair Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said he had not yet reviewed the bill.\n\nGrassley himself said he hadnât yet had an opportunity to push party leaders for a vote on his bill, but he made clear heâs using the moment to press for a reversal of Congressâ long-running willingness to cede its constitutional trade authority to the White House.\n\nâYou talk about tariffs any other time â when it comes up, you never get any attention. The president has brought tariffs to the surface, and it gives me a chance to correct the mistakes of the past,â Grassley said. âCongress ought to be very jealous about its power.â\n\nStill, the unavoidable question in the Senate is: How many days of stock market losses will the GOP be able to withstand before taking action? The answer at the moment seems to be, at least a few more.\n\nThatâs because Republicans seem to think the trade-induced economic malaise could go away just as quickly as it came, if Trump can renegotiate some deals with the dozens of countries his administration said have come running to them to cut deals.\n\nâSeems to me like heâs getting a positive reaction from our trading partners, who seem to be eager to go to zero on tariffs,â Cornyn said.\n\nRepublican leaders are betting they can hold the line while Trump works on new trade deals that could resuscitate the stock market and hold down projected cost increases for consumers.\n\nIn the short-term, itâs not a bad wager: Both chambers of Congress are about to leave town for two weeks of recess â an eternity in Trumpâs trade wars.\n\nIf lawmakers return to Washington in late April without a resolution, though, itâll get harder to keep Republicans from joining efforts like the Trade Review Act or a future resolution from Paul and Kaine to stop Trumpâs tariffs.\n\nEven if they do, a veto-proof majority on anything tariff-related seems far away.\n\nDemocratic leaders are clearly trying to drive a wedge between Republicans and Trump when it comes to tariffs.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday that Thune âhas a responsibility to listen to American families worried about the price of groceries, worried about their retirement.â\n\nâThe Republican leader should make passing tariff legislation the top priority of the Senate this week,â Schumer added. âLeader Thune has a decision to make: Side with Donald Trump and his destructive policies, or side with the American people.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Tea partyâs champions agonize over spending cuts\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nYears before Donald Trump remodeled the GOP, the Tea Party took its turn transforming the party. And now, at a critical juncture for Trumpâs agenda, its heirs in Congress are weighing just how far to push it.\n\nA handful of conservative senators are holding out â for now, at least â on supporting Republican leadersâ still-evolving budget, the next step to advance Trumpâs tax cut plans. Those senators are demanding deeper spending cuts than their House counterparts and questioning why the GOP would add a debt ceiling increase that theyâd have to pass without Democrats.\n\nBut a big unknown lingers over the endeavor: Are fiscal conservatives willing to vote no on the budget if they donât get their way? Itâs something the partyâs right flank is plainly wrestling with.\n\nâI have an obligation to do so, if it doesnât get it right. I also have an obligation to make sure it gets right, to get to the point where I can vote for it,â Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, told Semafor of the budget thatâs expected in the Senate floor as soon as next week.\n\nLee added that âI donât necessarily want to encourage us to go slower. I just want to make sure that we do it cautiously and that we get it right.â\n\nItâs a critical moment for Republicans like Lee whose political careers took off in 2010 and 2012 as a rejection of the GOPâs old guard. Senior Republicans estimate that the number of senators uneasy with the budget talks could jeopardize the package or at least delay it further, though Senate Majority Leader John Thune and fellow leaders are moving to assuage those concerns.\n\nIn addition to Lee, Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., are the most vocal in their calls for more spending cuts. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., an original member of the Tea Party Caucus during her time in the House, told Semafor sheâs taking their position, too: âI canât support the House level. There needs to be more cuts than that.â\n\nSenate Republicans are discussing adding $500 billion to the House GOPâs $1.5 trillion floor for spending cuts, although their budget may end up slashing even more, according to multiple members.\n\nLummis said a group of Republicans is pushing for deeper cuts, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said heâs among them â but another Republican senator told Semafor that going too far could alienate the partyâs more moderate members. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who leans more populist, said he could support deeper cuts but not if they affect benefits to Medicare or Medicaid, which the House had proposed targeting.\n\nRepublicans can lose up to three votes from their side and pass the budget with a simple majority.\n\nâWeâre trying to thread the needle â¦ all of us want to use as robust of a deficit reduction package as we can, but also something that we can get through the Senate,â Thune told Semafor.\n\nIn this article:\n\nAt the same time, Thuneâs most fiscally conservative members are pushing to excise a debt ceiling increase that Trump wants, separating that issue from the tax cut push. Paul was the only Republican to oppose the partyâs initial budget earlier this year; he told Semafor this is the moment for conservatives to get loud or get rolled.\n\nâThey need to be more verbal, and if theyâre vocal now, I think we can remove it from the bill. If more people donât stand up, theyâre going to jam things at the end and put it on,â Paul said.\n\nRepublicans do not seem optimistic about winning his vote.\n\nIt all speaks to the uncertain status of extreme budget-cutters in the Republican Party. Once a dominant force, these days theyâre used to being assured by leaders that later, not now, is the time for steep spending reduction.\n\nJohnson said this time he doesnât buy it, and that he wants Republicans to push spending back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nâThey say, âthis is the first step here, we can always do more,ââ Johnson told Semafor. Unless the party cuts spending now, he said: âWeâre not going to do more.â\n\nWhatever cuts the GOP endorses, the details will be left to Senate committees to figure out. Thuneâs leadership team is simply hoping to generate momentum for the stalled Republican agenda heading into next monthâs recess.\n\nThe party is far behind its 2017 pace when it comes to unilateral action on Trumpâs agenda, and leaders are aware that at some point they need to call a vote.\n\nâWeâre closing in on it,â said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., the No. 4 conference leader. She said the goal is to âagree to an aspirational number, or at least agree to a minimum, so we can just move forward. Because we want to capture the momentum.â\n\nBudget resolutions are more of a party unity exercise than anything else. And for that reason, despite the hard line being drawn by the Senateâs most Tea Party-friendly members, itâs hard to imagine four or more Republicans actually tanking the budget.\n\nThune would be highly unlikely to bring any budget to the floor, of course, if he didnât have adequate support.\n\nBut itâs certainly possible that things get delayed even further if conservatives keep balking. And that might not be such a bad thing, since some Republican senators still think they might need to split Trumpâs agenda back into two separate bills at some point.\n\nIf the Senate does move forward, the House might entertain further changes to the budget. To avoid yet another round of voting after this one, Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson will need to reach a compromise ahead of time.\n\nThatâs a huge challenge.\n\nThere are still plenty of optimists in the Senate GOP who see a comfortable landing spot for everyone.\n\nâI think the consensus now is itâs going to be $2 trillion, floor â¦ actually, itâll help us with the fiscal conservatives in the House and certainly in the Senate,â said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.\n\nHe added that âthe real meat of the discussion is the actual [party-line] reconciliation bill,â not the budget, and likened the moment to an easy trip down the slope: âI call this skiing the green runs. Weâre going to get into the blue runs and black diamonds next.â\n\nItâs undeniable that this phase of legislating is far easier than whatâs to come: Identifying binding cuts to popular government programs. Many Republicans already have said they are uneasy with cutting Medicaid, for example.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Republicans insist they could eventually restrain Trump and Musk\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nAside from Matt Gaetz, the Republican Congress is showing very little interest in checking President Donald Trumpâs power right now.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, a handful of once-reluctant Republicans approved of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbardâs bids to join Trumpâs Cabinet. On top of the mild GOP complaints about the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development and freeze on government spending, free-trading Republicans who warned against a potential trade war with Canada and Mexico are giving Trump plenty of latitude in that area.\n\nWith little threat of the GOP Congress stepping in to restrain it, Trump â and Elon Musk, empowered with significant authority to reshape the federal government â have staged a dizzying show of executive-branch dominance over the federal legislature.\n\nTrumpâs ability to wield power to start his second term has prompted increasingly loud charges from Democrats that Republicans are too afraid to stand up to him. Itâs a line that Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., is likely to hear for two more years as he prepares for a reelection bid on the front lines of 2026âs battle for the Senate.\n\nTillis is throwing the charge right back at Democrats, accusing them of being pliant for former President Joe Biden.\n\nâIn the last Democratic administration, which [nominees] did they even raise a concern [about]? Zero. Like, zero. So itâs disingenuous. Itâs the same old, tired playbook,â Tillis told Semafor when asked about the idea that heâs rolling over for Trump.\n\nHe contended that there will eventually be red lines that the Republican Congress wonât permit Trump to cross, âwhether itâs on nominees, or whether itâs on policy. I can see things where Musk â heâs coming up with good ideas â he could go too far. We could say, âGreat idea. It doesnât work in a public institution.ââ\n\nIt hasnât come to that yet. And Republicans are plainly sensitive to the idea that they are letting legislative power atrophy after charging Democrats with the same misdeed during the presidencies of Biden and Barack Obama.\n\nSen. Todd Young, R-Ind., even spoke to Trump directly about Gabbardâs nomination as director of national intelligence, but told reporters Trump wasnât trying to twist his arm. Young said Trump told him Gabbardâs vote was âimportant, but he said, âYou know what, Todd, weâre going to work together on all kinds of other things to Make America Great Again.ââ\n\nRepublicansâ attitudes may change if voters sour on Trump, but thus far the president has had wide latitude to remodel government. Heâs sparked frustration from moderate Republicans like Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins but little protest from party leaders.\n\nStill, Tillis isnât the only senior Republican to insist that they will not let Musk or the executive branch further infringe on Congressâs vaunted power of the purse.\n\nâWe do have to really make sure that the spending and the appropriation and the power of the purse remains with the House and Senate,â said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va. âAny encroachment on that, I think we should, as a body, stand up and resist.â\n\nRepublicans already concede they will likely need to push through legislation to finalize changes to USAID. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., told Semafor that Republicans are quietly critical of undercutting foreign aid development programs but âare afraid to say it. Theyâre afraid of retribution.â\n\nâIâm surprised that so many people here who have supported foreign assistance programs now suddenly are willing to let them be cut off, to the detriment of security,â said Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. âThese are not like turning off a light switch that you can shut it down and start it again.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nGaetzâs implosion last year led Democrats â and even some Republicans â to believe that Trumpâs crop of unconventional nominees could be forced into withdrawal or defeated. Yet the pugilistic president, his extremely online base and GOP leaders teamed up to advance every other nominee in that group.\n\nOne of them, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, is already confirmed; Gabbard and Kennedy are on the goal line to get there. Gaetz remains the only scuttled Trump Cabinet pick.\n\nYoung plainly struggled with his vote on Gabbard. He required written assurances from her on the possibility of pardoning Edward Snowden and her views on US surveillance power before moving ahead. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a doctor, was open about his reservations about Kennedyâs vaccine skepticism; he voted for Kennedy just as Trump mused online about vaccinesâ effect on autism.\n\nTillis said he and Cassidy are both âindependentâ and âprepared to offer up our concernsâ about nominees. He warned that Kennedy would âregret itâ if he took major steps against vaccines.\n\nBoth Cassidy and Young credited Vice President JD Vance with helping them get answers from nominees. And both have crossed Trump in the past â Young declined to endorse him last year, and Cassidy voted to convict him in the 2021 impeachment trial.\n\nStill, one ally of Trump and Kennedy said Cassidy was always seen within the administration as a yes in the end.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Trump will support Cassidy in 2026, or at least stay neutral.\n\nThe Senate minority leader told Semafor in a recent interview that he thinks Republicans will eventually be more comfortable working with Democrats on things that Trump may not totally love.\n\nâItâs going to take a little while. Because right now theyâre all afraid of Trump. Trump is going to have less power and less clout six months from now because of screwups like the OMB one,â Schumer said, referring to a blunt budget freeze that the administration revoked last week.\n\nTrumpâs power on Capitol Hill is stronger than it was in 2017, and heâs using every bit of that extra clout. Many of his Republican skeptics are no longer in Congress, and longtime GOP lawmakers see little upside to battling with him at this early date.\n\nThe biggest early question mark is Musk: If he starts targeting popular government programs, heâll likely face pushback from the GOP. But his initial forays have provoked little response from Republicans so far.\n\nShelby Talcott contributed to this report.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Whatâs behind Democratsâ bid to torpedo permanent Republican tax cuts\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nDemocrats are mounting a new counterattack to the GOPâs tax plan that has potentially sweeping consequences: trying to stop Republicansâ argument that extending expiring tax cuts should not count as increasing the deficit.\n\nThe two parties were set to make their cases Tuesday to the Senate parliamentarian, the chamberâs nonpartisan rules referee, ahead of a potential ruling on Republicansâ bid to declare that extensions of President Donald Trumpâs 2017 tax law should not be counted as deficit spending. That case is a linchpin of the GOPâs strategy to make Trumpâs tax cuts permanent â one of his top priorities.\n\nBut a scheduled bipartisan meeting was abruptly canceled on Tuesday afternoon, according to Democrats, as Republicans sought an alternative strategy to get their tax cuts made permanent using a gambit thatâs known as the âcurrent policy baselineâ on the Hill. Republicans said they donât need a bipartisan meeting to move forward and said no such meeting was even scheduled.\n\nDemocrats canât stop the underlying tax bill, regardless of the strategy used by the GOP. But they do have an opportunity to drive a wedge between Republicansâ stated desire to balance the budget and the reality of what permanent tax cuts might cost.\n\nâIf we want to go to a world in which you throw all fiscal responsibility to the wind, then the Republican strategy is the way to do it,â Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, told Semafor on Tuesday. âCreate deficits as far as the eye can see, and can try to hide those deficits and the resulting $37 trillion in additional debt over 30 years from the American people.â\n\nMerkley is leading the effort to scuttle Republicansâ plans. His staffers have met with the parliamentarianâs office in recent days to try to dismantle their opponentsâ strategy, arguing that âthat this is absolutely inappropriate under the law,â as he put it.\n\nMerkley said the 1974 law that created the rules for passing fiscal legislation along party lines is clear. Democrats attempted in the past to get creative with the so-called budget reconciliation rules, but theyâre hoping to at least contain Republicansâ tax cut plan, even if they canât stop it.\n\nWhile it seems wonky, the fight could resonate for years to come: The GOPâs push to make the Trump tax cuts permanent could further erode Senate constraints on party-line legislating and potentially absolve Congress from working with a 10-year budget window for major bills.\n\nIf Republicans implement more of Trumpâs promised tax breaks for overtime or tips this year, for example, those breaks would be more easily extended in the future without the need to find corresponding spending cuts or new revenues.\n\nAnd if the GOP prevails, Democrats almost certainly would be able to utilize the new precedent to establish and fund new government programs once they reclaim power in Washington. Merkley isnât yet predicting how he might approach the issue as the possible future budget committee chairman.\n\nHeâs more focused on winning both the procedural war â and the messaging battle.\n\nâI can say I have absolute conviction that our argument that throwing out current law so you can hide massive deficits is 100 percent inconsistent with the Budget and impoundment Control Act that has guided us for 50-plus years,â Merkley said.\n\nIn this article:\n\nRepublicans arenât forecasting victory yet, either. The parliamentarian frequently puts restraints on both parties; Democrats, for one, lost their bid four years ago to add immigration changes to former President Joe Bidenâs marquee party-line bill, now known as the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said this week that conversations with the parliamentarian are âongoing.â But on Tuesday Thune said itâs also âvery clearâ that Senate Budget Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., can unilaterally decree that he can set the current policy baseline.\n\nMerkley said that âwould be a massive abuse that destroys any sort of fiscal restraint in the budget process.â And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer likened that move to the going ânuclearâ or changing the Senateâs rules.\n\nEverything isnât fully sewn up yet on the Republican side, either. Some Senate Republicans are a bit uneasy with their partyâs budgetary maneuvering, although GOP leaders are optimistic their members will come around to exempting the extended tax cuts from deficit math.\n\nSen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., said there could be a defection or two from his side, âbut it wonât be enough to stop it. I wouldnât want to be the Republican who votes to increase taxes on working-class voters and small businesses.â\n\nDemocrats are still holding out hope that fiscal hawks in the House might protest the Senate Republicansâ bid to extend the Trump tax cuts permanently. (When the House passed its initial budget in February, it notably did not use the current policy baseline.)\n\nâThereâs many House members who have deep convictions about fiscal responsibility, who basically are singing our tune,â Merkley said .\n\nAs boring as the words âcurrent policy baselineâ sound, the topic might be the weekâs most seismic action in Washington. If Republicans are unable to use this strategy, their hopes of making Trumpâs 2017 tax cuts permanent look increasingly out of reach.\n\nIf Republicans are able to use their preferred approach, theyâll be able to skirt some tough choices about slashing spending to pay for more tax cuts â which is particularly helpful given how many of them are leery of touching Medicaid. However, theyâd also almost certainly embolden Democrats in ways they might regret the next time theyâre out of power.\n\nIn todayâs tit-for-tat Senate, which continues to gradually erode its own age-old traditions, that regret might be par for the course.\n\nMany conservatives donât see the matter as a cut-and-dry question of which approach is more fiscally responsible. Thatâs in part because theyâre highly skeptical of the Congressional Budget Office, the Hillâs nonpartisan economic scorekeeper.\n\nEven Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who otherwise opposes Republicansâ current budget framework out of distaste for its debt ceiling hike and its level of spending cuts, said heâs fine with using the âcurrent policy baseline.â\n\nâElected officials have allowed themselves to be controlled by bean-counters who count the beans in a way that no ordinary citizen would understand,â Paul told Semafor recently. âFor five years, we had a tax rate level based on the tax rates of 2017. Almost nobody believes that you would count it, every time you continued it, as a new tax cut.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Republicans start to sweat as Trump takes ownership of US economy\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nPresident Donald Trump got elected promising relief for US votersâ pocketbooks. Heâs already running into harsh economic reality.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers and CEOs are fretting over sagging consumer sentiment as Trumpâs proposed tariffs and federal layoffs stress a system taxed by persistent inflation and a slowing labor market. Stock markets are subdued, and new data shows that people in the US are feeling less optimistic about the economy, with surging expectations of higher prices and fewer jobs.\n\nWhile GOP leaders â and Trump himself â blame former President Joe Biden for rising prices, thanks to his trio of pricey government stimulus laws, thereâs a time limit on that argument. Once Trump fully owns the economy, his party will have to answer for the broader economic effects of his policies.\n\nOne of those consequences: The national debt is on track to increase with little chance for reining it back in. As Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., put it: âInflation comes from debt, and so if you add more debt, youâll get more inflation.â\n\nâThereâs a very good chance that whatâs going to happen is, youâll have the persistent inflation â 3 or 4% â but then you can have dramatic things happen,â like the bird flu spiking egg prices, Paul told Semafor. âTariffs can be an addition on that, and definitely be a problem.â\n\nTrump wonât have to face voters again, but congressional Republicans will next fall. Theyâre clearly conscious of the need to corral inflation while staving off recession.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., facing one of the toughest 2026 reelection races in the country, warned in an interview that âthe tariff regimen has to be right, or itâs going to be inflationary.â He added that itâs critical to manage Trumpâs proposed tariffs, along with preventing tax increases; otherwise, it could âend up being a very, very difficult cycle for us.â\n\nTillis expressed confidence that Trumpâs newly confirmed US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, would handle any tariffs appropriately. Heâll have an immediate challenge thanks to the presidentâs Thursday comments threatening higher tariffs next week on Mexico, Canada and China.\n\nOn top of that, Trumpâs administration earlier this week directed federal agencies to plot further downsizing following the dismissals and buyouts of tens of thousands of workers. Meanwhile, inflation and jobless claims are ticking up.\n\nâThe last time consumer sentiment fell, it was falling in a labor market that was one of the strongest weâve ever seen,â economic policy consultant Kathryn Edwards, previously with the RAND Corporation, said. âConsumer sentiment now is falling in a labor market that is on the precipice. This is a very dangerous combination.â\n\nThe administration maintains that its policies, including Trumpâs âfavorite wordâ tariffs, will boost the economy. In a speech this week , Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Americaâs economy is âbrittle underneathâ and the administrationâs policy plans will bring down inflation and interest rates.\n\nâTariffs can increase US industrial capacity, create and protect US jobs, and improve our national security,â Bessent said. He also said they âcan be an important source of government revenue.â\n\nTrumpâs only been in office a few weeks â far from enough time for the US to reap the benefits he sees coming from tariffs â though Trump said during the campaign he would âimmediatelyâ bring down prices. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged on Fox News Wednesday that returning jobs through tariffs âtakes two years, for sure.â\n\nThe administrationâs parallel efforts to bring down energy costs, like ending the war in Ukraine and rolling back Democratic regulations, will take time. That process is starting: This week Congress cleared a repeal of a Biden-era rule that charged oil and gas companies for their methane emissions.\n\nâI am worried about energy production. I think we have to expand that. If we donât do that, people are going to find inflation is going to be really persistent,â said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. âI think the president knows that.â\n\nTrump advisers are also looking to GOP plans for tax cuts and deficit reductions to help ease consumersâ economic burden.\n\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said lingering inflation stems from âthe Biden administrationâs nonsensical economic policies and runaway spending, adding that âPresident Trump built the greatest economy in American history during his first term, and heâs due to repeat the magic again in his second term.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nRep. Scott Fitzgerald expects Trump to announce soon an outline of what his administration is doing to lower prices, including on energy, monetary policy, and the labor market. The Wisconsin Republican has already been hearing concerns from employers in his district about how tariffs on Canada could affect their ability to source the steel and aluminum they need.\n\nâTheyâre kind of trying to figure out what are the changes that Trumpâs going to make now, and [whether] that could once again have an effect on their businesses,â Fitzgerald said.\n\nThe economic ramifications of Trumpâs tariffs and layoffs are a core challenge for Republicans who want to enact Trumpâs tax agenda without ballooning the deficit. House Speaker Mike Johnson returned from a Wednesday meeting with Trump and proposed tariffs, federal layoffs, and a new GOP plan to let noncitizens purchase a green card for $5 million as revenue sources.\n\nItâs not clear how much revenue those would bring in. And not everyone is bought in.\n\nâIâm not the biggest fan of depending on [tariffs] for revenue,â said Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., who chairs the House Ways and Means Committeeâs trade panel. âWe are doing tax reform â continuing what we did in 2017 â because itâs proven to be a good thing.â\n\nHe added that âthe cost to consumers is something weâre talking about, and we need to be mindful of that.â\n\nCongressional Democrats want to capitalize on the growing turmoil within the GOP as Trumpâs economic policies put members of his own party on edge.\n\nâThereâs probably some very challenging conversations, because a lot of these guys understand that itâs going to tick up inflation â that automobiles are going to be more expensive â and I think they understand that thatâs not a good thing for the president,â Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said.\n\nRepublicans are getting more candid about the potential economic downside of Trumpâs policies. Thatâs a long way from openly critiquing him over them.\n\nBut the fact thereâs any daylight just five weeks into the administration â when GOP lawmakers are largely unwilling to break from him on any other front â may betray deeper fault lines to come.\n\nConsider that most of Trumpâs proposals are still conceptual. The tariffs havenât gone into effect, many agencies havenât executed deeper spending cuts, and GOP policymakers are still optimistic about cutting taxes without growing the national debt.\n\nThe stress could increase when those policies become real.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nDonald Trump won a majority of voters without college degrees last November in part by promising a presidency that would bring âeconomic relief to our citizens.â\n\nNow comes the hard part.\n\nTrumpâs arrival in office comes at a tipping point for a Republican Party heâs reshaped in his image. Heâs outlined a number of populist economic goals, vowing to get rid of taxes on tips and overtime pay while weighing a âsignificant expansionâ of the child tax credit and new tariffs that he sees as a boon to US manufacturing. His populist allies have gone further: Steve Bannon told Semafor last month that it was time to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations.\n\nBut Trump is now avidly pursuing new corporate partners and investments that line up with a fiercely pro-business âÂ and conventional âÂ Republican agenda, hosting tech industry chiefs at Mar-a-Lago as he forges a close alliance with Elon Musk and rolls out a $100 billion SoftBank investment. The contrast between Trumpâs pro-working class talk and his pro-business actions has some of his own supporters asking whether any of his more populist ideas will end up becoming real administration policies.\n\nThe choice between those visions is âthe million-dollar question, and in my opinion the top story,â one person in Trumpâs orbit told Semafor. âBecause, to answer anything else, weâve got to know the answer to that.â\n\nOn Capitol Hill, generations of Republicans have seen a vote for any tax increases as politically perilous. A few of them are still open to taking the risk as they craft a bill extending Trumpâs first-term tax cuts.\n\nâWeâre legitimately looking at, should we adjust the corporate rate from, say, 21% to 23%,â Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., told Semafor.\n\nBut most GOP lawmakers sound like Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., who said simply: âNo, no, no. Negative. I donât believe in raising taxes.â\n\nOne of Clydeâs fellow conservatives, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said heâs never âsupported raising taxes on anybodyâ and would have to look closely at any bid to raise the corporate rate.\n\nBurchett also aired a sentiment thatâs somewhat common among Hill Republicans: Simply making good on their bigger promises as a party, as opposed to any specific populist agenda, will be enough to keep working-class voters in their corner.\n\nâIf the Republicans will just keep their word â reduce the size of government, fix the wall, reduce our spending, do all those things we said we were going to, decentralize government, close down some of these worthless departments and make some cuts at the Pentagon â I think, if we just do all those things, I think weâll be okay,â Burchett said.\n\nIn this article:\n\nEarly tension is already high between self-styled America-First populists and more tech-friendly conservatives, key camps of Trumpâs base that are broadly led within the MAGA ranks by Bannon and Musk, respectively.\n\nThe first schism came at the end of last month over H-1B visas for highly skilled workers. More immigration-skeptical opponents like Bannon and right-wing agitator Laura Loomer argued that wealthy tech magnates like Musk support the visas because they can bring in foreign workers who cost less, while H-1B backers like Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy touted the benefits to the US from admitting immigrants with higher education.\n\nAfter that Bannon-Musk clash, Trump said heâs âa big believerâ in H-1B visas â a switch from his stance in 2016. That didnât settle things down; more recently, Bannon told an Italian newspaper he would fight to limit the âevilâ Muskâs access to the Trump White House.\n\nBeyond the duoâs personal animus, however, are other opportunities for the broader party to embrace or downplay Bannonâs call for a more working class-friendly GOP.\n\nOne of those chances comes in the form of Trumpâs campaign plan to abolish taxes on tips, which some Republican lawmakers seem open to embracing so long as guardrails are installed to ensure lower-income taxpayers see a benefit.\n\nâYou have to define what is a tipped worker, or else weâll have all of these hotshot lawyers taking tips instead of retainers,â Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., told Semafor.\n\nOther Republicans see a successful extension of Trumpâs 2017 tax cuts, which lowered rates for individuals as well as corporations, as a potential boost to working-class taxpayers thatâs bigger than any of Trumpâs specific pre-election rhetoric.\n\nRep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., noted that âThe average Georgia family makes $75,000 a year. If we do not [extend] the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, theyâre going to have an increase of $1,500 a year.â\n\nAsked about higher taxes on the wealthy, Carter said: âI donât think thatâs a good idea, but, you know, perhaps in some kind of context, it might be.â\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats in Congress have championed extending the child tax credit, which the Trump tax cuts hiked in 2017 and outgoing President Joe Biden later extended. During the 2024 campaign, the parties jostled again to court working-class voters by touting the credit; at the time, Vice President-elect JD Vance said heâd like to raise it to $5,000.\n\nFor Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. â whoâs found common ground with progressive Elizabeth Warren on plans to rein in the pharmaceutical industry and curb bank CEO pay â a bigger child credit is his partyâs best chance to help the working class.\n\nRaising taxes on the wealthy would be âpretty hardâ to get into a party-line tax bill, Hawley told Semafor, and his support for that idea âwould depend on what it is.\n\nâWhat Iâm more interested in is getting very significant tax relief for working people and working families with the child tax credit, right?â he added. âAnd Iâve said to my colleagues, like, Iâm open to other ideas, if theyâve got other better ideas about how to deliver real tax relief to people who are not paying a bunch of income taxes.â\n\nMost tax proposals Republicans are considering will be expensive, and (as is typical) itâs going to be hard to get any bill through Congress. Itâs even tougher to see the party passing one that violates its unofficial code against raising taxes, even on the wealthy and corporations.\n\nWhich, in turn, will put the onus on Democrats to brand the future GOP tax plan as unfriendly to the working class.\n\nBut beyond specific tax clashes, the H-1B visa battle shows that the larger divide between anti-elite populists like Bannon and the Musk wing of the party could end up defining Trumpâs second term.\n\nBurgess Everett contributed.\n\nCorrection: Due to an editing error, this story initially included the wrong title for Vice President-elect JD Vance.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Senior House Republican pushes senators on debt ceiling increase\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nHouse Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith on Wednesday pushed Senate Republicans to abandon their reluctance to raise the debt limit as part of the partyâs sweeping tax and border bill.\n\nSmith has championed House Republicansâ push for a massive party-line measure that would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion while extending President Donald Trumpâs expiring 2017 tax cuts, enacting new tax breaks, adding money for border security and the military, and cutting other federal spending.\n\nBut Senate Republicans, who already passed a budget with a different, narrower approach, are fretting that the hike could âsabotage the whole bill.â\n\nâThey have a larger margin in the Senate than what we do in the House, so they can lose the couple [members] that you just talked about and still pass it,â Smith said onstage at a retirement summit hosted by Semafor alongside BlackRock and the Bipartisan Policy Center. âI think it is imperative that they keep the debt limit in there; that is what President Trump wants.â\n\nThe persistent strategic differences between House and Senate Republicans is a significant hurdle as the partyâs lawmakers race to get a bill to Trumpâs desk by Memorial Day â a deadline that Smith reiterated Wednesday. If Republicans drop the debt ceiling increase from their framework, theyâll have to enlist Democrats to help them raise it separately before the Treasury Department hits its borrowing limit in a few short months.\n\nâThe Democrats are not playing ball with anything right now,â Smith said. âItâs the same way with the debt limit: I think they would love to see the president of the United States being Donald Trump and see a default on our debt.â\n\nThe official point at which the government can no longer pay its bills, known in Washington as the âX-date,â will remain unclear until tax season wraps next month. But Smith pointed out that natural disasters like the California wildfires and Hurricane Helene could mean the deadline comes sooner than anticipated.\n\nâWhen thereâs a natural disaster like what happened there, they have an extension to file their taxes,â Smith said. âIt could make a difference.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nRepublicans on Smithâs committee are holding a pair of marathon meetings this week as they hash out how to extend expiring tax cuts and enact new ones championed by Trump â including tax relief for tips and overtime pay â while still staying within the $4.5 trillion cap that fiscal conservatives signed off on.\n\nâWe spent eight hours, like I said, on Monday; weâll spend eight to 10 hours today,â Smith said. âEverything is being looked at.â\n\nSo far, Smith and other top Republicans are staying tight-lipped about their decision-making.\n\nâI continue to push for R&D; make that permanent,â Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan., told reporters after Mondayâs meeting, in a nod to Republicansâ proposal that companies regain the ability to deduct research and development costs from their taxes the same year.\n\nAnother likely topic: a Senate-led call to create more budgetary wiggle room by letting Republicans count pre-existing tax cuts as having no cost.\n\nâIâm supportive, if the Senate can push that measure; I have serious doubts of whether they have the votes within their own chamber to be able toâ score the Trump tax cuts as cost-free, Smith said. âIâve thought that all along. But if they can deliver that, I welcome that.â\n\nSenators on the tax-writing Finance Committee are also likely to discuss that topic during a White House meeting with Trump thatâs scheduled for Thursday,\n\nMeanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made a cameo at the House Republicansâ meeting on Monday to take questions from members, Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., told reporters.\n\nâIt was a little random,â Kelly said, but âhe handled it really well.â\n\nDemocrats on the Ways and Means Committee arenât involved in drafting the partisan package â but that doesnât mean they arenât paying attention.\n\nRep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., on Tuesday reintroduced a bill alongside Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., that would provide long-term care insurance to qualifying older Americans. He said heâs weighing whether to pitch Smith on including the proposal.\n\nâThereâs an argument that it could go in there, if we could demonstrate between now and then that it will be a big savings in Medicaid,â Suozzi told reporters.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "The battle begins: Republican senators vs. MAGA primary foes\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nRepublican senatorsâ battle against MAGA-inspired primary opponents hoping to win Donald Trumpâs favor officially started days ago in Louisiana, where the first Facebook ads began running for a campaign thatâs two years away.\n\nOne of the ads urged Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy to âsupport Pete Hegsethâ for defense secretary. Another told Republican voters how to encourage Cassidy âto vote for all of Trumpâs nomineesâ â follow state treasurer John Fleming, Cassidyâs brand-new GOP primary challenger.\n\nâIâm openly and publicly supporting all of [Trumpâs] nominees,â Fleming told Semafor. âIt doesnât mean that I necessarily agree with everything theyâve said in the past. But I trust President Trump.â\n\nAs they weigh the president-electâs Cabinet picks, incumbent GOP senators are facing serious pressure to vote his way if they want to avoid tough and costly primary challenges. Trump confirmed as much on Monday, telling reporters that if Republicans are âunreasonable, if theyâre opposing somebody for political reasons or stupid reasons,â then those senators would be primaried.\n\nTrump wonât take office for more than a month, but his comments followed already-intense conservative media pressure and organized calls to Senate offices pushing Republicans to back Trumpâs nominees. The effect of the MAGA-driven campaign is already palpable, but some of the targeted Republicans are taking it in stride.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told Semafor that he is guaranteed to draw a primary challenge in 2026 and that Trump has a âvalid pointâ in asking GOP senators to explain their opposition to Cabinet nominees. Tillis has indicated heâll support any Trump pick who gets out of Senate committees and on to a full vote.\n\nâYou just canât be ânoâ because you want to be âno.â You have to be ânoâ because these questions do not not satisfy in my own mind, that this is the right pick,â Tillis said.\n\nStill, he added that senators deserve space to make decisions: âThe last time I thumbed through the Constitution, I heard it say âadvise and consent,â not âbludgeon and confirm.ââ\n\nCassidy has not come out against any of Trumpâs nominees thus far and expressed confidence they can work together, though Fleming said Louisianaâs GOP voters remain âvery, very angryâ with the senatorâs vote to convict the president-elect in his 2021 impeachment trial. Fleming, who lost a Senate race in 2016, will face Cassidy in a more traditional Republican-on-Republican primary after the state got rid of its top-two âjungleâ system, which more candidates could enter.\n\nHis challenge to Cassidy is a signal of the internal friction that Republican senators might face elsewhere. As former Trump adviser Steve Bannon put it recently: âIf they donât toe the line, they get a MAGA primary â and they will get a MAGA defeat.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nNo GOP senator has lost a primary since 2017, and only Cassidy already faces a well-known challenger so far. Yet Republicans are girding for more as they defend more than 20 seats across the country in 2026.\n\nTheyâll also have to rebuild some political muscle memory. They have a new leader, John Thune of South Dakota, and will have a new chief at their super PAC as Steven Law steps down from the Senate Leadership Fund. Typically, GOP leaders and SLF protect incumbent senators; Thune indicated he will keep that policy, telling Semafor on Tuesday that âwe back incumbents.â\n\nâWeâve got to figure out how to work together. Part of this is politics in the modern era. Primaries are kind of a fact of life for a lot of us,â Thune said.\n\nThe Senate primary threats follow Trumpâs successful challenges to most of his biggest critics in the House after his second impeachment. The tension is particularly acute on behalf of Hegseth, with Bannon and his allies bombarding GOP offices.\n\nâWe gave senators an attitude adjustment,â said Mike Davis, a pro-Trump legal activist whose Article III Project has driven thousands of calls and emails in support of Hegsethâs nomination.\n\nHegseth still is not a lock for Senate confirmation, but his prospects are looking better after that effort. It could be the start of a trend.\n\nâI donât think theyâre gonna have a problem getting nominees across the finish line, at this stage of the game,â said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., another incumbent up for reelection in 2026.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, whoâs also up in two years, said Trumpâs comments on Monday were not âhelpfulâ and that she will do her due diligence on his nominees no matter what: âI may well have a primary challenge, but that does not enter into my calculation on how Iâm going to vote on nominees.â\n\nShe generally hasnât faced primary challenges in the past, as the only GOP senator representing a reliably blue state, but Collins said she takes the prospect seriously.\n\nâPrimaries are tricky. Turnout can be small, you know, so I never take anything for granted,â she told Semafor.\n\nTrump has helped purge his critics from the House and played kingmaker in some Senate primaries. Thatâs encouraged conservative activists to keep their sights trained on incumbent senators despite recent struggles against them.\n\nJoshua Smith, a libertarian-turned-Republican whoâs mounting an uphill challenge to Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said that he got in the race because of her support for foreign military aid to Ukraine and Israel.\n\nâIowa went to bat for Trump, big time,â Smith told Semafor. He said he has messaged Donald Trump, Jr. about the race but has not heard back yet.\n\nErnstâs failure to embrace Hegseth immediately, he added, âwas really stupid for her political career.â\n\nBack in North Carolina, outgoing Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson polled his X followers on whether Tillis should be the partyâs 2026 Senate nominee. Robinsonâs conclusion, even after losing the gubernatorial race by 15 points last month? âThom is toast.â\n\nIn an interview, Tillis quickly dismissed Robinsonâs scandal-tarred record as a deal-breaker in a primary: âI donât think I have to prepare for Mark Robinson. Mark Robinsonâs record is enough for me. Itâs content-rich.â\n\nHe also downplayed the idea that Lara Trump would run against him in North Carolina because of her prospects of securing a Senate appointment in Florida.\n\nThe biggest risk for Republicans is that MAGA-driven primaries will hurt their chances to hold onto Senate control, an outcome that Democrats certainly donât mind.\n\nâMost of these nominees are bad news for anyone who wants to run for statewide office,â said North Carolina Rep. Wiley Nickel, a Democrat whoâs looking at a 2026 run for Tillisâ seat. âIf you support any of these far-right extremist candidates, you should be held to account by the voters.â\n\nRep. Troy Carter, D-La., said Cassidyâs impeachment vote was âcourageous,â and one he knew would complicate his re-election: âThe president-elect has demonstrated that he goes after his enemies.â\n\nThe last GOP senator to lose a primary was Alabamaâs Luther Strange, who fell to Roy Moore even though Trump had endorsed Strange. But the world, and the GOP, have changed since then: Loyalty to the incoming president has overwhelmed nearly any other potential litmus test for Republican candidates.\n\nSo it would be a mistake to look at this cycleâs crop of aspiring primary challengers as a MAGA version of the Tea Party. Weâre more likely to see most incumbent Republican senators edge closer to Trumpâs camp â a subtle way to address the opposition.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

Read it now .\n\nThe top Senate GOP super PAC is pouring $6.6 million into Wisconsinâs Senate race, clear proof that Republicans are trying to expandÂ theirÂ once-narrow campaign map less than a month before Election Day.\n\nThe Senate Leadership Fund shared its new spending first with Semafor; the super PAC aligned with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is now on track to spend $23.6 million overall on ousting Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.). Itâs a striking sum given that, up until a few months ago, RepublicansÂ sawÂ BaldwinÂ as relativelyÂ safe against their challenger, businessman Eric Hovde.\n\nWhatâs changed since then? The tightening presidential race in Wisconsin, which has Republicans thinking Baldwin could lose if Donald Trump can pull off a win in the state.Â Baldwinâs home-state Republican colleague, Sen. Ron Johnson, has also been asking for outside help to defeat her.\n\nâWeâre finding that a lot of Wisconsin voters had no idea how far-left Tammy Baldwin has drifted after almost 30 years in Congress. Our messages are resonating at the same time that Eric Hovde is consolidating his vote,â said Steven Law, president of the super PAC.\n\nDemocratsâ 51-49 Senate majority is at serious risk next month. The party is certain to lose a seat in West Virginia, Republican Tim Sheehy is leading Sen. Jon Tester in Montana and Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing a stiff challenge in Ohio.\n\nWisconsin is in the second tier of Senate races this fall, along with Pennsylvania and Michigan. Republican wins there would mean a red wave that sweeps the chamber to a hefty majority for Trumpâs party. Still, Democrats are generally leading the polls in all of those Senate races, and Republican challengers are generally lagging behind Trump.\n\nThe McConnell-linked super PAC is now spending tens of millions of dollars across five races: Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The lack of activity so far in Nevada and Arizona reflects the steeper climbs for GOP candidates against Sen. Jacky Rosen and Rep. Ruben Gallego, respectively.\n\nSenate Majority PAC, the largest Democratic outside group, purchased a new tranche of ads this week in all seven of this fallâs biggest battlegrounds, plus Maryland. Though the Senate Democratic campaign arm is investing in defeating both Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Rick Scott, neither partyâs big super PAC has gotten involved.\n\nFlorida and Texas are Democratsâ best pick-up opportunities for Senate seats despite being red states.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "âThe million-dollar question:â Trumpâs populist economic promises meet Republican skepticism\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nDonald Trump won a majority of voters without college degrees last November in part by promising a presidency that would bring âeconomic relief to our citizens.â\n\nNow comes the hard part.\n\nTrumpâs arrival in office comes at a tipping point for a Republican Party heâs reshaped in his image. Heâs outlined a number of populist economic goals, vowing to get rid of taxes on tips and overtime pay while weighing a âsignificant expansionâ of the child tax credit and new tariffs that he sees as a boon to US manufacturing. His populist allies have gone further: Steve Bannon told Semafor last month that it was time to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations.\n\nBut Trump is now avidly pursuing new corporate partners and investments that line up with a fiercely pro-business âÂ and conventional âÂ Republican agenda, hosting tech industry chiefs at Mar-a-Lago as he forges a close alliance with Elon Musk and rolls out a $100 billion SoftBank investment. The contrast between Trumpâs pro-working class talk and his pro-business actions has some of his own supporters asking whether any of his more populist ideas will end up becoming real administration policies.\n\nThe choice between those visions is âthe million-dollar question, and in my opinion the top story,â one person in Trumpâs orbit told Semafor. âBecause, to answer anything else, weâve got to know the answer to that.â\n\nOn Capitol Hill, generations of Republicans have seen a vote for any tax increases as politically perilous. A few of them are still open to taking the risk as they craft a bill extending Trumpâs first-term tax cuts.\n\nâWeâre legitimately looking at, should we adjust the corporate rate from, say, 21% to 23%,â Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., told Semafor.\n\nBut most GOP lawmakers sound like Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., who said simply: âNo, no, no. Negative. I donât believe in raising taxes.â\n\nOne of Clydeâs fellow conservatives, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said heâs never âsupported raising taxes on anybodyâ and would have to look closely at any bid to raise the corporate rate.\n\nBurchett also aired a sentiment thatâs somewhat common among Hill Republicans: Simply making good on their bigger promises as a party, as opposed to any specific populist agenda, will be enough to keep working-class voters in their corner.\n\nâIf the Republicans will just keep their word â reduce the size of government, fix the wall, reduce our spending, do all those things we said we were going to, decentralize government, close down some of these worthless departments and make some cuts at the Pentagon â I think, if we just do all those things, I think weâll be okay,â Burchett said.\n\nIn this article:\n\nEarly tension is already high between self-styled America-First populists and more tech-friendly conservatives, key camps of Trumpâs base that are broadly led within the MAGA ranks by Bannon and Musk, respectively.\n\nThe first schism came at the end of last month over H-1B visas for highly skilled workers. More immigration-skeptical opponents like Bannon and right-wing agitator Laura Loomer argued that wealthy tech magnates like Musk support the visas because they can bring in foreign workers who cost less, while H-1B backers like Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy touted the benefits to the US from admitting immigrants with higher education.\n\nAfter that Bannon-Musk clash, Trump said heâs âa big believerâ in H-1B visas â a switch from his stance in 2016. That didnât settle things down; more recently, Bannon told an Italian newspaper he would fight to limit the âevilâ Muskâs access to the Trump White House.\n\nBeyond the duoâs personal animus, however, are other opportunities for the broader party to embrace or downplay Bannonâs call for a more working class-friendly GOP.\n\nOne of those chances comes in the form of Trumpâs campaign plan to abolish taxes on tips, which some Republican lawmakers seem open to embracing so long as guardrails are installed to ensure lower-income taxpayers see a benefit.\n\nâYou have to define what is a tipped worker, or else weâll have all of these hotshot lawyers taking tips instead of retainers,â Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., told Semafor.\n\nOther Republicans see a successful extension of Trumpâs 2017 tax cuts, which lowered rates for individuals as well as corporations, as a potential boost to working-class taxpayers thatâs bigger than any of Trumpâs specific pre-election rhetoric.\n\nRep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., noted that âThe average Georgia family makes $75,000 a year. If we do not [extend] the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, theyâre going to have an increase of $1,500 a year.â\n\nAsked about higher taxes on the wealthy, Carter said: âI donât think thatâs a good idea, but, you know, perhaps in some kind of context, it might be.â\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats in Congress have championed extending the child tax credit, which the Trump tax cuts hiked in 2017 and outgoing President Joe Biden later extended. During the 2024 campaign, the parties jostled again to court working-class voters by touting the credit; at the time, Vice President-elect JD Vance said heâd like to raise it to $5,000.\n\nFor Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. â whoâs found common ground with progressive Elizabeth Warren on plans to rein in the pharmaceutical industry and curb bank CEO pay â a bigger child credit is his partyâs best chance to help the working class.\n\nRaising taxes on the wealthy would be âpretty hardâ to get into a party-line tax bill, Hawley told Semafor, and his support for that idea âwould depend on what it is.\n\nâWhat Iâm more interested in is getting very significant tax relief for working people and working families with the child tax credit, right?â he added. âAnd Iâve said to my colleagues, like, Iâm open to other ideas, if theyâve got other better ideas about how to deliver real tax relief to people who are not paying a bunch of income taxes.â\n\nMost tax proposals Republicans are considering will be expensive, and (as is typical) itâs going to be hard to get any bill through Congress. Itâs even tougher to see the party passing one that violates its unofficial code against raising taxes, even on the wealthy and corporations.\n\nWhich, in turn, will put the onus on Democrats to brand the future GOP tax plan as unfriendly to the working class.\n\nBut beyond specific tax clashes, the H-1B visa battle shows that the larger divide between anti-elite populists like Bannon and the Musk wing of the party could end up defining Trumpâs second term.\n\nBurgess Everett contributed.\n\nCorrection: Due to an editing error, this story initially included the wrong title for Vice President-elect JD Vance.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "How Conservatives Changed the Whole Point of American Political Parties\n\nT he Republican Party of 2024 belongs to Donald Trump and to MAGA. But the populist right once viewed the GOP very differently.\n\nAt the second annual Conservative Political Action Conference in 1975, attendees debated whether they should junk and replace the GOP. One speaker advocating for the move called parties \"no more than instruments, temporary and disposable, by which like-minded citizens can express their views.\" The conference passed a resolution declaring that \"the question of our allegiance to [the two major] political parties is a matter of increasing doubt to conservatives.\"\n\nThough a proposed third-party venture went nowhere fast, it reflected the right's distinctive, cold-eyed approach to the party form. Parties, conservatives thought, served solely as a disposable means to an end, rather than as valuable organizations and instruments of democracy in their own right. And when the forces on the right captured and remade the GOP in their own image beginning in the 1970s, the result was a retreat from the very commitments that had made political parties central pillars of small-d democratic and small-r republican politics. In that sense, the crisis roiling American democracy in 2024 is a half-century in the making.\n\nAs conservatives transformed the GOP, they obliterated an older model of Republicanism. In the middle of the 20th century, GOP organizations at their best had functioned as civic institutions rooted in communities. Conservative in form as much as substance, they focused on problem-solving in government, and worked to contain and channel political conflict rather than exacerbating it. Such Republican Party organizations reflected the interests and stewardship of local social and economic elites. The political scientist Clinton Rossiter evoked the \"Republican self-image\" at midcentury as \"men of standing and sobriety...sound without being callous.\"\n\nParty politics, in this approach, meant organizing social actors into tempered, pragmatic leadership, not serving up grand clashes of worldviews or all-out warfare across social divides. As such, Republican party work and governance emphasized limits in both the exercise of politics and the activity of government.\n\nRay Bliss, longtime Ohio Republican leader - and then in the 1960s, Republican National Committee chair-typified this approach. To build up GOP organizations, he would cross-check voter registration rolls with membership lists for service clubs like the Kiwanis and Rotarians, chambers of commerce, and country clubs. Averse to ideological infighting or even explicit comment on policy issues, Bliss summed up his own vision of Republicanism in power in 1960: \"government which is efficient, yet economical; government that is alert to the changing times, yet guided by common sense; government which is compassionate to the needs of the people, yet wise in the execution of programs to meet those needs.\"\n\nRising conservative activists disdained this approach as both milquetoast and politically ineffective. Seeing politics as fundamentally rooted in conflict, they moved to exploit grievance and status resentments-\"knowing who hates who,\" as the future Nixon aide Kevin Phillips had put it in 1968-to polarize politics.\n\nOrganizational changes to politics in the 1970s set the stage for that approach to overtake the older model of parties. Interest groups, think tanks, and lobbying shops encroached on the activity of both major political parties while a new campaign finance system channeled money outside of the party apparatuses. As the formal Republican Party's clout waned, outside groups ranging from the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC) to the National Right to Work Committee to the Moral Majority filled the breach. And even as they swamped the traditional party from the outside, conservative activists also used this network of groups to remake the GOP from the precinct level up. \"Conservatism is the wine,\" William Rusher, publisher of National Review , liked to say, \"the GOP is the bottle.\"\n\nConservative leaders like Rusher and Paul Weyrich saw how this burgeoning political infrastructure offered the opportunity to forge a new conservative electoral coalition. They aimed to capitalize on the growing resentments among white Americans over social and cultural issues ranging from legalized abortion to busing children to achieve racially integrated schools. Working together, a range of outside groups could mobilize the rising resentment and supplant the GOP establishment. In 1972, Weyrich launched weekly strategy meetings that would grow to include staffers from political groups like NCPAC, religious right groups, and business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers. Where conservatives had once eyed one another with suspicion, they now had a template for cooperation.\n\nThe activists' most critical move was recruiting disgruntled white evangelicals, especially in the South-most of them former Democrats-into the conservative fold. The fervid language of sexual morality had long colored conservative politics. Now it came tethered to new issues and networks. A deacon in the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, Weyrich always attached deep importance to abortion and homosexuality-and saw early on how they could bring together Catholics and (white) evangelicals.\n\nEventually, Christian Right pastors would deploy the same tactics as Weyrich and his fellow activists to mobilize resentment. \"We need an emotionally charged issue to stir people up and get them mad enough to get up from watching TV and do something,\" Bob Billings of the newly launched Moral Majority explained. \"I believe that the homosexual issue is the issue we should use.\" Especially on these cultural issues, women like the Catholic Phyllis Schlafly and the Evangelical Beverly LaHaye also contributed to the explosion of outside conservative groups.\n\nThis activism took advantage of the new post-Watergate limits on individual contributions to formal parties and candidates. Those restrictions opened up space for political action committees (PACs), which could rake in big money from small-dollar donors motivated to give by sensationalist direct mail focused on hot button cultural issues. NCPAC's chairman Terry Dolan cheerfully prophesied a politics unmoored from the lines of accountability that had long restrained parties and candidates alike. \"A group like ours could lie through its teeth,\" he said in 1980, \"and the candidate it helps stays clean.\"\n\nOne moment epitomized the clash between dueling visions of political action. At a testy breakfast on May 19, 1981, Richard Richards, chair of the Republican National Committee, confronted a who's who from the right, ranging from Dolan, Weyrich, and Schlafly to the billionaire oilman and John Birch Society member Bunker Hunt. Richards, a conservative but tradition-minded political operative, complained about the independent groups making mischief where the GOP did not want them. Their lavish advertising campaigns and repeated interventions in primaries usurped the traditional roles of the party. They were, Richards scolded, like \"loose cannonballs on the deck of a ship.\"\n\nNonsense, responded John Lofton, editor of the Conservative Digest. If he attacked those fighting hardest for Ronald Reagan and his tax cuts, it was Richards himself who was the loose cannonball.\n\nRichards was a more doctrinaire conservative than earlier party chairmen like Bliss. But he continued to hew to the classic organizational model, with its lines of accountability and authority, that had defined the political party for a century and a half. \"If I'm the chairman of the party and I have responsibility for a campaign in a given area,\" he argued, \"I don't want someone else coming in and interfering with my strategy.\" Richards later attempted to forge a \"non-interference agreement\" by which conservative organizations would pledge to stay out of races where Republican candidates or state chairs asked them to stand down.\n\nNCPAC rejected the request-and deemed Richards's complaints the purist of establishment claptrap. Dolan asserted that party operatives \"don't give a damn what registered Republicans think.\" They cared only \"about their contributors.\" The truth was that now that the right had its own machinery, financial clout, and connection with GOP base voters, formal parties were in no position to make demands.\n\nOver the ensuing decades, as the right's issues became the party's, so did its operatives, activists, and political approach. Thus did the conservative loose cannonballs come eventually to dominate the GOP-and define our disordered political era.\n\nParties at their best safeguard democracy, linking the governed with their government and instilling norms of forbearance. When parties fall short of those virtues, democracy itself is threatened. As the right has moved from Tea Party to MAGA in recent years, its longstanding mercenary, win-at-all-costs approach has shifted in disturbing new directions, dismissing not just the authority of political parties, but the very project of building electoral majorities themselves. Consumed by apocalyptic fears of a changing American electorate, Republicans have turned to and relied on the features of the American political system that frustrate popular majorities: the courts, the malapportioned Senate with its 60-vote filibuster rule, gerrymandering, and a politicized voting process.\n\nPerhaps the signal moment for the impulse that began to break down the traditional controls on American politics in the 1970s came with the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection. With mob violence, the right all-but-openly declared that electoral victories by the enemy did not count and countenanced any measures necessary to stop them. The fundamental criterion of democracy, that the losers accept their losses and fight again, no longer held-just another fetter to discard, as \"temporary and disposable\" as the fetters of party.\n\nDaniel Schlozman is associate professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University.

      "text": "Republicans Maintain House Majority, Clinching Trifecta of Government Control\n\nI n yet another blow to Democrats, Donald Trump will begin his presidency with a trifecta of Republican control in Washington . The GOP not only regained control of the White House and the Senate but also managed to hold onto a narrow majority in the House, the Associated Press called late Wednesday, more than a week after voters headed to the polls .\n\nThe victory in the House will have significant ramifications for the start of Trump's second term, allowing the President-elect and his allies to push forward with their full legislative agenda now that both chambers of Congress are under Republican control until at least 2026. While their priorities are still being outlined, Republicans will be positioned to confirm Trump's appointees, pass tax reform, fund border security, overhaul the Affordable Care Act, and legislate other parts of their agenda.\n\nRepublicans were able to maintain control of the House thanks to wins in key battleground races where they defended vulnerable seats and expanded their reach in Democratic-held districts. In Pennsylvania, Republicans flipped two competitive seats despite a tough campaign from Democrats seeking to capitalize on high-profile issues such as reproductive rights. Republicans also flipped a competitive seat in Colorado and an open seat in Michigan, the latter after Democratic incumbent Rep. Elissa Slotkin ran in the state's Senate race, which she won. In Arizona, Iowa, and Nebraska-which had some of the most competitive 2024 House races-GOP incumbents appear to have fended off strong challenges from Democrats. And Republicans look to buffer their margin in California, where votes continue to be counted in several close races, while the GOP could flip another seat in Alaska, where the ranked-choice race for the state's only congressional district remains too early to call.\n\nWhile Republicans are celebrating their victory, the party's razor-thin majority-even thinner after multiple members vacate their seats to join the Trump administration -and internal divisions could create challenges in the years ahead. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who was with Trump on Election Night and ascended to the role after a tumultuous leadership battle last year, faces the difficult task of unifying the caucus as it prepares to tackle major legislative issues. One of the GOP's most pressing concerns will be the potential for political gridlock if the party's far-right members clash with moderates on key pieces of legislation, particularly on issues like government spending.\n\nBut now that Republicans control the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives, they have a historic opportunity to reshape key aspects of U.S. policy. Republican leaders will push for additional tax cuts, particularly for businesses and high-income earners, building on the tax cuts passed during Trump's first term and making them permanent. One of Trump's signature issues, immigration reform, is also expected to take center stage. Republicans are likely to seek additional funding for border security and enforcement measures, including the construction of a border wall and tighter restrictions on immigration.\n\nIn March, Johnson said House Republicans would pursue \"aggressive\" and \"radical changes\" in the first 100 days of a Republican trifecta. He said on Oct. 28 that there would be \"massive\" health care changes in America. \"Health care reform's going to be a big part of the agenda. When I say we're going to have a very aggressive first 100 days agenda, we got a lot of things still on the table,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans could push to repeal or overhaul the Affordable Care Act (ACA), a central campaign promise for Trump and the GOP, potentially replacing it with a more market-driven system. Republicans could also press forward with conservative social policies, including measures limiting abortion access and enhancing religious freedom protections-setting up a clash with Democrats in the coming months. (Trump has lately said that abortion policy should be set by the states.)\n\nStill, the road ahead will not be smooth. Even with a Republican trifecta, the GOP will face intense scrutiny, particularly from Democrats and progressive groups, who will continue to fight for their policies in the courts, the Senate, and in state legislatures.\n\nWrite to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com"

      "text": "The Republicans Crossing Party Lines and Voting for Harris Over Trump\n\nW ith the general election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump upon us, endorsements from high-profile figures hold much significance. Especially those that involve crossing party lines. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican and the former Governor of California, spoke out on Wednesday, Oct. 30, in a post on X (formerly Twitter), endorsing Harris over Trump. He joins a growing number of Republicans who have decided to vote Democrat this November.\n\nHere is a list of the prominent Republicans crossing party lines and voting for Harris over Trump in the 2024 election:\n\nActor and former Governor of California Schwarzenegger endorsed Democratic nominee Harris for President over his fellow Republican, Trump, in a lengthy social media post . Schwarzenegger said he does not typically give endorsements, as he doesn't \"trust most politicians,\" but he understands why people want to know his opinions since he is \"not just a celebrity,\" but also a former Governor.\n\n\"To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America is a [sic] trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious,\" he wrote. \"And I will always be an American before I am a Republican. That's why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\"\n\n\"I'm sharing it with all of you because I think there are a lot of you who feel like I do,\" he elaborated. \"You don't recognize our country. And you are right to be furious.\"\n\nOn Sept. 6, Former Vice President and influential Republican Dick Cheney released a statement announcing his endorsement of Harris for President. Speaking out against the Republican nominee, Cheney said that Trump can \"never be trusted with power again.\"\n\nCheney, who served as Vice President under President George W. Bush between 2001 and 2009, went on to say that American citizens have a \"duty\" to prioritize the nation over partisan politics.\n\n\"In our nation's 248 year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" Cheney said in his statement. \"He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,\" he continued, referencing the events of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nDick Cheney's endorsement came a week after his daughter, former Wyoming Republican Representative Liz Cheney said that she'd vote for Harris.\n\n\"As a conservative and someone who believes in and cares deeply about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this. And because of the danger that Donald Trump poses-not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris,\" Cheney said on Sept. 4 at a Sanford School of Public Policy event at Duke University in North Carolina.\n\nCheney served as vice-chair of the Jan. 6 committee and was one of two Republicans on the panel-something that Trump called to have her jailed for.\n\nFormer Illinois Rep. and Republican Adam Kinzinger became a staunch critic of Trump after the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and spoke about endorsing Harris on the Democratic National Convention (DNC) stage in Chicago in August. He encouraged other Republicans who wish to \"defend democracy and decency\" to do the same.\n\n\"I was a Republican for 12 years in Congress, and I still hold on to the label,\" he said. \"I know Kamala Harris shares my allegiance to the rule of law, the Constitution, and democracy, and she is dedicated to upholding all three in service to our country.\"\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the businessman who served as White House Director of Communications under Trump for 10 days in 2017, endorsed Harris, and has even said he is working alongside Harris on her campaign's crypto policies.\n\n\"Kamala Harris is capable and has a great team,\" he said in July, via a social media post.\n\nFormer Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan spoke at the DNC, arguing that he stands in front of the crowd \"as an American\" though he is a Republican too. He focused his speech on other Republicans who may be watching, saying that the \"party is not civil or conservative. It's chaotic and crazy.\" Duncan referred to Trump as a \"direct threat to democracy.\"\n\n\"To my fellow Republicans at home that want to pivot back towards policy, empathy, and tone, you know the right thing to do. Now let's have the courage to do it in November,\" he said.\n\nRepublican former Senator and Arizona representative Jeff Flake posted a statement to X on Sept. 29, announcing his support of the Harriz-Walz ticket, though he still calls himself a \"conservative Republican.\" He noted that he served with both Harris and Walz in Congress and that he knows \"first hand\" how much they love America.\n\n\"I want to support a Presidential candidate who seeks to unite our country rather than one who divides us,\" he wrote. \"In times like these, there is nothing more conservative than putting country over party.\"\n\nMore than 200 Republicans who worked for both Bush Presidents, the late Sen. John McCain, and Sen. Mitt Romney released an open letter in August, declaring endorsement of Harris.\n\nIn their letter, which was first reported by USA Today, the former staff members wrote that they were reiterating the 2020 decision by George W. Bush, McCain, and Romney alumni to \"warn\" against re-electing Trump. Now, they are \"reuniting\" to endorse Harris in 2024.\n\n\"Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That's to be expected,\" they wrote. \"The alternative, however, is simply untenable.\"\n\nFormer Attorney General Alberto Gonzales endorsed Harris in an opinion piece published by Politico on Sept. 12.\n\n\"As the United States approaches a critical election, I can't sit quietly as Donald Trump-perhaps the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation-eyes a return to the White House,\" he wrote, pointing specifically to the events of Jan. 6. \"For that reason, though I'm a Republican, I've decided to support Kamala Harris for President.\"\n\nFormer Representative Denver Riggleman, who represented Virginia as a Republican, has endorsed Harris. In an appearance on Bloomberg TV on Aug. 9, Riggleman said: \"What's really going on is I think truth and facts need to be the baseline for this election. You can't have an inveterate liar as President of the United States... It's not about policy but the real reasons why Republicans should have the permission structure to vote for the Democratic ticket.\"\n\nFormer Michigan Republican Congressman Fred Upton, who served for three decades in the House of Representatives, endorsed Harris on Oct. 24\n\n\"Watching Trump day after day, he's ignored the advice of many senior, respected Republicans to stay on the issues,\" Upton told The Detroit News . \"Instead, he's still talking about the election being stolen, trashing women left and right. He's just totally unhinged. We don't need this chaos. We need to move forward, and that's why I'm where I am.\"\n\nUpton retired in 2022 after voting to impeach Trump the year before.\n\nFormer New Hampshire Attorney General, Republican Tom Rath spoke to a local news station during the final week of October, stating that this is an \"extraordinary moment in our history,\" and explaining his endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I think this is an election that completely oversteps any partisan identification,\" Rath said. \"This is not a Republican vote or a Democratic vote. This is a vote that speaks to what we want ourselves to be and what we want our government to be.\"\n\nFormer New Hampshire Sen. Gordon Humphrey also shared strong words against Trump.\n\n\"He's dangerous to our safety, dangerous to peace, dangerous to democracy and freedom,\" Humphrey, who served two terms in the Senate from 1979-1990, said in the same local news interview with Rath. \"I voted for Republicans for more than 50 years. I can't vote for Trump, as a father, as a grandfather, as a veteran, as a former U.S. Senator.\"\n\nFormer Trump White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who also served as Melania Trump's Chief of Staff, appeared at the DNC, where she shared that Harris \"has [her] vote.\"\n\nAt the convention, Grisham-who resigned after Jan 6.-took to the stage and said she felt  \"very strongly\" about speaking out.\n\n\"I love my country more than my party,\" Grisham said. \"Kamala Harris tells the truth. She respects the American people and she has my vote.\"\n\nJimmy McCain, son of former Arizona Senator and Republican presidential candidate John McCain, endorsed Harris in September, also stating that he had changed his voter registration to Democrat.\n\n\"She'll bring everyone together. She'll bring that moderation, that bipartisanship that we've been missing for so long,\" McCain told 12 News on Sept. 8, sharing that the Trump campaign's conduct at Arlington National Cemetery was what instigated his Harris endorsement.\n\nState Senator for Wisconsin's 2nd District, Republican Robert Cowles called Trump a \"totalitarian\" in an interview with Rational Revolution on Oct. 24 , and stated he would be voting for Harris.\n\nCowles said he is \"ready\" for the blowback of publicly announcing his decision. \"We have to make a change here and Trump has to be defeated and we have to protect the Constitution and the country will go on, even with some liberal things that Harris might do,\" he said.\n\nJohn Giles, Republican mayor of Mesa, Arizona, shared his endorsement of Harris in an opinion piece for the Arizona Republic in July. Giles has been Mayor of the third largest city in Arizona, a notable swing state in the upcoming election, since 2014.\n\n\"The Republican Party with Trump at its helm continues down the path of political extremism, away from focusing on our fundamental freedoms,\" Giles wrote in the op-ed. He went on to argue that Trump did not support Arizona cities and that Harris is the \"competent, just, and fair leader\" that the country \"deserves.\"\n\nFormer Director of National Intelligence under President George W. Bush, John Negroponte announced his support for Harris in a September letter signed by over 100 former national security officials from Republican Administrations and former Republican members of Congress.\n\nIn the letter, the signatories wrote that they \"expect to disagree with Kamala Harris on many domestic and foreign policy issues,\" but they still \"believe she possesses the essential qualities to serve as President and Donald Trump does not.\"\n\nWilliam Webster, former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) under Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, was another  signatory of the letter with Negroponte.\n\nThe letter also said that they \"firmly oppose the election of Donald Trump,\" arguing that as President he \"promoted daily chaos in government, praised our enemies and undermined our allies, politicized the military and disparaged our veterans.\"\n\nOlivia Troye, former homeland security and counterterrorism advisor to former Vice President Mike Pence, also signed the letter with Webster and Negroponte, endorsing Harris.\n\nBeyond that, Troye-who left the Trump-led White House in 2020-spoke at the DNC. There, she urged fellow Republicans to vote for Harris.\n\n\"To my fellow Republicans: you aren't voting for a Democrat, you're voting for democracy,\" she said. \"You aren't betraying your party, you're standing up for our country.\"\n\nTroye also wrote an opinion piece for MSNBC in which she called herself a \"lifelong Republican,\" but added that for President, there is \"only one option: Vice President Kamala Harris.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Senate GOP Approves Framework for Trump's Tax Breaks and Spending Cuts After Late-Night Session\n\nAP\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., joined by Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., the GOP whip, left, talks to reporters at the Capitol, in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, April 1, 2025.\n\nAP\n\nW ASHINGTON - Senate Republicans plugged away overnight and into early Saturday morning to approve their multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts framework, hurtling past Democratic opposition toward what President Donald Trump calls the \"big, beautiful bill\" that's central to his agenda.\n\nThe vote, 51-48, fell along mostly party lines, but with sharp dissent from two prominent Republicans. It could not have come at a more difficult political moment, with the economy churning after Trump's new tariffs sent stocks plummeting and experts warning of soaring costs for consumers and threats of a potential recession. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky both voted against the measure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with a nod from Trump, GOP leaders held on. Approval paves the way for Republicans in the months ahead to try to power a tax cut bill through both chambers of Congress over the objections of Democrats, just as they did in Trump's first term with unified party control in Washington.\n\n\"Let the voting begin,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Friday night.\n\nDemocrats were intent on making the effort as politically painful as possible, with action on some two dozen amendments to the package that GOP senators will have to defend before next year's midterm elections.\n\nAmong them were proposals to ban tax breaks for the super-wealthy, end Trump's tariffs, clip his efforts to shrink the federal government, and protect Medicaid, Social Security and other services. One, in response to the Trump national security team's use of Signal, sought to prohibit military officials from using any commercial messaging application to transmit war plans. They all failed, though a GOP amendment to protect Medicare and Medicaid was accepted.\n\nDemocrats accused Republicans of laying the groundwork for cutting key safety net programs to help pay for more than $5 trillion tax cuts they say disproportionately benefit the rich.\n\n\"Trump's policies are a disaster,\" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, as is Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, he added. \"Republicans could snuff it out tonight, if they wanted.\"\n\nThe Republicans framed their work as preventing a tax increase for most American families, arguing that unless Congress acts, the individual and estate tax cuts that GOP lawmakers passed in 2017 will expire at the end of this year.\n\nThe Senate package pulls in other GOP priorities, including $175 billion to bolster Trump's mass deportation effort, which is running short of cash, and an additional $175 billion for the Pentagon to build up the military, from an earlier budget effort.\n\nWyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 ranking Republican, said voters gave his party a mission in November, and the Senate's budget plan delivers.\n\n\"It fulfills our promises to secure the border, to rebuild our economy and to restore peace through strength,\" Barrasso said.\n\nThe framework now goes to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., could bring it up for a vote as soon as next week as he works toward a final product by Memorial Day.\n\nThe House and Senate need to resolve their differences. The House's version has $4.5 trillion in tax breaks over 10 years and some $2 trillion in budget cuts, and pointed at changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other programs. Some House Republicans have panned the Senate's approach.\n\nRepublican senators used their majority to swat back Democratic amendments, often in rambunctious voice votes.\n\nAmong the more than two dozen amendments offered were several to protect safety net programs. Several Republicans, including Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, joined Democrats in voting to preserve some of those programs, particularly regarding health care. Collins opposed the entire package in a warning against steep Medicaid cuts.\n\nCollins said the potential reductions for that health program in the House bill \"would be very detrimental to a lot of families and disabled individuals and seniors in my state.\"\n\nPaul questioned the math being used by his colleagues that he said would pile on the debt load. \"Something's fishy,\" he said.\n\nOne Republican, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, expressed his own misgivings about tax breaks adding to the federal deficits and said he has assurances that Trump officials would seek the cuts elsewhere.\n\n\"This vote isn't taking place in a vacuum,\" he said, a nod to the turmoil over Trump's tariffs.\n\nOne crucial challenge ahead will be for the House to accept the way the Senate's budget plan allows for extending the tax cuts under a scoring method that treats them as not adding to future deficits, something many House Republicans reject. A new estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation projects the tax breaks will add $5.5 trillion over the next decade when including interest, and $4.6 trillion not including interest.\n\nOn top of that, the senators added an additional $1.5 trillion that would allow some of Trump's campaign promises, such as no taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and overtime, swelling the overall the price tag to $7 trillion.\n\nRepublicans are also looking to increase the $10,000 deduction for state and local taxes, something that lawmakers from states such as New York, California and New Jersey say is necessary for their support.\n\nThe House and Senate are also at odds over increasing the debt limit to allow more borrowing. The House had boosted the debt limit by $4 trillion in its plan, but the Senate upped it to $5 trillion to push any further votes on the matter until after next year's midterm elections.\n\nThe Senate calls for just $4 billion in spending cuts, but GOP leadership emphasizes that's a low floor and that committees will be on the hunt for far more.\n\nAlready, the GOP leaders are confronting concerns from fiscal hawks who want trillions of dollars in spending cuts to help pay for the tax breaks. At the same time, dozens of lawmakers in swing districts and states are worried about what those cuts will mean for their constituents, and for their reelection chances.\n\nThe GOP leadership has encouraged members to just get a budget plan over the finish line, saying they have time to work out the tough questions of which tax breaks and spending cuts to include.\n\nExtending the the 2017 breaks would cut taxes for about three-quarters of households but raise them for about 10%. In 2027, about 45% of the benefit of all the tax cuts would go to those making roughly $450,000 or more, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, which analyzes tax issues.\n\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

      "text": "Congress Is Freaking Out About Trump's Trade War, But Not Enough to Stop Him\n\nSenior Correspondent\n\nSenior Correspondent\n\nThis article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nA fast-spreading panic hit Capitol Hill on Thursday, as President Donald Trump's trade war prompted markets to suffer their worst day since the onset of the pandemic in 2020 and analysts were predicting the worst was yet to come.\n\nWhile most Hill Republicans tried to avoid criticizing their party's leader, frustrations were being laid bare as their talking points didn't match those coming out of the White House. Lawmakers were insisting Trump's new tariffs are a starting point for a negotiation while the White House said they're actually the end of the discussion. Frantic calls to Cabinet agencies about home-district impacts were yielding platitudes and not promises. Even give-Trump-a-chance Republicans began losing patience as their office phone lines were on fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump's stated goal is to force businesses to make their wares on U.S. soil, in theory sparking a renaissance in domestic manufacturing. Economists are highly skeptical, but even Trump's apologists worry that the short-term ramp-up is going to be rough. Midterm elections seldom reward the party holding the White House even in the best of times, and Republicans are quickly realizing that Trump's kitchen-table chaos may end up tanking their hopes for retaining control of Congress next year.\n\n\"None of this was thought through,\" says one Republican lobbyist who is trying to tell her association's members not to panic. \"The math doesn't work. The end game doesn't work. The politics doesn't work. This is just a mess and it is going to cost Republicans seats.\"\n\nNot too long ago, Congress would have had some say in the tariffs levied on other countries. But Trump is calling the trade imbalance between domestic markets and its international partners as a national emergency to avail himself of powers that allow him, without any real check, to impose these tariffs. The result is set to be a minimum 10% tax on most goods coming into the country and climbing to a net 79% charge on some stuff coming in from China.\n\nPut plainly: this was not the trade rebalancing Hill Republicans would have drafted had they been consulted. Just don't expect things to move in any meaningful way against Trump's orders any time soon, no matter how steamed they are.\n\nA handful of Republicans were motioning to curb Trump's capricious trade war, but not in a way that anyone in Washington expects will go anywhere. As TIME's Nik Popli reports from the Hill, Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican whose home-state farmers will pay dearly if the export markets close, is backing a measure that requires Congress to approve tariffs within 60 days of a White House announcement. But there is almost zero chance the bill will get sufficient backing-let alone a vote-in the GOP-led House. Grassley's move tweaked the White House, but is just that: an annoyance. It's the same fate that awaits a small-scale, symbolic version to undo the penalties against Canada that immediately cleared the Senate on Wednesday.\n\nFor now, the Senate map in 2026 still favors Republicans, with retirements of Democrats in toss-up states like New Hampshire, Michigan, and Minnesota giving GOP strategists optimism about adding to their majorities. But the argument for electing Republicans becomes tougher once clothing and grocery bills spike, and housing starts plummet because Canadian lumber is too expensive to frame up a new development.\n\nThis tit-for-tat trade retribution is an impulse that has long been part of Trump's worldview. He thinks the United States is getting ripped off, plain and simple. He sees a deck stacked against American manufacturers, and he has the power to remedy this for what he calls the little guy. It's all guaranteed to be bad politics for a President who returned to office on promises of curbing inflation, driving down costs, and fixing Washington-and his fellow party members who are fine going along.\n\nRepublicans at the Capitol understand this is going to hurt not just Americans, but their own political futures. It's why, in a low-key fever, they're freaking out. But here's the rub: while they know this is bad for just about everyone, don't expect them to exercise their congressional authority to get Trump to back off. Their prospects may be bad right now, but they view crossing a President who leads a vindictive movement as even worse. This is not a moment where anyone in Washington is expecting political bravery. Far from it. The question many Republicans in the Capitol are asking themselves: which path will yield the least pain for selfish spoils? It's a pretty weak way to run a superpower.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C. Brief newsletter .\n\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "The Republican National Convention That Shocked the Country\n\nT he Republican National Convention is underway in Milwaukee. It comes on the 60th anniversary of the 1964 convention - a raucous affair at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. There, the GOP nominated Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, revealing that the conservative wing of the party was ascendent. Sixteen years later, the right scored a crowning victory when Ronald Reagan captured the presidency.\n\nThe 1964 convention shocked observers. Goldwater's supporters heaped abuse on the media and moderate Republicans who refused to endorse the nominee. It was a stark digression from the typical convention, in which a newly crowned nominee and his allies extended olive branches to all wings of the party. In 1960, for example, Goldwater had scolded conservatives who didn't want to endorse Vice President Richard Nixon, exhorting them to get on board.\n\nBut the vitriolic display, full of conspiracy theories and extremism, embodied the brand of conservatism on the rise in the GOP - one that now dominates the party.\n\nConservatives grew increasingly disgruntled during the 1950s as they watched the Republican President Dwight Eisenhower accept the welfare state and display a willingness to coexist with the Soviet Union. This spurred the mobilization of a grassroots movement determined to reassert its values, with the help of conservative media outlets like National Review and the radio program the Manion Forum of Opinion, as well as hard-right groups like the John Birch Society.\n\nBy the early 1960s, the conservative movement saw the GOP as their vehicle for pushing the country to the right and Goldwater as their standard-bearer. Fury over national Democrats' embrace of the Civil Rights movement gave them new allies: Southern white arch-conservative Democrats who had aligned with the racist legacies of the former Confederacy. Lyndon Johnson did not exaggerate when after signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 he conceded to aide Bill Moyers, \"Well, I think we may have lost the south for your lifetime - and mine.\"\n\nThat year, savvy grassroots strategy helped the right dominate the process for selecting Republican convention delegates, which set the stage for what happened in San Francisco.\n\nOne of the Convention's defining moments came when New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, a pro-civil rights Republican who lost to Goldwater in the primaries, addressed the Cow Palace crowd.\n\nKnowing his audience was stacked against him - but also aware that the convention was on television nationwide - Rockefeller forged ahead, \"prodding,\" what journalist Theodore White dubbed \"a den of hungry lions ,\" and describing how he had fought \"to keep the Republican Party the party of all the people and warning of the extremist threat.\"\n\nWhite, the legendary election chronicler, captured the scene: the Goldwater crowd exploded, \"hating and screaming and reveling in their own frenzy.\" Rockefeller struggled to make himself heard as he decried the Goldwater campaign tactics, including the \"anonymous midnight and early morning telephone calls, unsigned threatening letters, smear and hate literature, strong-arm and goon tactics, bomb threats and bombings.\"\n\nRockefeller was not the only Republican to get shouted down. When Pennsylvania senator Hugh Scott proposed amending the GOP platform to repudiate right-wing extremism, the Goldwater delegates \"sounded a thunderous 'no'\" and the proposal failed.\n\nEven Eisenhower got caught up in the Goldwater moment. He wound up the convention-goers by attacking the media for being biased against conservatives. The delegates \"stood in their chairs, shouting, raving, shaking their fists and cursing the reporters in the press section.\"\n\nThe highlight of the convention was Goldwater's acceptance speech in which he proclaimed that \"extremism in defense of liberty is no vice\" and that \"moderation in pursuit of justice is no virtue.\"\n\nLeft unsaid was what liberty and justice meant to Goldwater and his supporters. His opposition to the Civil Rights Act (CRA) just weeks earlier offered a strong clue; liberty and justice were reserved for White Americans like them. He predicted that the CRA - legislation that authorized the federal government to end the systematic denial of full freedom to African Americans - would lead to the \"destruction of free society.\"\n\nWhile observers saw the 1964 campaign as a devastating blow to the right wing of the GOP given Goldwater's landslide defeat, it didn't extinguish the anger driving conservatives or their determination to fight back against forces they perceived to be destroying America.\n\nThat became clear the following year as the U.S. escalated its military presence in Vietnam.\n\nIn response to the first antiwar demonstrations, conservative pro-war groups marched down Fifth Avenue in New York City in October 1965. The New York Times reported that 25,000 took part in a parade that included William F. Buckley - founder of National Review - Medal of Honor winners, marching bands, fife and drum corps, and floats featuring signs reading \"Bomb Hanoi.\" Other signs proclaimed, \"Fight the Reds in Vietnam and in New York City,\" showing that the goal of the march was not simply to make a statement on foreign policy.\n\nThe heated rhetorical exchanges of the 1964 Republican convention became physical altercations in 1965. The New York Times reported that \"burly longshoremen and veterans left the line of march to attack those who voiced antiwar viewpoints.\"\n\nOne bystander, Murray Rothfield, upon observing a sign with a picture of a nuclear bomb and the words, \"Let's Drop It!\" replied \"in a loud voice, 'Let's not drop it.'\" For this, \"[s]everal veterans jumped over the public barricade and punched him to the ground.\" Rothfield was livid. The \"Buckley goons are free to roam the streets and the whole thing has Brown Shirts overtones,\" referring to the paramilitary forces Hitler used as enforcers in the 1930s.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that bystander Armand Storace held up a sign that read \"Profits Equals Murder.\" One of the marchers yelled, \"Traitor, traitor,\" prompting members of the International Longshoreman's Association to beat Storace, opening up a \"wide gash\" on his head. Storace, the New York Times reported, was \"knocked to the ground\" whereby \"his assailants ripped off his clothes and kicked him. Several men shouted 'kill him' and 'string him up.'\"\n\nIt's no coincidence that the Anti-Defamation League that same month reported a \"sharp rise\" in Ku Klux Klan membership, especially outside the south. In November, The New York Times reported that membership in the John Birch Society was also flourishing. The Society's publicity director, John H. Rousselet, announced that he had added a new lecturer to their publicity wing:  James G. Clark, the Selma, Alabama, sheriff who helped direct the vicious attack on John Lewis and the other marchers crusading for voting rights on the Edmund Pettus Bridge just months before.\n\nFrom the tenor of the 1964 GOP convention to the growing popularity of the Ku Klux Klan and the John Birch Society, the conservatives' embrace of violent rhetoric and political bullies took root - something that would only increase in the years that followed.\n\nAfter members of the Ohio National Guard opened fire on antiwar protestors at Kent State in May 1970, killing four, novelist James Michener was stunned by the local resentment against the students. A local attorney confessed that he wished he'd been there \"with a submachine gun.\" Shortly after the Kent State shootings, construction workers in Manhattan assaulted antiwar protestors in what became known as the \"Hard Hat Riot.\" Nixon promptly invited the leaders of their unions to the White House for a photo-op.\n\nEven after Watergate damaged the GOP, the tenor remained the same. In 1978, Newt Gingrich , an up-and-coming Republican, lectured young activists that the party still didn't do enough to \"encourage you to be nasty.\" As a member of the House of Representatives in the 1980s, Gingrich routinely referred to Democrats as \"pro-communist, anti-American, tyrannical.\" In 1990, Gingrich provided Republicans with a go-to list to describe all Democrats: \"sick, pathetic, lie, anti-flag, traitors, radical, corrupt.\" In 1995, Gingrich became Speaker of the House.\n\nToday the Oath Keepers, the Three-Percenters, and the Proud Boys have taken the place of the Klan and the Birchers, and Gingrich proudly supports Donald Trump . During his 2016 campaign, Trump encouraged his rally-goers to \"knock the crap\" out of hecklers, adding his own desire to \"punch [them] in the face.\"\n\nWriting for The Atlantic , Ali Breland recently described how after Trump's conviction in his election interference (or \"hush money\") case, MAGA voices on the internet exploded with warnings against anyone they deem an obstacle to Trump's return to power. It was, Breland noted, not the first time: \"The MAGA faithful are once again on the internet threatening violence.\"\n\nEven though Goldwater lost in a landslide to Johnson, his RNC convention turned out to be a portent of the emerging temperament and rhetoric that now is a central part of Republican politics. If history cannot always show us how to prevail over looming dangers, it should at least teach us not to be surprised when they appear - or in this case, reappear.\n\nCharles J.

      "text": "Here are 10 Possible GOP 2024 Challengers Not Named Trump\n\nF ormer President Donald Trump is ramping up his third bid for President, speaking in New Hampshire and South Carolina on Saturday. The two appearances are among Trump's first bouts of campaigning since announcing he was running again on Nov. 15.\n\nThe former President, whose efforts to cling to power after losing the 2020 election culminated in a deadly attack on the Capitol, remains popular within the Republican Party but will undoubtedly face challengers for the GOP nomination. Many in his party blame Trump for the GOP's less-than-stellar performance in the midterm elections, in which they lost the Senate and won the House by a slim majority. He also faces multiple legal woes, including a Department of Justice investigation into his handling of classified materials, and a criminal investigation in Georgia into his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nWhile no one else has announced yet, several party figures say they are seriously considering it, and others are drawing strong speculation. Here's a rundown of 10 of the most prominent contenders.\n\nDeSantis handily won reelection on Nov. 8, leading a winning GOP ticket that left Florida with no elected statewide Democrats for the first time since Reconstruction. With polls already measuring how he stacks up against Trump, many in his party consider DeSantis a strong contender for the Republican nomination. During a debate in October, DeSantis refused to commit to forgoing a presidential run during his next term as governor. DeSantis has made national headlines for opposing mask mandates and business closures while the pandemic raged, and flying roughly 50 Venezuelan asylum-seekers to Martha's Vineyard under false pretenses . He's also drawn national attention for signing measures restricting instruction and discussion of certain topics in schools, including one critics have derided as the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill. Before becoming governor, DeSantis was a member of the House, where he co-founded the far-right Freedom Caucus.\n\nRead more : The Unexpected Way DeSantis Turned Florida Red and Stole the Spotlight From Trump\n\nBefore the former Vice President served in Trump's White House, he was Governor of Indiana and a three-term Representative in the U.S. House, where he chaired his party's caucus and aligned himself with the Tea Party. In November, Pence released a memoir, So Help Me God, that in part was aimed at burnishing his longstanding ties to the party's evangelical wing. Though he was Trump's running-mate twice, he has broken with the former President at times, most notably when he declined to illegally overturn the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021 (Trump then did little to intervene when rioters overtook the Capitol, with some chanting \"Hang Mike Pence.\" Pence has since described Trump's actions that day as \"reckless,\" but has also said the Justice Department shouldn't charge Trump over it.)\n\nRead more : Mike Pence Is Trying to Clear a Lane For Himself in a Party Exhausted by Trump\n\nPompeo has repeatedly said in recent months that he is considering a 2024 run, and this week, he released his first book, Never Give an Inch: Fighting for the America I Love . Pompeo saw his profile elevated considerably in 2017 when, during his fourth term as a member of the House representing Kansas, Trump tapped him to be the CIA Director, and then Secretary of State a year later. In both roles, the Trump loyalist emerged as an outspoken critic of China, a strong supporter of Israel, and an opponent of environmental protections. He has also made clear his contention that abortion should only be legal when the mother's life is in danger, and in 2020, helped create the anti-abortion Geneva Consensus Declaration, which was signed by dozens of countries.\n\nThe former ambassador to the United Nations under Trump has strongly hinted that she is preparing a 2024 run. Even before joining the Trump administration, Haley was a rising GOP star, becoming the first Indian-American woman to be elected Governor in the country, leading South Carolina for six years and drawing high approval ratings. More recently, she made the rounds supporting Republican candidates during the midterms. Yet her history with Trump has complicated her status in the GOP. In the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack, she gave a scathing assessment of the former President, before later backtracking. In 2021, she said she wouldn't run in 2024 if Trump was a candidate.\n\nNoem has long drawn speculation as a potential presidential candidate or running mate, Within the past month, the Trump-backed governor has attracted national attention for threatening to prosecute pharmacists that make abortion pills available within FDA guidelines, effectively blocking her state government from making contracts with China, and receiving a flamethrower as a Christmas gift from her staff. \"I'm not convinced that I need to run for President, but I also believe that this country needs somebody to lead us that has a vision,\" she told CBS News last week.\n\nScott won re-election last year by a decisive 26-point margin, and he hinted at a potential 2024 run in his victory speech. When he joined the Senate in 2013 (an appointment by then-Governor Nikki Haley), he became the first and only Black politician to serve in both chambers of Congress. He has drawn raves among GOP establishment figures like Mitch McConnell, while thus far not alienating himself from the Trump wing of the party.\n\nYoungkin entered the national political stage in 2021 upon winning a special election for Governor against the Democratic incumbent, Terry McAuliffe, with a campaign that some viewed as a potential blueprint for how Republicans can distance themselves from Trump without outright rejecting him. Youngkin, a former private equity CEO, has framed himself as a unifier of different GOP factions, campaigning on a message of bipartisanship and eventually came out against Trump's stolen election claims. On prominent social issues, Youngkin hasn't been afraid to take staunchly conservative stances, particularly related to schools, where he banned mask mandates and any teaching of critical race theory lessons soon after taking office.\n\nRead more : The Education of Glenn Youngkin\n\nMany within the GOP wanted Sununu to make a bid for the Senate last year. He surprised them by instead running for a fourth gubernatorial term, winning re-election by 15 points. Sununu is an outspoken Trump critic, complicating his path forward in the party, but his popularity within the first-in-the-nation primary state makes him harder to dismiss. He has given mixed responses to whether he might run for President in 2024.\n\nHutchison stepped down as Arkansas Governor this month after eight years at the job. He earlier represented the state in the House and served in the George W. Bush administration as the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration and an undersecretary in the Department of Homeland Security. He has long been critical of Trump, saying that the Jan. 6 attack, among other behavior, should disqualify the former President from another term in the minds of voters. He told NBC News on Wednesday he was \"absolutely\" considering a 2024 Republican presidential bid.\n\nCruz finished second behind Trump in the 2016 Republican primary, a race that ended bitterly, with Cruz famously refusing to endorse Trump during the Republican National Convention, only to then do so weeks later. Cruz has made clear he is not ruling out another run in 2024. In the nearly ten years he has been Senator, and during his time as the Solicitor General of Texas before that, he has framed himself as a staunch constitutional conservative. The former Trump rival notably supported the false notion that the 2020 Presidential election was stolen, and as recently as October refused to acknowledge that President Joe Biden was legitimately elected.\n\nVarious other names have been bandied about, including former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, and John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser.\n\nWrite to Julia Zorthian at julia.zorthian@time.com"

      "text": "In Thune, Senate Republicans Picked The Most Anti-MAGA Leader In The Mix\n\nThis article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nTo outsiders, it looks a whole lot like Donald Trump has unrivaled control over the current Republican Party. He rode a remarkable and ahistoric wave back to re-election last week, one in which his allies expanded their majority in the House, and the Senate will return in January with Republicans holding the gavels. To the lay eye, Trump and his GOP lackeys are going to have free reign of Washington for at least the next two years. Democrats, it's best to just cower and cede ground, right?\n\nBut look a little closer, and the Republican monopoly is a little less certain. The House is destined to be a mess, given a narrow margin of majority and the parochial whims of some of the most right-wing members. Republicans on most measures are expected to need a handful of Democratic votes to get must-pass pieces of legislation across the finish line, and that is going to force at least some modicum of whittling of conservative wish lists. In the Senate, the surviving filibuster demands a 60-vote bar for most measures, again needing a handful of Democratic votes to lift the big pieces into law. Put simply: Trump was never going to get a blank check from his pals in Congress.\n\nThat check got even less blank on Wednesday, when Senate Republicans picked their successor for Mitch McConnell, who is ending a record 18 years as party Leader. In his place, the GOP lawmakers elevated Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who spent the last few years as a watchful student of McConnell's mastery of the Senate and its quirks. Similarly an institutionalist, Thune bested colleagues John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida for the job on the second ballot, and Cornyn moved that the decision be made unanimous.\n\n\"We are excited to reclaim the majority and to get work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump's agenda,\" Thune said after the election.\n\nCareful words, sure. But total honesty? Not entirely.\n\nIn picking Thune, Republicans rejected the MAGA-backed Scott for a by-the-books establishment figure who is as unassuming as he is efficient. Thune is one of the most powerful people in Washington that folks outside the Beltway have never heard of. He has a national fundraising network-$33 million raised for Republicans this cycle alone-and his alumni are peppered throughout the conservative ecosystem of Hill offices, committee staff, and K Street lobbying shops. To put it plainly: Thune positioned himself shrewdly to become McConnell's logical heir.\n\nAnd that, precisely, is why President-elect Donald Trump must be stewing . Trump has made his contempt for business-as-usual Washington part of the deal. Trump famously loathed McConnell and his insistence that precedent and decorum rule the day, not haste or instinct. Thune has a little more appetite for gut instinct, but he is a gentleman who rightly matches the Senate's staid reputation. After Trump dispatched a mob to attack the chamber on Jan. 6, 2021, Thune broke with him in a big way that day. Four years earlier, Thune was among the Republicans who called on Trump to stand down in the wake of the Access Hollywood crisis that ultimately proved irrelevant to the race. While Trump was President, Thune was an ardent critic of Trump's obsession with tariffs.\n\nThough this involved a secret ballot unlike Senate votes, the fact that the chamber's Republicans sided with Thune is an early-and maybe premature-warning that they mightn't be the rubber stamp that Trump Republicans had hoped to find. Thune nodded along politely when Trump demanded the chamber give him recess appointments for his Cabinet should confirmation hearings drag on too long, but Thune carefully added that his legions would work on speedy vetting-not unilateral green lights for his picks.\n\nThat caution and calibration is why Trump has long harbored suspicion against Thune. So deep was the antipathy, Trump actively sought Kristi Noem as a primary challenger against Thune in 2022, although she ran for re-election instead and is now on deck to be his nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Thune is a normie in the purest sense, and his colleagues decided they trusted him over Cornyn-another mainstream conservative-or burn-it-down billionaire Scott to dictate what measures get moved to the Senate floor and which get buried in the bottom of a desk drawer.\n\nThune's win is also a signal that Trump and his inner-circle- specifically billionaire Elon Musk-will not have total control over D.C. Musk had openly supported Scott for the gig, and many in Trump's orbit had re-upped stories about how Thune was perceived as a disloyal adherent to the MAGA movement. But on the secret ballot, Thune prevailed as the level-headed, plain-spoken grandfather who could keep the intentionally inert Senate steady. With Trump likely to have his sycophants in the House ready to give his impulses a go-ahead order, and the courts remade to his-and McConnell's-liking, the Senate may be the fail-safe in government. The dam may yet break, but at least for now it holds. It may be the best those in Washington fearful of Trump 2.0 can hope for in the next few years.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

      "text": "Why We Have Conventions and How They Work\n\nT he Republican National Convention (RNC) began Monday in Milwaukee, just two days after a gunman shot at former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nTrump was officially nominated as the Republican Party's candidate for President on Monday afternoon-the same day that he announced Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate . In August, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) will be held in Chicago. The party has said that President Joe Biden will be officially nominated as the Democratic presidential nominee before the in-person convention starts .\n\nHere's how the presidential nominating conventions work.\n\nIn the early 19th century, presidential candidates were largely decided by party-based congressional nominating caucuses . Party nominating conventions were created after the 1824 election, when no candidate was able to receive the majority of electoral votes. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky was the first candidate to win the presidential nomination of his political party when his party, the National Republicans, conducted the first major national political convention in December 1931.\n\nIn the 1970s, both the RNC and DNC underwent major reform to give primary elections more power in deciding the presidential nominee.\n\nThroughout the primary elections, voters decide between multiple presidential candidates as they cast their ballots. After a state's primary vote, each candidate is awarded a number of delegates. Those delegates then typically cast official votes for the candidate at the convention.\n\nThe conventions, and the selection of each party's presidential nominee, mark the end of the primary election, and the beginning of the general election, resulting in a single presidential candidate from each party. From senators to celebrities, a range of people are usually in attendance to speak and show their support for the party and candidate, and the candidate often gives a keynote speech.\n\nMuch of what occurs at the convention-including announcing the party's platform and presumptive nominee-is now typically squared away long before the convention actually begins. \"[With] the current system, we generally know who's going to be the nominee before the convention,\" says Barbara Norrander, a professor at the University of Arizona's School of Government & Public Policy.  \"The conventions are more about advertisement for that candidate.\"\n\nDelegates are people selected to represent their state or district and choose their party's presidential candidate at the convention. They're typically state and local party officials or activists, Norrander says.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans choose their delegates in different ways, but both parties have two different kinds of delegates. The first are those who are bound or pledged to particular candidates and chosen at state nominating events, according to a report about the presidential nominating process by the Congressional Research Service . Generally, these delegates have to vote for the candidate who won the primary in their state or district, Norrander says.\n\nThe second are those who are automatic delegates by virtue of the office they hold. For the Republican Party, these delegates are members of the Republican National Committee, and they're usually obligated to vote for the candidate who won their state, according to the Brookings Institution . For the Democratic Party, delegates who are automatically selected may be members of the Democratic National Committee, members of Congress, governors, or distinguished party leaders, according to the report by the Congressional Research Service. These delegates are not bound to particular candidates.\n\nAlong with delegates, party officials and politicians, journalists, and celebrities often attend conventions. Among the speakers announced for the Republican convention this year, for example, are numerous members of Congress, two of Trump's sons, country singer Lee Greenwood, and model and influencer Amber Rose.\n\nWrite to Simmone Shah at simmone.shah@time.com"

      "text": "Harris Intensifies Pitch to Disaffected Republicans\n\nW ith less than three weeks until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris is ramping up her pitch to a core group of voters who could help flip a coin-toss election: anti-Trump Republicans.\n\nIn a speech backed by Republican supporters on Wednesday and an interview on Fox News that evening, Harris made a bid to invite disaffected conservatives into her coalition. Speaking in Bucks County, Penn., not far from where George Washington crossed the Delaware River, the Democratic nominee urged them to put country over party, and to unify against an opponent who has demonstrated a disregard for the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\"At stake in this race are the democratic ideals that our founders, and generations of Americans, have fought for. At stake in this election is the Constitution itself,\" Harris said, joined by more than 100 Republicans from Pennsylvania and other swing states.\n\nDonald Trump \"considers any American who doesn't support him, or bend to this will, an enemy of our country,\" Harris said. \"It is clear: Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged and seeking unchecked power.\"\n\nEver since Trump was elected in 2016, Democrats have hoped that Republicans would abandon a politician who has trampled many of their party's core ideals. It hasn't happened-at least not in significant numbers. Yet Harris believes there are enough conservatives who have serious doubts about Trump that winning them over could be enough to swing a tight election.\n\nThere's some evidence the strategy could work. More than 150,000 Republican voters voted for Nikki Haley in the Pennsylvania GOP primary, weeks after she dropped out of the race. President Biden won the state in 2020 by only about half that number. According to Haley Voters for Harris, a SuperPAC that is seeking to convince center-right voters to vote for Harris, the number of people who voted for former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in the 2024 GOP primary, both before and after she exited the race, is enough to swing battleground states like North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona. \"The number of folks who voted for Haley after she dropped out of the primaries, particularly in places like Pennsylvania, is a potentially decisive number of votes,\" says Craig Snyder, a former GOP Congressional Chief of Staff who now runs Haley Voters for Harris.\n\nHaley herself has since endorsed Trump. But according to a Blueprint poll, a significant portion of her voters are holding out against him: only 45% of Haley voters now say they'll vote for Trump, while 36% say they'll vote for Harris. Nearly 20% remain undecided, and those are the voters Harris appears to be speaking to now. \"This is real erosion of Trump's support within the party,\" Snyder says. According to a recent New York Times /Siena poll, Harris is winning 9% of Republican voters; Snyder says he thinks if she can crack 10%, it would win her the electoral college.\n\nTo reach those voters, Harris is also going to Trump's home turf: Fox News. She sat for a 25-minute interview with Fox's Bret Baier on Wednesday evening, during which she emphasized the number of Republicans who are supporting her. \"It is clear to me, and certainly the Republicans who were on stage with me,\" she said, \"that he is unfit to serve, that he is unstable, that he is dangerous, and that people are exhausted.\"\n\nHarris again brought up Trump's use of the phrase \"enemy within\" to refer to his opponents. \"This is a democracy, and in a democracy, the President of the United States, in the United States of America, should be willing to be able to handle criticism without saying he'd lock people up,\" she said.\n\nThe escalating pitch to waffling conservatives comes after stints of campaigning with Trump's Republican critics. Former Rep. Liz Cheney endorsed Harris at an event earlier this month. Some former Trump officials have come out in support of Harris. One Harris-Walz ad uses the words of Trump's own Vice President, Defense Secretary, National Security Adviser, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to argue that Trump is not fit to be President again.\n\nRob Gleason, who was the Republican state party chair in Pennsylvania when Trump won it in 2016, said that Harris appears to be trying to grow her vote share in the suburbs to counteract large expected losses in rural areas. \"At the end of the day, what's this election about: Do you like Trump or not?\" says Gleason. \"It's not about Kamala Harris.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Republican Voters Against Trump will start a swing-state bus tour throughout Pennsylvania and Michigan, designed to create a so-called \"permission structure \" for Republicans to break from the former President. Each stop-in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Detroit-will feature former Trump voters who are now supporting Harris. The group will also be spending more than $4 million in a new Pennsylvania ad campaign, including 55 new billboards featuring erstwhile Trump supporters explaining why they can't support him anymore. Republican Voters Against Trump is on track to spend a total of $32 million on ads featuring former Trump supporters.\n\nWhile it's nearly certain that the vast majority of Republicans will support their nominee, in a razor-thin race, even small defections can make the difference. \"When it's as close as it is here,\" says Gleason, \"every vote counts.\"\n\nCorrection appended, Oct. 18: An earlier version of this story misstated the group that conducted a poll of Nikki Haley voters. It was Blueprint, not Haley Voters for Harris.\n\nWrite to Charlotte Alter at charlotte.alter@time.com"

      "text": "'Probably unconstitutional': Trump's world trade war spotlights conservative fault lines\n\nPresident Donald Trump has hailed his sweeping tariffs on all U.S. trading partners and imports as a \"declaration of economic independence\" that has largely been cheered by his populist base as another example of his \"America First\" priorities.\n\nBut a backlash appears to be brewing on the political right as a handful of Republicans in Congress , former Trump administration officials, conservative activists and other prominent supporters are expressing doubt about this move as anxieties about higher consumer prices rise.\n\n\"President Trump declared that it was in fact 'liberation day' his giant tariff policy that he just dropped on the market unilaterally, probably unconstitutionally,\" Ben Shapiro, founder of the Daily Wire, said on his program this week.\n\n\"There are real-world implications for this sort of stuff,\" he added. \"Trade wars are in fact not good, and not easy to win, particularly if you don't have a plan.\"\n\nAmericans also appeared to have soured on this idea even as the administration promises long-term gains.\n\nTrump saw his approval rating dip to 43%, the lowest since his return to office, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released after the April 1 announcement.\n\nFifty-two percent of respondents said putting tariffs on vehicles will have a negative impact, including 53% of independents. And after riding a wave of anxiety about risings costs back into the White House, the survey shows 57% of Americans think Trump's moves to shake up the economy are \"too erratic\" with 59% of independent voters agreeing with that statement.\n\n\"The Trump Tariff Tax is the largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history,\" Republican Mike Pence , who served as Trump's vice president during his first term, said in an April 2 post on X .\n\n\"These Tariffs are nearly 10x the size of those imposed during the Trump-Pence Administration and will cost American families over $3,500 per year.\"\n\nWhether in Congress or think tanks, fiscal hawks aren't shying away from sharing their wariness in Trump's dramatic shift in U.S. trade policy, which includes a 10% baseline tariff on goods from all countries.\n\nThe Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, have mocked the administration for slapping tariffs on islands inhabited only by penguins, while echoing Pence and other conservatives.\n\n\"On the serious side: This isn't trade strategy,\" the group said on X. \"It's a massive tax on US consumers.\"\n\nThomas Sowell, a well-known economist often cited by GOP officeholders, called the administration's decision \"disturbing\" adding it runs the risk of a significant downturn. \"It's painful to see what a ruinous decision from back in the 1920s being repeated,\" he said .\n\nOn Capitol Hill, where there could be legislative consequences, the most noticeable GOP opposition is coming from the Senate side.\n\nLongtime Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has introduced a bipartisan bill that would require the president to notify Congress within 48 hours if the administration imposed a tariff.\n\nThat proposal has attracted other Senate Republicans who have flirted with the idea of support it, such as Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, who faces reelection in 2026.\n\nThen there are retiring lawmakers, like former Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who hasn't shied away from expressing his disagreements with Trump nominees and moderates such as Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, who all voted to end some of the tariffs on Canada this past week.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has arguably been the most outspoken , but others such as Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas, and Sen. John Kennedy, of Louisiana, have sprinkled cold water on the strategy, too.\n\n\"We do not know yet the impact of these (tariffs),\" Kennedy said Friday in an interview with Fox News. \"We just don't know and anybody who tells you otherwise that says they know has been smoking the devil's lettuce. I'm not going to bubble-wrap it.\"\n\nThings look much better for Trump on the House side where almost no members have come out against the plan save for Rep. Don Bacon, of Nebraska, who reportedly plans to draft a companion bill to the bipartisan Grassley proposal.\n\nMost other GOP members have rushed to say they believe Trump's plan puts U.S. interests first as he promised to do during the campaign. That is where a majority of Republicans stand, according to polling.\n\nOn the question of a negative impact on automobiles, for example, the Reuters/Ipsos survey finds 47% of GOP disagree that it will hurt people versus 30% who agree. The remaining 23% did not answer.\n\nSimilarly, 25% of Republicans think Trump is being \"too erratic\" with the economy while 63% think he isn't and just 11% who didn't answer.\n\n\"Trump is breaking the globalist order. Hold,\" Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, said Friday on X. \"The BEST is yet to come!\""

      "text": "I'm worried about Republicans. Feels like the job is too hard for them. | Opinion\n\nYou guys. We need to check on Republicans. They're having a rough couple of months. I know it is odd to say since they run the government and have busy little bees tearing down any traces of that government helping people.\n\nHeck, they've been busy tearing down actual people. Veterans and trans people alike. Wait, they've been busy tearing down trans veterans . But I digress.\n\nWhy am I worried about them? Because they still seem pretty angry and upset, and I hate to see it. They're such an angsty bunch. That made sense, to some extent, in 2024, when they rode an off-the-rails train of lies and fear back to the White House. The campaign was a bit stressful for everybody involved, if I'm being honest.\n\nPlus, it can be bothersome to keep track of so much lying and fearmongering. It's a burden I don't wish on anybody. But why are they still so mad? They won, right? Like, they all the way won in November.\n\nThey have Congress. They have the White House. They have the Supreme Court . They had all their political wishes come true. Now what?\n\nI guess I have some theories, but it all comes down to the notion that governing and working on behalf of voters is hard. It's hard, you guys. There is a spectrum of laws and rules that my woke education taught me requires something called \"checks and balances.\"\n\nThe nuance and skill set elected leaders need to navigate those checks and balances are not as easy as former President Barack Obama made it look. I get that.\n\nSo, instead of shrinking government, firing everybody, changing elections and eliminating federal departments through congressional action, Trump has decided to do it on his own and sort it out later in the courts. It has caused needless chaos. Republicans don't have to cheat to do stuff. They can, you know, just do stuff.\n\nAnd yet, they are unraveling under the weight of it, and Trump hasn't even hit the 100 days in office milestone.\n\nHere is a list of what has gone sideways for the party that we were told might know how to stabilize a country that Democrats had let fall off a cliff. MAGA will point out that Democrats are also in disarray, and that's not wrong. But Democrats don't control the government anymore, and Republicans still needed them to stop a shutdown .\n\nIs that everything? Probably not. Shout out something if I missed it. But that's a wild amount of chaos and political destruction implemented quickly.\n\nAnd again, there is no reason for most of it. Many of these misguided things could have been done through Congress if its members could be bothered to do anything.\n\nI guess if you relish the pain of others, that list belongs in the political destruction hall of fame. But if you're looking for long-lasting accomplishments beyond half-baked executive orders immediately thrown out in court, you're going to be looking a long time. Republicans are too busy fussing about the job to do it.\n\nThe thing is, there is polling that suggests Republican voters are happy with Trump , even if they've soured on Musk . Sure, everybody else wants Trump gone, but he's a big hit with his followers. That's nice, right?\n\nSo why are Republicans so hell-bent on breaking as much as possible while playing the victim card at every turn?\n\nTrump can't stop whining on Truth Social . House Speaker Mike Johnson gave a whacky news conference where he threatened to go after judges. Might he consider getting Congress to do anything to legislate Trump's MAGA manifesto instead?\n\nRepublican members of Congress are hiding from voters . One in Arizona checked to make sure only people registered as Republicans could enter his town hall. What are you afraid of, my guy? Facts?\n\nI guess I feel the need to reassure Republicans. Here goes:\n\nYes, Trump is a horrible president by all measures we use. Yes, the Republican Congress is increasingly one of the most useless we've seen in modern political history. And, sure, the economy isn't doing great, and maybe Trump won't be able to \"fix it\" on Day 1 like he promised. He's kind of making it worse .\n\nBut look at all you have accomplished in such a short and destructive time. You've managed to expose the fakery of our political guardrails. You've quickly created a blueprint for how presidents going forward can govern free of congressional meddling. You even innovated by letting a billionaire fire as many peasants as possible for his amusement.\n\nThat's something, right? So, buck up. You're doing great.\n\nLouie Villalobos is Gannett's director of opinion. You can find him hugging his Republican friends and family members as they cope with being in charge."

      "text": "If Republicans unify control of U.S. government, what to expect when Trump takes office\n\nWASHINGTON - It was a remarkable 2024 election for Republicans, who retook the White House with President-elect Donald Trump , flipped the Senate and appear poised to retain their majority in the House.\n\nSo what can Ohio voters expect from unified Republican control of all three power centers?\n\nFrom swift appointments of Trump's Cabinet choices to major changes in policy, Republicans in Congress are likely to use their leverage to advance Trump's priorities and will likely face few roadblocks from the Democratic minority.\n\n\"This historic election has proven that a majority of Americans are eager for secure borders, lower costs, peace through strength, and a return to common sense,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement Wednesday, even as the House has not yet been called for Republicans and Democrats insist it is still in play .\n\nThere are also no guarantees.\n\nTrump's relationships with his own party in the Senate have long been touch and go , and the chamber's rules afford the minority party the chance to slow walk or even kill bills that don't involve some degree of bipartisanship. Over in the House, the GOP's internal fights stymied action over the last two years due to an extremely narrow majority that Republicans are hoping to expand upon as the final few dozen races get called.\n\nBig things can happen when one party does run Washington.\n\nThe last time Republicans held a trifecta in DC came in 2017 and 2018 during Trump's first term, when he signed into law dozens of bills including a $1.5 trillion tax cut . Democrats held a trifecta in 2021 and 2022 under President Joe Biden, which helped lead to passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. Holding all the levers of power in 2009 and 2010, then-President Barack Obama pushed across the finish line the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a major overhaul of the U.S. financial sector and the Affordable Care Act .\n\nHere's what could be ahead under total GOP control of Washington.\n\nRepublicans have regained control of the Senate, which is responsible for confirming a president's Cabinet and judicial nominees, including filling any Supreme Court vacancies.\n\nCabinet confirmation hearings can be intense and prolonged when a nominee is controversial. In some rare instances, the president withdraws their nominee if it becomes clear they won't get enough support to be confirmed.\n\nFor example, Trump withdrew the nomination for Patrick Shanahan to serve as Secretary of Defense amid allegations of domestic violence and withdrew the nomination for now-Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs over concerns he did not have enough management experience. Biden withdrew his nomination of Neera Tanden to lead the Office of Management and Budget over concerns she was too partisan.\n\nBut most Cabinet nominations succeed when the White House and the Senate are controlled by the same party - especially since Democrats rolled back the filibuster to allow a president's picks to be approved by a simple majority. An incoming president also has historically been afforded a degree of latitude when putting forward their initial picks to staff their government after an election, especially when the Senate is run by the same party.\n\nSo Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services secretary? Utah Sen. Mike Lee for U.S. attorney general? Larry Kudlow for Treasury secretary? All are real possibilities with a GOP-led Senate.\n\nIn addition to Trump's policy priorities like curbing immigration and rolling back regulations on everything from home building to energy production, there are several fights ahead that Congress would have to tackle regardless of which presidential candidate took the helm next year.\n\nMultiple provisions of the $1.5 trillion 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act - one of the first Trump administration's biggest legislative accomplishments - are set to expire in 2025. It opens up an opportunity for Washington to remake national tax policy.\n\nExpect Republican priorities to be the starting point for these negotiations, including Trump's promises to eliminate taxes on tips, exempt overtime pay from income taxes, and extend the tax brackets in the 2017 law.\n\nCongress will also need to fund the government, which will likely reflect GOP priorities like stripping funding for federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs and slashing budgets for agencies like the Department of Education.\n\nAnother big debate ahead for Congress and the incoming Trump administration is over whether to raise the debt ceiling, which will be reinstated at the beginning of next year, before the government runs out money and may default on its debts .\n\nThroughout this election cycle, Republicans have promised they would not pass a federal abortion ban. Democrats have insisted that they would.\n\nNow, Republicans are likely to be put to the test: With total control over the House, Senate and White House, would they still resist calls from the evangelical Christian members of their base to pass federal restrictions?\n\nThe American public remains largely opposed to a federal abortion ban , including around two-thirds of Republicans.\n\nDemocrats have alleged that Republicans plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which now has widespread popularity . Republicans have said they do not plan to eliminate the law and they would only change the ACA if they could improve it to lower costs and improve coverage.\n\nRepublicans have also pledged not to touch the Senate's filibuster rule, which creates a 60-vote threshold that typically requires the majority party to convince at least a handful of the minority party to join with them to pass significant legislation.\n\n\"One of the most gratifying results of the Senate becoming Republican - the filibuster will stand,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters Wednesday. The leading candidates to succeed McConnell have also said they support keeping the filibuster.\n\nRepublicans will now be challenged to stand by that pledge, especially if Democrats are unified against their priorities."

      "text": "What is in the just-passed House Republican budget bill? What to know\n\nWASHINGTON ‒ After a long day of arm-twisting and internal party clashes, House Republicans on Tuesday narrowly passed their plan to advance President Donald Trump 's legislative agenda.\n\nThe GOP plan was passed by a vote of 217-215, after House Speaker Mike Johnson , R-La., had to convince several Republican holdouts including Reps. Victoria Spartz of Indiana, Tim Burchett of Tennessee and Warren Davidson of Ohio to come on board with the proposal.\n\nAfter the House plan passed on Tuesday night, Trump congratulated Johnson.\n\n\"Big First Step Win for Speaker Mike Johnson, and AMERICA. Now let's start to BALANCE THE BUDGET. IT CAN BE DONE!!!\" he wrote in a Truth Social post on Wednesday morning.\n\nHere's a rundown of what the proposal includes and who voted against it:\n\nThe House's plan would set up a massive reconciliation bill that would extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and implement new ones at a cost of $4.5 trillion over the next decade.\n\nIt would also allocate $300 billion for spending on defense and border security, raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion over two years, and add almost $3 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years.\n\nThe budget blueprint would also direct multiple committees to cut billions of dollars, including $880 billion in cuts spearheaded by the Energy and Commerce Committee. Because Trump has ruled out cuts to Medicare and Social Security, budget experts say that may necessitate cuts to Medicaid , which is under the committee's jurisdiction.\n\nAll Democrats and one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., voted against the budget plan.\n\nMassie argued that the plan \"doesn't cut spending much\" and that it will only add to the U.S. debt. \"We have no plan whatsoever to balance the budget other than growth. But what they're proposing is to make the deficit worse,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\nHouse Democrats have argued that the plan would have negative impacts on middle-class and low-income families.\n\n\"Tonight, House Republicans passed a budget which steals taxpayer dollars from Medicaid to give tax breaks to their billionaire donors and big corporations. Their cruel budget raises costs for those already struggling to make ends meet ‒ but Republicans voted for it with glee,\" former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe two government health programs were signed into law 60 years ago by former President Lyndon B. Johnson, each serving distinct groups.\n\nMedicare covers those 65 and older, as well as some younger than 65 with certain disabilities, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The program is run by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and the federal agency sets the requirements for eligibility.\n\nMedicaid is for low-income and disabled Americans. The program is a joint effort between the federal government and individual states. While there are certain standards set at the national level, other eligibility and benefits can vary from state to state.\n\nTogether, both programs serve about 25% of the country's population, according to an HHS spokesperson.\n\nThe latest budget resolution passed by the House Tuesday night does not explicitly lay out cuts to Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nWhat it does is set spending levels for different congressional committees, including the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees Medicaid.\n\nThe resolution calls for $2 trillion worth of federal spending cuts, $880 billion of those coming from the Energy and Commerce Committee specifically. Democrats and moderates have raised concerns that these cuts would end up slashing Medicaid coverage.\n\nBut House Republican leadership has said there will not be cuts to the program. Instead, they say they plan to save by targeting \"fraud, waste and abuse\" rather than the health services.\n\n\"The word Medicaid is not even in this bill. This bill doesn't even mention the word Medicaid a single time,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana said in a press conference Tuesday.\n\nTrump, who has called for his agenda to be passed in \"one, big beautiful bill,\" endorsed the House plan last week. He said in a Truth Social post that the \"House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!\"\n\nThe Senate had been working to pass Trump's agenda into two separate pieces. The upper chamber held a marathon session last week where they passed their own version of Trump's agenda in a border security and defense package.\n\nTrump then told reporters on Tuesday that he would look at both proposals and decide which one he prefers.\n\n\"So the House has a bill and the Senate has a bill, and I'm looking at them both, and I'll make decisions,\" he said. \"I know the Senate is doing very well and the House is doing very well. But each one of them has things that I like. So we'll see if we can come together.\"\n\nContributing: Ken Alltucker"

      "text": "Backlash to Musk isn't imagined. When they slash Medicaid it will be worse. | Opinion\n\nDuring the most recent House recess , Republicans who faced their constituents at town hall meetings were met with crowds furious about sweeping budget cuts, mass firings of federal workers and Elon Musk's unelected hands all over the government.\n\nAnd that was before House Republicans barely scraped together the votes to pass a budget blueprint that will likely cut social safety net programs to offset major tax breaks favoring wealthy Americans.\n\nThe current House budget plan includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts while assigning congressional committees the task of finding $2 trillion in spending reductions. The most likely casualty? Medicaid, with at least $800 billion on the chopping block. Though the bill doesn't explicitly call for Medicaid cuts , even Republicans have admitted there are few other ways to make the math work.\n\nThat hasn't stopped Trump from insisting the program will be \"just fine.\" Sound familiar? It should. Because in 2017 , he said the same thing before attempting to gut it.\n\nRepublican leaders celebrated the razor-thin passage of the bill, but many of their members will now face the real-world consequences: a fired-up electorate that is not buying what they're selling. Democrats see this as an opportunity to mobilize voters.\n\nPrior to the House budget plan passing, from Georgia to Oklahoma and Oregon to Wisconsin, GOP town halls were a masterclass in political self-immolation.\n\nOutside of Oshkosh, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman was booed before he even made it through the door of his event. Inside, he was grilled over the GOP's spending plan and his support for Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship . When he tried to defend the administration's efforts to purge thousands of federal workers, the crowd erupted.\n\nIn West Bend, Rep. Scott Fitzgerald faced similar heat over Republicans' failure to push back against Musk's outsized influence.\n\nAnd yet, instead of acknowledging the anger as organic, Republican lawmakers and right-wing media have trotted out a familiar excuse: the protests are fake. Conservative talking heads claim these events are orchestrated by paid left-wing agitators - a play straight out of the Tea Party-era Democratic playbook.\n\nIn 2009, when town halls exploded with conservative rage against Obamacare, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the backlash as \"Astroturf.\" A year later, Democrats suffered massive losses in the midterms. Whether or not the protests were manufactured didn't matter - the political consequences were real.\n\nRepublicans should take note.\n\nWhile GOP lawmakers scramble to downplay the backlash, Democrats see a different story: a grassroots awakening that could reshape the political landscape. Run for Something , a progressive group that recruits Democrats to run for office, reported a spike of more than 2,000 new applicants in the days following Musk's mass firings of federal workers.Much of the traffic came from former government employees who, once barred from political activism, now see running for office as a way to fight back. Just as the first Trump presidency sparked an unprecedented wave of first-time candidates - many of whom went on to flip Republican seats in 2018 - Democrats hope to harness this moment to fuel another electoral reckoning.\n\nMeanwhile, the right-wing media machine is working overtime to keep its audience insulated from the political storm. GOP lawmakers live in a media bubble where Trump and Musk are worshipped, their actions spun as part of a grand plan to \"restore America.\"\n\nInside that bubble, the town hall backlash doesn't exist - except as an invented conspiracy by the left. But reality has a funny way of breaking through. Recent polling shows that while a majority of Republicans support Musk's federal purge, only a third of Americans overall do. Among non-Republicans, that number plummets to fewer than 1 in 5. The right's information ecosystem might be able to convince its own base, but outside that echo chamber, the rest of the country isn't buying it.\n\nAnd yet, Trump and Musk aren't backing down. In a recent interview, Musk dismissed the opposition as an \"antibody reaction from those who were getting fraudulent government money.\" It's a classic move: delegitimize critics instead of addressing their concerns. But as history has shown , dismissing public outrage doesn't make it disappear - it makes it grow.\n\nIf this level of backlash is happening just one month into this administration, what happens when the pain becomes real? Republicans have made a bet that they can weather this storm. But if they're wrong, they won't just lose town halls - they'll lose elections.\n\nHere in Wisconsin, where Elon Musk has already thrown his money behind conservative Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel , voters will soon have a chance to send their own message. And looking ahead to 2026, guys like Derrick Van Orden over in Wisconsin's 3rd who scraped by with one of the slimmest margins in Wisconsin is going to have some explaining to do.\n\nAfterall, he won his 2024 re-election by significantly fewer votes than the number of adults in his district who rely on Medicaid and SNAP . If Republican lawmakers and their billionaire backers think they can ride this out unscathed, they might want to check the forecast.\n\nBecause right now? It's looking rough.\n\nKristin Brey is the \"My Take\" columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel."

Andy Biggs wants to hear from you - if you're a Republican | Opinion\n\nA Republican congressman from Arizona actually met face to face with constituents on Tuesday.\n\nWell, some constituents, anyway.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs along with Senate President Warren Petersen and Maricopa County Sheriff Jerry Sheridan met with Republican voters in Chandler on Tuesday evening.\"Come and hear from 3 of our elected officials on the HOT TOPICS in their respective office,\" read a flyer on the town hall, hosted by the Maricopa County Republican Committee.There certainly are plenty of those.\n\nHOT TOPICS, I mean. And I can only imagine that at least a few of the more 551,000 voters in Biggs' congressional district might have been interested to hear where Biggs stands on things like cuts to Medicaid, given that more than 20% of the state's residents are on it.\n\nOr his views on ending the CHIPS Act, the one that has boosted Arizona's economy and been called \"a horrible, horrible thing\" by President Donald Trump.\n\nOr where he stands on Social Security, as Elon Musk fires up his trusty chainsaw.\n\nUnfortunately, 57% of Biggs' constituents weren't welcome to come and hear what the congressman had to say.\n\nOnly Republicans could attend Tuesday's town hall and the media wasn't allowed in either.\n\n\"Please be advised that tonight's town hall is a private event,\" Patty Castillo Porter, a member-at-large of the Maricopa County Republican Committee, wrote, in a message announcing the event. \"I have been reminded that only members of the Republican Party will be admitted into the venue.\"\n\nContrast that with Rep. Yassamin Ansari's packed town hall in downtown Phoenix Tuesday evening, which was open to anyone who wanted to hear from the Democratic congresswoman.\n\nOr with Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego's joint town hall in Scottsdale Monday on Medicaid. It was geared to health-related groups but anyone could attend.\n\nOr with Gallego's town halls Tuesday in Douglas and Sierra Vista, which were advertised and open to anyone.\n\nOnce upon a time, Biggs, too, thought thought answering to his voters was an important part of the job.\n\nConsider this, from a Biggs newsletter in 2017, shortly into his first term.\n\n\"When I took office in January, I promised to host in-person town hall meetings for constituents of Arizona's Fifth Congressional District in April,\" he wrote. \"April is here, and so is my first town hall...I hope to see you in attendance and look forward to a robust discussion about the issues facing our country.\"Now in his fifth term, Biggs doesn't seem so interested in robust discussions ... at least not with the independents and Democrats in his conservative district.\n\nI can't recall the last time Biggs, who is now running for governor, held an in-person town hall for voters in his district.\n\nYet he had no problem attending one organized by Republicans for Republicans.\n\nHis allies were all for the GOP-only town hall, noting that Democrats have disrupted town halls held by Republicans in other states.\n\n\"They train their people to weaponize town halls against Republicans,\" Republican activist Merissa Hamilton replied, when I questioned why Biggs would agree to a GOP-only town hall. \"And with the violence coming from the Party, it makes town halls very dangerous venues!\"\n\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has advised Republicans to refrain from holding public meetings with constituents given the onslaught of protesters angry about the Trump's administration's slashing of federal government.\n\nBut some Republicans are doing it anyway.\n\nConsider Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., who held a town hall on Tuesday evening, knowing he'd be booed and jeered but knowing also that it was part of the job to hear from the people he represents.\n\n\"I know that there are some angry people in my congressional district,\" he told a reporter following the event. \"I also know there's a lot of people who feel like America's back on track. Tonight, I put myself here because I think there's value just in allowing somebody to come express themselves.\"\n\nBiggs likely thinks so too, as long as you're a Republican.\n\nI sent a note to Biggs on Tuesday, asking if he plans to hold a town hall open to all of his constituents.\n\nImagine my surprise to be met with crickets.\n\nReach Roberts at laurie.roberts@arizonarepublic.com .

      "text": "Why do I criticize Trump so much if I'm conservative? I expect better from GOP. | Opinion\n\nI receive dozens of emails weekly from people labelling me a RINO , a Democrat in disguise, or a cog in the left wing propaganda machine. Naturally, these emails don't warrant a response, but they do raise an interesting question collectively.\n\nWhy is it so bad to criticize my party or the people leading it?\n\nThe people who attack my frequent criticism of President Donald Trump and the direction of the Republican Party are wrong about my motivations. I'm more conservative than the vast majority of those people might think. But I believe it's more important to be critical of your party than it is to cover up deficiencies.\n\nWe should not be scared of criticizing our leaders as a way to strengthen conservatives in the future. The GOP will become weaker if we are unwilling to point out its blemishes.\n\nThe Trump administration lacks the moral foundation and conservative principles to truly represent a conservative outlook on American politics. Trump's expansion of power for himself, disregard for norms and the law, and his own character problems warrant criticism from those who claim to be conservative.\n\nIt is true that I still agree with the GOP platform far more than I do with the Democrats', which many people find hard to square with the majority of my columns.\n\nBut I'm harder on the GOP because I expect more from conservatives. Before Trump, Republicans had a consistent belief system rooted in a handful of core principles, such as limited government and free markets. Now, that is just not true.\n\nToday's GOP is abandoning that structure by supporting policy ideas like the expansion of tariffs , challenges to the separation of powers , and a blind alliance of the party to Trump. Even Congress has decided against legislating a conservative agenda despite having control of both chambers.\n\nWe see this in the news media, as well.\n\nMany conservatives in the media approach their coverage as a balancing of the mainstream outlets, which generally do favor Democrats, especially in the Trump era. These people ask softball questions, provide cover for Republicans and excuse away Trump's behavior. Organizations like Fox News do little better the Republican Party by catering to it.\n\nThis approach is unproductive for several reasons. By protecting Republican politicians, conservative media limits the flow of information to red state voters. Voters then become less informed, and more likely to base their decisions on that limited information.\n\nThat's fine if you want a voter base with a fraction of the information. I don't.\n\nHolding conservatives to the proper standards is part of making conservatism stronger. Iron sharpens iron, and if we want to produce the best candidates, we have no business taking it easy on conservative leaders, even if we're on the same team.\n\nThe start of the moral decline was when the Republican Party allowed Trump to be its presidential nominee, despite his many character issues.\n\nThe rationale for supporting Trump in 2016 was that holding your nose and voting for him was worth it because he was better than the alternative. A similar reasoning was employed in 2024, although by then more of the Republican Party had become Trump die-hards despite his 2020 loss.\n\nThe teardown of the party's principles led to the reshaping of the GOP for the single purpose of enabling Trump to win elections without regard for the long-term consequences. His administration operates with minimal checks and balances because of Republican acceptance.\n\nThis is why I've been willing to abstain from voting for Trump in the last two election cycles and will remain critical of policies I disagree with. His removal from the GOP is more important than winning any election.\n\nI do not believe that one election can doom the country. I do, however, believe that several consecutive election cycles that tear down political norms can stress the fabric of our Republic, which is precisely what the \"win at all costs\" attitude has done to our country over the past decade.\n\nRepublicans should make decisions based on what is good for conservatism in the long run, rather than their short-term election prospects. I know this is an unrealistic ask. But I'll keep asking ‒ and people can keep emailing me about how they disagree.\n\nDace Potas is an opinion columnist for USA TODAY and a graduate of DePaul University with a degree in political science."

      "text": "Red alert? Trump challenged as Dems win Wisconsin, Republican margins sag in Florida\n\nIs that a patch of blue sky?\n\nDemocrats, who haven't had much good news lately, prevailed Tuesday in an election for the Wisconsin Supreme Court - notable because it was for the swing vote on the top court in the nation's quintessential swing state.\n\nThough Republicans held on to two Florida congressional seats in special elections, the GOP's margin in the solidly red districts was slashed compared with just five months ago. A yawning advantage of 33 percentage points for Donald Trump in Florida's 1st district and 30 points in the 6th district was cut by half, to about 14 points.\n\nVictories, yes, but with a red flag attached.\n\nTo be clear, one state court seat and two congressional races that were closer than before do not a landslide make. The unending onslaught of news, including Trump's promise to impose global tariffs on Wednesday, will quickly compete for attention. By the midterm elections next year, the nation may have been transformed in one way or another.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nAfter 72 disruptive days of President Trump 2.0, the trio of contests provided the first significant electoral test of how he's doing. Not the assessments of polls, pols and pundits, but the votes cast by citizens.\n\nThe message: The GOP has maintained its narrow hold on the House. But Democrats have a pulse.\n\nAs the polls were closing in Florida, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey was trying to make a similar point - that resistance to Trump is alive and energized - as he broke the record for delivering the longest Senate speech in history. For just over 25 hours, he had held the floor to decry the direction Trump has taken the country on immigration and the economy and national security.\n\n\"This is the moral moment,\" he declared in his emotional conclusion.\n\nThat said, Booker's marathon speech ended with applause but not with action - a demonstration of Democrats' lack of clout as Republicans control the capital's platforms of power, at the White House and the Senate and the House.\n\nThat didn't change Tuesday.\n\nIn the Florida races, Republican Jimmy Patronis won the seat vacated by the scandal-ridden Rep. Matt Gaetz , who resigned when Trump nominated him , briefly, as attorney general. Republican Randy Fine succeeded Rep. Mike Waltz, now the White House national security adviser.\n\nOne surprise: Republican strategists considered Patronis a strong candidate and Fine a weak one, with national Republicans dumping in money and attention to assure Fine's victory. But the two candidates performed almost precisely the same - 56.7% for Fine, 56.9% for Patronis.\n\nThat could indicate voters were thinking nationally, less about their local representative and more about the man in the White House.\n\nRepublicans now have 220 House seats, Democrats 213. The two remaining vacancies, in Arizona and Texas, are in solidly blue districts and are likely to bring the Democrats to 215 when those special elections are held.\n\nAssuming that happens, the GOP would have a five-seat majority in the House - meaning Speaker Mike Johnson , R-La., could afford to lose no more than two votes to guarantee a majority.\n\nThat is so close that Trump has pulled his nomination of New York Rep. Elise Stefanik as United Nations ambassador amid concern about whether Republicans would hold her seat - in a district Trump had carried by 20 points.\n\nTrump has had experience with the omens special elections can carry. In the first year of his first term, there were six special House elections, and control didn't change in any of them. But Republican candidates lost ground compared with 2016, and Democrats gained.\n\nThe next year, Democrats picked up a stunning 41 House seats and regained control, setting the stage for a more formidable opposition and, as it turned out, two impeachment votes.\n\nYou would think spending $20 million or so on behalf of the conservative Supreme Court nominee would buy you some friends.\n\nAs it turned out, Elon Musk's record-breaking spending either wasn't enough or actually proved to be a liability. Liberal circuit court judge Susan Crawford tied her conservative opponent, county judge Brad Schimel, to Musk at every turn. Schimel tried to keep his distance.\n\n\"Wisconsin beat the billionaire,\" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz , the Democrats' vice presidential nominee in their losing race last year, crowed in a post on X .\n\nWisconsin is accustomed to nail-biter races. In 2020, Trump lost the Badger State by less than one percentage point; in 2024 he won it by less than one percentage point.\n\nBut the margin Tuesday wasn't close, and the race was called just an hour or so after the polls had closed. Crawford, backed by Democrats in the officially nonpartisan contest, was safely ahead by double digits, 55%-45%, with 95% of the vote counted.\n\nNext up: the off-year gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia."

Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and ardent Trump supporter, made headlines when he spoke out -- first on Fox News last week and in recent days on his podcast \"Verdict.\"\n\n\"Tariffs are a tax on consumers, and I'm not a fan of jacking up taxes on American consumers, so my hope is these tariffs are short-lived, and they serve as leverage to lower tariffs across the globe,\" Cruz told Fox Business host Larry Kudlow.\n\nMORE: US stocks plunge as tariffs rattle markets worldwide\n\nCruz reiterated that point on his podcast, saying it would be a win if the administration used the policy as leverage to quickly negotiate down tariffs imposed by other nations but if it stays in place long term it could increase inflation, hurt job growth and possibly put the U.S. into a recession -- the latter of which Cruz said would result in a \"bloodbath\" for the Republican Party in the 2026 midterm election.\n\n\"If we're in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now with massive American tariffs and massive tariffs on American goods in every other country on Earth, it's a terrible outcome,\" he said on Friday.\n\nDuring an episode of his podcast on Monday, Cruz said that while Trump's tariffs were \"important\"-- especially in order to bring manufacturing jobs back to America -- it would be \"really bad\" for the country if they remain permanent rather than used as a short-term negotiation tool.\n\nCruz suggested there was a \"very active debate within the White House\" over how to move forward.\n\n\"Do we use this as leverage to lower other countries' tariffs and then lower our own tariffs to reflect that? Or do we leave these tariffs up forever and ever and ever?\" Cruz said. \"There are angels and demons... on each of President Trump's shoulders, urging him to use them as leverage or keep them forever.\"\n\nCruz said that Elon Musk was one of the \"angels,\" based on recent comments the tech billionaire made about his hope for lower tariffs and \"complete freedom of trade between the United States and Europe.\"\n\n\"So when I talked about angels and demons ... Elon is one of the angels. This is a good, good voice that is focused on us, jobs that I hope the president is listening to. I hope the president is listening to Elon Musk.\"\n\nAsked on Monday to respond to the comments from his fellow Texas Republican, Sen. John Cornyn told reporters, \"Obviously nobody wants a recession, but I expect -- it looks like here at least in the near term -- that there's deals to be made. And President Trump if he's anything he's a deal maker and I remain hopeful that a deal can be made on many of these tariffs that will avoid any negative economic consequences long term.\"\n\nTrump officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Agriculture Secretary Broke Rollins, were confronted with his comments during Sunday morning news shows. They largely sidestepped the comments as they projected optimism about the policy's long term impact.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, voiced similar concerns as Cruz.\n\n\"Tariffs are taxes and Americans are paying the price,\" Paul wrote on X last week.\n\nPaul also spoke on the Senate floor criticizing Trump's argument that the tariffs are necessary because of what he claimed was a \"national emergency\" regarding trade deficits. Paul said Congress needed to reassert its constitutional power to regulate tariffs and foreign trade.\n\nMORE: Businesses, conservative lawyers planning legal challenge to Trump's tariffs\n\n\"I am a Republican. I am a supporter of Donald Trump ,\" Paul said. \"But this is a bipartisan problem. I don't care if the president is a Republican or a Democrat. I don't want to live under emergency rule. I don't want to live where my representatives cannot speak for me and have a check and balance on power.\"\n\n\"One person can make a mistake and guess what -- tariffs are a terrible mistake,\" Paul said.\n\nMORE: Businesses, conservative lawyers planning legal challenge to Trump's tariffs\n\n\"Tariffs are like whiskey: A little whiskey, under the right circumstances, can be refreshing -- but too much whiskey, under the wrong circumstances, can make you drunk as a goat,\" Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said last week.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, introduced a bill last week that would require Congress to approve any new tariffs. Grassley teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell on the legislation.\n\nCantwell said on CBS News \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that seven Republicans were on board with the bill. Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told CBS he was \"beginning support\" for a similar measure in the House.\n\nBut the legislation faces an uphill battle, as it would need significant Republican support in both chambers to pass and Speaker Mike Johnson opposes the the idea.\n\nAnd so far, there are limited signs of any widespread cracks in overall support for Trump.\n\nSen. John Barrasso, a member of Republican leadership, said on Sunday that he believed Trump's actions on tariffs were constitutional.\n\n\"So, in terms of the tariffs, I believe they're a tool, and I think we have to go after China,\" Barrasso said on CBS. \"They have been abusing us for years, and I believe the President is on firm constitutional grounds.\"\n\nOn Monday, according to a White House statement sent to Senate Republicans and obtained by ABC News, Trump vowed to veto a bipartisan bill seeking to limit his authority to impose tariffs\n\n\"If passed, this bill would dangerously hamper the President's authority and duty to determine our foreign policy and protect our national security,\" the statement reads.\n\nHouse and Senate lawmakers are returning to Washington on Monday.\n\nABC News' Allison Pecorin and Jay O'Brien contributed to this report.\n\nRepublicans Ted Cruz, Rand Paul speak out on risks of Trump tariff policy originally appeared on abcnews.go.com"

      "text": "Top Republican Takes Rachel Maddow's Advice on Trump's Tariffs\n\nManage your account\n\nOne of the Senate's most powerful Republicans seemed to take a page out of Rachel Maddow's playbook Thursday by attempting to claw back some of Congress' power over tariffs.\n\nChuck Grassley, the 91-year-old senior Republican senator from Iowa, jointly introduced a measure Thursday with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington to ensure Congress has a say in the president's tariff decisions. He is the president pro tempore of the chamber, making him the presiding officer and second-in-command behind the vice-president.\n\nThe measure lists that Congress would need to be notified \"no later than 48 hours\" of a tariff imposition or increase by the president. Moreover, Trump would also need to submit an \"explanation of the reasoning for imposing or increasing the duty\" and an assessment of the imposition's impact.\n\nCongress would then have 60 days to approve any new tariffs, and would also have the power to end any tariff when necessary.\n\n\"Congress has a constitutional role through the Commerce Clause on trade matters, and we should reassume that role,\" Grassley told reporters in a press call Tuesday, according to Politico . Meanwhile Republican Senator Thom Tillis similarly told reporters Thursday that Congress should have more of a say in Trump's tariff decisions and said, \"I think there's something to be said for having congressional review.\"\n\nThe proposal came just hours after MSNBC host Rachel Maddow laid out a similar plan during her monologue Wednesday night, urging Congress to reassert control over the country's tariff decisions.\n\n\"The actual way to stop this dictatorship mid-catastrophe, the way to stop this part of Trump's one-man wrecking-ball operation against the U.S. economy is for Congress to do something very simple, for Congress to simply declare with a simple majority vote that actually there isn't an emergency,\" Maddow said, referring to how Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 while announcing tariffs on global trade partners Wednesday.\n\n\"Yes, Trump proclaimed an economic emergency. That's how he gave himself these emergency powers,\" Maddow continued. \"But Congress could simply just say, 'Actually, no, there isn't an economic emergency. So no, he no longer has these powers. He is no longer empowered to singlehandedly drunk-drive our country into this particular wall.' They could do that.\"\n\nMaddow's plan was partially employed by the Senate Wednesday after four Republican senators -Susan Collins, Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, and Rand Paul-joined Democrats to pass a resolution rescinding the White House's emergency declaration on Canada.\n\nThe anchor acknowledged however that the plan is likely to not come to fruition, as House Speaker Mike Johnson moved to prevent a floor vote that would have ended the many national emergencies Trump has employed to impose tariffs.\n\n\"In other words, there is a cure to this disease. There is a readily available, dramatically effective, proven legal antidote to this poison, and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson grabbed it out of our hands and flushed it down the toilet to make sure we can never take it, so Donald Trump can keep doing this to the economy,\" Maddow said. \"Are you tired of all the winning?\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on several of the United States' biggest trading partners, including the European Union and China. Several countries have since announced retaliatory tariffs, with the prospect of a full-scale, global trade war quickly becoming a reality."

      "text": "Tentative deal is reached in Republican fight over proxy voting for new parents\n\nManage your account\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - A tentative deal has been reached with the Florida Republican leading a bipartisan push to allow proxy voting in the U.S. House for new parents, potentially ending a standoff that halted legislative work for days and threatened to delay a vote this week to advance President Donald Trump's agenda.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson and Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, who has been leading the bipartisan push on proxy voting, reached the deal, Luna said in a social media post on Sunday.\n\nRather than allow proxy voting, Luna said the agreement would formalize a \"pairing\" system long used in Congress where one member who is physically present in the House cancels out the vote of someone who is absent. Luna said the voting option would be open to all Republicans who are unable to vote, including new parents, the bereaved and lawmakers facing various medical and family emergencies.\n\n\"If we truly want a pro-family Congress, these are the changes that need to happen,\" Luna said.\n\nNo further details were immediately available. It was also unclear if the deal would be agreed to by the other lawmakers who had signed on to the proxy voting proposal.\n\nThe agreement with Luna could end days of back-and-forth over allowing new parents in Congress to vote by proxy for 12 weeks as they care for their newborns. Johnson has vigorously opposed the effort, calling it an affront to the Constitution that would open \"Pandora's box.\"\n\nBut some Republicans refused to go along with Johnson's bid to kill the resolution, with nine of them defying him in a vote last week.\n\nBy reaching a deal, Republican leaders will likely be able to move ahead this week on key legislative priorities - most critically a revised version of the budget framework that opens the door to Trump's push for trillions of dollars in tax breaks. The Senate approved that budget framework early Saturday morning after grinding through a late-night session.\n\nTrump had said he was in favor of allowing proxy voting for new parents after speaking with Luna, though he said he would defer to Johnson how the House should operate. \"I don't know why it's controversial,\" Trump said.\n\nLuna, who gave birth during her first term in Congress, had championed the proxy voting resolution alongside Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado, who has a 4-month-old son. The effort drew significant bipartisan support, with 218 lawmakers - the majority of the House, many young parents themselves - signing onto a petition that could trigger a floor vote.\n\nThe resolution would allow proxy voting for lawmakers who have given birth or pregnant lawmakers who are unable to travel safely or have a serious medical condition. It would also apply to lawmakers whose spouses are pregnant or giving birth.\n\nPettersen, who has carried her son onto the floor during recent House votes, said the institution needs to change with the times. About a dozen women have given birth while in Congress over the years, and there are many new fathers as well.\n\n\"It is unfathomable that in 2025 we have not modernized Congress,\" she said.\n\nBut Johnson, like GOP leaders before him, loathes proxy voting, which had been put in place for about two years during the COVID-19 lockdowns when Democrats had control of the House.\n\n\"It was quickly abused. Republicans put an end to it then, and we cannot allow it again,\" Johnson said in a social media post."

Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) steered clear of criticizing Donald Trump on Friday when confronted on CNN about the stock market free fall happening on the president's watch.\n\n\"Sir, is this Donald Trump's economy now?\" CNN 's Kasie Hunt bluntly asked.\n\n\"Well, I don't know that I'd call it that,\" Burchett replied.\n\nHunt swiftly raised her eyebrows after hearing the claim, \"Really?\"\n\nBurchett proceeded to ask whether CNN would use the term \"Donald Trump's economy\" when the now-tumbling stock market \"turns around,\" parroting the president's prediction that the economy will eventually \"boom\" after a \"minor disturbance\" caused by his sweeping tariffs.\n\nHe added that he didn't recall the network hosting panels \"railing\" on President Joe Biden 's economy, a claim that Hunt shut down by noting that former Biden White House communications director Kate Bedingfield was sitting next to her off camera.\n\n\"She was in a number of tough situations where we talked plenty about those issues,\" said Hunt of Bedingfield, a CNN analyst.\n\nAfter seconds of crosstalk, Hunt noted that Trump has recently tied his predecessor to the state of the economy, claiming that he inherited an \"economic catastrophe\" and \"inflation nightmare\" from Biden.\n\nAt the end of Biden's presidency, experts said the economy - broadly speaking - was in a good place .\n\n\"Voters are willing to give new presidents the benefit of the doubt in those circumstances. Do you really not see yesterday as a line in the sand before he could argue it was Biden's and now he has to - whatever happens good or bad - own that?\" she asked of Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement .\n\nBurchett, in response, declared that \"everybody knew\" the economy was going to \"take a hit.\"\n\n\"But economists will tell you can stack up a group that'll say no and the other ones will say yes, that the market is not really a good indicator,\" he claimed.\n\nTrump himself often used a booming stock market to tout his handling of the economy in his first term but he's been notably quiet in his current administration, The New York Times noted early last month.\n\n\"We've had the best stock market which is - whether you like stock market or not, it's a leading indicator, the all-time leading indicator,\" he told reporters outside Air Force One in 2020.\n\nTrump Posts Dark 5-Word Message From His Motorcade\n\nTrump Admin Guts Entire Teams Studying IVF, Maternal Health\n\nTrump Claims Investors Can Get 'RICHER THAN EVER' Amid U.S. Stock Market Turmoil"

      "text": "An anti-Trump Republican for governor tries to defy gravity in New Jersey's primary\n\nManage your account\n\nIn a Republican primary for governor dominated by fealty to President Donald Trump, a moderate long shot is trying to make up for his anti-Trumpism by running to the right of his opponents on immigration.\n\nJon Bramnick, a Republican state senator, is a two-decade Trenton insider with close ties to former Gov. Chris Christie, persona non-grata in Trump world.\n\nBut Bramnick is trying something novel by fully embracing an element of Trumpism that is most popular in New Jersey. Even as he boasts his longtime criticism of the president will help him win a general election, Bramnick has put out an immigration platform that's even more conservative than what's offered by his higher-profile, pro-Trump rivals, Jack Ciattarelli and Bill Spadea.\n\n\"The media always wants to say 'spoiler,' 'moderate' or 'never Trump.' How about just saying, 'Hey, listen, here's how the guy did over the last 25 years and evaluate it,'\" Bramnick, who's from Union County, said in a phone interview. \"I just don't think you should come to conclusions until we get a lot closer to June 10. Just watch how things evolve.\"\n\nBramnick is touting a hard-line record on immigration and pushing in the Statehouse to crack down on undocumented immigrants who commit crimes. It could make Bramnick, who is moderate on most other issues, appealing to the more conservative members of his party. Public polling last year showed a majority of New Jersey voters have shifted to the right on immigration since 2022.\n\nBramnick is far from the front-runner, and he's still largely considered a long shot for the nomination. But his campaign has shown staying power that's surprised some Republicans. He's also proven to be able to win an election with a Democratic-leaning electorate. In 2023, Bramnick won his district by 7 points. In 2024, Kamala Harris won it by 12.\n\nTrump's stronger-than-expected showing in New Jersey in November, where he lost by just 6 points, buoyed Republican hopes that the once solidly blue state is turning purple. But recent polling shows Trump is unpopular in the state. This year's race will test whether Trump's strong showing has a downstream effect within his party. Bramnick is betting it doesn't.\n\nAnd although he is against Trump, Bramnick is trying in campaign mailers and TV ads to appeal to the president's supporters on policy.\n\nOne flyer, which calls Bramnick \"the only candidate for governor with a conservative record on immigration,\" attacks Ciattarelli and Spadea for being \"shockingly liberal\" on the issue, quoting Spadea as saying he believes in amnesty for undocumented immigrants and Ciattarelli's support for allowing them to get driver's licenses.\n\nThe flyer highlights Bramnick's votes against New Jersey's 2019 legislation allowing undocumented immigrants to get driver's licenses and a 2013 law allowing undocumented students who went to high school in New Jersey to qualify for in-state college tuition. A Bramnick TV ad hits on the same issues and calls him \"the toughest candidate on immigration\" and a \"tested conservative who can win.\"\n\nLast week, Bramnick introduced the \"New Jersey Laken Riley Act,\" NJ S4302 , which would require undocumented immigrants charged with any indictable offenses be held in jail and allow local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n\nDespite those long years as a politician - he was a councilmember in Plainfield in the 1980s and early 1990s and first entered the Legislature as an Assemblymember in 2003 - Bramnick's name recognition is wanting. A March 6 poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University found it at just 43 percent among Republicans - significantly under Ciattarelli's 78 percent and Spadea's 54 percent.\n\nBut as Spadea and Ciattarelli have savaged each other in ads and on the debate stage, Bramnick has been left largely untouched, including vulnerable areas like his relationship with Christie - a political ally he backed for president against Trump.\n\nIn a statement, Ciattarelli strategist Chris Russell didn't ignore Bramnick, instead calling him \"barely a Republican\" and knocking him for hosting Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in the backyard of his home in 2021. At the time, Ciattarelli was running for the Republican primary to take on Murphy, which he would win before losing the general election by a surprisingly small 3-point margin.\n\n\"He can't credibly run to the right of anyone on any issue,\" Russell said. \"When Phil Murphy raised our taxes, exploded our budget, killed seniors in nursing homes and made us a sanctuary state, Jon Bramnick had him over for hot dogs and hamburgers.\"\n\nOn the debate stage in February, Bramnick openly criticized the president's pardon of violent Jan. 6 rioters, drawing loud boos from the audience. \"Let me make this clear: Either we're the party of law and order or we're not,\" Bramnick said in response. \"You can clap, you can boo if you want, but I will stand with police officers every time.\"\n\nCiattarelli and Spadea have taken the opposite approach, heaping praise on Trump at every opportunity and courting his endorsement. Just last month, Ciattarelli got a coveted meeting with Trump at his golf club in Bedminster, only to be followed by news that Spadea also enjoyed a brief meeting with the president the following day.\n\n\"Jon's not pretending, and I think that's resonating with people as he goes around the state,\" said Mike DuHaime, a friend of Bramnick's who is working as a campaign consultant. \"He's not going to back away from who his friends are, who he's worked with in the past.\"\n\nAnd though Bramnick's fundraising has not been stellar, it has been enough to keep him in the race. He's raised enough to qualify for matching funds from the state, getting nearly $2.8 million so far .\n\nDan Cassino, director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University poll, said Bramnick is trying to walk the line of not supporting Trump while appealing to his voters. Instead of professing support for the president, as the other candidates are, Cassino said he's \"trying to reframe\" the debate.\n\n\"Instead of being who's the most pro-Trump candidate, let's talk about an issue: Who's the most anti-undocumented immigrant candidate,\" Cassino said. \"I think it's a perfectly reasonable strategy. The question is whether the other candidates will actually get drawn into the debate without just talking about Trump.\""

Tim Kaine of Virginia offered them a potential off-ramp to the tariffs levied on Canadian imports, Republican leaders were trying to keep senators in line by focusing on fentanyl that comes into the U.S. over its northern border. It was yet another example of how Trump is not only reorienting global economics, but upending his party's longtime support for ideas like free trade.\n\n\"I really relish giving my Republican colleagues the chance to not just say they're concerned, but actually take an action to stop these tariffs,\" Kaine told The Associated Press in an interview last week.\n\nKaine's resolution would end the emergency declaration that Trump signed in February to implement tariffs on Canada as punishment for not doing enough to halt the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S. If the Senate passes the resolution, it would still need to be taken up by the Republican-controlled House.\n\nA small fraction of the fentanyl that comes into the U.S. enters from Canada. Customs and Border Protection seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the northern border during the 2024 fiscal year, and since January, authorities have seized less than 1.5 pounds, according to federal data . Meanwhile, at the southern border, authorities seized over 21,000 pounds last year.\n\nDemocrats warned that tariffs on Canadian goods would ripple through the economy, making it more expensive to build homes, outfit military ships and pay for daily goods.\n\n\"These tariffs are a tax increase on American families - plain and simple,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He argued that the increased costs for American households were being done \"simply to give a tax cut to Trump's billionaire friends.\"\n\nSchumer said he agrees with taking on China \"which really has hurt us in trade every step of the way.\" But the tariffs don't make sense for an ally whose economy is so interconnected with the U.S. economy. He added the tariffs are creating uncertainty with businesses and consumers.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday, Kaine said fentanyl trafficking is an emergency, but that the emergency stems from China and Mexico, not Canada. He said Trump invented a \"made-up emergency\" to help pay for extending tax cuts that he said primarily benefit the wealthy.\n\n\"How are they going to pay for it? Massive cuts in programs like Medicaid and Medicare, and tariffs imposed on the backs of everyday Americans,\" Kaine said.\n\nStill, Trump has claimed that the amount of fentanyl coming from Canada is \"massive\" and pledged to follow through by executing tariffs Wednesday.\n\n\"We are making progress to end this terrible Fentanyl Crisis, but Republicans in the Senate MUST vote to keep the National Emergency in place, so we can finish the job, and end the scourge,\"\n\nStill, a few of Republicans have indicated they are considering voting for the legislation, which would need just a simple majority to pass the Senate.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said she was still examining the bill, yet added she supported its \"intent\" because \"Canadian tariffs are disastrous for the state of Maine.\"\n\n\"Canada's our friends and our ally, and this is not China we're talking about. It's not an adversarial nation. It's our biggest trading partner, and this just makes no sense,\" she added.\n\nRepublican leaders in the Senate have signaled they aren't exactly fans of tariffs, but argued that Trump is using them as a negotiating tool.\n\n\"I think all of us are anxious to see - and we'll wait to see - what the president actually comes out with in terms of tariff policy tomorrow, but I don't think that should change people's vote,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters at the Capitol.\n\nHe added that the emergency declaration was made to \"deal with the flow of fentanyl.\"\n\nWhile Trump's close allies in the Senate were standing steadfastly by the idea of remaking the U.S. economy through tariffs, others have begun openly voicing their dissatisfaction with trade wars that could disrupt industries and raise prices on autos, groceries, housing and other goods.\n\n\"I'm keeping a close eye on all these tariffs because oftentimes the first folks that are hurt in a trade war are your farmers and ranchers,\" said Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican.\n\nSen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said he would prefer to see the U.S. and its trading partners move to remove all tariffs on each other, but he conceded that Trump's tariff threats had injected uncertainty into global markets.\n\n\"We're in uncharted waters,\" Kennedy told reporters. \"Nobody knows what the impact of these tariffs is going to be.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed reporting."

      "text": "JD Vance's role in Signal chat angers senior Republican lawmakers\n\nManage your account\n\nWASHINGTON - Vice President JD Vance's last-minute concerns about President Donald Trump's decision to strike the Houthis in Yemen, raised in a now-public Signal chat with other top U.S. officials, have left senior Republican lawmakers angry.\n\nSome are upset because they think Vance was trying to block a directive from Trump. Others, reflecting a broader debate inside the administration and the GOP over the wisdom of embarking on a stepped-up campaign against the militant group, are upset about the side he took.\n\nTrump has campaigned and governed on the idea that America should be put first and its traditional allies and conflicts overseas second. But his administration is now making moves that reflect the potential for a protracted military campaign against the Houthis.\n\nObservers say the debate over the Yemen strikes is the difference between MAGA world, which tends to be against helping the Europeans while focusing on Asia, and garden-variety Republicans, who think the U.S. should not abandon issues in the Middle East.\n\nThe Pentagon has moved an additional aircraft carrier and its attendant ships into the region, joining the USS Harry Truman carrier strike group already there. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized at least two Patriot missile defense batteries from Asia to be moved to the Middle East, two U.S. officials and one defense official told NBC News.\n\nAnd in a move that suggests thoughts of a sustained campaign in the Middle East, NBC News has also learned from one U.S. official and another person familiar with the matter that defense officials have approved the relocation of a large missile system known as a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, a more complex effort.\n\nAt the same time, the military has acknowledged in a statement that it quietly moved multiple B-2 bombers, C-17 cargo jets and KC-135 refueling tankers to Diego Garcia, a tiny island in the Indian Ocean that has been used as a hub for operations in the Middle East in the past. The B-2 bombers can carry the largest bombs in the U.S. arsenal, including bunker buster bombs that could be useful against Houthi militants, who are known to bury sites deep into the ground to protect them.\n\nAll of these moves signal a commitment to a sustained fight against the Houthis with the purpose of finally neutralizing the group, which is armed by Iran and has caused havoc to shipping routes through the Red Sea, and potentially deterring Tehran.\n\nMany Republicans on Capitol Hill are generally happy to see the Trump administration take the fight to the Houthis.\n\nVance's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nThe fact that Vance had questioned Trump's directive to conduct the strikes has largely been lost in the controversy over top administration officials discussing the military plans over Signal, and the inadvertent inclusion of The Atlantic's editor-in-chief in that chat.\n\nTaking what some believe is a pro-MAGA, anti-European position, Vance argued in the discussion on Signal that with the strikes, the U.S. was doing the work of European freeloaders, since, he said, the lion's share of Red Sea shipping is attributed to their economies.\n\nThat has angered some Republicans who believe Vance was about to obstruct the president's wishes in a way they see as comparable to how some top Trump aides acted during his first administration .\n\n\"I think we are making a mistake,\" Vance wrote in the Signal chat , later published by The Atlantic. Vance argued that although Trump wanted to send a message with the strikes, \"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now.\" He did say, though, that he was \"willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,\" but went on to say \"there is a strong argument for delaying this a month.\"\n\nMinutes later, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller shut down the conversation, writing, \"As I heard it, the president was clear.\"\n\nVance's questioning of the move on the Signal chat, which did not include Trump, has angered hawkish Republicans who were frustrated with what they felt were the Biden administration's muted efforts to go after the Houthis and who celebrate Trump's intention to go after senior leaders.\n\n\"Capitol Hill Republicans still have their jaws on their floor with how actively the VP worked to try and undo a Trump decision,\" one senior Republican official on Capitol Hill said in a text. \"Thank goodness Miller stepped in and put him in his place.\"\n\nThe senior Republican official added: \"It's one thing to have a healthy interagency debate before a decision is made. It's another to try and undo a Commander-in-Chief decision once Trump gives the execute order. This is the latter, and it's very [John] Bolton-esque.\"\n\nSome Republicans believe Vance raising questions about an action the president had already agreed to amounted to a form of obstruction, the same senior Republican official said.\n\n\"The president was not aware how inconsistent this is with his own messaging?\" another Republican on Capitol Hill asked, quoting Vance. \"These are the president's policies, and for JD Vance to question them like that is ridiculous. He is the commander in chief.\"\n\nBut some Trump administration officials believe privately that the U.S. should wash its hands of the conflict and move on. They worry that if he doesn't, Trump could get himself mired in a campaign that will prevent him from extracting the U.S. from the Middle East's problems, according to one current administration official, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\n\"It's 2002 all over again,\" the official said, referring to the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nDana Stroul, who was the top policy official in the Pentagon for the Middle East under Biden and is now a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said, \"I think Yemen will be the first test case of these opposing ideological positions in the Trump administration. This is the beginning of a campaign, and for the campaign to be successful, you need to be prepared to go for months if not longer.\"\n\nAfter Trump pours resources into the region, it will be difficult to pull them back out again, she said.\n\n\"When the president realizes months from now how tied down he is in the region, he might be frustrated to learn it is difficult to quickly change course without tremendous risk.\"\n\nBiden was often criticized by both Senate and House Republicans for being overly careful when it came to targeting the Houthis, but Stroul said the Biden administration's strategy was to keep a lid on the Houthis without getting pulled in altogether.\n\nGen. Michael Erik Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, presented strike packages to the Pentagon several times last year that included targeting Houthi leaders, specifically those involved in the militants' drone and missile program, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials.\n\n\"The Biden White House wasn't approving targets even when they had solid intel with multiple U.S. agencies and allies backing up the info, specifically when they include targeting people,\" said a former U.S. official with knowledge of the operations.\n\nBut two former U.S. officials, who worked in the White House during the Biden administration, said some of Kurilla's plans were not approved because they weren't based on solid intelligence, the possibility of civilian casualties was high, and Kurilla was consistently prepared to accept higher risk than the Pentagon and White House. The two former U.S. officials said obtaining actionable intelligence was hard because the U.S. lacked sources on the ground and drones were often jammed or shot down.\n\nStill, there was no \"knee-jerk opposition\" to targeting Houthi leaders, one of the former U.S. officials said.\n\nRepresentatives for Kurilla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThings changed in January 2025, when the combination of good intelligence shared by Israel and stepped-up intelligence by the U.S. put Washington in a better position to strike the Houthis, the two former U.S. officials said. They said Biden administration officials believed that they could have acted at that point, but that executing the plan correctly would have taken months and would have meant starting an operation just before Inauguration Day and boxing in the Trump administration. So Biden administration officials essentially bequeathed the plan to the Trump administration, which is now beginning to execute it.\n\nDefense Department officials say the strikes in Yemen will continue. \"This is a sustained, ongoing operation targeting Houthi leadership,\" a defense official said in a statement. \"At the direction of the president, CENTCOM continues to conduct strikes across multiple Iran-backed Houthi locations every day and night to restore freedom of navigation and restore American deterrence.\"\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com"

      "text": "Republicans win twice in Florida but results may stoke anxiety about midterms\n\nRepublicans have won a closely watched special Florida congressional election but with a much reduced majority that will make them uneasy about next year's midterms.\n\nRepublican State Senator Randy Fine defeated Democrat Josh Weil to fill the seat that was held by National Security Advisor Michael Waltz.\n\nThe result dashes Democratic hopes of pulling what would have been a stunning upset in a district that Donald Trump carried by 30 points in last November's presidential election.\n\nThe Republican prevailed in the other Florida special election, to fill the seat vacated by firebrand conservative Congressman Matt Gaetz.\n\nThat contest never drew the kind of national fundraising dollars, or attention, that the Fine-Weil matchup garnered.\n\nBut the narrow margin of Fine's victory, down to around 14 points, is likely to stoke some Republican anxiety about their prospects in the national mid-term congressional elections in 2025.\n\nDemocrat Weil, a strong Gaza supporter who clashed with Fine's anti-Palestinian stance, made waves by raising more than $12m in campaign donations, compared to the approximately $1m brought in by his opponent. That disparity, along with polls that showed a contest within the margin of error, had put this congressional race in the national spotlight.\n\nIt also prompted a last-minute influx of national Republican support that included telephone town halls by Trump and other prominent conservatives. Those efforts appear to have paid off, as Republican turnout climbed in the final days of early voting and in-person ballots cast by Republicans exceeded party expectations on election day.\n\nAt a polling location at a library in Daytona Beach, a steady stream of voters clad in American flag hats and Trump paraphernalia served as a vivid illustration of a last-minute surge of conservative support for Fine.\n\n\"People are getting the message that they need to turn out to vote,\" said Mary Fikert, a Fine campaign volunteer stationed at a small tent in the library's expansive parking lot. \"It was embarrassing that it was so close.\"\n\nRepublicans still hold only a narrow majority in the House of Representatives after Tuesday's results, but it appears to be a sustainable margin through next year's election, improving what would have been gloomy prospects of advancing Trump's legislative agenda if Fine had been defeated.\n\nDemocrats may be buoyed by the relative success achieved by Weil, a public school teacher who has never held elective office. His message focused on what he characterised as the dire consequences of the White House's efforts to slash government programmes and personnel. That resonated in the conservative region, which is populated by military veterans and retirees, although it was not enough to carry him to victory.\n\nEven before results were announced, Democrats predicted that their progress here in Florida would be a harbinger of larger success in next year's congressional mid-term elections. That remains to be seen.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, will be relieved that electoral disaster was averted, even if some candidates in more closely contested races next year face a less hospitable political climate than they enjoyed in 2024.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Republican rebels try to stop Trump's Canada tariffs\n\nFour Republican US senators have broken ranks and voted with the Democrats in an effort to block President Donald Trump's tariffs against Canada.\n\nIn a rare display of opposition to the president, Lisa Murkowski, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul and Susan Collins helped to vote through a resolution 51 to 48 to end Trump's emergency declaration on fentanyl trafficking that he has used to justify tariffs on Canadian imports.\n\n\"As I have always warned, tariffs are bad policy, and trade wars with our partners hurt working people most,\" McConnell said.\n\nBut the vote was largely symbolic, as the resolution is unlikely to pass through the Republican-held House of Representatives and be signed by Trump himself.\n\nDemocrat Tim Kaine, who led the resolution, said tariffs on Canada - which include a 25% levy on steel and aluminium - were \"not about fentanyl\" following the vote on Wednesday.\n\n\"It's about tariffs. It's about a national sales tax on American families,\" the senator for Virginia said.\n\nMitch McConnell, who stepped down as the US Senate's longest-serving Republican leader a few months ago, has a long history of criticising Donald Trump.\n\nLisa Murkowski, a senator for Alaska, and Susan Collins of Maine both represent areas that border Canada. Murkowski has also opposed Trump several times in the past.\n\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who co-sponsored the legislation, told Fox News on Wednesday that tariffs \"raise prices and are a bad idea for the economy\".\n\n\"We are richer because of trade with Canada, and so is Canada\", he said.\n\nTrump criticised the four senators as being \"extremely difficult to deal with and unbelievably disloyal\" on his Truth Social platform.\n\nEvery Democrat also voted in favour of the resolution on Wednesday night.\n\nDemocrats argue that Trump is using the tariffs to pay for proposed tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy, and will also cause a hike in bills and costs for Americans.\n\nHowever at the White House on Wednesday, Trump singled out Canada as benefiting from \"unfair\" trading practices with the US.\n\nA sweeping new set of tariffs unveiled by the president on Wednesday did not target Canada because it has already been hit with other measures.\n\nBut there was no confirmation of any reprieve from a new 25% tax that Trump will charge on Americans importing foreign-made cars, which could hit Canada particularly hard.\n\nThe unique culture, landscape and weather make running elections in Nunavut both difficult and rewarding.\n\nThe unidentified 30-year-old suspect had a history of mental health issues, according to Vancouver police.\n\nPolice say the suspect drove into pedestrians at Lapu Lapu celebrations in the western Canadian city.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Republicans' calls for probe of Trump officials' Signal chat grow\n\nRepublican calls to investigate a group chat in which White House national security officials shared sensitive military information have intensified, with Oklahoma Senator James Lankford saying an inquiry would be \"entirely appropriate\".\n\nLankford stopped short of calling on officials to resign when speaking to CNN on Sunday, but joined other Republicans who have broken with US President Donald Trump over the chat.\n\nThe Trump administration has downplayed the unclassified Signal messages, in which Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and others shared potentially classified details about an upcoming attack on Yemen.\n\nMany Democrats have demanded that Hegseth and other officials resign over the incident.\n\nLankford joins fellow Republican and Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker, who penned a letter earlier in the week requesting the inspector general of the US Department of Defense look into the incident.\n\nThe letter said the discussion of sensitive military information on Signal, an online messaging application, with a journalist present in the chat \"raises questions as to the use of unclassified networks to discuss sensitive and classified information\".\n\nNational Security Advisor Mike Waltz appears to have accidentally added The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to the chat before the officials discussed the upcoming strikes.\n\nOn Sunday, Republican senator Lankford said an independent investigation was warranted to answer lingering questions about the chat.\n\n\"One is obviously: How did a reporter get into this thread in the conversation?\" Lankford asked.\n\n\"And the second part of the conversation is, when individuals from the administration are not sitting at their desk in a classified setting on a classified computer, how do they communicate to each other?\"\n\nBut Lankford said calls for Hegseth to resign over the issue were \"overkill\".\n\n\"I think he just joined an encrypted app,\" he said. \"I don't see it as much of an issue because, again, they all believed that this was a closed circle of conversation.\"\n\nLankford added: \"I don't see this as an issue of leadership.\"\n\nLankford and Wicker are among few Republican lawmakers who have called for an investigation into the chat.\n\nThe Atlantic first reported details of the group chat after Mr Goldberg was added and followed the thread as top Trump administration officials discussed upcoming military strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nThe magazine on Wednesday published the entire text thread, which showed the detailed and potentially classified rundown for a March air raids.\n\nIn the wake of the controversy, Waltz said he took full responsibility for the group chat. \"I built the group,\" he told Fox News on Tuesday, adding Mr Goldberg's access was \"embarrassing\".\n\nWaltz was unable to explain how Mr Goldberg came to be on the chat, but said another, unnamed contact of his was supposed to be there in Mr Goldberg's place.\n\n\"I can tell you for 100% I don't know this guy,\" Waltz said.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr Goldberg told NBC that Waltz had been \"telling everyone that he's never met me or spoken to me - that's simply not true\".\n\nTrump called the incident a \"glitch\" and said that it had \"no impact at all\" operationally, adding that the military strike against the Houthis was a success.\n\nBut former national security officials have raised concerns that allowing this to slide could pose major risks and encourage American adversaries.\n\nSue Gordon, a former Trump administration deputy director of national intelligence, told the BBC's US partner CBS News that she was \"glad the operation was successful. Now we need to deal with the fact that this should not have happened\".\n\n\"I don't think we should rest on the fact that nothing bad happened this time,\" she said.\n\n\"We don't know whether that communications path has been penetrated. So we don't know whether the state actors that have lots of resources are just sitting and working now.\"\n\nThose concerns have led many Democrats to call for greater accountability, with Mark Warner, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, saying that if a military officer or CIA agent had treated classified information in a similar manner they \"would be fired - end of story\".\n\n\"I believe Secretary Hegseth should resign or be fired,\" he told CBS News on Sunday. \"I think Mike Waltz should resign or be fired. If no action is taken, what message does that send to the workforce?\"\n\nTrump had told NBC News a day before that he would not fire anyone involved in the group chat, and that he still had confidence in Waltz.\n\n\"I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\" he said.\n\nAlong with Waltz and Hegseth, the chat also included Vice-President JD Vance, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA director John Ratcliffe, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and other senior leaders.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Is Irish America jumping aboard the 'Trump train'?\n\nThe return of United States President Donald Trump to the White House has been fuelled by the \"America First\" ethos.\n\nThis has two big elements - a radical rethinking of the role played by the US on the international stage and \"protectionist\" economic policies.\n\nTrump is reflecting a broader shift within America, towards the right of the political spectrum.\n\nAs our documentary, Trump, Tariffs and Us, has discovered, he has garnered support for this new direction from many different elements within American society, not least Irish America.\n\nWhereas previous US presidents, predominantly those from the Democratic Party, have taken a keen interest in Northern Ireland and the peace process - think Bill Clinton and Joe Biden - Trump seems, currently at least, to have his focus elsewhere rather than on what may be happening in Belfast.\n\nWhile there has long been bipartisan support for Northern Ireland peace building in Washington, it was the Democrats that were most closely associated with ensuring the process stayed high on the agenda of Capitol Hill.\n\nBut, as the former US Northern Ireland special envoy Richard Haass tells us in the programme, that generation of politicians has \"moved on\".\n\nSenator Ted Kennedy passed away in 2009 while other figures, such as Senator Chris Dodd, have stepped away from politics.\n\nInstead, much of Irish America seems to have inched closer to the Republican Party and the policies of Trump.\n\nThis shift away from the Democrats has been noted by the publisher of the Irish American newspaper, the Irish Echo.\n\n\"Despite the threat to the Irish unauthorised immigrants, the undocumented immigrants, I have seen Irish America move to the right,\" Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said.\n\n\"A majority now have moved to Trump because they see it in their self-interest to do so.\n\n\"We [the Irish Echo] endorsed Kamala Harris and we're swimming against the tide.\n\n\"Some of the bedrocks of Irish America, just outside Manhattan, I have seen those not only move to Republicans but move very firmly to Republican candidates. I don't see a time when the Democrats take those seats back.\"\n\nIrish American band the Dropkick Murphys known to many for their iconic song I'm Shipping Up to Boston, which featured heavily in the Martin Scorsese film The Departed, is still deeply rooted in trade union politics.\n\nLead singer Ken Casey said his regular, on-stage commentary against the US president had caused the band to lose listeners, \"loads\" of whom now supported Trump's view of the world.\n\n\"I have many friends that came over from Ireland in their 20s to Boston, first generation, and they're already on the Trump train - saying 'close the door behind us',\" said Mr Casey.\n\n\"I was taught as an Irish-American I could never have those thoughts towards another immigrant because my family was able to come here and climb the economic ladder.\n\n\"A lot of my friends have gone to the 'dark side' and a tonne of the band's fans.\"\n\nTrump has won strong support from the Irish American law enforcement community.\n\nTreasurer of the New York Correctional Department's Emerald Society Brian Sharkey believes the Democrats abandoned the issue of law and order to the Republicans.\n\n\"They [Irish Americans] are hoping Trump can change things. He is a big supporter of law and order, and he's not a phoney,\" said Mr Sharkey, a former correctional officer on New York's Rikers Island.\n\n\"Right now there is a big problem in the city [New York] and there is a big problem with crime in general in New York State.\"\n\nHe described Joe Biden as \"the worst president of my lifetime\" and has little time for Mr Biden's strong sense of Irishness.\n\n\"He's a typical politician, able to put on the Irish blarney, talk about his Irish grandmother,\" he said.\n\nTrump has won support, too, from some people with a unionist background and for whom the United States is now home.\n\nOriginally from north Belfast, Michael George has become friendly with the Trump family through his banking career in Manhattan.\n\nHe sees some merit in the president's tariffs as policy tools.\n\n\"He wants to try and encourage free and fair tariffs,\" said Mr George.\n\n\"He says he is going to do reciprocal tariffs. Well, if the Europeans tariff us why shouldn't we tariff them?\"\n\nMr George believes the widespread use of tariffs on foreign imports is a tactical move that will end in negotiation.\n\nTrump's \"America First\" vision seems to enjoy support from diverse parts of American society for now. Whether that remains the case, only time will tell.\n\nTrump, Tariffs and Us, is on Sunday 30 March at 22:30 BST on BBC iPlayer and BBC One Northern Ireland. It was produced for BBC Northern Ireland by Clean Slate TV.\n\nThe two-vehicle crash happened shortly before 17:00 on Sunday.\n\nVideo has emerged of a gig in 2023 appearing to show one band member saying: \"The only good Tory is a dead Tory.\"\n\nThis was the second security alert in County Antrim on Saturday, with another device found in Newtownabbey.\n\nBy the middle of the week, temperatures could rise close to the April record of 24.5C.\n\nA small rural community in County Tyrone open a box hidden away for a quarter century.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Republicans retake control of US Senate\n\nRepublicans have retaken control of the US Senate, after flipping seats in West Virginia, Ohio and Montana.\n\nThe results guarantee the Republicans at least 52 out of 100 seats in the new chamber, with a handful of races still undecided.\n\nJim Justice, West Virginia's current governor, won the seat vacated by former Democrat Joe Manchin, while Bernie Moreno in Ohio unseated Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown. In Montana, Democratic veteran Jon Tester lost to Republican Tim Sheehy.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Republicans so far are leading - though results are still expected from a number of races.\n\nIf the Republican Party controls the House, Senate and the White House, it would have broad power to pass laws and enact the president's partisan agenda.\n\nRepublicans last won a majority in the Senate in 2018.\n\nIn Ohio, Brown was projected to lose to Moreno, a Colombian immigrant and former car sales magnate who portrayed the veteran politician as \"too liberal for Ohio\".\n\nThe contest was called the most expensive Senate race in US history.\n\nBrown told supporters that the result was a \"disappointment but not a failure\", adding: \"I'm not giving up on our fight for workers and I know you won't either.\"\n\nThe seat in West Virginia is projected to flip Republican. It was contested after the retirement of Manchin, who frequently clashed with members of his own party before turning independent.\n\nJustice had himself been a Democrat before switching parties to the Republicans at a Trump rally in 2017.\n\nIn Montana, former Navy seal and businessman Sheehy was projected to defeat 18-year incumbent Tester, who was the last remaining Democrat holding statewide office there.\n\nThe Republican majority could yet increase further as close races in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada are decided.\n\nA total of 34 Senate seats were being contested on Tuesday.\n\nIn Texas, Trump ally Ted Cruz fended off a robust challenge from former NFL player Colin Allred to win a third term.\n\nDemocrats launched a concerted effort to beat Cruz, but the party has not won a state-wide election in Texas for more than 30 years.\n\nRepublicans also retained Nebraska's seat for incumbent Deb Fischer, after a surprisingly fierce challenge from auto mechanic Dan Osborn, a registered independent.\n\nThe Senate result immediately kicked off discussions about who would replace Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell as Senate Republican leader, and therefore become majority leader, in the next legislative session.\n\nMcConnell, 82, announced earlier this year that he was stepping down from the powerful role.\n\nOne possible candidate is Rick Scott, a Republican incumbent in Florida, who retained his seat despite a challenge by former Miami-area Rep Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who migrated from Ecuador as a child.\n\nSpeaking at a victory rally early Tuesday evening, Scott correctly predicted that Republicans would seize the majority in the Senate, adding that he would be selected as Senate majority leader.\n\n\"Florida is the centre of the Republican Party of this country,\" he told the crowd. \"Washington can learn a hell of a lot from what we've done right here in this great state.\"\n\nDemocrats held a seat in Delaware, a state that President Joe Biden represented as a senator for 36 years, with a victory for fourth-term Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester.\n\nIn Maryland, the Democrats retained a seat vacated by Ben Cardin, with Angela Alsobrooks beating the popular Republican Governor Larry Hogan.\n\nThey will become the first black female senators to represent their respective states.\n\nIn New Jersey, Democrats retained a seat that was vacated by Bob Menendez, who resigned after he was found guilty of accepting bribes for political favours. Andy Kim, 42, will become the first ever Korean-American senator.\n\nIn California, Rep Adam Schiff, who led the first of two impeachment investigations against Trump, retained a seat held by late Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n\nBoth parties are also vying for control of the House, although the balance of power there will not be known for several days.\n\nThe vast majority of House elections are happening in \"safe districts\" - regions where one party is nearly certain to win. But a handful of other races in swing districts could determine who controls Washington DC.\n\nHouse races that could swing the balance are taking place a wide variety of states, with closely watched elections happening in California, New York, Washington, Maine and Alaska.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

      "text": "First black Republican congresswoman Mia Love dies at 49\n\nMia Love, the first US black Republican congresswoman, has died aged 49 in Utah, her family has announced.\n\n\"She passed away peacefully\" on Sunday, surrounded by family at her home in the town of Saratoga Springs, a statement said.\n\nLove, a daughter of Haitian immigrants, had represented the state of Utah in the House of Representatives.\n\nHer daughter Abigale said earlier this month that Love had no longer been responding to treatment for brain cancer.\n\n\"In the midst of a celebration of her life and an avalanche of happy memories, Mia quietly slipped the bands of mortality and, as her words and vision always did, soared heavenward,\" said the family statement, which was posted on X.\n\nPaying tributes to Love, Utah Governor Spencer Cox wrote: \"A true trailblazer and visionary leader, Mia inspired countless Utahns through her courage, grace, and unwavering belief in the American dream.\n\n\"Her legacy leaves a lasting, positive impact on our state. We will miss her deeply.\"\n\nMia Love's political career formally started in 2003 when she won a seat on the Saratoga Springs' city council, and she later became the mayor, aged 34.\n\nIn 2014, she was elected to the US House of Representatives. She made history as the first black Republican woman to take up the role, and served two terms.\n\nLove was critical of Donald Trump when he was running for president in 2016, endorsing instead his Republican nomination rival Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who dropped out of the race a few months later.\n\nShe also called for Trump to publicly apologise for making derogatory comments about Haiti in 2018.\n\nHer bid for a third term ended in a razor-thin defeat to her Democratic rival Ben McAdams.\n\nTrump reacted to that by saying at a news conference: \"Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost.\"\n\nBefore entering politics, the mother of three worked for some time as a flight attendant.\n\nAs a teenager she dreamed of an acting career, later graduating from the University of Hartford in Connecticut with a degree in musical theatre.\n\nIn 2022, Love was diagnosed with glioblastoma, a fast-moving and aggressive form of brain cancer, and was given just 10-15 months to live - which she surpassed.\n\nHer death comes nearly two weeks after Love wrote an opinion piece for Deseret News , which she said was \"not to say goodbye but to say thank you and express my living wish for you and the America I know\".\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Project 2025: The right-wing wish list for Trump's second term\n\nIt is a 900-page policy \"wish list\", a set of proposals that would expand presidential power and impose an ultra-conservative social vision.\n\nDuring his campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly disavowed Project 2025, after a backlash over some of its more radical ideas.\n\nBut he has nominated several of its authors to fill key government positions, and many of his initial executive orders closely follow proposals outlined in the document.\n\nHere's your guide to Project 2025, which lays out one vision of how Trump might govern over the next four years.\n\nProject 2025 is a product of the Heritage Foundation, one of Washington's most prominent right-wing think tanks. It first produced policy plans for future Republican administrations in 1981, when Ronald Reagan was about to take office.\n\nIt has produced similar documents in connection with subsequent presidential elections, including in 2016, when Trump first won the presidency.\n\nThat's not unusual - it's common for US think tanks of all political stripes to propose policy wish lists for future governments.\n\nThere's no denying Heritage has been influential during Republican presidencies. One year into Trump's first term, the think tank boasted that the White House had adopted nearly two-thirds of its proposals.\n\nIts latest set of recommendations was unveiled in April 2023, but went largely unnoticed outside of policy circles until the heat of the presidential campaign, when Democratic opposition to the document ramped up.\n\nDemocratic politicians launched a \"Stop Project 2025 Task Force\" and even set up a tip line to collect insider information on Heritage's activities.\n\nThe Harris campaign and its surrogates consistently brought up the project in interviews and speeches.\n\nTrump began actively pushing away from the document in July 2024.\n\n\"I know nothing about Project 2025,\" he posted on his social media platform, Truth Social. \"I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the things they're saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.\"\n\nThe team that created the project was chock-full of former Trump advisers, including director Paul Dans, who was chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management while Trump was president. Dans later left the project.\n\nBut other Project 2025 authors have been welcomed into government jobs.\n\nRussell Vought, a self-described Christian nationalist, wrote a key chapter in the document and was confirmed by the Senate to lead the Office of Budget Management, which administers the $6.75tn (£5.44tn) federal budget.\n\nVought - who Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer called \"the chief architect of Project 2025, its intellectual inspiration\" - was also put in charge of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , an agency that the Trump administration has indicated it would like to close.\n\nOther Project 2025 authors nominated to government positions include CIA director John Ratcliffe; Brendan Carr, chosen to oversee the Federal Communications Commission; Tom Homan, Trump's \"border czar\"; Paul Atkins, nominated to head the Securities and Exchange Commission; and trade advisor Peter Navarro.\n\nMore than 100 conservative organisations contributed to the document, Heritage says, including many that will now be hugely influential in Washington.\n\nThe document itself sets out four main policy aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation's sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely.\n\nSome of the proposals have already formed the basis for Trump's executive orders - although in a number of cases they are also mentioned in other policy documents, including the Republican platform and Trump's Agenda47 campaign manifesto .\n\nProject 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control - a controversial idea known as \"unitary executive theory\".\n\nIn practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas.\n\nThe proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees.\n\nThe document labels the FBI a \"bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization\". It calls for drastic overhauls of the agency and several others, as well as the complete elimination of the Department of Education.\n\nShortly after being sworn in, Trump moved to eliminate job protections for career civil servants, and freeze federal spending.\n\nThrough Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, the White House has moved to chop billions in federal spending, although the details and legal status of the cuts are hazy at best. DOGE is not an official government department, but rather an outside team advising Trump with broad authority from the president.\n\nIt's clear however that Trump intends to take a sledgehammer to the federal government as it currently stands - a goal broadly in line with Project 2025 suggestions.\n\nThe mentions of abortion in Project 2025 - there are about 200 of them - have sparked some of the most contentious debate.\n\nThe document does not call for an outright nationwide abortion ban, and Trump says he would not sign such a law.\n\nHowever, it proposes withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market, and using existing but little-enforced laws to stop the drug being sent through the post.\n\nThe document proposes new data collection efforts on abortion and more generally suggests that the department of Health and Human Services should \"maintain a biblically based, social science-reinforced definition of marriage and family\".\n\nTrump, by contrast, has generally said that abortion laws should mostly be left to individual states.\n\nHowever, during confirmation hearings, Trump's nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, said the president had ordered him to examine the safety record of mifepristone and left open the possibility of further regulation of the drug.\n\nTrump also issued an executive order designed to stop federal funds being used for abortion, a move that was outlined in detail in the Project 2025 document.\n\nIncreased funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border - one of Trump's signature proposals in 2016 - is proposed in the document.\n\nBut Trump's signature immigration policy - a pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants - is not spelled out in any detail in Project 2025.\n\nThe document does include language calling on Trump to \"thoroughly enforce immigration laws\".\n\nBut in the main chapter dealing with immigration, Project 2025 authors suggest dismantling the Department of Homeland Security and combining it with other immigration enforcement units in other agencies, creating a much larger and more powerful border policing operation.\n\nOther proposals include eliminating visa categories for crime and human trafficking victims, increasing fees on immigrants and allowing fast-tracked applications for migrants who pay a premium.\n\nBut it was mass deportations - not a bureaucratic shuffle, visa changes or a longer, taller border wall - that was Trump's top pitch to voters.\n\nOn this issue, his administration promises to go in a slightly different direction - and potentially much further - than the Project 2025 proposals.\n\nEnergy policy is a broad area of agreement between Trump and the Project 2025 proposals, summed up by one of the president's campaign slogans: \"Drill, baby, drill\".\n\nThe new administration wants to ramp up fossil fuel production and has taken the US out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which seeks to limit emissions and global warming.\n\nProject 2025 proposes slashing federal money for research and investment in renewable energy, and calls for the next president to \"stop the war on oil and natural gas\" - ideas that the Trump campaign has enthusiastically taken up.\n\nThe document sets out two competing visions on tariffs: one suggesting boosting free trade and another pro-tariff position.\n\nTrump has clearly sided with the latter camp, announcing import taxes targeting Canada, Mexico and China.\n\nThe economic advisers of Project 2025 suggest that a second Trump administration should slash corporate and income taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve and even consider a return to gold-backed currency.\n\nWhile the president has made comments about proposals in some of these areas, the economic talk in the early days of his administration has been dominated by tariffs.\n\nAlmost immediately upon taking office, Trump moved to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs and decreed that government departments would recognise only two genders.\n\nThose moves are broadly in line with Project 2025, which took aim at DEI and gender terminology as part of what it describes as a wider crackdown on \"woke\" ideology.\n\nThe document also calls for greater school choice - essentially subidising religious and private schools with public funds - which was also the subject of an early Trump executive order.\n\nAnd it calls for abolishing the Department of Education, another idea that Trump has signalled he supports.\n\nIn other proposals, Project 2025 suggests banning pornography and shutting down tech and telecoms companies that allow access to adult material.\n\nThis has so far not been a focus of the new administration, which has drawn support from a number of top tech bosses.\n\nTrump's views on the tech industry have regularly shifted, and don't appear to have much to do with sexual content.\n\nThe writing of Project 2025 was a massive undertaking, backed by a $22m (£17m) budget from Heritage.\n\nIt includes strategies for implementing policies, such as the creation of a database of conservative loyalists to fill government positions, and a programme to train those new workers.\n\nThere are clear areas of agreement and overlapping personnel. However, many of the themes of Project 2025 were independently being touted by the Trump campaign.\n\nIt's very early in Trump's second term, and still unclear how far the president will be able to go in reshaping the vast US federal government.\n\nDemocrats have indicated they will continue to oppose the proposals and highlight Project 2025's influence.\n\nAnd many of the president's executive orders and other actions will continue to face political and legal challenges.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Top Republican says Trump nominees are 'disruptors'\n\nWashington's highest-ranking Republican has said that President-elect Donald Trump is tapping \"disruptors\" to lead his incoming administration.\n\n\"They are persons who will shake up the status quo,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union. \"I think that's by design.\"\n\nTrump continues to announce officials who he wants to fill high-ranking positions in his administration, seeming to favour close allies over those with related policy experience.\n\nSome of those picks have sent shockwaves through Washington and caused bipartisan concern. But those close to Trump say there are back-up plans in place if these nominees can't muster the support needed to be approved.\n\nTrump's defence secretary pick Pete Hegseth has denied a sexual assault allegation and his potential attorney general Matt Gaetz is at the centre of an ethics scandal. His health secretary nominee, Robert F Kennedy Jr , is under scrutiny for his vaccine scepticism.\n\nThe president-elect's son, Donald Trump Jr, defended his father's nominees on Sunday, saying on Fox News that \"we know who the good guys and bad guys are\".\n\n\"It's about surrounding my father with people who are competent and loyal. They will deliver on his promises,\" he said. \"They are not people who think they know better as unelected bureaucrats.\"\n\nHe noted some of the nominees are \"controversial\" and appeared to acknowledge some could face problems in the Senate, which is tasked with vetting thousands of presidential nominees and voting on their appointments.\n\n\"We do have back-up plans, but we're obviously going with the strongest candidates first,\" the president-elect's son said. \"You know some of them are going to be controversial because they'll actually get things done.\"\n\nOne of Donald Trump's latest picks is oil executive Chris Wright, nominated as energy secretary.\n\nWright, the founder and CEO of fracking company Liberty Energy, is expected to work toward fulfilling Trump's campaign promise to increase fossil fuel production - an aim summed by the campaign slogan \"drill, baby, drill\".\n\nHe is a climate change sceptic who previously said he does not care where energy comes from, \"as long as it is secure, reliable, affordable and betters human lives\".\n\nHe has no government experience but the Trump campaign cited Wright's work with Pinnacle Technologies, a company he founded before Liberty Energy, as being critical to the US's fracking boom, which has made the country the world's largest oil producer.\n\nWright's appointment is a win for the fossil fuel industry. Trump has pledged to increase production of US fossil fuels rather than investing in renewable energy sources such as wind power - a goal Wright will be instrumental in driving.\n\nHis appointment came as Joe Biden became the first sitting US president to visit the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rainforest, on Sunday, as he touted his climate legacy.\n\nBiden took an aerial tour over part of the Amazon and met with local and Indigenous leaders working to preserve the region's ecosystem before making a brief appearance in Manaus, a large city nestled in the centre of the rainforest.\n\nThere, Biden described the battle against climate change as \"a defining cause of my presidency\" and touted the landmark climate legislation passed under his administration.\n\nThe Democrat also pledged new financial assistance to protect the Amazon, including an additional $50m (£40m) contribution to the Amazon Conservation Fund bringing the US commitment to $100m.\n\nAnd while he did not mention Trump by name, Biden seemed to make reference to his successor, saying that while \"some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that is underway in America... nobody, nobody can reverse it\".\n\n\"The question now,\" he said, \"is which government will stand in the way and which will seize the enormous economic opportunity.\"\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Advisers told reporters that Mr. Trump was reassessing his messaging, and Mr. Trump himself said as much in a post-shooting interview with the Washington Examiner. His speech Thursday night would bring the whole country together, he said, if not the whole world.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump took the podium Thursday evening, it did seem - for the first 15 minutes - that he tried to do just that.\n\nIn accepting the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump envisioned a nation \"more united than ever before.\" But his speech included sharp attacks on President Joe Biden, as both parties also confront open or latent fissures within.\n\n\"The discord and division in our society must be healed,\" said Mr. Trump, before he formally accepted the Republican nomination. \"I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America. Because there is no victory in winning for half of America.\"\n\nSoon after, however, he shifted back into old patterns, abandoning his teleprompter for long stretches. In a rambling 92-minute performance, Mr. Trump repeated many of his usual talking points from rallies. The crowd roared when he vowed to enact the \"largest deportation operation,\" and when he referred to President Joe Biden as worse than America's 10 worst presidents put together - despite a pre-speech promise to not refer to Mr. Biden by name.\n\nIn many ways, Mr. Trump's speech was the culmination of a week that has felt less like a warmup for the campaign's toughest, final stretch and more like an election night victory party. And the GOP's palpable air of optimism and camaraderie was fueled by two events outside Wisconsin that were entirely out of Mr. Trump's control.\n\nAfter the assassination attempt against Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania just days ago, his supporters, many donning makeshift ear bandages mimicking the former president's, said they felt inspired anew . \"It's like when something bad happens in your family and you all band together,\" said Gary Leffler, an alternate delegate from Iowa. \"The assassination attempt has drawn everyone that much closer. It had an extremely unifying consequence to it.\"\n\nAt the same time, the chaotic unraveling taking place among Democrats back in Washington, with the drip-drip-drip of congressional statements against Mr. Biden's candidacy and increasingly dire poll numbers - showing Mr. Trump with a clear lead - made attendees here almost giddy with anticipation .\n\nWhen asked about the Republican Party's sudden unity, Peter Navarro, a former Trump adviser who spoke at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday evening after being released from prison for defying a congressional subpoena related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, answered in the reverse. \"The Democratic Party,\" he said, \"is in complete disarray.\"\n\nPolitical disarray, of course, is what happens when a party believes it is on track to lose. It was after Mr. Biden's disastrous June 27 debate performance that Democrats' internal strife began in earnest. And as Republicans are now demonstrating, it's easy to paper over differences and come together when your team is running up the scoreboard.\n\nThe display of GOP unity this week was all the more remarkable, coming after a year of vicious infighting in the House of Representatives that led to the ouster of a Republican speaker. And certainly, it stood in stark contrast to the bitter internal divisions on view in 2016 over Mr. Trump's candidacy - divisions that over the past eight years caused many anti-Trump Republicans to leave the party.\n\nIt's clearly Mr. Trump's party more than ever. But as he leaves Milwaukee as the Republican presidential nominee for a third time, only time will tell if this newfound party unity is conditional - if Mr. Trump and his supporters will insist on total fealty going forward, or if the party's full-throated support of Mr. Trump is in part a product of polling leads.\n\n\"I think Trump has done an excellent job unifying people. ... But also, I give a lot of credit to the Democrats. Their division unites us more,\" former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy said in an interview Thursday afternoon. \"I hope Republicans learn from this, that we're stronger together and we're weaker divided. A house divided cannot stand.\"\n\nMr. McCarthy's own political demise, of course, points to the recent internal cracks that have, for now, been papered over. The former speaker was ousted last year by a small faction of disgruntled party members - one of whom, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, was caught taunting Mr. McCarthy here as he was giving an on-camera interview.\n\nIt's also notable who wasn't in the arena to hear Mr. Trump's promises of togetherness.\n\nHis former vice president, Mike Pence, was fishing in Montana . The 2012 Republican presidential ticket - Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and former Rep. Paul Ryan - wasn't here. Republican former President George W. Bush did not make an appearance, nor did former Vice President Dick Cheney or his daughter, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney. More than half a dozen Republican Senate candidates gave prime-time speeches Tuesday evening, but former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who has so far declined to endorse Mr. Trump while running for a Senate seat that would be a dream pickup for Republicans, was absent.\n\n\"You can always say, 'Oh, so-and-so didn't come.' Who cares? It's their right not to come,\" said New York Rep. Mike Lawler.\n\nInstead, many attendees noted all the onetime Trump opponents who were present, like primary rivals Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who endorsed Mr. Trump for the first time in her convention speech.\n\n\"You saw many of President Trump's primary opponents here speaking; they were well received,\" said Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. He said that this convention, the 10th he has attended, was more unified than the Cleveland convention he presided over as home-state governor eight years ago.\n\nStill, when Ms. Haley first came onstage Tuesday, a smattering of boos rippled from the crowd. The greeting for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history, when he announced Kentucky's delegates for Mr. Trump on Monday, was almost hostile .\n\n\"The party has moved from an elitist party to a working-class party. That includes the Bushes and Mike Pence,\" said Mary Downey, an alternate delegate from Florida wearing an American flag dress. \"It's not the Republican Party of 30 years ago anymore.\"\n\nThat's true not just in terms of personnel, but also in policy. In Republicans' 2024 party platform, two longtime pillars - abortion and guns - were largely missing from this year's document , which Mr. Trump and his team reportedly rewrote themselves and drastically shortened from the 2016-2020 version.\n\n\"As somebody that's a Republican that believes in pro-life and believes in character that matters and believes in global leadership, I want to stay in the party and fight for some of the principles that I believe in,\" said former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, one of the few Trump-critical Republicans who attended the convention without endorsing the former president, in an interview Monday. But he seemed resigned to the fact that this wasn't the old GOP he came up in.\n\n\"It's his party,\" said Mr. Hutchinson.\n\nNot helping Mr. Hutchinson's decision is Mr. Trump's choice for vice president. Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance was \"the most MAGA person that was out there\" among the known contenders, said Mr. Hutchinson, who worried about Mr. Vance's opposition to supporting Ukraine. Governor DeWine of Ohio voiced similar concerns.\n\n\"It was good for J.D. Vance last night to openly acknowledge that we have differences,\" said Mr. DeWine of the vice presidential nominee's speech Wednesday evening.\n\nBut as Mr. Trump's thousands of delegates cheered to his greatest hits during his convention speech, intraparty policy differences didn't seem top of mind. And the former president himself seemed to recognize the gift of this political moment.\n\n\"I better finish strong or else I'll blow it,\" said Mr. Trump. \"And we can't do that.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He leads a conservative city in a key swing state, but he is opposing GOP nominee Donald Trump and endorsing Democrat Kamala Harris for president.\n\nOther prominent Republicans have endorsed Ms. Harris, including former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, former Vice President Dick Cheney (Ms. Cheney's father), and former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. More than 100 former GOP officials, including some from the Trump administration, also endorsed Ms. Harris in a letter this week.\n\nSimilar defections are notably absent on the other side, though ex-Democrats Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard have joined Mr. Trump's team. The powerful Teamsters union - amid strong membership support for the former president - decided not to endorse either candidate this year. The Harris campaign is hoping conservative endorsements will help win over wavering Republicans and independents.\n\nSome prominent Republicans have endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris in her quest for the presidency. John Giles, a conservative mayor in a border state, says it's about moving beyond party affiliations and working in \"the middle.''\n\nThe Monitor sat down with Mr. Giles earlier this month in his City Hall office in Mesa, near Phoenix. With a panoramic view of Camelback Mountain as a backdrop, he talked about why he's endorsing the vice president and how he squares that with his Republican and religious values. Like many in Mesa, he's a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. \"I think she's going to govern from the center, which I'm OK with,\" he says. \"Compromise is part of government, and she's demonstrated an ability to do that.\"\n\nThe following interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity:\n\nWhy are you endorsing Kamala Harris?\n\nI need to back up a bit. I've been the mayor of my hometown for the last 10 years, and I have loved this job. And part of what I've loved is that I'm elected in a nonpartisan election, and I lead a city council that is diverse and made up of progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans. We get along amazingly well. And that's because we don't bring partisanship to the equation. We focus on the middle, and we take a problem-solving approach.\n\nI wade into partisan waters only very rarely, but I'm compelled to take a side in this presidential campaign because a second Donald Trump presidency would not be in the best interest of my city. Donald Trump made a lot of promises. None of them came true.\n\nCan you delve into that?\n\nInfrastructure is a huge issue for us. Under President Trump, \"Infrastructure Week\" became a running gag. Literally nothing occurred as far as federal participation in helping with infrastructure.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, we've had the Chips Act, which has had this dramatic impact in the Phoenix area. TSMC [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.], Intel, both are making multibillion-dollar investments in chip fabrication facilities. A lot of the supply chain economy that supports those fabs is in Mesa. Taiwan Semiconductor is literally making the largest foreign investment in the history of the United States here in Arizona. That's because of the Chips Act, where there's federal funds involved. These investments will have a generational impact. So the Biden administration deserves credit for that .\n\nSimilarly, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act - that's had a significant impact in Mesa, particularly out of our airport. We got a new terminal and a new air traffic control tower.\n\nI want to ask about your own personal journey in this switch. Was there a turning point for you?\n\nIt's been death by a thousand cuts. For the last several years, I've walked into the office and asked my staff, \"Can I leave the Republican Party now?'' But I came to the conclusion that it would be a mistake to do that.\n\nI continue to be in the Republican Party because I really do identify more with Republican principles and the Republican emphasis on personal responsibility and smaller government. I think it's important that voices like mine don't leave the party but continue to point out its flaws in hopes of a system where we have two strong parties.\n\nThe Republican Party might be a lost cause. But having multiple strong parties is a cause that's worth fighting for. It's still important that there be loyal opposition in the Republican Party.\n\nHow much blowback have you gotten?\n\nAny time you're in national media and you say something provocative, you're going to get hundreds of emails comparing you to a little brown emoji. I was censured two years ago by the local Republican Party, and I've been censured again. I fully expected all that. What I've been more taken aback by is the positive reaction that I've gotten from strangers who walk up to me and say, \"You don't know me, but I've seen what you've said. Thank you for giving a voice to what I've been feeling for the last few years.\"\n\nHow do you square your conservative values with what Ms. Harris stands for?\n\nVice President Harris is very different from the candidate that she was four years ago. The experience that she's had in the White House has taught her the importance of governing from the middle. I am not afraid of a Harris administration coming in and being this hair-on-fire, progressive administration that the Trump campaign is painting it to be.\n\nThe bipartisan immigration and border bill was very much a compromise. It was green-lit by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. And if the votes were there, that was going to happen. Until Donald Trump decided that it was not in his best interests.\n\nKamala Harris has already said she would sign that. To me, that's an indication that she's pragmatic.\n\nThe same is true of her economic policies. They're focused on food inflation, on housing affordability and availability, on real-life, Middle America problems. It's not a socialist agenda.\n\nDonald Trump's economic policies are troubling because he's going to double tariffs. I don't think that's a very Republican policy. He's going to create housing supply by deporting millions of people. I don't think that's a smart policy that economists and Republicans would endorse.\n\nMesa has a lot of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to which you also belong. Do your LDS values inform your politics?\n\nFor many years, people like myself have been taught in church: \"Hey, it's okay to be a Democrat. It's okay to be a Republican. Sometimes you need to zigzag between the two.\" But there's been an underlying, maybe less-said, emphasis on, really, you can't be a Democrat because of abortion.\n\nNow that Donald Trump has been successful in overturning Roe and in turning abortion from a federal issue to a state issue, there's no longer a need for people in my religious community, who felt duty-bound not to vote Democratic, for any loyalty to the Republican Party on the abortion issue. Of course Kamala Harris is pro-choice, but do you think there's going to be 60 votes in the Senate for a national abortion bill? That hasn't happened in 250 years. It's not going to happen now.\n\nYou chair the immigration task force for the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Do you see a way forward on immigration?\n\nThe short-term solution is that Donald Trump needs to lose this election, because he's going to continue to use the issue for political purposes. With that mindset in the White House, nothing is going to happen. Kamala Harris has already said that if she is elected, she will pick up where we left off with the bipartisan border bill.\n\nExecutive orders can in some marginal ways impact the number of border crossers. Donald Trump, on this issue, was fortunate to be president during the pandemic, because under Title 42 he could use the pandemic as an excuse to put limitations on border crossers. But executive orders are no substitute for congressional action.\n\nIf we just separate the political gamesmanship from it, immigration is very solvable.\n\nBut when we have things like, at the Republican convention, chanting for \"mass deportation now,\" that's not helpful. Arizona is a great example of that. When we had SB 1070 - where the state got involved in enforcing federal immigration laws - it was devastating to our economy.\n\nThe tradespeople, the skilled workers, were predominantly immigrants. And when the state pulled people over for \"driving while brown,\" that had a chilling effect on the Hispanic community, and they left.\n\nWhat difference do you think Republicans for Harris will make?\n\nIt will make a difference because, in Arizona, we are a very closely divided state. Joe Biden won the state by about 10,000 votes. The middle is going to decide this. And so moderate Republicans, moderate Democrats, independents, former Republicans - that's the battleground within the battleground state.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It reiterates many of Mr. Trump's campaign promises -  including building an Iron Dome missile defense system over the United States, and implementing \"THE LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY.\" It also promises to hold government officials accountable for alleged abuses of power, such as \"illegal censoring\" of lawful speech or \"unjustly\" prosecuting political opponents.\n\nA party platform, while not binding, gives an indication of policy priorities and a road map for governing. The changes since 2016 reflect a populist shift, dialing back long-standing Republican stances on abortion, guns, and fiscal responsibility.\n\nDelegates to the Republican National Convention, which kicks off Monday in Milwaukee, are expected to adopt the new platform and formally choose Mr. Trump as the GOP presidential nominee.\n\nA party platform is a document that outlines what a political party believes on key issues - essentially a party's \"mission statement.\" It is typically written by major party figures as well as representatives from interest groups.\n\nRussell Vought, who headed up the Office of Management and Budget during the Trump administration, is the policy director for the Republican National Committee platform committee. Mr. Vought is also one of the authors of Project 2025 , a sweeping presidential transition plan created by the Heritage Foundation that offers a road map for an incoming conservative administration, although Mr. Trump has recently sought to distance himself from it.\n\nParty platforms have been a regular feature of campaigns since 1840, when then-President Martin Van Buren outlined nine major Democratic Party positions in about 500 words. Modern-day platforms are far more complex, running up to 75 pages long. They include a preamble that lays out how the party sees the state of the country and the problems that must be addressed, as well as goals it seeks to achieve on different issues.\n\nTypically, both parties draft updated platforms during presidential election years, and delegates vote to adopt the platform at their nominating convention. Presidential candidates are not bound to follow it. However, a platform is usually a good indicator of how a party hopes to govern.\n\nSince 2016 the Republican Party has been moving away from its Ronald Reagan-era conservative roots, reshaping itself along the lines of Mr. Trump's \"America First\" populism. The new platform shows just how deep an imprint he has made, from shifting policy priorities to adopting his signature and unusual use of capitalization.\n\nThe 2016 platform - which was used again in 2020 - more closely resembled the GOP's traditional conservative vision. This year's platform is significantly shorter - 16 pages, compared with 66 - and dedicated to \"the Forgotten Men and Women of America.\" It appears to be aimed at regular voters, not policy wonks.\n\nIn many ways, the platform reads more as an extension of Mr. Trump's campaign than as a detailed description of party policy priorities. The preamble begins, \"America First.\" Mr. Trump is referenced by name 19 times.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Trump was not referenced at all in the 2016 platform. And he was mentioned just three times in a 2020 resolution to forgo developing a new platform that year, though it pledged to \"enthusiastically support the President's America-first agenda.\"\n\nThis year's platform dedicates a section to culture war issues like \"gender ideology\" and critical race theory. Other issues it prioritizes include election security and energy production. It puts the most focus on border security, promising to place the U.S. military on the southern border and to enact stricter vetting processes and \"keep foreign Christian-hating Communists, Marxists, and Socialists out of America.\"\n\nThat's a sharp difference in tone from the 2016 platform, which also called for improved border security, but sought to strike an inclusive note. \"Our party is the natural home for those who come in search of freedom and justice,\" began the section on immigration.  \"We welcome all to the Great Opportunity Party.\"\n\nOne long-standing campaign issue for Republicans is almost entirely absent from this year's platform: fortifying Second Amendment rights.\n\nWhile the 2016 platform dedicated a three-paragraph section, and included references elsewhere to Second Amendment protections, the 2024 platform has only a passing promise to defend \"THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.\"\n\nAnd for the first time in four decades, the Republican platform doesn't include a call for a national abortion ban. It commends the Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 for giving the power to ban abortion \"to the States.\" But the word \"abortion\" appears only one time, compared with 35 times in the 2016 platform. The document also affirms support for access to birth control and in vitro fertilization (IVF), the latter of which was recently formally opposed by the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\nParts of the platform have drawn criticism from evangelical Christians, including Mr. Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, who called the change in abortion policy \"a profound disappointment.\"\n\nIn addition, the GOP's long-held priorities of reducing entitlement spending and reining in the national debt aren't discussed. The word \"debt\" doesn't appear anywhere in the document, and \"deficit\" appears only once, in reference to the trade deficit. There is, however, a promise to \"immediately stabilize the Economy by slashing wasteful Government spending and promoting Economic Growth.\"\n\nMeanwhile, several sections address \"Gender Insanity,\" \"Gender Indoctrination,\" and \"GENDER IDEOLOGY.\" The word \"gender\" did not appear once in 2016.\n\nReferences to foreign policy are mostly broad, such as promising that \"Republicans will end the global chaos and restore Peace\" and counter China. Russia and Ukraine are not named. The 2016 platform, by contrast, dedicated pages to specific and nuanced foreign policy positions.\n\nMarjorie Hershey, a political science professor at Indiana University, calls the 2024 GOP platform \"a series of outtakes from Trump's rally speeches.\"\n\nNot all Republicans are happy with the changes. But the RNC's support for Mr. Trump's policies seems to signal that the party has indeed gotten on board. Many members who were once strong critics have urged the party to coalesce behind him.\n\n\"Trump has completely taken control of the party,\" says Dr. Hershey.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Asked the next day if Russian President Vladimir Putin was a war criminal, Mr. Pence didn't hesitate: \"Without question.\"\n\nNot far away, at a picnic in Salem, candidate Vivek Ramaswamy offered a different take. \"We have to get the facts before we get to the bottom of that,\" the pharmaceutical entrepreneur said when asked about Mr. Putin's status as a potential war criminal. Speaking to voters on an unusually hot September day, Mr. Ramaswamy said he would prioritize the homefront over involvement in foreign conflicts. \"My job is to keep us out of World War III while advancing American interests.\"\n\nOften in presidential primaries, candidates struggle to find ways to differentiate themselves. Largely agreeing on the main issues of the day, they wind up emphasizing slight nuances or leaning on stylistic distinctions.\n\nYes, Donald Trump is leading by far in polls of GOP voters. But the Republican Party is far from homogeneous, as a disparate field of presidential candidates attests.\n\nThe 2024 Republicans don't have that problem.\n\nFrom the debate stage to the campaign trail, whether they're talking about Ukraine or abortion or the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, these candidates' pitches have been so jarringly different from one another that voters might be forgiven for wondering if they're truly from the same party.\n\nThe kaleidoscope of views on display could help the GOP attract some new supporters - including more independents, voters of color, and a younger generation that sees Reagan-style conservatism as hopelessly passé. At the same time, analysts say, the party is running the risk of coming across as incoherent, making it hard for voters to identify what it actually stands for. And parties that are deeply divided along policy lines often struggle at the ballot box.\n\n\"When political scientists for the past 20-plus years have compared the Republican and Democratic parties, a common refrain has been, 'Well, the Democrats are this \"big tent\" party of different constituents who don't have much in common - union people, highly educated individuals - but they agree to join forces for the purposes of trying to win elections,'\" says David Barker, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. \"By contrast, the conventional wisdom has been that Republicans are the ideological party rowing in the same boat ... which was why people used to say that Republicans had a leg up. Now we've really seen that turn upside down.\"\n\nIt's the ripple effect of a realignment that started when Donald Trump captured the White House in 2016 and has yet to be fully resolved. With Mr. Trump still dominant and pushing the GOP in a more populist direction, his rivals are caught between trying to emulate him and hewing to a more traditional conservatism - or trying to somehow have it both ways.\n\nIn her own campaign stops across the Granite State last week, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley advocated for a muscular foreign policy, similar to Mr. Pence's pitch. But she put forward a very different message on the subject of a national abortion ban - essentially telling voters it's not going to happen. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was in his home state dealing with Hurricane Idalia, often sounds more populist than Mr. Trump, such as in his culture war battle with Disney. He has expressed skepticism about the COVID-19 vaccine, while Mr. Trump recently told interviewer Megyn Kelly that his decision to back the vaccine's development, according to health officials, \"saved 100 million lives.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Mr. Trump, the candidates have differing takes - at times, even from themselves. Ms. Haley has said he would be a weak general election candidate, calling him \"the most disliked politician in America,\" while also saying she'd back him if he were the nominee. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has essentially made his entire campaign about the need to prevent Mr. Trump from recapturing the White House. Mr. Ramaswamy, on the other hand, calls Mr. Trump the best president of the 21st century.\n\nThere's always a spectrum within parties, notes Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist and New Hampshire native. But Mr. Trump fundamentally shifted the landscape for the GOP, so that even positions once seen as utterly heterodox are now \"percolating\" among the 2024 candidates.\n\n\"We were the party of fiscal responsibility, including entitlement reform. We were the party of free trade capitalism,\" says Mr. Bartlett. \"Flash-forward four years: Donald Trump says, 'No more stupid wars. You're not going to touch Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. Oh, and by the way, it's called fair trade, not free trade.' And what happened? He won.\"\n\nWhile some candidates are calling for a return to core Republican ideas and principles, others seem to be saying, \"Maybe Trump's ideas are much closer to where voters and the base of the party is,\" Mr. Bartlett adds.\n\nSo far, Mr. Trump is the heavy favorite to win the nomination again, with formidable leads in most national polls . A late August poll of New Hampshire primary voters found the former president as the top choice for almost half of those surveyed.\n\n\"I like Donald J. Trump,\" says David Hunt, wiping sweat and dirt from his arms as he takes a break from working outside his home in Windsor, New Hampshire. Mr. Hunt says his business drilling wells for homes has all but dried up due to rising interest rates and a difficult housing market. The farm stand that he runs with his wife, Laurie, where they sell local produce, honey, and maple butter through an honor system, has struggled as well. By comparison, Mr. Hunt says he \"never made as much\" money as he did during the Trump years.\n\nWhen asked if he'd consider voting for anyone else in the GOP primary field, Mr. Hunt answers, \"Vik.\"\n\nIndeed, Mr. Ramaswamy has tried to position himself as the inheritor of the MAGA mantle, though many New Hampshire voters like Mr. Hunt still struggle to pronounce his name. Mr. Ramaswamy calls his campaign \"the leading edge of defining where the 'America First' movement goes from here.\"\n\nThe Harvard- and Yale-educated lawyer, who made millions as a biotech entrepreneur, has never held elected office and says he's only voted in two presidential elections - in 2004 for a Libertarian and in 2020 for President Trump.\n\nAt the first Republican debate in late August, Mr. Ramaswamy stood in the middle of the stage, fending off attacks from almost all the other candidates and throwing punches of his own. In the 24 hours that followed, there were more than 1 million Google searches of his name.\n\nThe crowd at the Ramaswamy picnic whistled and applauded when he vowed to abolish numerous government agencies, cut 75% of the federal workforce, and battle the \"new secular cults\" of COVID-19 and transgender issues. The GOP primary, he told the crowd, was a choice between \"incremental reform\" and \"revolution.\"\n\nMr. Ramaswamy's rhetoric closely emulates Mr. Trump's, and he echoes the former president's depiction of America as in a state of decline. Indeed, one lesson other candidates seem to have taken from Mr. Trump's political success is that style matters more than substance - and that many voters will be flexible on policy if they like a candidate's posture.\n\n\"Right now, the Republican Party is about attitude and swagger,\" says Mr. Bartlett, the GOP strategist. \"Vivek has made some very inflammatory comments. It tends to resonate. It is not just what you say, but how you say it in the Republican Party.\"\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum is Mr. Pence, a 1990s-style politician in a blue blazer and dad sneakers, who has been calling for a return to Reaganesque Republicanism - the \"three-legged stool\" of religious traditionalism, foreign policy hawkishness, and free market sentiment - which he says would usher in a new \"Morning in America.\"\n\nOn the stump in New Hampshire, the former Trump vice president called out \"Donald Trump and his imitators\" for preaching a \"siren song of populism\" that has destabilized the GOP and aligned it with Democrats on many issues.\n\n\"We have come to a Republican time for choosing,\" Mr. Pence told a crowd of students, several of whom said they were there for class credit, at Saint Anselm College in Manchester. \"The question of the hour is not just who, but what will we offer the American people a year from this November? ... I believe that choice will determine the fate of the party and the course of our nation for years to come.\"\n\nIf Mr. Pence's meager crowds last week were any indication, however, the party may have already made its choice.\n\n\"I don't like Pence,\" said freshman Isiah Chamberlain after seeing the former vice president at a town hall at New England College in Henniker, New Hampshire. \"I'd take any populist candidate over an elitist conservative.\"\n\nStill, others saw Mr. Pence's message as worth heeding. Freshman Matthew Cryan said he liked the former vice president's references to Ronald Reagan and his comments about standing firm against Mr. Putin. \"I want to knock him down before he has the chance to get stronger.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The GOP flipped two Senate seats in Ohio and West Virginia, and as of Wednesday afternoon seemed likely to grow their majority with wins in Rust Belt and Western states where votes were still being counted.\n\nControl of the U.S. House remained too close to call, but it's entirely possible Mr. Trump will come back to Washington having won a trifecta, with both chambers of Congress in Republican hands.\n\nIn a year when Democrats had more seats to defend than Republicans, they had hoped to save their majority by perhaps flipping a few seats of their own in Florida and Texas. But it was not to be, as Republican Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas held their ground, with voters punishing Democrats over the economy and immigration.\n\nVoters have put the U.S. Senate back under Republican control. One upshot: They will hold the keys to approving nominees for executive branch posts, federal judgeships, and the Supreme Court.\n\nIn Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno ousted incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown, with criticism of Democrats on border security helping the Colombian-born businessman to victory.\n\nPopular West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice handily won the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, the independent who caucused with Democrats. Mr. Justice was so confident of victory he barely even campaigned against his opponent, Glenn Elliott, the Democratic former mayor of Wheeling.\n\n\"In the primary, I didn't put a sign out,\" he said during a press conference. \"Think about this for a second: I didn't put one single sign up, and I won by 35-plus points. The people of this state know me. They know me, and they know me really well. I've done almost zero campaigning.\"\n\nThe Senate switch will put Republicans in charge of the agenda in that chamber. They will hold the keys to executive branch nominations and federal judgeships, as well as any vacancies that might arise at the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Trump will be able to get any confirmations that he likes,\" says Jeffery Jenkins, a public policy professor at the University of Southern California.\n\nAnd right off the bat, lawmakers will be staring at an expiring federal debt ceiling and tax cuts from the first Trump administration that will end at the conclusion of 2025.\n\n\"The stakes are going to be really high. Right out of the box they're going to have to deal with government spending, raising the debt limit,\" says Kevin Kosar, an expert on Congress at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nBut first, Republicans will need to pick their new majority leader in a secret-ballot election set for next week. In the running are South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican; Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who termed out of GOP leadership; and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida. Both Senators Thune and Cornyn are more traditional conservatives, while Senator Scott has deep ties to the party's right wing, says Sarah Binder, a political science professor at The George Washington University who has long studied Congress.\n\nStaunch Trump loyalist Sen. Mike Lee of Utah appears to be playing kingmaker. He has announced that each of the candidates has agreed to participate at a forum that he will moderate on Nov. 12. At the same time, he has issued a letter to colleagues , calling for Senate reforms, especially allowing more freedom for senators to offer amendments on legislation and engage in extended debate.\n\nSenator Cruz of Texas, an ally of Senator Lee, this week described outgoing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as a \" one-man dictator .\" Senator McConnell, from Kentucky, is the longest-serving Republican Senate leader in history and is stepping down from leadership at the end of this year.\n\nSenator McConnell, speaking to reporters on Wednesday morning, said he believed the GOP's victory would help preserve the filibuster.\n\n\"One of the most gratifying results of the Senate becoming Republican: The filibuster will stand, there won't be any new states admitted that will benefit the other side, and we'll quit beating up the Supreme Court every time they make a decision we don't like,\" he said.\n\nFor many years, the Senate has been sliding toward more control by party leaders. \"There's been a lot of complaints among senators about feeling like they're eunuchs at the court,\" says Mr. Kosar.\n\nBut senators also have themselves to blame, says Dr. Binder, in part because they want protection from amendment votes that could damage them politically. \"They've not really fought back,\" she says.\n\nMr. Trump is expected to push his agenda of tax cuts and a restrictive approach to immigration. On trade, Congress long ago ceded power to the president to impose sanctions and raise tariffs.\n\nBut a Republican Senate will not necessarily walk in lockstep with Mr. Trump. In the Middle East, Ukraine, and Taiwan, \"different levels of peril will test the Republicans' comfort with interjecting themselves,\" says Mr. Kosar. And will anyone want to stick their neck out on immigration after they saw Mr. Trump squelch a bipartisan bill on border security?\n\nRegardless of the final constellation of party alignment in Washington, Dr. Binder doesn't see a Senate that accomplishes much beyond addressing taxes in the next year or two. \"That will absorb most of the energies of a Republican Senate.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story, which was originally published at 12:40 a.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 6, has been updated to reflect ongoing developments.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Those percentages significantly exceed Mr. Trump's performance in the 2020 election, when the same exit poll estimated Republican support from 32% of Latino voters and 36% of Latino men.\n\nExperts caution against reading too much into exit polls, which may be skewed given the large share of citizens voting early or by mail ballot. On top of that, Latinos are not a monolithic voting bloc, says John Tuman, executive associate dean in liberal arts and political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Their views can differ based on everything from ancestry and country of origin to religion and housing situations.\n\nDonald Trump's victory was aided by a significant rise in Latino support, according to exit polls. Some voters shifted loyalties due to concerns over the economy and inflation.\n\nAnd even with gains among Latino voters, Republican victories are largely the result of overwhelming support among white voters. Fifty-seven percent of white voters, who make up the bulk of the electorate, cast ballots favoring the GOP, according to the NBC News exit poll.\n\nStill, the big question now is what motivated the apparent surge of Republican support from Latino voters, who by some estimates could make up nearly 15% of the U.S. electorate this year. In certain battleground states, that percentage is even higher. Latinos were expected to represent a quarter of Arizona voters. In Nevada, they make up about 1 in every 5 voters.\n\n\"For many different demographic groups, including Latinos, inflation was just really a big driving factor,\" says Dr. Tuman, who has researched Latino voters. \"[It was] very hard for Biden and then Harris, who took over as a candidate very late in the campaign, to push back against that narrative.\"\n\nEighty-five percent of Latino voters cited the economy as \"very important\" in the presidential election, topping all other issues, according to a Pew Research Center survey released in September.\n\nOutside a Phoenix vote center Tuesday, an \"I Voted\" sticker is affixed to the brim of Sebastian Mario's baseball cap. The first-time voter - and Mexican-born American - chose Mr. Trump on the economy.\n\n\"Now that I'm an adult, and I've got to pay my own bills, I feel like it's really hard on people's pockets,\" said the 20-something plumber.\n\n\"I actually didn't like Trump,\" he clarified. However, \"I like his plan better.\"\n\nMr. Mario thought to himself as he voted: \"Don't make me regret this.\"\n\nJesus Marquez, a conservative strategist with the American Christian Caucus, agrees that economic concerns propelled more Latino voters toward Mr. Trump and Republicans, a trend afoot for several election cycles now. But he contends it's more than that.\n\nMr. Marquez says many Latino voters want stronger border security and greater parental rights, among other issues. Mr. Trump, he says, is the candidate who delivered that message in an unwavering fashion. On the Democratic side, Ms. Harris devoted a lot of time and messaging to reproductive rights, which Mr. Marquez says didn't necessarily have the same tug as other policy concerns among Latino voters.\n\n\"There's a lot of women who support abortion up until a certain stage, but they care more for other things,\" he says. \"They care more for providing for the family, for food, for the economy, and for security.\"\n\nDemocrats, however, hoped Mr. Trump's incendiary language about illegal immigration and plans for mass deportations would pull voters to their side. Vice President Kamala Harris routinely condemned such rhetoric, including that immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" And in the waning days of the campaign, a comedian at Mr. Trump's Madison Square Garden rally called Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage.\"\n\nFor some, that language did make a difference. Joshua Berrios, a Puerto Rican from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, was an undecided voter for much of the election, until he saw a clip of comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's performance at Mr. Trump's rally. He cast his vote for Ms. Harris.\n\nThe rhetoric wasn't enough to move the needle for other voters, though.\n\nIn Aurora, Colorado, Denisse Schaffino was also drawn to Mr. Trump on the economy. The Mexican-born Republican lost her job in the mortgage industry in 2022 as interest rates began to climb.

This may seem incongruous to many people. But if you watched the Republican National Convention, you saw other African Americans who think the way I do. We represent just a small slice of the Republican Party - and among Black people, we are a small minority - yet we are strong in force.\n\nWe are living in very challenging and polarizing times. It is important that we look at each other as people, not political perspectives. Our nation is divided. Problems between law enforcement and the Black community are at an all-time high. Now, more than ever, we need diversity of thoughts and opinions.\n\nOftentimes, as a media personality and conservative, I get ostracized because of my views. In many instances, I am judged for being conservative. But I face the same problems other Black men face. Many don't know, but I had a gun pulled on me in Washington, D.C., by an officer at a Walgreens over not wearing a mask. This was in early spring, when wearing masks was not enforced everywhere.\n\nBlack Americans have often been described by the news media or political experts as a monolithic voting bloc, a stereotype that fails to capture the wide diversity of views - even under a president deemed polarizing on race.\n\nWe had a miscommunication that resulted in me fearing for my life and him pointing a gun in my face as I screamed \"Please don't shoot!\" over and over while he pushed me to the ground in the middle of the street. It was a crazy experience.\n\nBut I will never forget police officer A.J. Smith, a white man, who was very kind and saw to it that I was treated fairly, even insisting that the other officer, who was also white, give me my paperwork after I was released. Officer Smith was direct and had my back.\n\nThe world is not a zero-sum game. We need to be able to listen to each other even if we disagree. Many people in the Black community demonize me because I am conservative and support Mr. Trump. But chastising and ridiculing people without hearing their thoughts is not how to solve things.\n\nThere are many reasons for Black voters to support Mr. Trump. Look at the First Step Act , which redresses sentencing rules leading to high rates of imprisonment among Black men and women and bans, with a few exceptions, shackling of women giving birth in federal prisons. In its first 18 months, nearly 1,700 inmates had sentences reduced, 91% of whom were Black.\n\nIn addition, the Black unemployment rate fell to 5.4% in October 2019, and Mr. Trump signed legislation securing a decade of annual funding for historically Black colleges and universities in December 2019. The preceding year, Mr. Trump nominated the first Black woman for promotion to brigadier general in the U.S. Marine Corps. Lastly, I want to point out the president's Platinum Plan , released in September, which pledges to \"increase access to capital in Black communities by almost $500 billon.\" President Trump is doing these things because he cares .\n\nSome have stated that the Charlottesville comment in which Mr. Trump stated that there were \"very fine people, on both sides\" is bad. However, this is an attempt by the media and the left to distort the president's words. A minute later, he clearly condemned Nazis and white supremacists when he said, \"I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists - because they should be condemned totally. But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists. OK? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.\"\n\nBeing conservative does not prevent me from being an effective voice for minority needs. We live in a country where free speech is essential. I believe it's time to look at each other as equal human beings, and that goes well beyond skin color. We cannot say that because you are a Democrat or a Republican, you cannot have a voice. That is an us or nothing mentality. You should not be forced to vote for former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris just because you are Black. It's OK to have diversity of thought.\n\nLook at the streets of Baltimore. Look at the effectiveness of Maryland's Republican congressional candidate Kimberly Klacik's recent ad, which drew national attention . Why was it so effective? Because people are tired! We have had the same leaders around for decades with broken promises. Many of our communities are impoverished and disenfranchised. People are ready to be independent thinkers.\n\nThe expectation for many is that if you are Black, you are expected to be a Democrat. People hear you are Republican and automatically shut you out. Yet we walk around saying we are all in this together.\n\nOf course, I have had my issues with racial injustice. But I continue to rise because I believe racism is not what America stands for. It is time for a change. It is time to be looked at fairly, regardless of our views.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nI am not going to bully someone in the streets because he doesn't think the way I want him to. It is time for us to respect each other as a nation. It seems to me you can be Black and a Republican and still think this country has work to do on race. Peacefully! Not by rioting, looting, and tearing down statues, but by embracing all the opportunities this country offers.\n\nLet me leave you with one thing: It is so important that we listen with open hearts and minds. Despite our disagreements, no matter how much you don't like the candidate your friend or family members support, the only way we can grow and build is together . We cannot stand united if we are not willing to hold each other up and truly hear each other out. We need to listen to understand, not to reply, and we need to remember that together we will and can prevail - but only if we truly respect each other and hear each other.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

What's more, the former president chose Thursday evening on which to surrender in Atlanta for his latest indictment , an obvious effort to eclipse postmortems on the debate and keep the focus on him.\n\nBut the eight Republicans on stage in Milwaukee last night gave voters plenty of fodder for discussion on the future of the GOP - and the country - if not the possibility that Mr. Trump could somehow lose the nomination. More likely, those on stage included potential running mates for Mr. Trump or members of his Cabinet if he regains the Oval Office.\n\nThe eight Republicans onstage in Milwaukee gave voters plenty of fodder for discussion on the future of the GOP - if not the possibility that Donald Trump could somehow lose the nomination.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, a wealthy entrepreneur rising in the polls, was a youthful stand-in for Mr. Trump. Barely old enough to run for president, Mr. Ramaswamy managed to compare himself to both former President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump. An American-born son of Indian immigrants, Mr. Ramaswamy called himself a \"skinny guy with a funny last name,\" an echo of Mr. Obama's pitch in 2004.\n\nBut with no previous experience in politics and a charismatic personality, Mr. Ramaswamy could also portray himself as a Trump-like figure, bringing a businessperson's sensibility to governance. He was the most MAGA - \"Make America Great Again\" - candidate on stage Wednesday, and thus possibly a contender for Trump vice president or Cabinet member.\n\nNikki Haley, former governor of South Carolina and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Mr. Trump, was another standout Wednesday night. She articulately framed the GOP's challenge on abortion , government spending , and support for Ukraine , and as the only woman in the Republican field, stood in for many voters in a key segment of the electorate.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you look at the 2024 budget, Republicans asked for $7.4 billion in earmarks. Democrats asked for $2.8 billion,\" Ms. Haley said. \"So you tell me, who are the big spenders? I think it's time for an accountant in the White House.\"\n\nMaybe \"accountant in the White House\" isn't the most compelling message, but Ms. Haley's point is important. Republicans used to stand for fiscal responsibility, and after the free-spending Trump era, that's now in doubt. Her call for fiscal prudence speaks to a significant portion of the GOP base, and it's a message she could build on.\n\nMs. Haley's message on abortion - a nuanced take on the reality of women in an unwanted pregnancy - also introduced a fresh perspective in a male-dominated field that could help the GOP.\n\nIt's easy to say that, with no clear winner, Mr. Trump \"won\" the first Republican debate. But his decision to skip the debate could also be portrayed as a mistake. As a TV performer focused on ratings, he missed the opportunity for a big cable audience, opting instead for an interview with former Fox host Tucker Carlson on X, the website formerly known as Twitter.\n\nBut it's also apparent that Mr. Trump \"beat\" his top primary opponent, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has struggled with relatability. Governor DeSantis barely smiled during the two-hour debate. And while he didn't stumble, he also didn't distinguish himself. Mr. DeSantis needed a breakout moment , and it didn't happen.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nIt's still early, and maybe Mr. DeSantis can step up his game. As a Trump-friendly GOP activist noted by text Thursday morning, \"50%+ of Republicans are open to voting for him, which is second behind Trump.\"\n\nAll of which means, this ain't over.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Advisers told reporters that Mr. Trump was reassessing his messaging, and Mr. Trump himself said as much in a post-shooting interview with the Washington Examiner. His speech Thursday night would bring the whole country together, he said, if not the whole world.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump took the podium Thursday evening, it did seem - for the first 15 minutes - that he tried to do just that.\n\nIn accepting the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump envisioned a nation \"more united than ever before.\" But his speech included sharp attacks on President Joe Biden, as both parties also confront open or latent fissures within.\n\n\"The discord and division in our society must be healed,\" said Mr. Trump, before he formally accepted the Republican nomination. \"I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America. Because there is no victory in winning for half of America.\"\n\nSoon after, however, he shifted back into old patterns, abandoning his teleprompter for long stretches. In a rambling 92-minute performance, Mr. Trump repeated many of his usual talking points from rallies. The crowd roared when he vowed to enact the \"largest deportation operation,\" and when he referred to President Joe Biden as worse than America's 10 worst presidents put together - despite a pre-speech promise to not refer to Mr. Biden by name.\n\nIn many ways, Mr. Trump's speech was the culmination of a week that has felt less like a warmup for the campaign's toughest, final stretch and more like an election night victory party. And the GOP's palpable air of optimism and camaraderie was fueled by two events outside Wisconsin that were entirely out of Mr. Trump's control.\n\nAfter the assassination attempt against Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania just days ago, his supporters, many donning makeshift ear bandages mimicking the former president's, said they felt inspired anew . \"It's like when something bad happens in your family and you all band together,\" said Gary Leffler, an alternate delegate from Iowa. \"The assassination attempt has drawn everyone that much closer. It had an extremely unifying consequence to it.\"\n\nAt the same time, the chaotic unraveling taking place among Democrats back in Washington, with the drip-drip-drip of congressional statements against Mr. Biden's candidacy and increasingly dire poll numbers - showing Mr. Trump with a clear lead - made attendees here almost giddy with anticipation .\n\nWhen asked about the Republican Party's sudden unity, Peter Navarro, a former Trump adviser who spoke at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday evening after being released from prison for defying a congressional subpoena related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, answered in the reverse. \"The Democratic Party,\" he said, \"is in complete disarray.\"\n\nPolitical disarray, of course, is what happens when a party believes it is on track to lose. It was after Mr. Biden's disastrous June 27 debate performance that Democrats' internal strife began in earnest. And as Republicans are now demonstrating, it's easy to paper over differences and come together when your team is running up the scoreboard.\n\nThe display of GOP unity this week was all the more remarkable, coming after a year of vicious infighting in the House of Representatives that led to the ouster of a Republican speaker. And certainly, it stood in stark contrast to the bitter internal divisions on view in 2016 over Mr. Trump's candidacy - divisions that over the past eight years caused many anti-Trump Republicans to leave the party.\n\nIt's clearly Mr. Trump's party more than ever. But as he leaves Milwaukee as the Republican presidential nominee for a third time, only time will tell if this newfound party unity is conditional - if Mr. Trump and his supporters will insist on total fealty going forward, or if the party's full-throated support of Mr. Trump is in part a product of polling leads.\n\n\"I think Trump has done an excellent job unifying people. ... But also, I give a lot of credit to the Democrats. Their division unites us more,\" former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy said in an interview Thursday afternoon. \"I hope Republicans learn from this, that we're stronger together and we're weaker divided. A house divided cannot stand.\"\n\nMr. McCarthy's own political demise, of course, points to the recent internal cracks that have, for now, been papered over. The former speaker was ousted last year by a small faction of disgruntled party members - one of whom, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, was caught taunting Mr. McCarthy here as he was giving an on-camera interview.\n\nIt's also notable who wasn't in the arena to hear Mr. Trump's promises of togetherness.\n\nHis former vice president, Mike Pence, was fishing in Montana . The 2012 Republican presidential ticket - Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and former Rep. Paul Ryan - wasn't here. Republican former President George W. Bush did not make an appearance, nor did former Vice President Dick Cheney or his daughter, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney. More than half a dozen Republican Senate candidates gave prime-time speeches Tuesday evening, but former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who has so far declined to endorse Mr. Trump while running for a Senate seat that would be a dream pickup for Republicans, was absent.\n\n\"You can always say, 'Oh, so-and-so didn't come.' Who cares? It's their right not to come,\" said New York Rep. Mike Lawler.\n\nInstead, many attendees noted all the onetime Trump opponents who were present, like primary rivals Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who endorsed Mr. Trump for the first time in her convention speech.\n\n\"You saw many of President Trump's primary opponents here speaking; they were well received,\" said Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. He said that this convention, the 10th he has attended, was more unified than the Cleveland convention he presided over as home-state governor eight years ago.\n\nStill, when Ms. Haley first came onstage Tuesday, a smattering of boos rippled from the crowd. The greeting for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history, when he announced Kentucky's delegates for Mr. Trump on Monday, was almost hostile .\n\n\"The party has moved from an elitist party to a working-class party. That includes the Bushes and Mike Pence,\" said Mary Downey, an alternate delegate from Florida wearing an American flag dress. \"It's not the Republican Party of 30 years ago anymore.\"\n\nThat's true not just in terms of personnel, but also in policy. In Republicans' 2024 party platform, two longtime pillars - abortion and guns - were largely missing from this year's document , which Mr. Trump and his team reportedly rewrote themselves and drastically shortened from the 2016-2020 version.\n\n\"As somebody that's a Republican that believes in pro-life and believes in character that matters and believes in global leadership, I want to stay in the party and fight for some of the principles that I believe in,\" said former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, one of the few Trump-critical Republicans who attended the convention without endorsing the former president, in an interview Monday. But he seemed resigned to the fact that this wasn't the old GOP he came up in.\n\n\"It's his party,\" said Mr. Hutchinson.\n\nNot helping Mr. Hutchinson's decision is Mr. Trump's choice for vice president. Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance was \"the most MAGA person that was out there\" among the known contenders, said Mr. Hutchinson, who worried about Mr. Vance's opposition to supporting Ukraine. Governor DeWine of Ohio voiced similar concerns.\n\n\"It was good for J.D. Vance last night to openly acknowledge that we have differences,\" said Mr. DeWine of the vice presidential nominee's speech Wednesday evening.\n\nBut as Mr. Trump's thousands of delegates cheered to his greatest hits during his convention speech, intraparty policy differences didn't seem top of mind. And the former president himself seemed to recognize the gift of this political moment.\n\n\"I better finish strong or else I'll blow it,\" said Mr. Trump. \"And we can't do that.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

As the US diversifies, to remain relevant, the GOP must abandon divisive language that Michelle Bachmann and others have used recently and instead embrace a more unifying message.\n\nLoading...\n\nJuly 31, 2012, 3:22 p.m. ET | Oxford, England\n\nRep. Michelle Bachmann and her cohort of right-wing Republicans are using identity, religion, and race as a permanent wedge issue - most recently in their unsubstantiated attack on Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton 's Muslim aide Huma Abedin . When Ms. Bachmann was criticized for her suggestion that Ms. Abedin be investigated for potential ties to the Muslim Brotherhood , Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh rushed to her defense.\n\nBy tapping into the powerful undercurrents of race and religion, Ms. Bachmann and others are using language to satisfy their immediate political ends, by dividing Americans and thereby America into pro- and anti-American parts.\n\nIn a diverse country built by immigrants, why are some Republicans taking this divisive approach?\n\nAt its most fundamental level, politics is about the creation of ideological communities where an individual can find a home. These political homes provide a sense of belonging and a safe place for individuals in a political and physical environment that can often seem hostile or confusing.\n\nAs documented in the 2010 Census, the United States is in the midst of a demographic transformation. Minorities, now roughly one-third of the US population, are expected to become the collective majority before the middle of the century. These changes will have a long-term cultural and political impact, but they are also fueling an immediate backlash.\n\nIt appears that a small group of Americans have met these demographic changes with a mixture of fear and anxiety. America is changing too quickly and too uncomfortably for some, and it seems they have looked to their political home for reassurance and guidance.\n\nIt is this fear of the \"un-American\" that undergirds the persistent assertion by 17 percent of registered voters that President Obama is Muslim. Others label him a socialist. Such mistrust has also led to the ongoing \"birther\" movement - those who question the validity of Mr. Obama's birth certificate, alleging he was born in Kenya . Republican celebrities like Donald Trump have at times tacitly or overtly endorsed such groups.\n\nInstead of reassuring their members, this fringe group of Republicans has exploited the environment of mistrust to secure votes and fill their campaign coffers. By fashioning themselves as defenders of what Sarah Palin once termed \"real America,\" these melancholic preachers have used nostalgia to contrive a vision of a homogeneous America that is supposedly slipping away.\n\nNot all Republicans are guilty of domestic divisiveness, but it is an unfortunate reality that members such as Bachmann and Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas (who is continuing the accusations of Muslim Brotherhood influence in America) are allowed a prominent home under the Republican tent. The tragic irony of their vision is not that America is slipping from their grasp, but rather that the Republican fringe is increasingly hostile to the American ideal of a multi-cultural and pluralistic society.\n\nWhile presidential campaigns are often decided on wedge issues, a continued strategy within parts of the Republican Party to vilify those from diverse backgrounds as \"un-American\" is incredibly shortsighted.\n\nAttempts by the Republican Party in Pennsylvania , Florida , and more than a dozen other states to implement voter ID laws renews concerns. These voter ID laws, supposedly meant to combat voter fraud, have the potential to disenfranchise millions of voters - create road blocks to voting for millions of Americans who are predominantly from minority backgrounds.\n\nThough such restrictions may be politically expedient to Republicans in the short-term, they ignore a more pressing challenge. The proportion of the population represented by Ms. Palin's and Bachmann's \"real Americans\" (white) is shrinking, and America is in the midst of an era of change and renewal. As our nation continues to diversify, the Republican Party will be unable to remain relevant unless it embraces a set of more enlightened policies and a more unifying message.\n\nThe lack of diversity within the Republican Party is already marginalizing them in what were once competitive states. Even Obama, in a fundraising trip to deep red Texas last month, declared that Texas could be a battleground state \"soon,\" an allusion to the increasing Hispanic population there and the potential for such demographic shifts to reshape the political landscape.\n\nBoth parties must acknowledge and try to solve the real issues facing all Americans, beyond momentary political gains. If some Republicans continue to resist the changes taking place, then a common effort to solve our problems will likely not be possible. There is an urgent need for an emphasis on solving problems and less on divisive rhetoric.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "House Republicans hit the brakes on town halls after blowback over Trump's cuts\n\nWASHINGTON - House Republicans are becoming weary and wary of in-person town hall meetings after a number of lawmakers have faced hometown crowds angry about the Trump administration's push to slash government programs and staffing.\n\nParty leaders suggest that if lawmakers feel the need to hold such events, they do tele-town halls or at least vet attendees to avoid scenes that become viral clips, according to GOP sources.\n\nA GOP aide said House Republican leaders are urging lawmakers to stop engaging in them altogether.\n\nThe town halls, and the rash of negative headlines, have been the first bit of public blowback for members who face voters next year. And the new reluctance to hold them indicates there are bubbling concerns about the impact the cuts could have on the GOP's chances of holding its thin majority in the House next year.\n\nThe viral nature of video clips spreading from one district to another means a bad confrontation in safe Republican territory could influence voters in battlegrounds.\n\nThe GOP-led House is trying to enact even deeper spending and tax cuts through legislation that could add as much as $4.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. But much of the tension focused on billionaire Elon Musk, the face of President Donald Trump's effort to unilaterally eliminate jobs, contracts and grants. Musk, who is a \"special government employee\" advising Trump, did not require Senate confirmation to take his temporary post.\n\n\"Obviously we're very aware of those headlines,\" a Republican National Committee official familiar with the dynamics said.\n\n\"I don't know that a specific edict is going to come down from on high that they need to stop or anything, but a message I believe has been clearly sent that this narrative should end very soon,\" the official said. \"Probably the best way for that to happen is no more town halls. Elon Musk's work still has the administration's support, period.\"\n\nBeyond that, White House and party officials say the majority of the public wants the budget cuts.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\n\"The president's policies are incredibly popular, and the American people applaud his success in cutting the waste, fraud and abuse of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars,\" said Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser at the RNC. \"Pathetic astroturf campaigns organized by out-of-touch, far-left groups are exactly why Democrats will keep losing.\"\n\nA Republican lawmaker who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity to avoid publicly divulging internal party strategy, said that the RNC has been helpful in making suggestions about how House Republicans can handle the situation but that it stopped short of trying to impose an impossible-to-enforce moratorium.\n\nLawmakers are spooked enough about the prospects of heated exchanges that most of them do not want to do town halls anyway, this Republican said.\n\nA chief of staff to a House Republican who has won handily compared the dynamics with tough town halls in the 2018 midterms. While Democrats won control of the House that year, GOP lawmakers in Republican-heavy districts may have benefited from a backlash to the criticism.\n\n\"It's 2018 all over again,\"\n\nthe aide said. \"The town halls, if anything, helped in districts like ours.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "U.S. Senate Republicans pass measure to move forward on Trump's tax cuts\n\nThe U.S. Senate approved a Republican budget blueprint early on Saturday that aims to extend trillions of dollars worth of President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts and sharply reduce government spending.\n\nThe vote, following an all-night legislative session, unlocks a maneuver that will allow Republicans to bypass the Senate's filibuster and pass the tax cuts later this year without Democratic votes.\n\nNon-partisan analysts say the measure, if enacted, would add about $5.7 trillion to the federal government's debt over the next decade. Senate Republicans contend the cost is $1.5 trillion, saying that the effects of extending existing tax policy that was scheduled to expire at the end of this year should not be counted in the measure's cost.\n\nThe measure also aims to raise the federal government's debt ceiling by $5 trillion, a move Congress has to make by summer or risk defaulting on $36.6 trillion in debt. It aims to partly offset the deficit-raising costs of tax cuts by cutting spending. Democrats have warned that Republican targets would imperil the Medicaid health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nRepublican Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, warned that allowing the 2017 tax cuts to expire would hit Americans hard.\n\n\"The average taxpayer would see a 22% tax hike. A family of four making $80,610, the median income in the United States, would see a $1,695 tax increase,\" Graham said. The 2017 cuts, Trump's signature legislative achievement in his first term, cut the top corporate tax cut to 21% from 35%, a move that is not set to expire.\n\nThe balance of the cuts, for individual Americans, were set to expire, a decision made to limit the 2017 bill's deficit-raising effects.\n\n\"The Republican bill that now sits before the Senate is poison,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, said on Friday. \"But as Americans learn that Republicans are doing it simply to give tax cuts to the ultra-rich, an electric shock is going to go through the American people.\"\n\nHanging over the debate, which began late on Thursday, was a brutal stock market sell-off following Trump's sweeping new trade tariffs, which economists warned will drive up prices and could trigger a recession.\n\nDemocrats offered dozens of amendments on matters ranging from protecting Social Security retirement benefits to shielding care for veterans. They were mainly blocked by Republicans.\n\nIt is now up to the House to debate and possibly tinker with this complicated measure.\n\nSeveral hours into Friday's debate, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky - a rare Republican opponent of the measure - summarized the feelings of conservative deficit hawks.\n\n\"On the one hand, it appears as if all this great savings is happening. But on the other hand, the resolution before us will increase the debt by $5 trillion. So, which is it? Are we cutting spending or are we expanding the debt?\"\n\nThere likely will be spending cuts by the time the dust settles, as bills are passed to enforce the budget plan. The most controversial one, arguably, would be if Republicans end up including $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid.\n\nThat, said independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, \"would make a bad situation worse by throwing millions of kids off the health care that they have.\"\n\nRepublicans have maintained that Medicaid would not be cut. Instead, they say they would achieve savings by making the program more efficient.\n\nIf House Republicans get their way, there could be net spending cuts in the range of $2 trillion.\n\nThe budget blueprint would also make room for increased security measures at the southwest border with Mexico and administration efforts to significantly ramp up immigrant deportations.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "At town halls, Republicans feel the heat from Trump and Musk's firing and cutting spree\n\nMany members of the House skipped holding large, public events while out of Washington this week. But the Republicans who did hold town halls back home got an earful.\n\nAt events from Georgia and Wisconsin to Oklahoma and Oregon, House Republicans faced sometimes-hostile crowds furious about the sweeping budget cuts and mass firings of federal workers that President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency are carrying out.\n\nWith the House on recess and many lawmakers returning to their districts, this week was the first opportunity for them to hear directly from constituents about Trump and Musk's scorched-earth strategy to cut spending and shrink the federal government's footprint.\n\nAt City Hall in Roswell, a suburb of Atlanta, on Thursday night, attendees jeered and talked over Republican Rep. Rich McCormick as they peppered him with tough questions about the cuts - and the seemingly indiscriminate way some of them are being carried out.\n\nOne man asked McCormick how Musk's DOGE could fire employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration , which safeguards America's nuclear weapons, and other federal employees who had been working to combat the bird flu outbreak . More than 1,000 workers also have been laid off from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , a major employer in Atlanta.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\n\"Why is the supposedly conservative party taking such a radical and extremist and sloppy approach to this?\" the man said as the room erupted in applause, according to videos posted on X by Greg Bluestein, a journalist with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and a NBC News contributor.\n\n\"A lot of the work they do is duplicitous with AI,\" responded McCormick, referring to artificial intelligence, a remark that sparked disagreement from the crowd. \"I happen to be a doctor. I know a few things, OK?\"\n\n\"If we continue to grow the size of government, and we can't afford it, it's going to have shortfalls in your Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security,\" the congressman continued. \"We have to make some decisions.\"\n\nAt the start of the town hall, a woman told McCormick, who represents a safe Republican seat outside Atlanta, that it was Congress' job to direct and appropriate federal spending, \"not the president, and you are doing a disservice to set that down and not stand up for us.\"\n\nMany of these issues \"will be litigated in court,\" McCormick said, prompting more jeers.\n\n\"But we're pissed!\" another attendee yelled out.\n\nThe contentious town halls could be an early sign of political backlash to come for elected Republicans as thousands of federal workers around the country begin getting pink slips and Americans start to feel the impact , as the GOP-controlled Congress largely yields to Trump and Musk .\n\nOne Republican lawmaker said it appeared that constituents who've been \"quiet\" since Joe Biden's 2020 victory are back out in force.\n\n\"Too much too fast seems to be a common refrain,\" the lawmaker continued. \"Need to review each program, department or agency first and then make calculated decisions. But generally frustrated right now by lack of clarity.\"\n\nSome House Republicans hosted virtual or tele-town halls, which can be moderated more easily. But at the few in-person town halls around the country this week, GOP lawmakers were on the defensive as they were quizzed about the mass firings and potential future cuts to Medicaid .\n\nIn West Bend, Wisconsin, GOP Rep. Scott Fitzgerald faced several tough questions at a town hall Thursday, including from attendee Michael Wittig, who was holding a sign reading, \"Presidents are not kings.\"\n\n\"Are you going to subpoena him at some point? Are you willing to use your subpoena power to tell Musk to stand in front of Congress and answer some hard questions?\" Wittig asked, according to a report from WTMJ , the NBC News affiliate in Milwaukee.\n\nThat same question came up in Glenpool, Oklahoma, where attendees told Rep. Kevin Hern, a member of GOP leadership, that he wasn't doing his job standing up to the executive branch. \"We're seeing the administration undermining Congress,\" a mother with a baby in her lap told Hern, according to News9 in Oklahoma City . \"Will you call Elon Musk in to testify under oath to explain what he's doing?\" asked another attendee.\n\nAt a town hall in Baker City, Oregon , a man who identified himself as Terry Strommer, a military veteran from Oxbow, told GOP Rep. Cliff Bentz that his office had been unresponsive when he raised concerns about Musk.\n\n\"I'll just ask you, if you think that he's doing it right. Would you like all of your private records revealed and pulled up by a bunch of people that weren't elected, they're just randomly appointed, a bunch of 20-year-olds?\" the man said. \"I know that when I was in the service, there was a chain of command and we answered to somebody. I don't see him answering to anybody.\"\n\nBentz defended Musk, calling him \"an absolute world-renowned expert\" who could overhaul the government's \"antiquated systems.\" Some in the crowd laughed at Bentz's description.\n\nAnd back in Wisconsin, attendees confronted GOP Rep. Glenn Grothman about potential cuts in Trump and congressional Republicans' spending plans.\n\nAsked whether cuts to Social Security or Medicaid would push him to oppose a GOP spending bill, Grothman said, \"Well, certainly if Social Security is cut, and Medicaid, we'll have to see about that.\"\n\nThe raucous town halls conjured memories of those in 2009 - the start of the tea party movement - when constituents protested over Democrats' massive health care bill, which became the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe next year, a red wave gave House Republicans a staggering 63-seat gain and swept Democrats out of power. Democrats hope that the palpable frustration could be an accelerant for them in next year's midterms, though the specifics of the modern House battlefield, shaped by two rounds of precise redistricting since 2010, make the kind of tsunami Republicans rode then hard to replicate.\n\nAt this juncture, some Republicans are also questioning just how deep the backlash in these congressional town halls runs.\n\n\"I love how the media takes a few critics when the overwhelming response from the American people is support for what this administration is doing,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in response to questions from NBC News.\n\nShe added: \"There should be no secret about the fact that this administration is committed to cutting waste, fraud and abuse. The president campaigned on that promise. Americans elected him on that promise, and he's actually delivering on it. And this is something that Democrats promised they would do for decades.\"\n\nStill, a Republican strategist on the front lines of the tea party wave said he sees early glimmers of a similar phenomenon now, with the GOP facing voter anger over the economic situation the same way the Democratic trifecta did in 2009.\n\n\"The Republican mandate coming out of the 2024 election was pretty clear: Tackle the rising cost of living in America,\" said Ken Spain, who served as communications director for the House Republican campaign arm in 2009 and 2010. \"As exciting as it may be for the Republican base, most voters don't naturally make a connection between aggressively cutting the size of the federal workforce and their pocketbooks.\"\n\nSpain also said Republicans still have time to avoid getting swamped like Democrats did in 2010.\n\n\"We're one month into the new administration, so it's too early to start drawing immediate parallels to the tea party protests of 2009, but Republicans must pivot to connecting the dots between their actions and the tangible economic benefits for the working class,\" Spain said. \"Otherwise, the echoes of 2009 could become increasingly louder.\"\n\nRecent surveys show some potential peril for Republicans because of Trump's early actions, particularly his efforts to thin the ranks of the federal workforce.\n\nNarrow majorities of American adults in polling from CNN and The Washington Post/Ipsos said they believe Trump has overstepped as president.\n\nBoth polls also found a majority disagreeing with his attempts to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development. And the Post's poll found that 58% opposed his efforts to lay off large numbers of federal government workers.\n\nJesse Ferguson, a veteran Democratic strategist who worked on House races during the Obama era, said he sees parallels to the 2018 cycle, when Trump's party faced a backlash in the midterms.\n\n\"Republicans are taking heat cause people feel like things are out-of-control and see the GOP as becoming responsible for the problem instead of being part of the solution,\" he said. \"When life feels out of control, the last thing you want is Trump and Musk chainsawing apart everything you depend on.\"\n\n\"In 2010, Democrats felt the backlash from owning a bad status quo, and in 2018, Republicans felt the backlash for trying to take important things away,\" Ferguson said. \"In 2025, Republicans are managing to do both.\"\n\nOne outstanding political question is whether voters take any frustration over those actions out on largely powerless Democrats, too.\n\nStuck in the minority in Congress, House and Senate Democrats have been protesting the firings and cuts , holding rallies and in some cases confronting security personnel outside federal agency buildings around Washington. But some Democrats are also feeling the heat from constituents who urged them to fight harder against Musk's DOGE efforts.\n\nAt a packed town hall in Albany, New York, a man told Democratic Rep. Paul Tonko that he had watched the congressman on TV protesting the cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Education. But he called on Tonko to do more because Musk and Republicans \"are not playing by the rules.\"\n\n\"If you ask us to show up, Congressman Tonko, we will show up. ... We have to take it to them,\" the man said, according to a video posted on Facebook . When he turned on the TV, \"I was so proud that my representative was on the front line. But I thought about Jimmy Carter and I thought about John Lewis, and I know what John Lewis would have done. He would have gotten arrested that day.\n\n\"Make them outlaw you,\" he continued as the applause grew louder. \"We will stand behind you, we will be there with you. I will get arrested with you.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Chuck Schumer says he won't block Republican funding bill amid Democratic divisions over shutdown strategy\n\nWASHINGTON - Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., indicated Thursday he would vote to advance Republicans' six-month funding bill that passed the House to avert a government shutdown Friday night.\n\nThe move is a major concession from Schumer, yielding to the GOP measure just one day after he vowed that Democrats wouldn't allow it to pass. It means the bill is likely to find enough votes to clear the 60-vote threshold and eventually pass with a simple majority, even as a growing number of Senate Democrats came out in opposition to it Thursday.\n\n\"There are no winners in a government shutdown,\" Schumer said in a floor speech. \"It's not really a decision; it's a Hobson's choice: Either proceed with the bill before us or risk Donald Trump throwing America into the chaos of a shutdown.\n\n\"For sure, the Republican bill is a terrible option. It is not a clean CR [continuing resolution]. It is deeply partisan. It doesn't address far too many of this country's needs. But I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,\" he added. \"I will vote to keep the government open and not shut it down.\"\n\nSchumer informed his colleagues in a closed-door meeting that he would vote for the procedural motion to advance the funding bill when it comes to the Senate floor Friday, according to a source familiar with his remarks. The New York Times first reported Schumer's private comments .\n\nIf the Senate passes the bill, it would then go to President Donald Trump's desk for a signature. A shutdown occurs after 11:59 p.m. ET Friday if no law is enacted by then.\n\n\"We have a choice between terrible and awful,\" said Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga.\n\nIt's unclear what, if anything, Schumer got in return for his decision to allow the House bill to proceed. He told reporters after his Senate speech that Democrats would \"try to get some amendments on the bill.\"\n\nBefore his comments, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., hinted that Democrats could try to secure a vote on an amendment to the House bill to turn it into a 30-day, rather than a six-month, stopgap measure. But he didn't commit to dropping opposition to the bill if the amendment were voted down.\n\nJohn Fetterman, of Pennsylvania, is the only Senate Democrat who has said he'd vote to advance the House bill; several others have stayed quiet about how they would handle a procedural vote. Schumer told reporters that \"members are making their own decisions right now.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, a growing number of Senate Democrats vowed to oppose the legislation. They included John Hickenlooper, of Colorado, who called the bill \"dangerous\"; Mark Kelly, of Arizona, who said it would \"give unchecked power to Donald Trump and Elon Musk\"; Ruben Gallego, of Arizona, who blasted it as \"a grab bag of extreme policies\"; and Mark Warner, of Virginia, who called it \"a terrible deal\" that would hurt Virginia.\n\n\"One thing is certain: If we pass this continuing resolution for the next half year, we will own what the president does,\" said Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. \"I am not willing to take ownership of that.\"\n\nFrom outside the Democratic lunch meeting, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., could be heard yelling about devastating impacts of a government shutdown, particularly now.\n\nSenators have faced heavy pressure from House Democratic colleagues and liberal advocates outside of the Capitol to hold the line against the funding bill, which was crafted by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and the White House.\n\nEarlier this week, just one House Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, voted for the bill, which party leaders in the chamber railed against.\n\nAfter Schumer spoke on the Senate floor, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told reporters there is a \"deep sense of outrage and betrayal\" from House Democrats.\n\n\"There are members of Congress who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territory in the United States, who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people, in order to defend Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. ... Just to see some Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think it is a huge slap in the face, and I think that there is a wide sense of betrayal if things proceed as currently planned,\" she said.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nYet even as some Democrats were rallying against the House GOP bill, they struggled to offer a plausible endgame to avert a shutdown - or reopen the government if funding lapses after Friday night. They demanded a 30-day stopgap measure to continue funding at status quo levels to reach a full funding deal for fiscal year 2025.\n\nThat discombobulated approach clashes with the fact that Trump and Johnson have said they don't want an appropriations deal for a fiscal year that is already half over, as they want to move on to their party-line budget bill to address taxes, immigration and other priorities.\n\n\"We're trying to convince them. Now, they can be convinced or unconvinced,\" Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., said about the GOP's rejection of a new appropriations deal.\n\nDemocratic senators have cited numerous objections to the House bill.\n\nFirst, they had no input in developing it - some in the party fear that voting for it would empower Johnson and Trump to dictate outcomes without negotiating with Democrats to earn their votes.\n\nSecond, they object to provisions that would cut nondefense domestic spending by billions of dollars, including a hit to Washington, D.C.'s budget, while boosting military spending - a move they see as sacrificing Democratic priorities for GOP priorities.\n\nThird, they worry that voting for the measure without guardrails on executive power would green-light Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk's moves to dismantle parts of the federal government or refuse to spend money directed by Congress.\n\nA new memo Thursday from the Center for American Progress Action Fund, led by longtime Democratic adviser Neera Tanden, called on the party to hold the line against the House Republican bill, making the policy and messaging case for it.\n\n\"While the consequences of a shutdown are real, Democrats bear no responsibility in fact or in public perception if they continue to support a clean CR or clean 30-day CR. However, supporting the MAGA plan will sap momentum that is building against Republicans,\" said the memo, which NBC News obtained from a congressional Democratic source who received it. \"Lawmakers must focus on connecting the so-called CR to how the Administration and DOGE are actively causing radical harm.\"\n\nSome Democrats believe voters will blame Republicans in the event of a government shutdown. In a new Quinnipiac University national poll , 53% of registered voters said they would blame Trump or Republicans in Congress if the government shut down; 32% said they would blame Democrats. Another 15% didn't know or wouldn't say.\n\n\"Jiminy Christmas! Republicans control the House, Senate and White House,\" said Sen. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M.\n\nBut Senate Republican leaders say it's time to dispense with the debate over fiscal 2025 funding, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Thursday on the floor that the House bill was the only path to prevent a shutdown.\n\n\"Democrats need to decide if they're going to support funding legislation that came over from the House or if they're going to shut down the government,\" he said.\n\nSchumer told reporters after his floor speech that he's convinced he made the right decision because of how difficult it would be to reopen the government.\n\n\"There is no off-ramp,\" he said. \"Anyone who thinks there might be an off-ramp knows it depends on the Republicans, and I don't trust them at all. I think they want a shutdown, and I think they want to use the shutdown to decimate the federal government.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Poll: Trump faces early challenges on the economy as a united GOP backs big change\n\nVoters are starting 2025 sour on the state of the economy and President Donald Trump 's handling of it so far, even as his election to a second term sparked an upswing in positive feelings about the direction of the nation, according to a new national NBC News poll .\n\nBuoyed by jubilant and unified Republicans, who are standing in lockstep with Trump and the expansive agenda he and congressional leaders are pushing in Washington, more registered voters see the U.S. as heading in the right direction than at any point since early 2004, though a majority still say the country is on the wrong track. Trump's approval rating also equals his best-ever mark as president (47%), though again, a majority (51%) disapproves of his performance.\n\nMeanwhile, driven in part by a pessimistic shift among Democrats since Trump's election, just 18% of voters rate the economy as \"excellent\" or \"good\" - not as low as the poorest economic marks during the Biden administration, according to CNBC polling from 2022, but within a handful of points, and as low as that mark has been in NBC News polling since 2014. Majorities of voters disapprove of Trump's early job performance on the economy (54% disapprove, 44% approve) and how he's handling inflation and the cost of living (55% disapprove, 42% approve).\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nIt's a new development for Trump, who never previously had a majority against his handling of the economy in a national NBC News poll. Now, he is confronting jittery markets and businesses amid his early moves to put tariffs on U.S. neighbors and other allies. Trump also faces questions from voters about whether he is sufficiently focused on their core issue of costs as he pursues other projects like reshaping the federal bureaucracy.\n\nOverall, the poll reflects an America that remains deeply divided in the months following Trump's 2024 victory, as it was in the months before.\n\nVoters narrowly disapprove of Trump's overall job performance, but the margin is closer than at almost any point during his first term. His personal ratings and the share of Republicans identifying as part of the MAGA movement have grown, reflecting the unity inside his party giving him wide latitude in a GOP-controlled Washington.\n\nIn another change from Trump's first term in the White House, the public has come around on his deportation-focused immigration policies, though voters are wary of his handling of other issues, including foreign policy.\n\nVoters like the general idea of the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump-blessed effort to slash government jobs and spending. But they harbor reservations about its rapid-fire execution so far, as well as about billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, DOGE's de facto head.\n\nAnd voters are split evenly on which party they'd like to see win the 2026 midterm elections, even as the Democratic Party faces record-low popularity and fractious divides over how to respond to Trump. (The survey was conducted March 7-11, before Senate Democrats provided a handful of votes to help resolve a government funding fight.)\n\n\"While this survey shows a mixed result for Donald Trump, Democrats are the ones in the wilderness right now,\" said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies. Horwitt called Trump's upside-down numbers among independents \"a flashing red light across the survey.\"\n\nMcInturff noted how Trump has fortified his base over the last year. The political story of the next year, he said, will be whether voter dissatisfaction on the economy or other issues takes hold - \"or the strength of the Republican and Trump base has maintained a very competitive election\" in 2026, McInturff continued.\n\nTrump's job approval rating (47%) and personal favorable rating (46%), along with the 44% who believe the country is on the right track, are at all-time highs in NBC News polling during his political career.\n\nBut they are also far below where previous presidents stood during the \"honeymoon period\" of new administrations, marking the polarization that has defined the Trump years. Slightly more disapprove of Trump's job performance (51%) and view him personally negatively (49%), and 54% see the country as on the wrong track.\n\nUnderscoring the deep partisan divide, Trump has the largest gap of any president in the last 80 years between his approval rating among members of his own party (90%) and his approval rating from the opposing party (4%), according to an analysis of three decades of NBC News polling and earlier data from Gallup.\n\nAmong independents, 30% approve and 67% disapprove of Trump's performance in office. A large gender gap still persists, with men approving of Trump's job performance 55%-43%, while women split the other way, 40%-58%.\n\nVice President JD Vance is viewed positively by 41% of voters and negatively by 47%. That compares unfavorably to the even or positive appraisals of vice presidents at the beginning of the previous three administrations, according to NBC News polls.\n\nWhen it comes to the issues, Trump fares particularly well on immigration. Fifty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of border security and immigration, while 43% disapprove. A similar share, 56%, say he's bringing the \"right kind of change\" on the issue, while 25% say he's bringing the wrong change and 18% say he isn't bringing change.\n\nBut that's the only one of the five issues tested in the poll - border security and immigration, foreign policy, the economy, inflation and cost of living, and the war between Russia and Ukraine - that sees a majority of American voters approve of how Trump is handling it.\n\nForty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of foreign policy and 53% disapprove of it, while 42% approve of his handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, with 55% disapproving.\n\nThe split between how voters see his delivery on immigration and on economic issues comes after Trump identified them as the twin pillars of his 2024 victory, telling NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" in December : \"I won on the border and I won on groceries.\"\n\nJust 1% rate the economy as \"excellent\" and 17% as \"good,\" with 39% calling it \"only fair\" and 43% rating it \"poor.\" While Republicans are more likely to have favorable views of the economy than others, majorities across virtually every demographic still view the economy in an unfavorable light.\n\nAbout one-third (32%) of voters say their family's income is staying about even with the cost of living, but 60% say it's falling behind. Another 7% say their family's income is rising faster than the cost of living.\n\nAsked to gauge their satisfaction about how much Trump is doing to battle inflation, a majority say they aren't satisfied - 46% say they are \"not at all satisfied\" and another 9% say they are \"not too satisfied,\" while 20% are \"somewhat\" satisfied and 23% are \"very\" satisfied.\n\nThe NBC News poll also gauged voters' feelings on what kind of change Trump is bringing as president, with 40% saying he's bringing the right kind of change to inflation and the cost of living, while 30% say he's bringing the wrong change and 28% say he isn't bringing change.\n\nOn trade and tariffs, 41% say he's bringing the right change, 38% say the wrong change and 18% say he is not bringing change.\n\nOverall, 46% said Trump is bringing the right kind of change, 30% said he's bringing the wrong kind of change, and 21% said he's not bringing change.\n\nVoters are open, narrowly, to an effort to tackle inefficiencies in government. But concerns about Musk and about how DOGE is executing those cuts could be a public opinion liability for the administration.\n\nForty-six percent of voters say establishing a Department of Government Efficiency was a good idea, while 40% say it was a bad idea and another 13% do not have an opinion. However, DOGE itself is viewed unfavorably, with 41% holding positive views of the effort and 47% holding negative views.\n\nAnd Musk is unpopular, with 51% holding negative views of the tech mogul and 39% viewing him positively. Half of voters (49%) say they have positive views about federal workers, while 21% view them negatively and 29% feel neutral about them.\n\nAsked to reflect broadly on DOGE, one-third of voters said Musk and DOGE's efforts to reduce spending and the size of the federal government \"should continue as much more needs to be done.\" Meanwhile, 28% say \"it is needed but should slow down to assess the impact.\" And another 33% say \"it is reckless and should stop now before more damage is done.\"\n\nWhile Trump's standing is largely based on overwhelming support from within his own party, the Democratic Party now sits at its lowest favorable rating in the history of NBC News polling . Just 27% of registered voters view the party positively. That includes just 59% of self-identified Democrats.\n\nMeanwhile, 65% of Democrats say they want Democratic lawmakers to stick to their positions even if this means not being able to get things done in Washington, while 32% want them to compromise with Trump to gain consensus on legislation.\n\nStill, voters remain split as to who they want to control Congress after next year's midterm elections: 48% back Democrats, while 47% back Republicans.\n\nAs Trump dominates Washington, 53% of registered voters say Republicans in Congress are too supportive of the president, 6% say they are too critical and 39% say they are dealing with Trump in the right way. By comparison, 50% say congressional Democrats are too critical of Trump, 16% say they are too supportive of him and 30% say they are dealing with him in the right way.\n\nA plurality, 44%, believe the Supreme Court is dealing with Trump in the right way, while 35% believe it's been too supportive and 14% believe it's been too critical.\n\nA near-majority, 49%, say that CEOs of large corporations are too supportive of Trump, 29% believe they are dealing with him correctly and 12% believe they are being too critical.\n\nAnd when it comes to the news media, 46% of voters say it has been too critical of Trump, 25% say it's been too supportive, and 24% say it's been dealing with Trump the right way.\n\nThe NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Republicans win special elections for two deep-red House seats in Florida\n\nThe Republican candidates prevailed in a pair of special congressional elections in Florida on Tuesday, NBC News projects, giving Republicans some more breathing room as they navigate a narrow House majority.\n\nNBC News projects that Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis has won the race in the 1st District to replace GOP former Rep. Matt Gaetz, while Republican state Sen. Randy Fine won the 6th District race to replace GOP former Rep. Michael Waltz, who is now President Donald Trump's national security adviser.\n\nFine was leading Democrat Josh Weil 54%-46% when the NBC News Decision Desk called the race with 73% of the expected vote in. In three counties where nearly all of the expected vote is in, Fine was faring around 10 points worse than Waltz in November.\n\nPatronis defeated Democrat Gay Valimont, a former activist with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, who lost to Gaetz in November.\n\nThe 6th District race gave some Republicans heartburn , with Weil vastly outraising Fine and Fine slow to launch TV ads. Trump carried the district, which includes Daytona Beach, by 30 points in November, but outside Republican groups hit the airwaves in the final days as the race appeared to be competitive.\n\nTrump himself also engaged to help turn out his supporters, as Democrats looked to leverage lower turnout in a special election and energy among the party's grassroots to oppose him. Trump issued multiple Truth Social posts and held two tele-town halls last week for both candidates.\n\nFine is a staunch Trump ally, having switched his endorsement in the 2024 presidential primary from home-state Gov. Ron DeSantis to Trump. Fine wrote in an op-ed that he, as a Jewish Republican, did not believe DeSantis had done enough to combat antisemitism. DeSantis represented the 6th District in Congress before he ran for governor.\n\nFine's decision to endorse Trump earned him the president's support ahead of the special primary election in January, helping him easily win the GOP nomination. And he promoted his ties to Trump in the race.\n\n\"I stand behind you 100%, and you'll have no greater warrior for your agenda than me,\" Fine said of Trump in last week's tele-town hall.\n\nFine's support for Trump appealed to Linda Morgan, a Republican voter who cast her ballot Tuesday morning for Fine.\n\n\"If he admits he's going to help President Trump do the job that we elected him for, then I'm all in,\" Morgan told NBC News outside a polling place in Daytona Beach.\n\nFine celebrated his victory by crediting Trump with the win, writing on X, \"Because of you, Mr. President. I won't let you down.\"\n\nPatronis also pitched himself as a Trump ally, though he stayed neutral in the presidential primary, saying in an interview in January that he wanted to maintain a good working relationship with DeSantis.\n\nValimont significantly outraised Patronis, which he acknowledged created \"a lot of anxiety\" in his race.\n\nBut the fundraising gap was even wider in the slightly-less-Republican 6th District, which drove Republican concerns about Fine's prospects.\n\nWeil, a public school teacher who had raised more than $10 million as of Monday, according to recent fundraising reports, had leveraged his strong fundraising to launch attacks against Fine over potential GOP-led cuts to entitlement programs, including Social Security and Medicaid, in a district where nearly 30% of the population is over age 65.\n\nTrump tried to counter those attacks in last week's tele-town hall, telling supporters, \"Randy will vote to defend Social Security, protect Medicare, cut your taxes, end inflation, fully fund our border security agenda.\"\n\nFine had raised $2 million as of Monday, including $600,000 from himself, fueling some GOP concerns that the race could be closer than expected.\n\nFine also lives more than 100 miles south of the seat he was running in and never made real inroads in the region, and he did not start running TV ads until late in the campaign.\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\nThat worried Republicans, but Weil's huge financial support is what bred panic among Republicans and the White House.\n\n\"The White House was late in learning what almost every Floridian involved in politics knew,\" said a longtime Florida operative involved with the race who is familiar with the Trump orbit's thinking. Once it realized Fine's vulnerabilities, the source said, it \"engaged at an enormous level and expended the necessary resources to win it.\"\n\n\"It was all hands on deck,\" the person added.\n\nThe effort included a huge push from Florida Republicans to travel to the district to help get out the vote for Fine, as well as a late influx of cash to get Fine on TV and help blunt his money disadvantage against Weil.\n\n\"Panic and money can solve a lot of problems,\" said a Republican consultant working on Fine's campaign.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, took solace in Weil's appearing to perform better than Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"In 2025, Democrats have overperformed the top of the ticket in nearly every election as voters turn out in blue, purple, and red districts to voice their anger at Donald Trump and Elon Musk,\" Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement. \"Tonight was no different.\"\n\nThe pair of GOP victories gives Republican House leaders a little more breathing room in passing their major priorities.\n\nRepublicans will now have a 220-213 majority, with two Democratic vacancies, meaning they can afford to lose three Republicans and still pass legislation along party lines, assuming every sitting member votes.\n\nPatronis and Fine will head to Congress as Republicans are trying to piece together a sweeping budget proposal to tackle Trump's top priorities, including extending his 2017 tax cuts.\n\nFine has signaled that he will support Trump's agenda, telling him at last week's tele-town hall that his race could determine \"whether you have the votes in Congress you need to get the job done.\"\n\nPatronis said in an interview last week that his top priorities in Congress would be the economy and supporting veterans. (The 1st District has the second-highest share of veterans of any district in the country, according to the Veterans Administration.)\n\nAsked whether there were any elements of a possible budget proposal that he would not support, such as cuts to Medicaid, Patronis demurred, saying he had not given much thought to \"those type of hypotheticals.\"\n\n\"My principles are making sure that we're either restoring dollars back to the citizens of CD-1, we spend their dollars more efficient,\" he said. \"I don't think it's good to create a path where you're taking away something from a benefit or entitlement that somebody is counting on. I do like giving people options.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Senate passes GOP funding bill to avert a government shutdown\n\nThe Senate passed a six-month funding bill Friday to avert a government shutdown hours ahead of the midnight deadline, sending it to President Donald Trump to sign into law.\n\nThe vote was 54-46, with two Democrats joining all but one Republican in voting yes. Earlier Friday, the bill cleared a key procedural hurdle with the help of 10 Democrats in a 62-38 vote. Sixty votes were needed to defeat a Democratic filibuster.\n\nThe votes came after a dramatic 48-hour period during which Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., broke with most House and Senate Democrats , announcing he would support moving forward on the bill one day after he declared it didn't have the votes. Schumer ultimately voted no on final passage of the legislation.\n\nThe bill, which cleared the House on a party-line vote earlier this week, will keep the government funded through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year.\n\nUnder pressure from his left flank and House Democrats to block the GOP funding package, Schumer had kept his cards close to the vest about his shutdown strategy throughout the week.\n\nBut on Thursday, Schumer said he would vote to advance the funding bill , giving cover to other Democrats to do the same and significantly lowering the threat of a catastrophic shutdown amid broader economic uncertainty .\n\nRead more NBC News:\n\nDefending his decision in a floor speech Friday, Schumer warned that a shutdown would be far worse than passing the GOP bill. He argued that a shutdown would give Trump, his billionaire adviser Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) even more power to slash the federal workforce and government services. They could do that, Schumer said, by dictating who are \"essential\" and non-essential workers in a shutdown.\n\n\"Clearly, this is a Hobson's choice; the CR is a bad bill. But as bad as the CR is, I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,\" Schumer said.\n\n\"A shutdown would allow DOGE to shift into overdrive. ... It would give Donald Trump and DOGE the keys to the city, state and country,\" he continued.\n\nIn addition to Schumer, nine other Democrats voted to advance the bill: Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Gary Peters of Michigan, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n\nBut just two of those Democratic Caucus members - Shaheen and King - voted yes on the underlying funding bill.\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul was the only Republican to oppose the bill on both the procedural and final votes.\n\nCortez Masto echoed Schumer, saying a shutdown would place thousands of federal workers on unpaid furlough and hand Trump and Musk more power to gut federal agencies.\n\n\"A government shutdown would be devastating for the American people. It would force tens of thousands of Nevada military personnel, union members, law enforcement agents and nurses to work without pay,\" Cortez Masto said in a statement. \"The last government shutdown cost the American economy $11 billion and thousands of hardworking Americans were harmed. I cannot vote for that.\"\n\nSchumer's move, however, infuriated House Democrats, who were gathered 40 miles away in Leesburg, Virginia, at their annual policy retreat. All but one House Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, had voted against Speaker Mike Johnson's six-month bill on Tuesday.\n\nAhead of Friday's procedural vote, House Democratic women held a news conference and urged their Senate colleagues to hold the line against the GOP bill.\n\n\"The American people literally are shouting from the rooftops that this is a five-alarm emergency and that we cannot hand the keys of the kingdom of this big, beautiful democracy that we love over to somebody who has total disregard, not only for the rule of law, but for American lives,\" said Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, the top Democrat on the House DOGE subcommittee.\n\nUnderscoring the schism among Hill Democrats, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y, and his leadership team returned to the Capitol on Friday and held a news conference imploring Senate Democrats to reject the GOP funding bill.\n\nThey pushed Congress to instead pass a 30-day stopgap funding bill that would buy bipartisan negotiators more time to strike a yearlong appropriations deal on funding the government.\n\n\"It's an unacceptable, unconscionable and un-American spending bill. That's why House Democrats remain strongly opposed,\" said Jeffries, flanked by his top lieutenants, Reps. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., and Pete Aguilar, D-Calif.\n\n\"House Democrats are here. We're ready to pass a four-week spending bill that keeps the government open and will allow the House and the Senate to negotiate an actual agreement that meets the needs of the American people,\" Jeffries added.\n\nThe GOP legislation is not a typical stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution or CR, that simply extends funding at current levels. The 99-page spending bill includes a slight increase in military spending and a $13 billion cut in domestic nondefense spending. It was crafted by GOP leaders, who took input from the White House and excluded Democrats from the process.\n\nOn top of that, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, and other Democrats lamented that the bill is structured in a way that hands the Trump administration too much flexibility in how to spend certain pots of money. A memo from Murray said the GOP measure creates \"slush funds for the Trump administration to reshape spending priorities, eliminate longstanding programs, pick winners and losers.\"\n\nThe bill would also force the District of Columbia to revert back to its fiscal year 2024 budget levels, cutting local spending by more than $1 billion , which could impact schools, police and and other services.\n\nSpeaking on the floor, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., argued that lawmakers have been forced to pass yet another stopgap funding measure because Democrats, who controlled the Senate majority in the last Congress, did not complete the regular appropriations process last year.\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee had passed and sent to the floor 11 out of the 12 appropriations bills that fund federal agencies and the legislative branch, Thune said, but Schumer never brought them to a vote.\n\n\"So today we're trying to finish up last year's work so that we can begin to do this year's work,\" Thune said Friday. \"To be clear, Republicans aren't thrilled about another CR but it is our best option to make sure that last year's failure by Democrats doesn't interfere with this year's appropriations process.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "How Trump's intimidation tactics have reshaped the Republican Party\n\nIn this article\n\nWhen U.S. congressman Tom Rice voted to impeach Donald Trump for inciting the mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol in January 2021, it was the beginning of the end of his political career.\n\nAngry calls and emails - including three death threats - flooded the South Carolina Republican's office. The next year, as Rice ran for a sixth term, a sheriff's deputy often guarded him at public events. Trump backed Rice's foe in the party's primary election. At a rally, the ex-president warned voters that the congressman \"partnered with the Democrats to stab the Republican Party and, frankly, to stab our country in the back.\"\n\nRice got crushed in the primary. Today, the one-time conservative darling, a small-government fiscal hawk, is shunned by former allies and some old friends, he told Reuters. He feels betrayed by fellow Republicans who, \"rather than upholding their oath and defending the Constitution, decided their position and their power was worth more.\"\n\nIn cementing his third-straight Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump and his staunchest followers have used menace and harassment to fundamentally reshape the party of Reagan, purging officials and activists seen as insufficiently loyal to Trump and his Make America Great Again agenda. Trump has imposed this fealty at every level of the party, from minor state and local officials to members of Congress, cabinet secretaries and rivals for the presidency, calling for revenge on those who resist his demands, vote against his interests or cross his allies.\n\nSince launching his Truth Social media platform in early 2022, Trump has posted more than 600 attacks on fellow Republicans, singling out more than 100 party officials, activists and right-leaning media figures for condemnation, according to a Reuters review of his nearly 20,000 posts during that time.\n\nOne recent target: Brian Kemp, Republican governor of the battleground state of Georgia, which Trump narrowly lost in 2020. Trump berated Kemp at an Aug. 3 rally as \"Little Brian\" for refusing to help overturn the last presidential election. Trump framed his Kemp attack as part of a broad cleansing of the party.\n\n\"He's a bad guy. He's a disloyal guy,\" Trump said of Kemp. Earlier that day, he wrote on Truth Social: \"We have to purge the Party of people that go against our Candidates and make it harder for a popular Republican President to beat the Radical Left.\" Kemp did not respond to a request to comment.\n\nTrump's ultimate weapon is his coveted endorsement, often wielded to drive the disloyal from office. Since the start of 2022, he has endorsed Republican challengers against at least 13 members of his own party in Congress who he's accused of betrayal, a Reuters review of his endorsements shows. All but three of the 13 lost their seats or quit the race.\n\nAnd of the 10 Republican members of the House of Representatives who voted to impeach him, just two remain in office. Four lost to Trump-backed primary challengers, including Liz Cheney, a former member of the Republican House leadership, and four opted not to run again. At least seven were threatened or harassed by Trump backers, according to police reports, court records and their own public statements.\n\nTrump also subjects lower-tier party officials to opprobrium, often triggering copycat harassment and political defeat. More than a quarter of his Republican targets on Truth Social were state legislators, state judges, local election officials and other relatively low-profile political figures, Reuters found.\n\nAsked about the former president's attacks on his fellow Republicans, Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"President Trump continues to build a historic and unified political movement to make America strong, wealthy and safe again.\"\n\nGlenn Rogers, a conservative Texas legislator and rancher, faced intimidation after joining a vote last year to impeach the state's attorney general, Ken Paxton, a Trump ally, over allegations that he abused his office to benefit a donor.  Paxton ultimately was acquitted, but the vote sparked rage from the Republican right - and ultimately from Trump himself.\n\nOne Facebook post warned Rogers he should prepare to \"face your maker.\" Vandals spray-painted RINO - short for Republican in name only - on his campaign signs. Then, days before the party's nomination vote, Trump ripped Rogers on social media, calling him a RINO and endorsing his Republican opponent, who unseated him.\n\nThe fallout \"was like a tsunami,\" Rogers said in an interview. \"There's people that actually worship Trump like a deity.\" He still plans to vote for Trump, dismissing Democrats as too far left.\n\nReuters documented at least 39 cases of elected national and state Republican officials who have been threatened or harassed since 2021 for taking actions or expressing views seen as contradicting Trump and the MAGA agenda. Targets included Republicans who question Trump's false claim that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n\"Menace is a big part of the power,\" said Sarah Longwell, a former Republican strategist who publishes the Bulwark, an anti-Trump publication, and runs Republican Voters Against Trump, a political action group. Republicans who oppose Trump must consider the possibility they'll face threats or intimidation from his supporters and be driven from politics, she said. \"It's hard to disaggregate the fear of political violence and the fear of career suicide.\"\n\nThe result: By the time Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination on July 18, the party was fully behind him. Most of his prominent Republican critics had fallen in line - including his most potent challenger, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, and onetime Attorney General William Barr. Both called Trump unfit for office but later recanted and said they would vote for him.\n\nTrump's salvos against fellow Republicans bring political risks, some political experts say. The attacks mattered less when Trump's Democratic opponent for the White House was 81-year-old President Joe Biden, who trailed him in polling for months, burdened by concerns about his age. As Biden's successor, Vice President Kamala Harris, draws even in polls, Trump's intra-party assaults, like the one against Kemp, amount \"to self-harm,\" said David Wasserman, senior editor at the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan political publication. In a tight race, Trump needs the support of Republican moderates, he said.\n\nIn Arizona, where Trump recently seemed headed for victory, Harris now has a lead of seven percentage points over Trump with independent and unaffiliated voters, said Doug Cole, a Republican strategist whose Phoenix-based firm, HighGround, surveyed voters there in late July and early August. \"He's got a problem with moderate Republicans,\" Cole said. \"I don't know how this premise of purging the party helps him.\" Polling aggregates show Harris and Trump broadly even in Arizona among voters overall.\n\nSometimes the intimidation happens behind closed doors. At other times, it plays out in public, amplified by right-wing influencers and Trump himself. Congressman Rice experienced both kinds.\n\nAfter Rice cast his ballot to impeach Trump in January 2021, then-House Minority Whip Steve Scalise immediately phoned him, Rice told Reuters. The Republican leadership had told party members to vote their conscience, but Scalise was calling to register disapproval.\n\n\"He said, 'Tom you hit the wrong button,'\" Rice recalled. \"I said, 'No, I didn't, Steve. I loaded it exactly the way I intended.'\" Scalise's office did not respond when Reuters asked about the exchange.\n\nRice received hundreds of angry emails and voice messages after the vote, including a warning \"to watch out.\" Within weeks, the South Carolina Republican Party censured him, a formal expression of disapproval.\n\nTrump piled on, calling Rice \"a disaster\" who was \"respected by no one.\" At public events, some constituents called Rice a traitor, he said. Others harangued him for condemning the pro-Trump rioters who sacked the Capitol. One state politician confided to Rice he wanted to denounce Trump, too, but knew voters would throw him out, Rice recalled without identifying the individual.\n\nRice said he doesn't regret the impeachment vote: \"If you are conservative and support the Constitution, you cannot support what Donald Trump has done.\"\n\nTrump had help in hounding him. After the vote, Rice and the nine other Republican House members who defied Trump were targeted by Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist in Trump's White House. On Bannon's daily \"War Room\" podcast, Rice was lambasted by Jason Miller, a Trump 2020 campaign advisor, as \"worthless\" and \"not coming back.\" The \"War Room\" abuse went on for two days. In an email responding to questions from Reuters, Miller did not address his attacks on Rice.\n\nBannon's \"War Room\" program, a go‐to interview for pro-Trump celebrities, claims to reach millions of viewers. That puts him at the center of a far-right online influencer network that joins and amplifies Trump's calls to purge unfaithful officials. Other top MAGA figures have been hosting the show since July, when Bannon began a five-month prison sentence for refusing to testify to Congress about the Capitol attack.\n\nNebraska congressman Don Bacon, a retired Air Force general and evangelical Christian with a firmly conservative voting record, says he has been threatened and harassed repeatedly by people \"radicalized\" by far-right media personalities such as Bannon.\n\nLast October, Bannon targeted Bacon as disloyal to the Trump agenda after the congressman opposed the candidacy of Trump ally Jim Jordan as speaker of the House of Representatives. \"Bacon is one of the hardcore of the hardcore. He's never-Trump, hates Trump,\" Bannon said, urging the audience to call the lawmaker's office.\n\nThey did. Bacon and his wife each received anonymous threats and harassing messages by text and phone, he said. One caller vowed to stalk and molest his wife, prompting her to begin sleeping with a loaded gun. \"You think you're the chosen one because you married the pig,\" warned another message reviewed by Reuters. \"See you later, bitch.\"\n\nBacon says Bannon and other far-right commentators inspire an \"ends-justify-the-means\" mentality with their audiences in enforcing loyalty to Trump and his agenda. \"You have a few bloggers out there and people on social media with a million followers, and everything they say is gospel,\" he said. Bacon, seeking a fifth House term, managed to win the Republican nomination for his seat this spring with more than 60% of the vote, despite the state Republican Party chairman endorsing his opponent.\n\nFred Upton, a former Republican congressman from Michigan, also voted to impeach Trump over the Capitol riots. That day, Bannon called on his show for constituents \"to deal with\" the Republican impeachers. Upton was deluged with threats.\n\n\"Who the HELL do you think you are?!!! You work for US!!! There is NO GOP without MAGA Nation!,\" read one emailed message, which Upton shared with Reuters. \"Get ready for hell. Cause we're going to make your life a living one,\" the email said.\n\nUpton said lawmakers are desperate to avoid attacks by Trump and Bannon. \"Nobody wants to be on that list.\"\n\nReuters was unable to contact Bannon in prison and no one at his office was authorized to speak on his behalf.\n\nIn a December 2022 social media post, Trump savaged Upton after the lawmaker's name was floated as a candidate for House Speaker, calling him a \"RINO\" and \"a disaster for anything having to do with the word Republican.\"\n\nUpton opted not to seek re-election after a new map of his district put him in the same seat as a Republican who had Trump's strong backing. He said he worries about score-settling against enemies in a second Trump White House, citing Trump's vows in speeches to exact \"retribution.\"\n\n\"They're going to be going after people,\" he said.\n\nTwo categories of Republicans have faced the heaviest fire from Trump, the review of his social media posts shows: his rivals for this year's presidential nomination and officials who resisted his baseless claim that the 2020 election was rigged.\n\nTrump ridiculed early rival Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, more than 250 times as \"DeSanctimonious.\" And he derided his last rival to drop out, former South Carolina Governor Haley, more than 50 times as \"Birdbrain.\"\n\nBoth were subjected to threats and harassment throughout the campaign, prompting increased security measures, according to their respective offices and law enforcement agencies. DeSantis, who later endorsed Trump, did not respond to a request for comment. As Trump competed with Haley for the Republican nomination, some of his supporters posted violent messages on social media, calling for her death or physical abuse. Her office told Reuters it wasn't aware of any threats made against her by Trump supporters.\n\nTrump also has gone after lesser-known state and local officials.\n\nRusty Bowers, a conservative Republican who was speaker of Arizona's House of Representatives, refused to overturn Biden's narrow 2020 win in the state. Local party members called him a traitor, threatening messages flooded his office, and a man with a pistol turned up at his home, Bowers said in an interview. Trump blasted Bowers as \"weak\" and \"wrong on everything,\" and he backed a Republican rival in a 2022 state senate race.\n\nBowers lost but the rancor endured. \"I have been neutralized in their mind,\" he said, referring to Trump's supporters. \"I am not a factor.\"\n\nIn the new Republican Party, grassroots supporters have taken it upon themselves to enforce loyalty to Trump by identifying and vilifying Republicans they see as out of step with the leader.\n\nMatt Fogal, the Republican district attorney in Pennsylvania's Franklin County until late last year, has the kind of pedigree that once made politicians hard to beat in the state's conservative south-central region. He attended an evangelical church and served in the National Guard with deployments in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Fogal became district attorney in 2009. He ran uncontested three times, in a county where Trump won more than 70% of the vote in 2016 and 2020.\n\nWhen Trump became president, Fogal disagreed with his comments denigrating immigrants, Muslims and women. But he kept his views to himself. He told himself the country would survive the next four years and then mend any damage caused by Trump, he said. But in May 2020, as racial justice protests swept the nation after the police killing of George Floyd, Fogal publicly broke with Trump.\n\nAs protesters against police brutality and racism rallied peacefully in heavily white Franklin County, Fogal issued a statement praising their \"positive spirit of change and equality.\" He also criticized Trump for authorizing the National Guard to use force on protesters in Washington.\n\nTrump supporters - and some police officers - swiftly condemned him.\n\nFogal met with local law enforcement to explain his stance. At one meeting, an officer accused him of being \"a Marxist,\" he said. At a local church, the pastor demanded to know if he supported looters and rioters, Fogal recalled. His wife, a beautician, lost customers. Some relatives stopped talking to him, he said. The local Republican Party denounced him.\n\nFogal struggled to understand how he'd misread his own community. \"It was the first time I had seen this kind of worship and idolatry, the way they talked about Trump,\" he said.\n\nThat September, already disowned by Republicans, Fogal endorsed Biden in the 2020 election. After the Capitol riots, he announced he had registered as an independent. Although he hadn't received death threats, police officers he considered his friends told him he should carry a gun \"in case someone did something stupid,\" he said.\n\nAs the end of his term approached and he sought work in the private sector, Fogal discovered he wasn't welcome at local law firms. Some told him \"he was too hot to handle,\" he said.\n\nLast October, he found a job as a lawyer with the Pennsylvania governor's general counsel office and resigned as district attorney. But he said many in his home town haven't forgiven him.\n\n\"I'm quite literally a pariah,\" he said. \"Things used to be different here.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "What a Republican sweep in Congress could mean for the stock market-in one chart\n\nRelated Stories\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has won the 2024 election , sweeping into office on a wave of support for Republican candidates.\n\nNBC News reports that the previously Democrat-controlled Senate will have a Republican majority . It's too early to determine which party will win the majority in the House of Representatives, but should Republicans retain control, the party will be in position to set forth the agenda that Trump laid out on the campaign trail.\n\nFor stock investors, the occupant of the Oval Office doesn't matter much . After all, the S&P 500 has gone up during 17 of the last 20 four-year presidential terms.\n\nBut some investors may be eying the pending House races closely.\n\n\"What tends to do better for investors is not so much who is in the White House. It's the makeup of Congress,\" says Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group.\n\nSpecifically, stocks tend to do better with a divided government. From 1951 through 2023, the S&P 500 has returned an annual average of 8% under single-party rule, compared with a 9.9% average gain when different parties control the presidency and at least one chamber of Congress, according to data provided by the Carson Group.\n\nA divided Congress in particular tends to bode well for investors, with average yearly gains of 15.7% under Democratic presidents and 13.7% under Republican presidents.\n\nShould the S&P 500 finish out 2024 up from the previous year (it's currently up about 25%), it will mark 14 consecutive years of positive returns under split Congresses.\n\nIt's impossible to say exactly why stocks tend to outperform under divided governments, but it may have to do with the idea that gridlock keeps legislators from pulling levers that will have drastic effects on the economy, says Detrick.\n\n\"There's not too much power one way or the other, not too much spending one way or the other,\" he says. \"There are checks and balances, the way our forefathers wanted things.\"\n\nStill, historical returns are no guarantee of future results. What's more, the outcome of the recent election has far less bearing on stock prices than the economic fundamentals that drive them. And the government that comes into power under Trump is set to inherit a favorable economic picture, says Detrick.\n\n\"Initial [jobless] claims have come back to the lowest levels since May , so we still have a solid labor market,\" he says. \"We still have a pretty solid economy being led by record earnings .\"\n\nThings can change quickly, of course. A unified Congress could potentially take power and pass sweeping legislation that would \"upset the apple cart,\" Detrick says. But even then, you're likely better off paying attention to the things that have direct impact on the economy, like central banking policy.\n\n\"Right now, the Fed is cutting rates,\" Detrick says. \"That matters much more to us as investors versus something that Congress is up to.\" Lower interest rates directly impact the economy by making it easy for consumers and businesses to get access to credit. They're also, in this case, a response to an assessment on the part of the Fed that inflation is cooling .\n\nIn other words, if you're stressing today about the election's potential impact on your finances, it's worth remembering that, while policy can have an effect on your portfolio, it's far from the deciding factor for how things play out in the markets.\n\n\"The reality is that the economy matters more,\" says Detrick.\n\nWant to earn more money at work?

      "text": "Trump's Tariffs Face Growing Republican Backlash: 'Last Thing We Need'\n\nSome high-ranking Republicans openly expressed their fears of economic fallout surrounding President Donald Trump's new sweeping tariff policy unveiled Wednesday-breaking with the president after the package caused stocks to nosedive and and threatened to drive up prices for a long list of consumer goods.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs an executive order after delivering remarks on reciprocal tariffs ... More during an event in the Rose Garden entitled \"Make America Wealthy Again\" at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 2, 2025. (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. , released a statement Thursday rebuking tariffs generally, writing on X, \"with so much at stake globally, the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against China's predatory and unfair trade practices.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of uncertainty,\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said, telling The Hill her constituents were concerned about potential price increases.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas , told The Hill he was concerned about the potential for a ballooning tariff war, and said \"tariffs are a tax, and I'm not a fan of raising taxes on millions of American cosponsors,\" while Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, expressed concerns that the rates Trump announced Wednesday didn't distinguish \"between our allies and our adversaries.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-N.D. , told reporters, \"obviously you want to make sure you're not doing harm to the economy,\" and said he was taking a \"wait and see\" approach to the announcement, offering a tempered defense of Trump's thinking: \"the concept behind it was reciprocity, and reciprocal tariffs are something that I think most people think make sense.\"\n\nThune, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan. , and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va. , all suggested Wednesday's rates might not be final, Punchbowl reported , with Moran saying he expected \"a more modest approach in the amounts\" and Capito telling the outlet \"it's pretty rough right now,\" but \"the concept behind the tariffs is something I support.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa , along with Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. , introduced legislation Thursday that would require Trump to notify Congress before enacting new tariffs and mandate congressional approval of the new policy within 60 days of it being announced, or it would expire.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. , indicated he and other Republicans would back Grassley's bill, telling reporters Thursday, \"I think there's something to be said for having congressional review,\" after expressing concerns in an interview with CNN on Wednesday about how the tariffs could impact farmers, whom he said are \"one crop away from bankruptcy.\"\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La. , also told CNN, \"in the long run, we're all dead. Short run matters too. Nobody knows what the impact of these tariffs is going to be on the economy.\"\n\nFour Republican senators-including McConnell-voted alongside all Democrats on Wednesday to revoke new tariffs on Canada. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told Politico on Thursday he will introduce a new \"motion of disapproval\" aimed at the 10% baseline tariffs Trump imposed Wednesday on U.S. trading partners. Kaine, who sponsored the Senate bill targeting the tariffs against Canada, said he could raise the motion as soon as Thursday. Any bill passed by the Senate that runs counter to the White House narrative has slim odds of passing the House, where House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who is typically in lock-step with Trump, would be unlikely to introduce them.\n\nTrump announced individual tariffs against U.S. trading partners-with some exceeding 50%-in a highly anticipated address Wednesday, which he coined \"Liberation Day,\" prompting a stock market spiral and new recession fears. The rates include an additional 34% tax on Chinese imports to the U.S. on top of the 20% already charged, a 46% tax for Vietnam, 32% for Taiwan and 24% for Japan. Stocks sank the morning after the announcement, with the Down Jones Industrial Average falling 3.8%, the S&P 500 down 4.4% and the Nasdaq dipping 5.7%. JPMorgan Chase chief economist Michael Feroli warned the policies \"take the economy perilously close to slipping into recession.\" Trump, meanwhile, doubled down on his tariffs Thursday, writing on Truth Social that the U.S. \"WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE\" as a result.\n\nTrump's Tariffs Tip Economy 'Perilously Close' To A Recession, Largest U.S. Bank Warns (Forbes)\n\nTrump Doubles Down On Tariffs Amid Economic Chaos: 'The Patient Lived, And Is Healing' (Forbes)\n\nHere's What Will Cost More After Trump's Tariffs: Coffee, Cars, More (Forbes)\n\nOne Community.

      "text": "The 2024 Republican Platform's Empty Promises To Older Adults\n\nBy Howard Gleckman\n\nBy Howard Gleckman ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nVANDALIA, OHIO - MARCH 16: Former President Donald Trump speaks to supporters during a rally. (Photo ... More by Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Republican party platform , orchestrated by former President Trump, is filled with promises for those it calls \"our Great Seniors.\" But there is little or no real policy behind most of those campaign pledges. And the document is filled with many irreconcilable contradictions.\n\nThe platform will be the GOP's election-year policy framework coming out of its upcoming July 15-18 nominating convention. And it recognizes some critical needs of seniors and sets goals that would improve their quality of life and that of their families. But it rarely describes how Trump and the GOP would achieve those goals.\n\nSocial Security\n\nThe document is full of uppercase promises such as, \"FIGHT FOR AND PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE WITH NO CUTS, INCLUDING NO CHANGES TO THE RETIREMENT AGE.\"\n\nBut that bold pledge ignores a singular reality. Within about a decade, absent major changes, the Social Security trust fund will have only enough money to pay about 78% of promised benefits. That means a typical retiree receiving about $1,900-a-month in benefits would see their payments decline by more than $400.\n\nIn other words, those promised \"NO CUTS\" are impossible without major reforms. But the platform is completely mute on what they'd be.\n\nMedicare\n\nSame story with Medicare. The platform promises \"NO CUTS\" but is silent on how to make the troubled Hospital Insurance trust fund solvent.\n\nIt does make one promise: \"Republicans will protect Medicare's finances from being financially crushed by the Democrat plan to add tens of millions of new illegal immigrants to the rolls of Medicare.\"\n\nBut undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicare . Undocumented workers must pay the Medicare payroll tax but can't collect benefits. Thus, they make Medicare's finances stronger, not weaker . And few Democrats support expanding Medicare benefits to the undocumented.\n\nImmigration And Care Workers\n\nThe implacable opposition of Trump and his party to immigration hurts seniors in other ways and creates a massive inconsistency in the platform. It follows a pattern from Trump's first term in office.\n\nOn one hand, it vows to shut the US borders to immigration and initiate the \"largest deportation program in American history.\" But it also promises to \"overturn disincentives that lead to Care Worker shortages.\" Except one of the largest causes of care worker shortages is, wait for it, restrictive immigration policy.\n\nFor example, the US will need to fill 5.5 million vacant home care jobs by 2031, according to PHI International. But few native-born Americans want to do this low-paid and dangerous work. Where will those workers come from?\n\nAbout one-third of on-the-books home care workers currently are immigrants. Licensed home care aides, for example, have work papers. But an unknown, but significant, number of gray market workers are undocumented. And many working on green cards have family members who are undocumented.\n\nBooting foreign-born workers out of the country will make the care worker shortages vastly worse, placing even more burdens on family members, jeopardizing the health of frail older adults, and driving more people who need long-term care out of their homes and into nursing facilities. All exactly the opposite of what the platform promises.\n\nAnd it isn't just aides. The research organization KFF reports that about a half million registered nurses are immigrants, one of every six nurses in the US. Nearly one-third of all hospitals report hiring foreign-educated nurses.\n\nNotwithstanding the platform's promise to \"work with our Great Seniors, in order to allow them to be active and healthy,\" the immigration provisions of the GOP platform will make their lives infinitely worse.\n\nTax Credits\n\nThe platform also promises unspecified tax credits for family caregivers. There is less to that pledge than meets the eye as well.\n\nTax credits come in two flavors, refundable and non-refundable. Most are non-refundable, which means they are unavailable to low- and even many moderate-income households who pay no federal income tax . Refundable tax credits are more available, but they cost the Treasury more revenue and generally have been opposed by Republicans.\n\nAnd even if you are eligible, the credits represent no more than a drop in the financial bucket for most frail older adults and their families. A federal credit may be $750 or $1,000. But the average annual cost of a home care aide is $75,000. And a nursing home can easily cost twice as much.\n\nPrimary Care\n\nThen, the platform says this: \"Republicans will support increased focus on Chronic Disease prevention and management, Long-Term Care, and Benefit flexibility. We will expand access to Primary Care and support Policies that help Seniors remain in their homes and maintain Financial Security.\"\n\nAll laudable goals. But what do they mean?\n\nFocusing on long-term care is nice but it isn't a plan.\n\nAnother example: Access to primary care is important. But given the severe shortage of primary care physicians and nurse practitioners , increased access is a pipe dream.\n\nHow would Trump and a GOP Congress increase incentives for medical professionals to get into primary care? Silence.\n\nThere's lots more, but you get the drift. Promising support for \"our Great Seniors\" is nice. But without real, consistent policy ideas, it is meaningless."

More Studio during the Toronto International Film Festival 2024 on September 7, 2024 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nFormer GOP and anti-Donald Trump congressman Adam Kinzinger wasn't sure he wanted to participate in director Steve Pink's documentary The Last Republican , but he's glad he did. He needed to get it all out.\n\n\"I've never said this to anybody because it just hit me, the interview that we do that spreads throughout the whole film, where I'm sitting in the empty office, that was the most cathartic thing for me, \"he recalls as we chat about the film over Zoom. \"Steve and I sat there for a day talking, and he's getting all this stuff out of me. I realized at that moment the damage done to me and that I had been putting this off. That interview was probably psychologically the most healing thing, even over talking to somebody in counseling for a year, just to be able to unload all that.\"\n\nThe Last Republican follows Representative from Illinois, in Congress from 2021 through 2023, and his unwavering fight to hold Donald Trump accountable for the January 6 insurrection. After having its world premiere at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival and screening at various other festivals, it screens at New York's Film Forum from Friday, January 3, 2025.\n\nThe Last Republican is directed by Pink, who wrote and produced Grosse Pointe Blank and High Fidelity and directed Hot Tub Time Machine , the latter being a film that turned out to be one of Kinzinger's favorite films, something Pink discovered via a passing comment from the politician during filming.\n\n\"I think the thing that connected us on cinema, beyond the fact that he made the movie that I thought was great, but what's bigger than that,\" Kinzinger explains. \"It's not just that I like Hot Tub Time Machine , and we watched it in Iraq all the time, but that sense of humor is the thing that can transcend all politics. Back when comedies used to come out in the movie theater, which hopefully they do again someday, you'd have however many people in a room laughing at the same thing. Some are far left, some are far right, some are in the middle, some don't even care about politics and have never voted in their life. It's the thing that unites us and brings us all together. That humor, to me, transcends everything.\"\n\n\"The thing that surprised me most with this, and here's a funny thing about the last couple of years, I've built these new alliances, like I've realized I'm probably closer to a Democrat now because of how the Republican Party has changed. The Democrats are now the party that's defending America's role in the world, defending Ukraine, which I'm really passionate about.\"\n\nThe pair also bonded over another movie, director John Milius' 1984 action drama, Red Dawn , which starred Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson, and C. Thomas Howell.\n\n\"When I said to Steve that I love Red Dawn , I've probably watched the movie 50 to 100 times, and I'm not even joking, he was like, 'Dude, I love Red Dawn , too.' I remember thinking, 'Why? You're supposed to be some lefty that actually wanted the Russians to win, right?'\" the former lieutenant colonel in the United States Air Force explains. \"Obviously, it's not the case. I thought that was fun to talk about. All of us are about the same age, we were coming up in the 80s, and that's what it is to be a man, to sit here and fight and protect things. It was perfect for that. Now we can look back and say it was toxic in some ways, but being in the middle of it was fun.\"\n\nPink adds, \"In Red Dawn , it's teenagers saving the world, and I was a teenager, so it made perfect sense that it was going to be left up to us to ultimately save the world. I read a thing, and I don't know who sent it to me, that said Gen X voted for Trump by four or five points versus every other demographic, so I was like, 'Come on, guys, we're the Slacker Generation. What are you thinking?' So, having a shared sense of humor, I agree with Adam; you're unified by laughter. You can't help but see the humanity in someone else if you're laughing together, and then you get somewhere. That's just how it works.\"\n\n(Left to right) Pam Knoll, Steve Pink, Adam Kinzinger and Sofia Kinzinger attend the premiere of ... More 'The Last Republican' during the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nHowever, at the heart of the personal unity Pink, a fellow Illinois native, and Kinzinger found was the matter of deep political division and the maelstrom that engulfed the outspoken politician who was a member of the January 6 Committee. The two men's experiences of what happened in Washington, D.C., that day are very different.\n\n\"I knew there was going to be violence. I predicted violence, and so I went in with my gun for the first time. I am usually armed if I'm out in public, but for the first time ever, I took my gun to the Capitol,\" Kinzinger recalls. \"I asked my wife to stay home, told my staff to stay home, and I remember walking around the Capitol and seeing these MAGA hats out and walking around. I go to the floor of the house when this starts, and that's when I'm literally on my phone, looking at Twitter; I was getting more information there than I'm getting from the house, and it was like, 'Boy, they just breached the perimeter. I've never seen them do that.'\"\n\n\"I ended up going back to my office, and I don't recall if this is in the film or not, but when I went back there, I opened my window behind my desk, which overlooked the West front of the Capitol, and where all this stuff was going on. I heard all this commotion, non-lethal munitions being fired, screaming, and yelling, and I remember feeling this sense of darkness. I've never felt it before. I've been in war, and I've never felt this feeling of something dark happening. At that point, I had to barricade myself in my office, and I was sitting there in absolute disbelief. Foreign policies are my forte; it's what I love, and I've helped so many countries that have found themselves in this situation. I never thought this would happen.\"\n\nHe continues, \"My wife was obviously completely panicked because there were threats against me actively on Twitter like, 'Where is your office? We're coming to get you,' and that kind of stuff. I was sitting there for about 30 minutes thinking I might have to shoot as many Americans as bullets as I had in my gun to protect myself. I still don't really feel like it happened, but it's one of those days for me that stands out, like 9/11 and the day I took the Milwaukee stabber down.\"\n\nA moment of introspection in a scene from 'The Last Republican.'\n\nWhile everything was going off in the Capitol, Pink was shooting a Super Bowl commercial.\n\n\"It was a big shoot; there were hundreds of people, there were a bunch of monitors so we could watch what we were filming, but they also had a live feed, and someone turned on what was happening at the Capitol,\" the director remembers. \"I got behind the monitor, saw the chaos, and couldn't compute it. I didn't have time to ask anybody what was really going on. I almost felt like, 'Is that a movie?' My first thought was one of those things where it gets loose in the public that it's real, but then it turns out to be a Spielberg movie or something.\"\n\n\"Like Adam, I started feeling a weird darkness washing over the set, and I couldn't understand what was happening. There's a moment in the movie where his wife Sofia talks about it. She's at home, and she turns on the live feed of Statuary Hall. There's that really scary moment where she's looking at the empty hall like you always would if you're just looking at the feed, and suddenly there's this massive crowd marauding through it, and that was the moment she knew that Adam was potentially in danger. It was a terrifying moment, obviously.\"\n\nDespite the continued threats against Kinzinger during his time in office and since, his family, including his wife, who was expecting at the time of filming, gave the filmmaker whatever he needed without hesitation.\n\n\"My parents were very good about being in it. They've been very supportive. My wife worked for Trump, then Pence, and then left, and then she's more anti-Trump than I am, which is not even possible because I'm as far as it gets, and so she was willing,\" the ex-congressman explains. \"She knows the life. It changes a little bit once you have a kid, and I've got a three-year-old now. The immediate family was willing to participate and understood what I was doing. The tough thing is getting into extended family, cousins, uncles, etc. They don't tell me what I'm doing is wrong, but don't talk to me.\"\n\n\"I had a friend that I've known since I was 18 that texted me that it is my fault the guy tried to kill Donald Trump, so I had to block that friendship. I had my co-pilot in Iraq, which is a bond you can never match anywhere, send me a text saying he was ashamed to have ever flown with me and fought with me. Those are the kinds of things that stab, and I have to work through them in my own life, trying to forgive these people. Then, of course, there's my whole extended family that sent a certified letter calling me part of the devil's army. Bringing a three-year-old kid into this is something I still struggle with, but one thing I know, and I'll get choked up if I say it, but I know that when he reads about this time in history, he's not going to be ashamed to be a Kinzinger and that that makes it worth it.\"\n\nPink adds, \"Adam's parents were really welcoming. They don't wear politics on their sleeve, they wear kindness on their sleeve. Adam told them that I would be coming to interview them. Naturally, when they hear interview, they think that it's some kind of journalistic interview. I show up, and his dad is in a sports coat; his mom is dressed up, and they say, 'Okay, where would you want us for the interview?' I was like, 'That is so sweet of you guys to be immediately trusting, no resistance at all, then I explained to them, like, 'Actually, I just want to talk, have a casual conversation, and I want you just to go about your day.' They were getting ready to go to Sofia's baby shower, so his mom had to finish preparing the sandwiches, and I just said, 'Well, just keep doing that, and then we'll have a conversation.' They were warm and trusting, and they couldn't have cared less about my politics. It was never even a question. It certainly didn't come up.\"\n\n(Left to right) Adam Kinzinger and Steve Pink of 'The Last Republican' pose in the Getty Images ... More Portrait Studio during the Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nThe Last Republican is produced by Media Courthouse Documentary Collective, a documentary company founded by Pink and long-time friends and documentary filmmakers Kevin Morris, Robb Bindler, Jason Kohn, and Chapin Wilson. Does this film mean people should take the man known for comedy more seriously?\n\n\"I think it's impossible for people to take me seriously, but that's just something I have to live with. That's my cross to bear, so of course, I jumped at the chance to seem legitimate by doing an important political subject, and I was able to sucker Adam into it,\" Pink says. \"I've always been a political nerd. You find the things that you love to do, that you're asked to do, and in my film career, that was mainly comedy, which I love, but there are not even a lot of political narrative fiction movies, so I always wanted to do a story in politics. When the opportunity came to do one, I didn't expect to do one with someone whose views I opposed, but he chose country over party, and it was a super compelling documentary subject.\"\n\n\"The other thing I would say is that I went into it thinking that I was making a political drama. It's obviously a very serious subject; a lot of high-stakes and very serious things were happening to Adam in the last year of his office. The comedic banter that emerges as a way to frame the movie that only happened in editorial. The banter where we rip on each other seemed, for me, as a filmmaker, to be a way to warm up Adam. He was very busy a lot of the time. I wouldn't see him for a month or two, so naturally, you're like, 'Hey, what have you been doing?' You have a fun or funny conversation and then get into the subject of the day, but we found that there was all this material where we were constantly joking with each other, and we realized that the movie could be as much about the need for civil discourse as anything else. That's what movie became, but that evolved over time.\"\n\nCongressman Adam Kinzinger speaks his truth to the media from the corridors of power in Washington, ... More D.C.\n\nSo, after everything that has happened and continues to happen as a result of him standing up for what he believes is right, does he have hope that the GOP can return to what it once was and a party he can align with again? The future could lie in America's political history.\n\n\"That's a good question,\" he muses. \"Every democracy needs like a left movement and a right movement; it's that push-pull. Obviously, we needed to go forward on gay marriage. There are some things that conservative movements do a good job of saying, 'Well, hold on.' I think the Republican Party is toast for a while. Everything is a pendulum, and I honestly believe that Trumpism doesn't survive past these four years. While I'm pissed Trump won, had he lost, I couldn't have put an expiration date on Trumpism. It could have been right then and could have been 10 years from now. The only good thing about Trump winning is that in four years, people are going to want nothing to do with him or his movement anymore.\"\n\n\"That's typically the same for any American president. After their eighth year, America turned against them; it happened with George W. Bush, it happened with Barack Obama, it happened with everybody, so I don't think the Republican Party is saveable in the near term. We all love this idea of a third party, but that's tough, even mechanically, to pull off. Suppose the Democrats understand that there is room for centrist Democrats. I live in Texas now, and in the last election, Democrats put up a great candidate against Ted Cruz, Colin Allred. Unfortunately, it was a bad year in Texas, but he, a friend of mine, was actually the perfect candidate to defeat Cruz. If you were to put a Colin Allred type as the equivalent of a Republican, they'd have kicked him out for being too moderate. So, I do think there's an opportunity for Democrats to have this family discussion and run the country.\"\n\nFmr. Rep. concludes, \"Like I say, I think the Republican Party for the near term, unfortunately, is toast. I hope I'm wrong, and I hope in four years, everybody wakes up and realizes they were under the spell of Donald Trump, and we need to get back to a Ronald Reagan-type or George W Bush without the wars because he was this compassionate conservative type. It's tough because, honestly, the young generation is getting radicalized, and young men particularly. Young people now have never seen politics outside of Donald Trump being a factor, and so that's my whole mission, to try to remind people that politics doesn't have to be this.\""

      "text": "Doctors Outraged Republican Congress To Allow Medicare Pay Cut\n\nBy Bruce Japsen\n\nBy Bruce Japsen ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nThe American Medical Association and a chorus of physician groups Sunday decried what they say is ... More decision by the Republican-controlled Congress to allow a devastating cut in Medicare payments to physicians.\n\nThe American Medical Association and a chorus of physician groups decried what they say is a decision by the Republican-controlled Congress to allow a devastating cut in Medicare payments to physicians.\n\nA funding bill released over the weekend by Republicans who control the U.S. House of Representatives will allow to go forward a 2.8% cut in payments physicians receive from the Medicare health insurance program to treat elderly patients.\n\nWith Donald Trump and his biggest campaign donor, the billionaire Elon Musk, already cutting federal health agency funding and Republicans looking at cuts to spending on Medicaid coverage for low-income Americans, doctors and hospitals fear the Medicare payment cut to physicians will certainly lead to closures of physician practices, clinics and hospitals, particularly in rural areas.\n\n\"Today's decision to allow the 2.8 percent cut to go forward is particularly devastating for rural and underserved communities,\" AMA president Dr. Bruce Scott said Sunday. \"These physicians and their patients have borne the brunt of the rising practice costs - 3.5 percent this year according to Medicare's own estimate. When adjusted for inflation, Medicare payment to physician practices has dropped 33 percent since 2001. Let me be clear: these unsustainable cuts will force more practices to close and leave patients with fewer options for care.\"\n\nThe decision to allow the cut to go forward was a shock to physician groups and Congressional observers. Less than two weeks ago, the AMA cheered bipartisan legislation to stop the cut plus language in a bill that would provide \"a 2% payment update to help offset the rising costs of running a practice,\" the AMA said in late February.\n\nThe bipartisan legislation to stop the payment cut also had the support of the \"House GOP Doctors' Caucus,\" which the AMA said endorsed the improved Medicare funding, calling \"the current path forward for physicians - especially those serving rural and underserved communities - (as) unsustainable.\"\n\nPolitico reported Rep. Greg Murphy, a North Carolina Republican and urologist who co-chairs the GOP Doctors' Caucus, said \"in recent months that Republican leadership was open to including the policy in the bill to keep the government funded through September, and that Trump administration officials had assured it would be addressed.\"\n\n\"Five health industry lobbyists, granted anonymity to share details of private negotiations, were also anticipating it would be a part of the funding measure to avoid a shutdown after March 14,\" Politico's report said.\n\nBut physicians Sunday said Congress has failed them, and it's Medicare patients who will suffer.\n\nRural areas are already struggling to attract physicians, doctors say, and studies show Medicare payment makes up most of any rural physician's revenue. And the payment cuts come as physicians are seeing an influx of patients.\n\n\"Physicians across the country are outraged that Congress's proposed spending package locks in a devastating fifth consecutive year of Medicare cuts, threatening access to care for 66 million Medicare patients,\" the AMA's Scott said. \"Despite repeated warnings, lawmakers are once again ignoring the dire consequences of these cuts and their impact both on patients and the private practices struggling to keep their doors open.\""

      "text": "Elon Musk's PAC Gave $1 Million To College Republican Leader In Wisconsin Giveaway-Why That Might Not Be A Coincidence\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk and his America PAC gave $1 million to two Wisconsin voters at a rally Sunday, one of whom leads the state's College Republicans and has worked in GOP politics-a choice that's garnered scrutiny but may have been intentional, as past statements by America PAC suggest the Musk-helmed group does not select its giveaway winners at random.\n\nElon Musk presents a $1 million check to Nicholas Jacobs during a town hall March 30 in Green Bay, ... More Wisconsin.\n\nMusk and America PAC have been spending millions to elect Republican Brad Schimel in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race , including offering money to state voters who sign the PAC's petition against purportedly partisan judges-ranging from lower $20 and $100 payments to people who sign the petition or recruit others, to two $1 million prizes given out Sunday when Musk campaigned in the state.\n\nMusk gave $1 million to two individuals in Wisconsin Sunday, including one - Nicholas Jacobs - whose long history in Republican politics in the state raised scrutiny, while the other, graphic designer Ekaterina Diestler, was chosen to be a spokesperson for the PAC but did not appear to have any background in politics.\n\nJacobs said in a video posted by America PAC he \"didn't believe it\" when his name was called as a prize winner and that Musk is \"motivating people to go out and vote in a way that hasn't been done before.\"\n\nMusk has classified the $1 million prizes as payments for the winners to be \"spokesmen\" for America PAC and its petition against purportedly partisan judges-after outraging legal experts by suggesting in a now-deleted post on X that he was giving the million-dollar prizes out to voters who had already cast ballots \"in appreciation for you taking the time to vote.\"\n\nJacobs introduced himself in the America PAC video as the chair of the Wisconsin Federation of Young Republicans-with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporting he's also worked on multiple congressional campaigns and with right-wing group Turning Point USA-and his win has garnered scrutiny on social media, as users have speculated Musk did not pick Jacobs at random given his background in GOP politics.\n\nPast statements by America PAC suggest Jacobs may have been chosen intentionally: When the PAC gave away $1 million to swing state voters during November's presidential election , lawyers for the committee admitted in court that winners were not chosen at random, but were selected based on their ability to be good spokespeople for the group.\n\nAmerica PAC hasn't clarified how winners in Wisconsin were chosen, and the PAC and the Wisconsin College Republicans have not yet responded to requests for comment-but neither Musk's announcement of the Wisconsin giveaways nor court documents America PAC has filed in Wisconsin characterize the winners as being chosen at random.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court race is taking place Tuesday, with Schimel facing off against Democratic-backed candidate Susan Crawford. Polls will close at 8 p.m. CDT, though it's unclear how long after that it will take to determine a winner.\n\nAmerica PAC claimed last year it did not choose its $1 million giveaway winners at random, after Philadelphia's district attorney sued Musk and his PAC over their cash prizes being given out to swing state voters. While Philadelphia argued the $1 million giveaways violated Pennsylvania's rules against unauthorized lotteries, America PAC claimed the giveaways weren't actually lotteries at all, because winners were not chosen by chance. Instead, PAC director Chris Young testified during a hearing the winners were chosen based on their suitability to be spokespeople, and likened the petition that voters signed-which made them eligible to win the $1 million prize-to a \"job application\" for a position as a PAC spokesperson. America PAC used a \"multi-step process\" to select winners of the $1 million giveaways during the presidential election, Young said, as recounted by the judge in his decision allowing the giveaways . That process included looking at winners' public social media posts and meeting them in person before they were given the cash prizes \"to make sure their personality would be a good fit for the role.\"\n\nHow the winners in Wisconsin were chosen. While Wisconsin attorney general Josh Kaul sued Musk and America PAC to stop the giveaways, that lawsuit did not take issue with whether or not the winners were chosen at random, so Musk and America PAC did not disclose its process for choosing the winners. Both Jacobs and Diestler made videos for the PAC after being chosen.\n\nAmerica PAC's admission in court that $1 million winners weren't chosen at random during the presidential election sparked a class action lawsuit against the PAC, as voters who had signed its petition because they wanted a shot at the $1 million prizes alleged they were defrauded. \"Had Plaintiff been aware that the lottery was not random, or that she did not have a fair chance to win the prize, or that her selection hinged on her perceived favorability to Defendants as a marketing prop, she would not have signed or supported the America PAC petition and would not have provided her [personal information] to Defendants,\" voter Joy Harvick's lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. The litigation is still playing out in federal court.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court election has become a major focus for Musk and his America PAC, with the PAC spending more than $12 million on the race, on top of millions spent by other groups Musk is associated with and donations the billionaire has given directly to the state's Republican Party. The election is the first downballot race Musk has waded into since he emerged as a major political force last summer, when he formed America PAC and became one of President Donald Trump's top political donors and most outspoken supporters. Musk said in the aftermath of Trump's win that America PAC would keep up its campaign operations, announcing the PAC would \"keep grinding\" and \"increasing Republican registrations in key districts around the country, in preparation for special elections and the midterms.\" Musk has highlighted the Wisconsin Supreme Court race as being important given that it will determine the ideological balance of the court, which is likely to decide key issues like redrawing House districts and voting rules for the 2028 election. Payments to voters have become a hallmark of America PAC's efforts-albeit a controversial one, given laws that prohibit giving things of value to persuade voters to cast ballots-and the committee has also offered smaller payments to Wisconsin voters who sign its petition or recruit others to do so.\n\nOne Community.

There are 244 days until the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nTrump's path to the nomination appeared certain before the primaries even began, based on a polling lead that would defy historical precedent if he were to lose the contest, while Biden's incumbent status made him his party's heavy favorite given only longshot competitors. Trump's final remaining competitor in the race, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, dropped out after he won 14 of 15 contests last week on Super Tuesday, effectively handing him the nomination. Both Trump and Biden have been looking beyond the primaries for weeks-focusing their attacks on each other and largely ignoring other longshot candidates as it's become clear they're headed for a closely contested rematch, with polls showing Trump leading Biden by just 1.7 points, according to RealClearPolitics' polling average .\n\nRepublicans will officially confirm their nominee at the Republican National Convention July 15-18 in Milwaukee, and Democrats will hold their convention Aug. 19-22 in Chicago."

More of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket on November 19, 2024 in Brownsville, Texas. SpaceX's billionaire owner, Elon Musk, a Trump confidante, has been tapped to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency alongside former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\n\nA Republican senator has introduced a bill to eliminate the Department of Education, which was one of President Donald Trump's campaign promises.\n\nThe bill aims to end the Department of Education, and redistribute federal programs to other existing departments. But the biggest change would be allocating K-12 education money directly to the states via block grants.\n\nThe bill, Returning Education to Our States Act , was introduced by Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota. In a press release , he said \"The federal Department of Education has never educated a single student, and it's long past time to end this bureaucratic Department that causes more harm than good.\"\n\nHowever, it was also noted that there are several important programs housed within the Department of Education, and the goal is to move them to other areas of government.\n\nThe bill proposes moving key programs to different areas. According to the bill, here's where the programs would move:\n\nFor the remaining K-12 funds, the money would be distributed by the Department of the Treasury to the states via block grants.\n\nIt's important to note that these changes do not directly have an impact on borrowers in any way. By simply moving the existing programs to another department (in this case, Treasury), none of the rules governing student loans change.\n\nIn fact, it's likely that (at least in the short term) no loan servicers will change and student loans will operate in the current status quo.\n\nBorrowers would still need to make their student loan payments, student loan repayment plans that were created by law will still be available, and loan forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness will still happen .\n\nIt would take future actions by Congress to change these existing programs, whether or not the Department of Education exists as an entity.\n\nWhile the uncertainty surrounding student loans can be unnerving, especially as you're trying to plan for the future, borrowers with existing loans should make their plans based on the information available today - not hypothetical future legislation.\n\nEven if changes were to happen to the Department of Education, it would take time - potentially years. And as the legislation stands today, the existing student loan programs will remain as they are."

(Photo ... More by Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Republican party platform , orchestrated by former President Trump, is filled with promises for those it calls \"our Great Seniors.\" But there is little or no real policy behind most of those campaign pledges. And the document is filled with many irreconcilable contradictions.\n\nThe platform will be the GOP's election-year policy framework coming out of its upcoming July 15-18 nominating convention. And it recognizes some critical needs of seniors and sets goals that would improve their quality of life and that of their families. But it rarely describes how Trump and the GOP would achieve those goals.\n\nSocial Security\n\nThe document is full of uppercase promises such as, \"FIGHT FOR AND PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE WITH NO CUTS, INCLUDING NO CHANGES TO THE RETIREMENT AGE.\"\n\nBut that bold pledge ignores a singular reality. Within about a decade, absent major changes, the Social Security trust fund will have only enough money to pay about 78% of promised benefits. That means a typical retiree receiving about $1,900-a-month in benefits would see their payments decline by more than $400.\n\nIn other words, those promised \"NO CUTS\" are impossible without major reforms. But the platform is completely mute on what they'd be.\n\nMedicare\n\nSame story with Medicare. The platform promises \"NO CUTS\" but is silent on how to make the troubled Hospital Insurance trust fund solvent.\n\nIt does make one promise: \"Republicans will protect Medicare's finances from being financially crushed by the Democrat plan to add tens of millions of new illegal immigrants to the rolls of Medicare.\"\n\nBut undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicare . Undocumented workers must pay the Medicare payroll tax but can't collect benefits. Thus, they make Medicare's finances stronger, not weaker . And few Democrats support expanding Medicare benefits to the undocumented.\n\nImmigration And Care Workers\n\nThe implacable opposition of Trump and his party to immigration hurts seniors in other ways and creates a massive inconsistency in the platform. It follows a pattern from Trump's first term in office.\n\nOn one hand, it vows to shut the US borders to immigration and initiate the \"largest deportation program in American history.\" But it also promises to \"overturn disincentives that lead to Care Worker shortages.\" Except one of the largest causes of care worker shortages is, wait for it, restrictive immigration policy.\n\nFor example, the US will need to fill 5.5 million vacant home care jobs by 2031, according to PHI International. But few native-born Americans want to do this low-paid and dangerous work. Where will those workers come from?\n\nAbout one-third of on-the-books home care workers currently are immigrants. Licensed home care aides, for example, have work papers. But an unknown, but significant, number of gray market workers are undocumented. And many working on green cards have family members who are undocumented.\n\nBooting foreign-born workers out of the country will make the care worker shortages vastly worse, placing even more burdens on family members, jeopardizing the health of frail older adults, and driving more people who need long-term care out of their homes and into nursing facilities. All exactly the opposite of what the platform promises.\n\nAnd it isn't just aides. The research organization KFF reports that about a half million registered nurses are immigrants, one of every six nurses in the US. Nearly one-third of all hospitals report hiring foreign-educated nurses.\n\nNotwithstanding the platform's promise to \"work with our Great Seniors, in order to allow them to be active and healthy,\" the immigration provisions of the GOP platform will make their lives infinitely worse.\n\nTax Credits\n\nThe platform also promises unspecified tax credits for family caregivers. There is less to that pledge than meets the eye as well.\n\nTax credits come in two flavors, refundable and non-refundable. Most are non-refundable, which means they are unavailable to low- and even many moderate-income households who pay no federal income tax . Refundable tax credits are more available, but they cost the Treasury more revenue and generally have been opposed by Republicans.\n\nAnd even if you are eligible, the credits represent no more than a drop in the financial bucket for most frail older adults and their families. A federal credit may be $750 or $1,000. But the average annual cost of a home care aide is $75,000. And a nursing home can easily cost twice as much.\n\nPrimary Care\n\nThen, the platform says this: \"Republicans will support increased focus on Chronic Disease prevention and management, Long-Term Care, and Benefit flexibility. We will expand access to Primary Care and support Policies that help Seniors remain in their homes and maintain Financial Security.\"\n\nAll laudable goals. But what do they mean?\n\nFocusing on long-term care is nice but it isn't a plan.\n\nAnother example: Access to primary care is important. But given the severe shortage of primary care physicians and nurse practitioners , increased access is a pipe dream.\n\nHow would Trump and a GOP Congress increase incentives for medical professionals to get into primary care? Silence.\n\nThere's lots more, but you get the drift. Promising support for \"our Great Seniors\" is nice. But without real, consistent policy ideas, it is meaningless."

The issue is institutional,\" said Augustus LeRoux, chair of the NYFCR. \"I'm hard pressed to think of anything the CRNC has done to advance the Republican cause.\"\n\nUnrest has been brewing for several months at the CRNC, which oversees an annual budget of more than $1 million and leads GOP volunteer efforts by university students at college Republican chapters in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.\n\nOn July 13, the NYFCR published a dossier claiming that the national committee had failed to report at least $2 million in funding and misallocated more than $1 million in digital advertising in three separate fiscal years. The dossier alleged that just $164 of the $1 million advertising budget had been spent on Facebook ads.\n\nWhen LeRoux questioned Thornton about the missing funds in a phone call on June 18, Thornton responded that he couldn't directly provide a breakdown of the budget but that much of the money went into marketing outside of the organization and recruitment.\n\n\"The truth is nobody knows what happened,\" LeRoux said. \"The expenses that we do have and that we can look at doesn't add up with the budget proposal. Speculation flies to whether this money was pocketed.\"\n\nThe CRNC and Thornton did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nSeveral state branches have also criticized the national org after a letter between Thornton and a Case Western University professor obtained by National Review pointed to tampering in an election for the new chairperson.\n\nA rule in the CRNC Constitution says that state branches need to submit information about members by Feb. 1 to receive voting delegates. When more than a dozen federations had their credentials rejected, only some states that overwhelmingly supported national chair candidate Courtney Britt were granted voting delegates.\n\nStates that were disenfranchised were told they were required to submit a letter of certification from faculty advisors at each college chapter. But many college chapters that supported candidate Judah Waxelbaum were not notified of this stipulation.\n\nIn a statement to CRNC members published on Twitter, Thornton defended the voting procedure, saying that the convention operated within the organization's rules, and that 17 federations either failed to submit documentation to receive voting delegates or chose not to appear.\n\nIn a letter sent to the national org, the chairperson of the Mississippi branch wrote that \"leaders of the [CRNC] have proven to be more concerned with clinging on their own power than with empowering federations across the country.\"\n\nThe NYFCR stated in their dossier that they plan on creating the framework for a new forum-based national organization for Republican college students in an effort to replace the current national committee, given that more states withdraw.\n\nLeRoux said that there is an active effort among several states to create a national organization that is structured to provide checks and balances, as well as bring donation money directly to the state federations.\n\n\"If the CRNC has any hope of survival, the delegates of these 11 states must be reinstated immediately, and the anti-corruption movement must be allowed to reform the organization,\" the NYFCR stated."

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is facing mounting opposition from Republican senators over his sweeping plan to impose steep tariffs on nearly 200 countries, including the United States' biggest trading partners and allies.\n\nThe pushback-in the form of public statements and support for legislation that would limit Trump's tariff authority-has become stronger as Wall Street and international markets nosedive amid increased uncertainty about the impact of the tariffs and fears of a global recession.\n\nTrump sent Wall Street into a tailspin when he announced on Wednesday that the U.S. would impose a 10 percent \"baseline\" tariff on virtually all imports and singled out roughly 60 countries for what he described as \"discounted reciprocal tariffs.\"\n\nHe explained that the \"reciprocal\" tariffs were based on tariffs those countries imposed on the U.S. The numbers Trump cited, however, were inaccurate and the White House later clarified that the formula it used was based on just two variables: the U.S.'s trade deficit with a foreign country divided by that country's exports to the U.S.\n\nTrump then halved that number to arrive at his \"discounted reciprocal tariff,\" which he said he was doing to be \"kind.\"\n\nWall Street had its worst week in five years in response to Trump's tariffs, as the U.S. and global markets reeled with recession fears and uncertainty about the potentially devastating impact the tariffs could have. The U.S. dollar also wiped out all its gains since Trump's reelection.\n\nMore than half a dozen Senate Republicans have pushed back on the president's tariffs so far.\n\n\"Tariffs are a tax on consumers, and I'm not a fan of jacking up taxes on American consumers,\" Cruz, a one-time Trump rival turned staunch ally, told Fox Business' Larry Kudlow on Thursday.\n\n\"So my hope is these tariffs are short-lived and they serve as leverage to lower tariffs across the globe,\" he added.\n\nJoshua Blank, who runs the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas in Austin, told Newsweek that the state will likely \"feel more pain than most\" other states as a result of Trump's tariffs because of the critical role that foreign trade plays in its economy.\n\nGrassley recently cosponsored a bipartisan piece of legislation with Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington that would limit the president's power to impose and enact tariffs and give Congress more control over the duties.\n\nThe measure says that within 48 hours of imposing or increasing a duty, the president must explain to Congress the \"reasoning\" for doing so and submit \"an assessment of the potential impact of imposing or increasing the duty on United States businesses and consumers.\"\n\nIt also says any new tariffs will expire within 60 days unless approved by Congress.\n\nGrassley's proposal with Cantwell comes as rural residents in Iowa, many of whom rely heavily on manufacturing and farming, brace for the impact of Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"A trade war will put Iowa farmers directly in the crossfire without getting any closer to the long-term goal of fair trade that values Iowa farmers and workers, Aaron Lehman, the board president of Iowa Farmers Union, told The Des Moines Register in a statement .\n\nTillis indicated to Politico that he backs Grassley and Cantwell's legislation , telling the news outlet he was \"inclined\" to support it.\n\nHe noted, however, that he's made no final decision on it and said his staff is still reviewing the text of the bill.\n\nTillis also warned of the consequences of Trump's tariffs, telling CNN , \"Anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right need to talk to my farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy.\"\n\n\"They don't have time, so we've got to be crisp on this implementation,\" the North Carolina senator added. \"Otherwise, we could do damage that's irreparable to farmers.\"\n\nMcConnell, the former Senate majority and minority leader, broke ranks along with several other Republicans earlier this week to thwart Trump's tariffs on Canada , a longtime U.S. ally and key trading partner.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Goods made in America will be more expensive to manufacture and, ultimately, for consumers to purchase, with higher broad-based tariffs,\" McConnell said. \"At a time when Americans are tightening their belts, we would do well to avoid policies that heap on the pain. We ought to strengthen our friendships abroad, and reinforce our allies as pillars of American prosperity and security.\"\n\nMurkowski also voted with Democrats on the measure effectively ending some of Trump's tariffs on Canada.\n\nThe bill zeroes in on Trump's national emergency declaration in February, which his administration invoked to impose a 25 percent tariff on Canada, which is the U.S.'s closest trading partner. Trump claimed that Canada was allowing fentanyl and other drugs to pour into the U.S. when he signed an executive order declaring a national emergency.\n\nMurkowski said Trump's tariffs would hurt Alaska and called for the president to \"find a better way to mutually secure our borders and address fentanyl trafficking than by staring a trade war.\"\n\n\"While not all Canadian trade practices are fair, I'm keenly aware of the negative impacts in store for Alaskan families and businesses should tariffs drive up the costs of essential goods,\" Murkowski wrote on X, formerly Twitter .\n\n\"In Alaska ... we share more than 1,538 miles of border with Canada,\" the Republican senator added. \"We are friends, neighbors, partners, and allies when it comes to our economies, our mutual defense, our cultures, and, yes, our trade.\"\n\nCollins-who frequently votes with Murkowski and is widely viewed as a more moderate Republican-backed her colleagues in their support for the Democratic bill demanding that the 25 percent tariffs on Canada be reversed.\n\n\"The fact is, the vast majority of fentanyl in America comes from the southern border,\" not Canada, Collins said on the Senate floor.\n\nThe Maine lawmaker, whose state borders Canada, also noted that Trump's tariffs would adversely affect key industries in Maine, including the paper, pulp, lobster and agricultural sectors.\n\nShe also took a swipe at Trump's decision to target partners and rivals alike with his broad tariffs-a fact that came into sharp focus when Trump unveiled tariffs against 185 countries earlier that same day.\n\n\"One of my biggest concerns is we should be distinguishing between allies and our adversaries and not treating them the same way,\" Collins said.\n\nPaul has been an ardent and long-time opponent of tariffs, saying that Congress is the only government entity that has the authority to impose and raise taxes, not the executive branch.\n\nThe Kentucky senator joined McConnell, Collins and Murkowski in voting with Democrats to reverse some of the tariffs on Canada and wrote on X after the vote: \"Tariffs don't punish foreign governments. They punish American families. When we tax imports, we raise the price of everything-from groceries to smartphones to washing machines to prescription drugs.\"\n\nPaul issued another dire warning on Wednesday, saying Trump's sweeping tariffs could result in the \"political decimation\" of the Republican Party .\n\n\"Tariffs have also led to political decimation,\" Paul told Fox News . \"When [former President William] McKinley most famously put tariffs on in 1890, they lost 50 percent of their seats in the national election. When [Smoot-Hawley] put on their tariff in the early 1930s, we lost the House and the Senate for 60 years. So they're not only bad economically, they're bad politically.\"\n\nKennedy struck a more measured tone than Paul, noting that he shares Trump's \"objective\" on trade \"in the long run.\"\n\n\"But ... in the long run, we're all dead,\" Kennedy said after Trump rolled out his plan. \"The short-run matters, too. I don't care what the experts say. We do not know yet the impact of these [tariffs ... We just don't know and anybody who tells you otherwise that says they know has been smoking the devil's lettuce.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to bubble-wrap it,\" Kennedy told Fox News' Harris Faulkner. \"Now, will it continue? Will we find a bottom and then it'll start to go back up? I hope so. That's what I'm pulling for.\"\n\nThe Louisiana senator also said that the U.S. is in \"uncharted waters\" and the \"economic unknown.\"\n\nAlmost no House Republicans-who are much more aligned with the president than their Senate counterparts-have spoken out against Trump's tariffs so far.\n\nOn Friday evening, Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska became the first House Republican to publicly come out against the president's tariffs, saying he will introduce a companion bill to Grassley and Cantwell's Senate bill to rein in Trump's tariff powers and give Congress back that authority.\n\nPolitico first reported on Bacon's plans, which he later confirmed to Axios.\n\nThe Senate bill reversing Trump's Canada tariffs will almost certainly fail in the GOP-led House of Representatives. Similarly, if Grassley and Cantwell's measure passes the Senate, it will likely tank in the House.\n\nTrump blasted the four Republicans who voted to roll back his Canada tariffs and urged them to \"get on the Republican bandwagon,\" writing on Truth Social: \"To the people of the Great States of Kentucky, Alaska, and Maine, please contact these Senators and get them to FINALLY adhere to Republican Values and Ideals. They have been extremely difficult to deal with and, unbelievably disloyal to hardworking Majority Leader John Thune, and the Republican Party itself.\"\n\nTrump said things are \"going very well,\" even as the stock market nosedived this week in response to his tariff plan: \"It was an operation, like when a patient gets operated on and it's a big thing. I said this would exactly be the way it is. We have six or seven trillion dollars coming into our country and we've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nHe added: \"The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country's going to boom. And the rest of the world wants to see, is there any way they can make a deal. They've taken advantage of us for many, many years. And many years we've been at the wrong side of the ball and I'll tell you what, I think it's going to be unbelievable.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance echoed his boss , telling Newsmax on Thursday evening: \"We're feeling good. Look, I frankly thought in some ways it could be worse in the markets because this is a big transition.\"\n\nA 25 percent tariff on auto imports, which Trump had announced before unveiling this week's sweeping tariffs, took effect on Thursday. His 10 percent \"baseline\" tariff is set to take effect on Saturday and his \"discounted reciprocal\" tariffs will kick in on April 9.\n\nUpdate 04/04/25 8:20 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nSonam Sheth is an Evening Politics Editor at Newsweek who is based in New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRepresentative Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican working to curb some of President Donald Trump 's tariff authority, said Sunday that his party's historic support of tariffs led to the \"worst depression we've ever had,\" pointing to the economic crisis that started in 1929 and carried through the 1930s.\n\n\"We learned from that, that tariffs and protectionism does not work,\" he told Margaret Brennan, host of CBS News' Face the Nation on Sunday.\n\nTrump's April 2 announcement of sweeping global tariffs included new tariffs on all imported goods from 180 countries as well as a list of \" reciprocal duties \" targeting dozens of countries in an effort to reportedly combat trade imbalances and restore America's manufacturing industry. The president has hailed the tariffs as the country's \"declaration of economic independence.\"\n\nHowever, Trump's shakeup of international trade has rattled global and domestic markets, with Wall Street tanking over the past few days, marking the worst days for the U.S. stock markets since 2020 .\n\nEconomists have warned of the likelihood of a recession, while the Trump administration has not ruled out the possibility, noting the transition period will be marked with some market \"disruption.\" On Saturday, Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" amid market volatility and the announcement of reciprocal tariffs by other countries, including China.\n\nBacon was the first GOP House member to come out against Trump's tariffs, vocally backing bipartisan Senate legislation to rein in presidential authority over tariffs and give Congress more control over future trade duties.\n\nDanielle Jensen, Bacon's communications director, told Newsweek in a Sunday email that the representative is \"looking forward to working on this legislation with Senator [Chuck] Grassley [an Iowa Republican] and returning the power of tariffs to Congress.\"\n\nThe bipartisan bill, \"Trade Review Act of 2025\" comes a day after Trump's \"Liberation Day,\" and states that within 48 hours after imposing or increasing a duty, the president must submit to Congress an \"explanation of the reasoning for imposing or increasing the duty and an assessment of the potential impact of imposing or increasing the duty on United States businesses and consumers.\"\n\nThe bill also states that any new tariffs will expire within 60 days unless Congress approves them. Both chambers can pass a \"joint resolution of disapproval\" to terminate the tariff before the 60-day deadline.\n\nBacon will be introducing a House companion bill on the matter on Monday, telling Brennan that \"it will be harder to pass this in the House, no doubt,\" but signaled that he has some support from chamber members.\n\n\"It's time that Congress restores its authorities here,\" Bacon said Sunday. \"And the Constitution is clear. The House and the Senate, Congress, has the power of tariffs and taxes, and we gave some of that power to the executive branch and I think, in hindsight that was a mistake.\"\n\nBrennan followed up by pointing out that Trump heavily campaigned on tariffs and taking America back to the \"glory days of the 1800s,\" asking \"did Republicans just not take him seriously?\"\n\nBacon replied: \"It was Republican's support of tariffs in the 1800s and up through about 1930 when we passed that Smoot-Hawley Act that created the worst depression we've ever had. We learned from that that tariffs and protectionism does not work.\"\n\nThe Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was signed into law in 1930 and sharply raised U.S. tariffs from on over 20,000 imported goods to protect American farmers and manufacturers. U.S. imports fell by two-thirds within three years, and exports saw similar declines. It is often cited as a contributor to the economic collapse of the 1930s, though some economists disagree.\n\nThe Great Depression was the most prolonged economic downturn in U.S. history, marked by the stock market crash, high unemployment, and bank failures.\n\nBacon told Brennan that tariffs were not a central voting issue for Americans in last year's presidential election, at least not in comparison to the southern border, immigration, and inflation, saying: \"I don't think tariffs was really a big factor in people's decision making.\"\n\nConcerns over a potential recession and rising economic hardship are growing among Americans following news of the stock market reaching its lowest days in half a decade. Even prior to recent market volatility, a majority of Americans believed the country was headed for a recession within the year, according to a poll by Ipsos that was published on Wednesday.\n\nThe survey conducted between March 25-26 among 1,085 adults found that 61 percent of respondents expect the U.S. to enter a recession within the next 12 months. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.1 percentage points.\n\nSenator Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat co-sponsoring the bill with Grassley, said in a statement Thursday: \"This bill reasserts Congress's role over trade policy to ensure rules-based trade policies are transparent, consistent, and benefit the American public.\"\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement Thursday: \"For too long, Congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch. Building on my previous efforts as Finance Committee Chairman, I'm joining Senator Cantwell to introduce the bipartisan Trade Review Act of 2025 to reassert Congress's constitutional role and ensure Congress has a voice in trade policy.\"\n\nSenator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, about the bill to NBC News on Thursday: \"I like congressional review...In trade, it's a good example,\" and clarified, \"I'll support Grassley if it gets a vote.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in a Saturday Truth Social post: \"THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\nCantwell spoke on the Senate floor about her co-sponsored bill on Thursday. It now heads to committee for review before it can advance to a full Senate vote.\n\nBacon is expected to introduce the House bill on Monday where Republicans hold a 220-213 majority in the House.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nMandy Taheri is a Newsweek reporter based in Brooklyn.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nU.S. Representative Don Bacon has become the first Republican House member to come out against Donald Trump 's tariffs, as he prepares to introduce a mirror bill to the bipartisan Senate legislation aimed at restoring congressional powers over the levies.\n\nBacon, of Nebraska, told Newsweek on Friday, \"I look forward to working with Sen. Grassley to restore review and powers over tariffs to Congress.\"\n\nSeveral Senate Republicans , including Trump allies, have raised concerns about the sweeping tariffs that sent global markets into a tailspin after they were announced on Wednesday.\n\nLawmakers have warned the tariffs could spark inflation and a recession, even as Trump insists that the tariffs will boost domestic manufacturing and balance \"unfair\" international trade.\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley , Iowa Republican, recently joined Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington to introduce the bipartisan Senate bill that would allow Congress more control over future trade duties.\n\nBacon's move is unusual in Trump's loyalist Republican-majority House. But this is not the first time he's broken ranks to criticize the president.\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed this week, Bacon called out the president for being too soft on Russia.\n\n\"In recent weeks, too many of my fellow Republicans - including Mr. Trump - have treated Russia with velvet gloves, shying away from calling out Mr. Putin's flatly illegal war and even blaming Ukraine for starting it,\" he wrote, adding that Trump and the White House needed to reaffirm their commitment to opposing Russian President Vladimir Putin .\n\nDespite voting for the GOP temporary spending bill last month, Bacon also blasted it as a \"a sign of a dysfunctional government.\"\n\nNow Bacon is again speaking out against Trump, this time on his tariffs. He told Newsweek , \"I strongly oppose the use of tariff authority to impose nonreciprocal tariffs,\" adding he was \"pleased\" that Trump has not imposed further tariffs on his state's biggest trading partners, Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe details of Bacon's bill are not yet clear, but is set to be companion legislation to the Senate bill, which aims to limit the president's power to impose tariffs.\n\nTitled \"Trade Review Act of 2025,\" the Senate legislation states that within 48 hours after imposing or increasing a duty, the president must submit to Congress an \"explanation of the reasoning for imposing or increasing the duty and an assessment of the potential impact of imposing or increasing the duty on United States businesses and consumers.\" It would also let Congress vote to end the levies at any time.\n\nSince it was introduced by Grassley and Cantwell on Thursday, four other Republicans have signed as cosponsors, including Senators Mitch McConnell , Thom Tillis, Lisa Murkowski and Jerry Moran.\n\nThe House recently voted to bar lawmakers from trying to force a vote to end the emergency declaration Trump used to implement the tariffs.\n\nBacon told Newsweek on the tariffs, \"Nebraskans want free trade agreements, not trade animosity.\"\n\nGrassley, in a statement on Thursday: \"For too long, Congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch. Building on my previous efforts as Finance Committee Chairman, I'm joining Senator Cantwell to introduce the bipartisan Trade Review Act of 2025 to reassert Congress's constitutional role and ensure Congress has a voice in trade policy.\"\n\nSenator Susan Collins, on the Senate floor Wednesday: \"The price hikes that will happen for Maine families-every time they go to the grocery store, they fill their gas tank, they fill their heating oil tank-if these tariffs go into effect will be so harmful. And as price hikes always do, they will hurt those the most who can afford them the least.\"\n\nBacon has not confirmed when he plans to introduce the bill to the House.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nHannah Parry is a Newsweek Live Blog Editor based in New York.

In 2023, around 71.6 million people received benefits from programs administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA), the agency reported.\n\nMany Democrats have said Republicans and Trump will cut various entitlements as part of efforts to shrink the federal government, reduce the national debt, and limit government spending.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders , a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democrats, spoke out on the Senate floor Friday ahead of a vote on a Trump-backed budget bill, which ultimately passed early Saturday morning.\n\nIn a statement emailed to Newsweek , the progressive senator's office described the GOP proposal as an \"absurd budget that guts programs working class families rely on to pay for tax cuts for the rich.\"\n\nOn Saturday, tens of thousands of demonstrators took part in various \"Hands Off!\" protests across the country, and a handful in Europe, urging Trump and Musk to take their \"hands off\" of Social Security, federal jobs, Medicaid, and more.\n\nTuberville, a staunch Trump supporter, joined guest host Jackie DeAngelis on Sunday Morning Futures to discuss the recent Senate GOP budget, which passed 51-48 on Saturday, with Republican Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine voting against the bill.\n\nAn identical resolution needs to pass the House of Representatives in order for the reconciliation process.\n\nThe resolution includes an extension of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, increase the debt, and increase funding for the border and Pentagon , among others. Tuberville said the tax cuts should be addressed quickly \"because this will help out with the tariffs,\" as Trump imposed tariffs on 180 countries last week , sending the global and domestic stock markets in a tailspin.\n\nTuberville, speaking about Democrats, told DeAngelis: \"Their only compliant that they have, which is totally wrong, saying we're going to cut Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, they couldn't be any further from the truth, we're not going to do that, we're going to reform it.\"\n\nHe later added: \"This is the first time Democrats have been exactly right-Social Security, Medicare and Medicare is going to blow up and is going to go broke if we continue down the path of what the Democrats want,\" reiterating that \"we have to reform it.\"\n\nThe SSA, which started in 1935, faces a funding crisis that could leave the program unable to pay full benefits by the mid-2030s.\n\nMillions of Americans receive government supported health insurance programs. The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reports that 68.4 million Americans were enrolled in Medicare as of December 2024, and over 79 million in Medicaid as of November 2024.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Fox News in February : \"Social Security won't be touched, other than if there's fraud or something...It's going to be strengthened... Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said ahead of the vote: \"This resolution is the first step toward a final bill to make permanent the tax relief we implemented in 2017 and deliver a transformational investment in our border, national, and energy security.\"\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats said in a statement ahead of the vote : \"Maybe worst of all, at a moment when Mr. Musk and his billionaire friends are laying off thousands of workers at the Social Security Administration, closing down Social Security offices all over the country , and making it harder for people with disabilities and older people to get the benefits that they have paid into for their whole lives, this bill does nothing to address that crisis.\"\n\nSenator Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican, wrote on X on Friday: \"Here's the truth you won't hear from Democrats tonight. This budget resolution stops a $4 trillion tax hike from hitting families and small businesses. Let's pass this and get President Trump's agenda done!\"\n\nSenator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, wrote in an X post on March 1: \"Social Security is not a Ponzi scheme it's a promise that every American pays into so they can retire with dignity. Get loud and tell Elon Musk to keep his hands OFF social security.\"\n\nThe Senate approval of the fiscal framework lays the groundwork for a major tax and spending bill to implement Trump's policies, though this could run into trouble due to the concern of some House Republicans over U.S. debt levels.\n\nBoth chambers have to agree to the same budget framework.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nMandy Taheri is a Newsweek reporter based in Brooklyn.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's approval rating has turned negative for the first time in a poll conducted by a Republican-leaning firm.\n\nA shift in Trump's numbers could influence support from Republican lawmakers, affect his ability to push through his agenda and shape the political landscape, heading into the midterm election cycle.\n\nAccording to Rasmussen's daily poll tracker, as of April 4, Trump's approval rating sits at 49 percent, while 50 percent disapprove of his job performance.\n\nThat is the first time in Trump's second term that Rasmussen's tracker has shown the president with a net negative approval rating. On April 3, Trump's approval rating dipped below 50 points for the first time. Rasmussen is generally considered as a Republican-leaning pollster.\n\nMany polls have shown the president's approval rating on the decline in recent days.\n\nNewsweek's average of the 10 most recently published polls shows that Trump's approval rating stands at 47 percent, while 49 percent disapprove. That is a decline from early March, when Trump's approval rating was at 49 percent, while 47 percent disapproved.\n\nThe latest poll by RMG Research, another Republican-leaning pollster, has also shown a decrease in Trump's approval rating. The most recent poll, conducted between March 26 and April 3 among 3,000 registered voters, showed that Trump's approval rating stands at 51 percent, while 47 percent disapprove. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 points.\n\nIn a poll conducted in March by RMG, 52 percent had approved and 45 percent had disapproved.\n\nThe same trend was apparent in the most recent TIPP Insights poll, conducted between March 26 and 28 among 1,452 respondents, which showed that 44 percent approve of Trump, while 45 percent disapprove, giving him a net approval rating of -1. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points.\n\nA previous TIPP Insights poll from January showed that Trump's net approval rating stood at +5 points, with 46 percent approving and 41 percent disapproving.\n\nA poll conducted by Marquette University Law School between March 17 and March 27 among 1,021 adults also showed that Trump's approval rating had dropped to 46 percent, while 54 percent said they disapproved. In January, 48 percent approved and 52 percent disapproved. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nAnd according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted between March 31 and April 2 among 1,486 respondents, Trump's approval rating fell to 43 percent, the lowest since his return to office. Overall, the president was down 2 percentage points from a poll conducted March 21 to 23, and 4 points below the 47 percent approval he had shortly after taking office on January 20. The poll had a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.\n\nThe drop in Trump's approval rating has been mirrored by growing dissatisfaction with how he is handling the economy.\n\nFears over the state of the economy sprouted in recent weeks in reaction to a number of Trump economic policies, including his new program of tariffs. Goldman Sachs previously estimated tariffs could push up inflation by 1 percent while squeezing U.S. companies' profits.\n\nThe Marquette poll showed that 58 percent of adults think tariffs hurt the U.S. economy. The same amount think Trump's policies will increase inflation.\n\nTrump's 47 percent approval rating is lower than former President Joe Biden 's popularity at the same point in his presidency on April 5, 2021, when he stood at 54 percent, with a disapproval rating of 42 percent, according to RealClearPolitics.\n\nPolls released in the days after Trump's inauguration showed his popularity at an all-time high. However, he was still the least popular president in recent times.\n\nAccording to Gallup's first poll of Trump's second term, conducted between January 21 and 27, his initial approval rating was 47 percent. The pollster said this figure made him less popular than any president since 1953 at the start of a term and the only one to begin with a sub-50 percent approval rating. Gallup said Biden started his first term with a 57 percent approval rating.\n\nThe RealClearPolitics tracker shows that on April 5, 2017, Trump's approval rating was 40 percent, while his disapproval rating was 53 percent, giving him a net approval rating of -13 points, making Trump more popular now than at the same point in his first term.\n\nTrump's approval rating will likely fluctuate in the coming weeks, depending on the outcome of key events, including critical negotiations on the Russia-Ukraine war and the growing tariff battles.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nMartha McHardy is a U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is on polling and California politics.

His role is reporting on U.S. politics and social issues. Andrew joined Newsweek in 2021 from The Boston Globe. He is a graduate of Emerson College.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky predicted that President Donald Trump 's tariffs could lead to the \"political decimation\" of the Republican Party.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the U.S. Treasury for comment via email.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday announced sweeping tariffs for countries across the globe. Trump and supporters of these tariffs argue they are necessary to restore U.S. manufacturing, but many economists have warned that it will only amount to a new tax on U.S. consumers for many goods as companies pass off the additional expense.\n\nPaul was one of four GOP senators who joined Democrats who voted to oppose Trump's tariffs on Canada on Wednesday and is one of few Republicans in Congress who are opposing his tariffs.\n\nPaul warned that, if history is any indicator, tariffs won't play out well for the Republican Party in remarks reported by Fox News on Wednesday.\n\n\"Tariffs have also led to political decimation,\" Paul said. \"When [former President William] McKinley most famously put tariffs on in 1890, they lost 50 percent of their seats in the national election. When [Smoot-Hawley] put on their tariff in the early 1930s, we lost the House and the Senate for 60 years. So they're not only bad economically, they're bad politically.\"\n\nIn 1890, then-Representative William McKinley, a Republican, led the charge for new tariffs to protect manufacturing interests. Later that year, Republicans did suffer losses in the House of Representatives, losing 93 seats to Democrats and the Populist Party.\n\nAfter the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which many economists say worsened the Great Depression, Republicans did struggle in elections for decades. From 1930 to 1995, they only held a House majority for two nonconsecutive terms, and the Senate for only six terms, amounting to about 12 years.\n\nRobert Y. Shapiro, professor of political science at Columbia University, told Newsweek the tariffs will be \"very costly\" to Republicans in the midterms if they lead to higher prices, unemployment or a decline in economic growth.\n\nTariffs, Shapiro said, are likely to be the \"biggest issue\" of the election.\n\n\"The midterms are typically decided based on the ratio of good news to bad news for the party in the White House-in this case, that party controls Congress as well, so the implication is even greater-and that news is normally dominated by economic news (2006 was affected by the Iraq War), so that bad performance of the economy (2010 involved a lack of full recovery) could lead the Republicans to lose the House decisively. And the Senate could be at risk,\" Shapiro said.\n\nHe added that Republicans will likely stay \"mostly silent\" about tariffs, as it would be risk to defend them. Democrats, meanwhile, will be crafting a message preparing for an economic downturn.\n\n\"At this point, the Republicans need to hope that any negative effect of the tariffs will be short-lived and become a distant enough memory by the midterms,\" Shapiro said.\n\nPrior to these tariffs, Democrats were already hopeful about their chances in the 2026 midterms. The party of the president typically loses seats during their midterm, giving historical precedent for a \"blue wave\" like in 2018. Overperformances in two Florida special elections and a victory in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race this week further fueled their optimism.\n\nIn addition to Paul, Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska also voted against the Canadian tariffs on Tuesday.\n\nSenator Paul wrote in a post to X: \"Tariffs don't punish foreign governments. They punish American families. When we tax imports, we raise the price of everything-from groceries to smartphones to washing machines to prescription drugs.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump, while announcing the new tariffs on Wednesday, said: \"Chronic trade deficits are a national emergency.\"\n\nDavid Hogg, vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, on X after Trump's announcement: \"I'm very excited for midterms.\"\n\nRepresentative Darren Soto, a Democrat from a potentially competitive Florida House district, on X: \"Last year, our economy was the strongest on the planet. Unemployment & inflation were low, growth & investments were high. Pres Trump wrecked it in less than 100 days due to his tariffs, deportations & chaos. He promised to fix the economy. Well the 'fix' is in ...\"\n\nA 25 percent tariff on \"all foreign-made automobiles\" will take effect on April 3. The 10 percent \"baseline\" tariffs will take effect on April 5, and the reciprocal tariffs will kick in on April 9.\n\nMarkets quickly reacted negatively to Trump's tariffs as investors braced for their impact. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3 percent within 30 minutes of opening Thursday morning.\n\nUpdate 4/3/2025, 12:59 p.m. ET: This article was updated with expert comment from Robert Y.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley , an Iowa Republican, joined Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington in introducing a bipartisan bill to rein in presidential authority over tariffs and give Congress more control over future trade duties.\n\nThe bipartisan bill comes a day after President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day,\" in which he imposed a new round of sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, reigniting debate over executive power in trade policy.\n\nSeveral Republicans , many of whom are Trump allies, have raised concerns about Trump 's tariffs, warning that they will raise prices and derail the economy. Many economists have warned that significant tariffs could spark a recession and that American consumers would end up shouldering the burden of the tariffs as importers pass on costs in the form of higher prices.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump has said that tariffs would boost domestic manufacturing, bring in revenue and restore fairness to global trade.\n\nThe bill, titled \"Trade Review Act of 2025,\" states that within 48 hours after imposing or increasing a duty, the president must submit to Congress an \"explanation of the reasoning for imposing or increasing the duty and an assessment of the potential impact of imposing or increasing the duty on United States businesses and consumers.\"\n\nBoth Cantwell and Grassley are members of the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nThe bill also states that any new tariffs will expire within 60 days unless Congress approves them. Both chambers can pass a \"joint resolution of disapproval\" to terminate the tariff before the 60-day deadline.\n\nIt comes the day after Trump levied global tariffs, which were much higher than experts had expected, leading to a significant stock market drop. On Thursday, the S&P 500 opened down over 3 percent, following declines in Asia and Europe, with other indexes also experiencing substantial losses.\n\nGrassley joins a small but vocal group of Republicans expressing skepticism about tariffs, such as Senator Rand Paul , who told Fox News on Wednesday that tariffs were a \"bad idea\" for the economy, a similar sentiment expressed by Senator Mitch McConnell , who called them \"bad policy.\" Republican Senator Thom Tillis said Thursday that he would support the bill if it advances through the Senate to a vote.\n\nOn Wednesday, Senator Susan Collins warned on the Senate floor that tariffs would hurt families in her home state of Maine, which shares a border with Canada.\n\nThe bipartisan bill follows an effort on Wednesday when a handful of Republican senators voted in favor of a measure that would effectively terminate the national emergency declaration used to green-light tariffs on Canadian imports.\n\nSenator Maria Cantwell, in a statement Thursday: \"This bill reasserts Congress's role over trade policy to ensure rules-based trade policies are transparent, consistent, and benefit the American public.\"\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley, in a statement Thursday: \"For too long, Congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch. Building on my previous efforts as Finance Committee Chairman, I'm joining Senator Cantwell to introduce the bipartisan Trade Review Act of 2025 to reassert Congress's constitutional role and ensure Congress has a voice in trade policy.\"\n\nSenator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, about the bill to NBC on Thursday: \"I like congressional review....In trade, it's a good example,\" and clarified, \"I'll support Grassley if it gets a vote.\n\nSenator Susan Collins, on the Senate floor Wednesday: \"The price hikes that will happen for Maine families-every time they go to the grocery store, they fill their gas tank, they fill their heating oil tank-if these tariffs go into effect will be so harmful. And as price hikes always do, they will hurt those the most who can afford them the least.\"\n\nCantwell spoke on the Senate floor about the bill on Thursday.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nGOP Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has indicated he could support legislation introduced by Senators Chuck Grassley and Maria Cantwell, a Republican and Democrat respectively, which would reassert congressional control over tariff policy.\n\nNewsweek contacted Senator Tillis and the White House for comment by email, along with the Republican National Committee via online inquiry, for comment on Friday outside of regular office hours.\n\nThe Republicans have a slim majority in both the Senate and House of Representatives, meaning some GOP support would be required to trim or outright overturn President Donald Trump 's tariff policy.\n\nOn Wednesday, which he dubbed Liberation Day, President Trump unveiled sweeping new tariffs on goods imported to the United States. This included a \"baseline\" tariff of 10 percent on all imports, along with what the White House said were \"discounted reciprocal tariffs\" on certain countries including 34 percent on China, 24 percent on Japan and 20 percent on the European Union .\n\nIn response on Thursday, stock markets had their worst day since the COVID pandemic , with the S&P 500 index closing down 4.84 percent while the Nasdaq fell 5.97 percent amid recession fears.\n\nOn Thursday, Grassley, from Iowa, and Cantwell, from Washington, introduced a bill that would allow Congress approve any new tariffs within 60 days of their introduction. Congress would also be able to terminate a tariff at any time.\n\nSpeaking to Politico, Tillis said he could also co-sponsor the legislation telling the publication he would \"be inclined to\" give it his backing. However even if the bill passes the Senate it is likely to struggle in the House where Speaker Mike Johnson has previously blocked votes to end the emergency declaration that underpins Trump's tariff powers. The House also passed a rule effectively preventing Democrats from forcing such a vote as part of the budget negotiations.\n\nWednesday saw four rebel Republican senators join Democrats to vote 51-48 to reject the national emergency declaration President Trump used to justify 25 percent tariffs on many Canadian imports, though this was largely symbolic as Speaker Johnson has already indicated he would move to prevent a vote in the House.\n\nThe four dissenting GOP senators were Mitch McConnell , Susan Collins, Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski.\n\nFormer Republican Senate leader McConnell said: \"Make no mistake: Goods made in America will be more expensive to manufacture and, ultimately, for consumers to purchase, with higher broad-based tariffs. At a time when Americans are tightening their belts, we would do well to avoid policies that heap on the pain. We ought to strengthen our friendships abroad, and reinforce our allies as pillars of American prosperity and security.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN about tariffs, Senator Tillis said: \"Anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right need to talk to my farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy. They don't have time. So we've got to be crisp on this implementation. Otherwise, we could do damage that's irreparable to farmers.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said: \"The Trump Tariff Tax is the largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history.\"\n\nOn his Truth Social website, Trump wrote: \"THE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING. THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE.\"\n\nAt this stage, there is little indication that Republican rebels in Congress have the numbers required, when combined with Democratic lawmakers, to take back control of tariff policy from the White House. It remains to be seen whether this will change as the economic impact of the tariffs takes effect.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJames Bickerton is a Newsweek U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is on covering news and politics in Texas, as well as other general news across the United States.

      "text": "Republican Voters Got More Socially Liberal Under Trump\n\nPolitics\n\nJesse Walker | From the October 2024 issue\n\nIn the usual liberal account, President Donald Trump reawakened America's atavistic, bigoted side, driving both the Republican Party and the United States to the right. In the usual conservative retort, it's the left that became more extreme in the 2010s, adopting radical views on race and gender that meant a moderate could seem to be moving rightward while in fact he was standing still.\n\nBut there is a third possibility: that liberals spent the decade moving leftward on questions of race and sexual orientation-and so did conservatives. And while the so-called Great Awokening has cooled somewhat since Joe Biden succeeded Trump as president, Republicans may have quietly continued to trend leftward on racial issues.\n\nTo be clear: I am speaking of public opinion here, not public officials or public policy. And I don't dispute that explicit bigots became a lot noisier in the mid-'10s, or that they acquired more influence in certain circles.\n\nBut noisier and more typical are not the same thing. In a 2020 paper for Public Opinion Quarterly , the University of Pennsylvania political scientists Daniel Hopkins and Samantha Washington reported that from 2007 through 2018, antiblack and anti-Hispanic stereotypes declined among both white Democrats and white Republicans. It's just that the Democratic drop in these surveys was much larger, creating a wider gap even though both groups, on average, were moving in the same direction.\n\n***\n\nA similar picture appeared when Ohio State political scientist Thomas Wood tried in 2017 to measure the relationship between Americans' presidential votes and how they scored on the \"symbolic racism\" or \"racial resentment\" scale, which Wood described as a way to uncover \"racial attitudes among respondents who know that it's socially unacceptable to say things perceived as racially prejudiced.\"\n\nThis scale is controversial, because some of the statements it asks people to evaluate-such as \"Over the past few years blacks have gotten less than they deserve\"-could elicit the \"wrong\" answer for reasons unrelated to prejudice or resentment. The underlying problem was highlighted when surveys found substantial numbers of African Americans endorsing the purportedly racist positions, leading some social scientists to call for giving the measurement a less loaded label. At best, the scale measures whether people attribute racial disparities to structural barriers or individual failings.\n\nBut whether or not the people who score higher on the scale are racists, it seems fair to say that the people who score lower on the scale are racial liberals. So what did Wood find?\n\nFor Wood, the big takeaway was that \"we've never seen such a clear correspondence between vote choice and racial perceptions\" in three decades of these surveys: The higher you landed in the scale, the more likely you were to vote Republican. But as Musa al-Gharbi pointed out in a critique of Wood's work for The American Sociologist , this ignored the direction those Republicans were moving in. According to Wood's own data, al-Gharbi noted, whites who backed Trump over Hillary Clinton were \" less racist than those who voted for [Mitt] Romney. The same holds among whites who voted for Clinton as compared to those who voted for [Barack] Obama.\" Again, voters in both parties were getting more racially liberal; it's just that Democrats went further.\n\nThe explicitly racist and even fascist elements of the right-the sort of people who chant antisemitic slogans while carrying tiki torches-may have gotten larger and better-known in the early Trump years. But it is one thing to be large by fringe-group standards; it is another thing entirely to be embraced by the mainstream. Indeed, al-Gharbi argued during the 2020 election that when voters associated Trump with that sort of rhetoric and behavior, it made him less rather than more popular, including among white Republicans.\n\nNeedless to say, most Republicans still tend to favor individual over structural explanations for racial disparities. But there is still plenty of variation within that worldview, including on such hot-button issues as race and policing. In June 2020, a Washington Post survey showed 53 percent of Republicans endorsing the protests that erupted after a cop murdered George Floyd-and this was after some of the protests turned into riots. Around the same time, a Pew poll showed a large minority of Republicans (40 percent) endorsing Black Lives Matter.\n\nViews on the George Floyd movement later became more polarized along partisan lines. But that initial configuration of opinions, persisting even after the street violence began, hints at how much the conventional narratives of the period miss.\n\n***\n\nThe Trump era also marked what was, at that point, the highest recorded rank-and-file Republican tolerance for gays and lesbians. In Gallup's annual polls , Republican support for same-sex marriage didn't reach 40 percent until 2016, but by 2020 it had gotten to 49 percent. It later became the majority opinion, leaping to 55 percent for the first two years of the Biden administration, though it sank back below the 50 percent mark in 2023 and 2024, probably in response to recent LGBT culture wars. (The figure currently stands at 46 percent.)\n\nMost of those culture wars center around trans people, whose political fights are currently far more contentious than the battles around gays and lesbians. Many social conservatives have tried to use those trans-rights conflicts as a wedge to reopen older debates about gay liberation; one way to read that drop in gay-marriage support from 55 percent to 46 percent is as a measure of how many Republicans have been receptive to that sort of messaging. We can't be sure whether that decline will continue or be a temporary recession. But it is notable that even now, after a two-year retrenchment, Republican support for same-sex marriage is higher than in any year before 2017.\n\nOn racial questions, there hasn't been a Republican retrenchment at all. In June, the Democracy Fund published a report on \"how attitudes about race and immigration are settling and shifting after Trump,\" drawing on surveys conducted regularly since 2016. On immigration, the authors found, both Democrats and Republicans have moved rightward since Biden took office. But when they looked at those \"racial resentment\" questions (while avoiding that dubious term), they found Democrats getting a smidge more conservative since Trump left office-and Republicans getting a smidge more liberal.\n\nThere's one more shift worth noting here. While Democrats have continued to receive a majority of the nonwhite vote, their share has been declining-even, to a small extent, among African Americans. That could just be temporary turbulence. But with Hispanics in particular seeming more open to voting Republican, we could be seeing the start of a long-term trend comparable to the movement of many \"white ethnic\" voters toward the GOP in the 1960s and '70s.\n\nNo culture war configuration is permanent. Time and again, once-vivid fights have receded, as with same-sex unions, or disappeared almost entirely, as with interracial marriage. Sometimes an alliance formed to fight one cultural conflict will be what finally buries an old one, as when conservative Catholics, Protestants, and Mormons came together to fight liberal sexual mores. And even when a fight persists, the lineups on each side can radically change . Do not be shocked if that happens again.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "How the GOP Became a (More) Multicultural Party\n\nElection 2024\n\nJesse Walker | 11.8.2024 2:38 PM\n\nIt's been decades since we last saw a winning Republican coalition as multicultural as this one. Not every vote has been counted yet and the exit polls aren't identical, but we can cobble together enough numbers now for a picture to emerge.\n\nFour years ago, according to NBC's exit polls, Hispanics favored Democrat Joe Biden over Republican Donald Trump, 65 percent to 32 percent . This year, Vice President Kamala Harris appears to have gotten just 52 percent of the Latin vote, the worst showing for a Democrat since 2004, while Trump received 46 percent, the best showing for a Republican in modern times. (Yes: Trump did better than George W. Bush , a man whose Texas training always had him outperforming most Republicans among Latino voters.) Among Hispanic men, Trump won an outright majority of 55 percent. Trump carried several heavily Mexican-American counties in South Texas that used to be Democratic strongholds, including one-Starr County-that last went Republican in 1892.\n\nNBC has Harris carrying the Asian vote, but it shifted five points to the right . African Americans are still overwhelmingly Democrats, but black men have gone from voting 13 percent Republican in 2016 to 19 percent in 2020 and now 20 percent in 2024, according to Edison Research . Overall this year, The Independent notes , about one in three nonwhite voters backed Trump.\n\nThe movement in this direction had been visible for a while-you'll note that the real bump in Trump's support among African-American men happened four years ago, not this time. But before this month, people had more room to dismiss it: to suggest that those Hispanic Republicans were mostly white Latinos, or refugees from socialist countries, or employees of the Border Patrol. This time the trend is almost impossible to ignore. Minority support for the GOP has grown, not shrunk, over the last decade. We may have to wait till the post-Trump era to find out to what extent that happened despite Donald Trump and to what extent it happened because of him. But more and more, this resembles the movement of many \"white ethnic\" constituencies-Irish, Italian, Polish, and so on-out of the New Deal coalition in the 1960s and '70s.\n\nSince Democrats often go out of their way to present themselves as the party of racial justice, many of them have a hard time making sense of this. But it shouldn't be surprising that a Korean business owner would like Republican economic policies, that a Mexican pro-lifer would like Republican abortion policies, or that a black man living in a declining Democratic city would object to the ways his town is poorly run. If the GOP weren't so prone to self-sabotage, those voters might have started shifting earlier. Nor should it be surprising if some of the people whose families have already immigrated to America are less interested in bringing in more newcomers behind them. That's a familiar dynamic in immigration politics.\n\nAbove all, it shouldn't be surprising if one of the biggest recent political developments in the U.S. (and elsewhere ) has started to seep across racial lines. Voters with college degrees have become increasingly likely to be Democrats, and those without college degrees have become increasingly likely to be Republicans. This is not, as some of the crasser interpretations would have it, because Democrats are smarter. It is because there are politically salient differences between people in professions that require college degrees and people in professions that don't: different material interests, different languages for discussing the issues that don't directly affect those interests, different cultural influences shaping those discussions. And those divisions have become more central to electoral politics.\n\nThis does not mean anything so crude as \"people who went to college are on one side of the culture wars, and people who didn't are on the other.\" There are, after all, plenty of degreeless Americans who like to have sex with people whose genitals match their own. And indeed, survey data suggest that the general population, including the Republican part of it , is more socially liberal on questions of race and sexual orientation than it was a decade ago. But there is the sort of social liberalism that is summed up by the phrase live and let live , and there is the sort summed up by a middle manager briskly strolling into a room, dropping a six-pound tome on the table, and announcing: Here are the new rules. We will email you the updates each Tuesday. To a lot of people outside that college-educated tome-dropper's social class, including some of the people the fat rulebook is theoretically there to help, that second approach looks more like micromanagement than liberation. The more Democrats are associated with it, the worse for them-and the worse for the buried live-and-let-live cause.\n\nNeedless to say, knowledge-class Republicans have countless ways to alienate people too. The number of Americans interested in listening to the ramblings of an anti-trans obsessive probably isn't much larger than the number interested in listening to a lecture on how to make punctuation more inclusive. But after years of keeping culturally or economically conservative minorities pent up in their party, the Democrats currently have more to lose.\n\nThe wildest thing about this development may be the number of the Republicans who don't seem any more capable than the Democrats of wrapping their heads around it. I still see right-wingers warning that immigration is a plot to import a blue majority. Trump's gains with minorities are not just a rebuke to all the progressives who assumed nonwhite voters would belong to them forever; they're a rebuke to all the conservatives who agreed with them.\n\nAlong those lines, let's check in with the group that loomed largest in the right-wing fears of the first two decades of this century. In the 1990s, there were some tentative moves on the right to expand the alliance of socially conservative Catholics, Protestants, Mormons, and Jews to include socially conservative Muslims as well, inching toward the day when the sorts of folks who talk about \"Judeo-Christian values\" start invoking \"Abrahamic values\" instead. 9/11 brought that effort to a crashing halt. But then the Gaza war scrambled the picture yet again, opening a space not just for protest votes against an administration funding Israel's side of the war but for Islamoconservatives to rethink their alliances on a deeper level.\n\nThere hasn't been a clear-cut nationwide Muslim movement toward Trump, who isn't exactly a Gaza dove himself; the data we have so far on the Muslim vote is contradictory, with different organizations offering different tentative results . But we can see how people cast their ballots in the two Michigan towns that in the 2010s were most likely to send SHARIA LAW IS COMING TO THE U.S.!!! stories rippling through the right-wing press. In Hamtramck, America's first majority-Muslim city, Harris just barely squeaked by Trump, 46 percent to 43 percent, with 9 percent backing the Green Party's Jill Stein. (One of Trump's supporters in Hamtramck was Mayor Ameer Ghalib, who endorsed him in September.) In nearby Dearborn-America's first majority- Arab city, though not all of those Arabs are Muslims-Trump won outright : He got 42 percent and Harris got 36 percent. A full 18 percent voted for Stein, a Jew picking up Islamic support like she was Evan McMullin among the Mormons .\n\nDepending on what happens next in the Middle East, it's not hard to imagine a future where a lot of those Muslim votes move back into the Democratic column. But it's also not that hard to imagine a future where the next SHARIA LAW IS COMING TO THE U.S.!!! screed appears on the Occupy Democrats Facebook feed. Me, I'll hope for a future where neither major party thinks of minority voters as either something to take for granted or a no-go zone.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The 10 Worst Republican Budget Gimmicks\n\nGovernment Spending\n\nJessica Riedl | 3.13.2025 3:16 PM\n\nBeing an elected Republican today means navigating a fundamental contradiction: Voters love bold spending cuts in theory but hate them in practice. Surveys have long shown that Americans want deficit reduction and a smaller government . \"Washington spends too much money\" is one of the easiest applause lines in politics. But when asked about specific programs-Social Security, Medicare, defense, veterans' benefits, infrastructure, education, border security, the safety net, and nearly every other federal budget item except, perhaps, the 1 percent of total spending going to foreign aid and NASA-the electorate demands even more spending. Across the spectrum, voters prefer to talk like Sen. Barry Goldwater and spend like LBJ.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers handle the voter contradictions by emphasizing their support for expanding popular programs and vaguely hinting that taxing the rich can pay for it all ( it cannot ). Republicans, by contrast, square the circle with budget gimmicks. They make grand pledges to balance the budget within a decade and push for popular budget rules to create the illusion of spending restraint. Then GOP lawmakers simply ignore their own rules and continue spending and borrowing as usual. The current budget and tax debates have become a festival of gimmicks-here are the GOP's 10 most egregious ploys:\n\nThe purpose of these budget gimmicks is for Republican presidents and lawmakers to look tough on spending and deficits without actually doing anything substantive to save taxpayer dollars. Republican voters get the illusion of deep spending and deficit reductions without anyone seeing painful tax increases or benefit losses. In a world of busy lives and short attention spans, it is not difficult for lawmakers to fool voters into believing deficits are being reduced.\n\nBut the economy will not be fooled. Congress can manipulate baselines, set fake expiration dates, and ignore their own budget rules-but they can't repeal the laws of economics or math. Deficits will continue to rise-from $1.8 trillion today to a projected $3.6 trillion in a decade. Another $25 trillion in 10-year borrowing will push interest rates higher and bury the budget under trillions in interest costs . And, perhaps most dire, the bond market will not be fooled. At some point between the national debt's current level of $30 trillion and the 30-year projected level of nearly $200 trillion (!), the bond market will likely tap out and stop lending money to Washington at plausible interest rates, triggering a possible debt crisis. When that happens, we may discover that all this time we were only fooling ourselves.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Republicans pounce\n\nThe phrase \"Republicans pounce\" (or related phrases, such as \"conservatives pounce\" or \"seize\" ) is a term used by some conservative commentators in the United States to illustrate media bias against Republicans and conservatives . These commentators have argued that journalists downplay controversies and potentially negative stories about Democrats , liberals , and progressives by emphasizing the Republican or conservative response, rather than the negative aspects of the stories themselves. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]\n\nAnalyses of U.S. news stories have shown that the \"pounces\" phrasing is used with roughly equal frequency to refer to Republicans and Democrats, while acknowledging the difficulty of measuring the phenomenon qualitatively. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]\n\nAccording to an analysis by Washington Post reporter Aaron Blake, the use of the \"pounce\" framing \"appears to be pretty bipartisan in its implementation.\" Searching U.S. newspapers and wire services between 2010 and 2019, Blake found 1,732 instances of Democrats or liberals \"pouncing,\" versus 1,427 instances of Republicans or conservatives doing the same. However, he cautioned that this approach had several limitations: it did not survey cable news ; it did not include similar verbs such as \"seize on\"; and it did not assess the severity of the controversy being \"pounced\" upon. [ 1 ]\n\nWall Street Journal editor James Freeman describes the term as a \"long-running joke among right-leading media skeptics\", but found little evidence to back it up. In a 2019 search of the Factiva news archive, he discovered 311 occurrences of the phrasing \"Democrats pounce,\" compared with 245 occurrences of \"Republicans pounce.\" While this suggested that the framing has been applied more toward Democrats, Freeman acknowledged that the phenomenon was \"difficult to measure qualitatively.\" [ 2 ]\n\nBlake identifies a 1933 New York Times article \"Revived Republicans Pounce on Democrats\" as one of the first occurrences of this phrasing in print, but says that the overwhelming majority of \"Republicans pounce\" headlines in the Times or The Washington Post have been printed in the 21st century. [ 1 ]\n\nAfter Harvard University president Claudine Gay resigned in the wake of plagiarism allegations, the Associated Press ' headline called plagiarism a \"new conservative weapon against colleges\". Conservatives criticized the AP's coverage as a case of media bias. [ 3 ] Washington Examiner editor Quin Hillyer called the AP's story a \"perfect example\" of the \"Republicans pounce\" phenomenon. [ 5 ]\n\nThe National Post has associated the phenomenon, along with other instances of \"unconscious bias\" among journalists, with the decline of public trust in the mainstream news media. [ 3 ]\n\nJames Freeman discussed the construction in the context of the 2019 New York Times article \" Ocasio-Cortez Team Flubs a Green New Deal Summary, and Republicans Pounce\". [ 2 ] Commentary writer Noah Rothman argues that the \"Republicans pounce\" construction benefits Democrats, using the 2015 story \"Republicans seize on Planned Parenthood video \" in The Hill as an example. [ 6 ] Washington Examiner editor Nicholas Clairmont says that the use of the \"Republicans pounce\" trope is a form of \" othering \" by journalists, although not necessarily deliberate or inaccurate. [ 7 ]\n\nNational Review political correspondent Jim Geraghty has criticized \"Republicans pounce\" headlines for contributing to political polarization, saying that such headlines give the public a \"psychological permission slip\" to ignore legitimate issues or scandals based on who is criticizing them. [ 8 ] Another National Review writer, Charles C. W. Cooke , linked \"Republicans pounce\" to media coverage suggesting that Republican politicians are engaging in \" culture wars .\" [ 9 ]\n\nMother Jones writer Kevin Drum said that the claims Republicans made about the term were difficult to prove. He observed that only limited conclusions can be drawn from simple keyword searches, writing: \"What we really need to know is whether Republicans suffer more than Democrats from a general framing that focuses on the opposition response instead of the initial miscue.\" [ 10 ]"

      "text": "Why the New Republican Platform Is Moderate on Abortion\n\nAbortion\n\nElizabeth Nolan Brown | 7.17.2024 11:59 AM\n\nThe Republican Party has changed its official platform on abortion, taking a less extreme position that reflects both former President Donald Trump's statements on the issue and the new political realities.\n\nPreviously, the platform called for constitutional changes that would ban abortion nationwide. Now, it says the matter should be left to the states.\n\nRepublican National Convention (RNC) delegates approved the amended platform on Monday.\n\nYou are reading Sex & Tech , from Elizabeth Nolan Brown. Get more of Elizabeth's sex, tech, bodily autonomy, law, and online culture coverage.\n\nΔ\n\nThe change is interesting for what it says about the shifting politics of abortion in America. A majority of Americans are pretty moderate on this issue, believing neither in abortion without any limits nor in total bans.\n\nExtremist positions on abortion-popular among a segment of the GOP base-were OK so long as Roe governed U.S. abortion laws and total bans had no chance of becoming reality. But in the past two years, since the Supreme Court overturned Roe and some states have enacted strict abortion bans, it's become clear that absolutist positions on abortion are not an election-winning strategy. And we've begun to see some Republican rhetoric change to reflect this.\n\n\"The word 'abortion' appeared 35 times in the 2016 Republican platform . It only appears one time in [the 2024] document,\" notes CNN.\n\nThe GOP's new abortion plank certainly isn't pro-choice by any means. But it does express support for the idea that abortion laws should be determined by the people of each state, and it also endorses policies that advance access to birth control and fertility treatments.\n\nThat last bit seems deliberately intended to assuage fears-and counter Democratic claims-that Republicans want to go after contraception and in vitro fertilization, too.\n\nThe word abortion first appeared in the Republican Party platform in 1976, according to The Washington Post .\n\n\"The question of abortion is one of the most difficult and controversial of our time,\" the platform said back then. Abortion \"is undoubtedly a moral and personal issue\" on which Republicans may disagree, it noted, calling for \"a continuance of the public dialogue on abortion.\"\n\nNonetheless, the '76 platform also professed support for \"the efforts of those who seek enactment of a constitutional amendment to restore protection of the right to life for unborn children.\"\n\nSimilar language regarding a constitutional amendment remained in the party platform for decades.\n\nThe 2016 platform asserted that \"the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed\" and called for \"a human life amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to children before birth.\"\n\nThe party did not adopt a new platform in 2020 because of the pandemic.\n\nHere is the 2024 abortion plan in full:\n\nWe proudly stand for families and Life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights. After 51 yers, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People. We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\n\nThis new platform \"still includes language that links abortion to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, leaving open a path to legislation or court decisions that would grant fetuses additional legal rights,\" notes The Washington Post .\n\nBesides, party platform language is in no way binding.\n\nNonetheless, the platform change seems to signal a shift away from embracing one-size-fits-all abortion laws nationwide. That's good news for supporters of reproductive freedom and believers in state's rights.\n\nTrump was reportedly \"heavily involved\" in the party's platform on abortion changing.\n\nTrump himself has shifted his position on abortion over the years. In 1999, he said that while he hated \"the concept of abortion,\" he was \"very pro-choice.\" By 2011, he was calling himself pro-life. And in 2017, he said he strongly supported a 20-week abortion ban nationwide.\n\nBut after the Supreme Court overturned Roe , Trump called it a decision that would \"work out for everybody,\" since it \"brings everything back to the states, where it has always belonged.\" In 2023, he criticized the way abortion was \"poorly handled\" by Republicans who didn't favor exceptions to bans. And, in April, he again suggested it was good that \"the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both.\"\n\nWhether Trump's more recent statements reflect his personal values or a political calculation is anyone's guess. Ultimately, it doesn't really matter. The GOP is the Trump Party now-where he stands tends to be where the party stands. And where he stands seems to be in personal opposition to abortion but slightly less willing than some members of his party to impose that view on everyone.\n\nBecause Trump is such an idiosyncratic political figure, the remaking of the Republican Party in his image tends to be a mixed bag. There aren't a lot of pure bright spots for fans of freedom, to be sure. But every now and then, the faintest glimmer of libertarianism slips in.\n\nAt the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week, reactions to the abortion platform shift have been predictably mixed.\n\n\"Delegates repeatedly [said] they agreed with the change,\" reports Axios :\n\nAxios spoke to 10 delegates from various states on the first night of the RNC.\n\nMeanwhile, \"anti-abortion protesters demonstrating Monday outside the Republican National Convention said they felt out-of-step with the party and former President Donald Trump,\" notes the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel .\n\n\"The national Republican Party, the RNC and the president ought not to take the pro-life base for granted,\" said Matt Sande, legislative director for Pro-Life Wisconsin, who was among those who rallied near Haymarket Square Park in downtown Milwaukee.\n\n• We're looking at four more years of anti-tech antics from the Federal Trade Commission no matter who wins this November.\n\n• Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on the Department of Justice lawsuit against Apple : It's \"not actually about protecting consumers\" but \"a thinly veiled attempt to accomplish through litigation what Democrats could not get done through legislation.\"\n\n• Arkansans for Limited Government is suing over the state's rejection of the abortion rights amendment the group is trying to get on the November ballot.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Republicans Have Completely Abandoned Criminal Justice Reform\n\nElection 2024\n\nJoe Lancaster | 7.17.2024 11:15 AM\n\nThe Republican Party wants you to be afraid. Very, very afraid.\n\nUnder former President Donald Trump, the party is playing up fears of violent crime, even as crime rates have fallen from their pandemic-era spike. And in the process, it is abandoning the modest yet meaningful moves toward criminal justice reform it made in recent years.\n\nThis much was clear on the second night of the 2024 Republican National Convention (RNC), whose theme was \"Make America Safe Again.\" Several of the presenters spoke of the need to get tough on crime.\n\n\"We are experiencing a plague of crime across America,\" said retired police Lieutenant Randy Sutton. \"It's all made America more dangerous than ever before.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis charged that Democrats, like President Joe Biden, \"have unleashed progressive prosecutors across our nation who care more about coddling criminals than about protecting their own communities.\"\n\nIf Trump's choice of running mate signaled how thoroughly he has bent the GOP's economic policy to his will, Tuesday night at the convention provided an unfortunate indication of how thoroughly the party platform has abandoned any prospect of criminal justice reform.\n\nTrump accepted his party's nomination the first time, in 2016, during what he called \"a moment of crisis for our nation.\"\n\n\"The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life,\" he warned. \"Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.\" He detailed frightening statistics from big cities: murder rates up 50 percent in Washington, D.C., and up 60 percent in Baltimore; more than 2,000 victims of gun violence in Chicago in the previous year alone.\n\n\"The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities,\" Trump pledged. \"In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.\"\n\nTrump conveyed similar fears at the 2020 convention, held amid the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide racial-justice protests. \"Your vote will decide whether we protect law abiding Americans, or whether we give free reign to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten our citizens,\" he said.\n\nIn each case, the message was clear: Violent criminals lurk around every corner, and only by voting Republican can we hold back the deadly hordes.\n\nOf course, that wasn't quite true in either year: While murders in the 30 largest U.S. cities rose by more than 13 percent in 2015, a study by the Brennan Center for Justice found that \" half of that change occurred in just three cities\"-Trump's cherry-picked examples of Baltimore, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. \"Murder nationally is still similar to what it was in 2012, at historic lows.\"\n\nAnd while 2020 did see a nationwide spike in violent crime amid summer protests, murder rates fell precipitously in 2023, and preliminary data for the beginning of 2024 suggests that overall violent crime has continued falling and may again hit record lows by the end of the year.\n\nBut ginning up fears of violent crime was key to Trump's-and by extension, his party's-pitch to America. In his inaugural address , he warned of \"the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives\" and pledged, \"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\"\n\nThis was an unfortunate break with the party's platform in recent years, when the GOP at least feinted toward less punitive criminal justice policies.\n\n\"While getting criminals off the street is essential, more attention must be paid to the process of restoring those individuals to the community,\" read the 2012 Republican Party Platform . \"Prisons should do more than punish; they should attempt to rehabilitate and institute proven prisoner reentry systems to reduce recidivism and future victimization.\"\n\nWhile the 2012 platform still advocated punitive punishments for certain crimes-including the death penalty for capital murder, \"mandatory prison time for all assaults involving serious injury to law enforcement officers,\" and \"a national registry for convicted child murderers\"-it also hinted at alternatives. The party praised \"faithbased institutions that have proven track records in diverting young and first time, non-violent offenders from criminal careers,\" and said that governments should emulate these groups' \"emphasis on restorative justice, to make the victim whole and put the offender on the right path.\"\n\nEven in 2016, when the GOP first nominated Trump, its platform praised \"the Republican Governors and legislators who have been implementing criminal justice reforms like those proposed by our 2012 platform.\" (Of course, the party did not draft a new platform in 2020, simply carrying over the 2016 document unaltered.)\n\nAs president, Trump even signed the FIRST STEP Act , which accomplished many laudable goals , like reducing mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug crimes and allowing federal inmates to accumulate more credits toward early release. In the law's first year, thousands of people left federal prison early as a result of shortened sentences.\n\nBut then the effort stalled. While Trump bragged about signing the FIRST STEP Act and ran ads in 2020 touting his ability to accomplish criminal justice reforms, he had soured on the law by the end of his term. By the time he announced his bid for reelection in 2022, Trump had stopped talking about the bill altogether and was calling for anyone \"caught selling drugs, to receive the death penalty.\" Some Republican-led states that implemented reforms are now repealing them , even in places where the measures were successful.\n\nThe FIRST STEP Act was not only one of the most successful reform initiatives in recent years, but it represented a truly bipartisan effort-progressive activist Van Jones still brags about working with Republicans to get it passed-but it became verboten in GOP circles.\n\nThe 2024 GOP platform makes no mention of criminal justice reform and instead pledges to \"restore law and order,\" \"stand up to Marxist Prosecutors,\" and \"restore safety in our neighborhoods by replenishing Police Departments, restoring Common Sense Policing, and protecting Officers from frivolous lawsuits\"-presumably a reference to Trump's stated pledge to give cops \"immunity from prosecution.\"\n\nOn the second night of the RNC, with immigration and crime as its theme, speakers stuck to the party line: Many presenters spoke of immigration and crime as if they are inextricably linked, and nobody mentioned criminal justice reform, other than one mention of \"comprehensive prison reform\" by Republican National Committee co-Chair Lara Trump as one of Trump's first-term accomplishments.\n\nIt's a shame that on an issue like paring back the needlessly punitive aspects of the criminal justice system-on which Republicans and Democrats broadly agreed with one another very recently-the GOP has completely turned its back.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Confidence in federal civil servants remains far lower among Republicans than Democrats\n\nNumbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World\n\nRead our research on:\n\nFull Topic List\n\nRead Our Research On:\n\n|\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have long held very different views of federal \"career employees\" - the civil servants who work for government agencies or departments and do not change with administrations. That continues to be the case today: Most Democrats have high levels of confidence in the federal workforce, while most Republicans do not.\n\nThe Trump administration has made reducing the size of this workforce - through its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team in particular - one of its top priorities .\n\nPew Research Center conducted this survey to assess Americans' views of career civil servants, presidential appointees, and federal and state relations. We surveyed 5,086 U.S. adults from Jan. 27 to Feb. 2, 2025.\n\nEveryone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP's methodology .\n\nHere are the questions used for this analysis , along with responses , and its methodology .\n\nOverall, a slim majority of Americans (55%) express a great deal or fair amount of confidence in federal career employees, while 44% have little or no confidence, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Jan. 27-Feb. 2. But the already wide partisan divide in these views has continued to grow:\n\nConservative Republicans, in particular, have little confidence in the federal civil service: 30% now have at least a fair amount of confidence, while 70% have little to no confidence. By contrast, moderate and liberal Republicans are more divided: 51% have at least a fair amount of confidence in civil servants, while 48% don't have much confidence in them.\n\nLarge majorities of both liberal Democrats (77%) and conservative and moderate Democrats (69%) have at least a fair amount of confidence in civil servants.\n\nRelated: What the data says about federal workers\n\nIn addition to career employees, presidents appoint officials to oversee government agencies. Partisan confidence in these officials generally tracks with the party holding the White House.\n\nToday, 71% of Republicans say they have at least a fair amount of confidence in presidential appointees. In 2018, during the first Trump administration, 60% of Republicans expressed confidence in presidential appointees. But in 2022 - when Democrat Joe Biden was president - just 21% of Republicans said they had confidence in presidential appointees.\n\nAmong Democrats, 22% currently say they have a great deal or a fair amount of confidence in presidential appointees. This is slightly lower than the 28% who expressed confidence in 2018 during the first Trump administration. In 2022, when Biden was president, 54% of Democrats said they had confidence in presidential appointees.\n\nAmericans' views about the relationship between the state and federal governments have also shifted somewhat with the change in administration.\n\nConcerns about states' willingness to work with the federal government\n\nToday, 40% of Republicans and 34% of Democrats say they are extremely or very concerned about states not being willing enough to work with the federal government. These views have shifted since the Biden administration, with Republicans and Democrats moving in opposite directions. In 2023, 27% of Republicans and 54% of Democrats expressed these concerns.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have also moved in opposite directions when it comes to concern about the federal government setting policies on issues that may be better left to state governments. Today, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say they are extremely or very concerned about this (46% vs. 30%).\n\nIn 2023, we asked a similar question: \"How concerned are you that the federal government is doing too much on issues better left to state governments?\" At that time, Republicans were far more likely than Democrats to express concern (62% vs. 22%).\n\nConcerns that rights and protections may differ across states\n\nDemocrats continue to be more concerned than Republicans that the rights and protections a person has might differ by state. Today, 66% of Democrats say they are extremely or very concerned about this, compared with 27% of Republicans.\n\nDemocrats' level of concern is relatively unchanged from 2023. In contrast, Republicans' level of concern has decreased by 12 points.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis , along with responses , and its methodology .\n\nTopics\n\nTed Van Green is a research analyst focusing on U.S. politics and policy at Pew Research Center .\n\n901 E St. NW, Suite 300 Washington, DC 20004 USA (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main (+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries\n\nABOUT PEW RESEARCH CENTER Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan, nonadvocacy fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

We have serious problems, namely a fast-growing debt and a need to extend some tax cuts in an unforgiving environment where interest rates are high and inflation is rising again. Unfortunately, despite a new mandate, House Republicans have yet to rise to the occasion. Their latest budget blueprint shows that fiscal responsibility vanishes the moment real choices arise.\n\nAs a reminder, government debt stands at 100 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). It will grow to 117 percent by 2034 if the tax cuts are allowed to expire as scheduled this year. It was 76.5 percent when the cuts were first passed in 2017.\n\nFor those wondering why deficits and debt have accumulated so much, here are some more numbers. According to Center for a Free Economy President Ryan Ellis, since 2017, tax revenues have grown by 58 percent, while spending has grown by 75 percent. These hikes weren't driven by inflation alone, which was 31 percent cumulatively over the period.* As Ellis rightly notes, we can't blame taxpayers. The fault lies squarely with politicians' spending incontinence.\n\nEnter the House Republican budget blueprint for a \"big beautiful bill\" as requested by the president. As the Committee for a Responsible Budget explains , \"the budget resolution's instructions include a net $3.3 trillion in allowable deficit increases-or nearly $4 trillion including interest in additional debt by 2034.\" It also raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.\n\nBasically, we're talking about offsetting as much as $4.8 trillion-mostly for tax cut extensions-with only $1.5 trillion in supposed spending reductions. The plan projects that additional tax revenue from economic growth will temper the debt impact.\n\nWhile I've touted the potential for some tax cut extensions to boost economic growth, this is a case of wishful thinking by Republicans. In part, it's because the plan relies on the same kinds of budget gimmicks and unrealistic assumptions we've seen before, like counting on Congress to deliver on large future spending cuts to discretionary spending and Medicaid.\n\nIt's not as if there isn't lots to cut-there is, especially considering the unhinged government expansions of the last four years-but it remains politically tough. As the Manhattan Institute's Jessica Riedl notes, achieving the assumed level of cuts in the plan would require Congress to deliver the lowest discretionary spending share of GDP since the 1930s while simultaneously increasing defense and border security spending. Why would we expect Congress to have the stomach for that?\n\nMany Republicans are putting their faith in Elon Musk's cost cutting, but it's not enough . Much of what needs to happen requires Congress, which apparently prefers to once again kick the can down the road.\n\nThe blueprint makes other questionable assumptions. I doubt we'll find $2.6 trillion in extra revenue from a highly improbable 2.8 percent annual GDP growth rate, considering the approximately 1.8 percent growth baseline.\n\nYes, extending the provision allowing businesses to quickly and fully deduct the cost of their investments would have a powerful, positive impact on growth. However, many of the other tax provisions have little growth oomph.\n\nIn addition, there are plenty of headwinds that will hamper growth, such as the increase of the debt itself and the uncertainty created by a president who spends his time threatening trading partners with ever more tariffs.\n\nThere's real risk that inflation may pick up again, in part because previous fiscal decadence has led to enormous interest payments on the debt, which has serious ripple effects. If Republicans decide to extend taxes without any concern for adding to the debt, they will contribute to the problem.\n\nAnd indeed, it looks like that's what they are setting out to do. The saddest part is that this version of the plan will be better than whatever bargained budget congressional Republicans can get across the finish line-especially after caving to those who want to eliminate revenue savers from the 2017 tax reform, such as the limits put on the state and local tax deduction.\n\nI get it: Governing is hard, so legislators tout savings and revenue that may never materialize. But glossy narratives do nothing to fix the nation's daunting debt trajectory, and budgets like this latest one push us closer to crisis. Without difficult structural reforms, debt will continue to mount, forcing harsher choices later.\n\nTo capitalize on their opportunity, Republicans must confront reality. So stop the charade and cut both discretionary spending and the growth of runaway entitlement spending. And cut any unfair tax loopholes that prevent us from paying for a slightly more modest government.\n\n* CORRECTION: The original version of this article misstated the rate of cumulative inflation since 2017.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nStart your day with Reason .

NewsNation will also have analytical coverage anchored by the former CNN host Chris Cuomo for two hours before and two hours after the event, and will then rebroadcast the debate from midnight to 2 a.m. Eastern.\n\nIn the Eastern and Central time zones, it will be broadcast live on the CW, in a slot more commonly occupied by magic shows and \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\" In the Mountain and Pacific time zones, it will be broadcast on local CW affiliates; check your local listings to confirm the time.\n\nAn audio feed will be available on SiriusXM's Channel 111, also known as Triumph.\n\nIt will also be streamed live on Rumble.\n\nOnly four candidates met the Republican National Committee's more stringent criteria:\n\nChris Christie , a former governor of New Jersey.\n\nRon DeSantis , the governor of Florida.\n\nNikki Haley , a former governor of South Carolina and former United Nations ambassador.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy , an entrepreneur.\n\nThey had to have at least 80,000 unique donors - up from 70,000 for the third debate in November - and to reach 6 percent support either in two national polls or in one national poll and polls of two states with early primaries.\n\nHe is skipping the debate, as he did the first three. (Though he easily meets the polling and donor criteria, he technically hasn't qualified because he has refused to sign a pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee.)\n\nUnlike the first three times, he will not be doing any public counterprogramming. Instead, he will attend a fund-raiser in Florida for a super PAC called MAGA Inc.\n\nThe moderators will be Megyn Kelly, a former Fox News host turned radio talk-show host; Eliana Johnson, the editor in chief of The Free Beacon; and Elizabeth Vargas, a NewsNation anchor.\n\nMaggie Astor covers politics for The New York Times, focusing on breaking news, policies, campaigns and how underrepresented or marginalized groups are affected by political systems.\n\nAdvertisement"
