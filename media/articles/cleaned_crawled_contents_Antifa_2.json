      "text": "Here are 5 key facts about antifa that Trump and right-wing media are painfully unaware of\n\nDuring the George Floyd protests, President Donald Trump and his allies in the right-wing media - including Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson at Fox News - have been obsessed with the Antifa movement, claiming that its activists were a major source of violence at the protests.\n\nBut when it comes to Antifa, hysteria often takes a back seat to facts in Trump's administration and the right-wing media. Here are four key facts about the Antifa movement.\n\n1. Hannity claimed that \"armed volunteers of Antifa\" have established a \"cop-free zone and taken over precincts\" in Seattle.\n\nCNN's Oliver Darcy has debunked Hannity's claims, noting that \"according to the Seattle mayor's office, city officials haven't seen any evidence to indicate armed members of Antifa are even on the ground.\" Lori Patrick, a spokesperson for the Seattle mayor's office, told CNN that while police heard some reports of \"armed individuals at demonstrations,\" it was unclear what their affiliation was. In other words, there was no evidence to suggest the Antifa takeover of Seattle that Hannity claimed was taking place.\n\nDarcy's piece explained that the events in Seattle have been wildly mischaracterized by the right:\n\n2. Antifa is controversial on the left\n\nWhile the right-wing media resort to hysterical fear-mongering about Antifa, liberal and progressive media outlets have made an effort to have a reasonable discussion about the movement. Antifa, even on the left, are controversial: author Noam Chomsky and journalist Chris Hedges have been highly critical of Antifa's more militant rhetoric and tactics - which, Chomsky has warned, can be used by the far right to demonize the left. Hedges, meanwhile, debated California-based activist Michael McBride on Antifa's tactics in 2017. Hedges and McBride are both left-of-center politically, but they have expressed different views on Antifa.\n\nActivist Cornel West has defended Antifa, asserting that Antifa activists saved him from being physically harmed at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017. So, the left is hardly monolithic when it comes to views on Antifa.\n\n3. Antifa is not an organization as Trump has claimed\n\nTrump recently tweeted that \"the United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,\" but in fact, Antifa is not an organization, but rather, a movement and an ideology . An actual political organization such as the NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union or the National Organization for Women has a structure and a hierarchy, whereas Antifa is not organized in that way. In other words, someone who identifies as part of Antifa in Boston might have different views from someone who identifies as Antifa (which stands for anti-fascist) in Milan, Italy or Oslo, Norway.\n\nChomsky explained, \"Antifa is very far from a structured organization. It is largely a collection of people disturbed about the ugly and ominous forces that have broken into the public arena with particular venom since Trump removed the cork from the bottle.\"\n\n4. Antifa, for all their militant rhetoric, do not resort to terrorist tactics\n\nTerrorists, which could be anyone from al-Qaeda and ISIS (Islamic State, Iraq and Syria) to the Ku Klux Klan, make a point of killing or harming people in order to further their goals - for example, the KKK bombing the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963 or al-Qaeda flying hijacked planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. Terrorists, in fact, resort to murder and acts of extreme violence because their goal is to terrorize. By that standard, it's ludicrous to claim that Antifa fit the definition of terrorists.\n\nAntifa activists have been criticized on the left and the right for taking part in the \"punch a Nazi\" campaign , but full-fledged terrorist tactics like blowing up churches or setting off bombs on public transportation is not how Antifa operates.\n\n5. Antifa is not the same as the Black Bloc anarchists\n\nThe far-right often lumps Antifa and Black Bloc anarchists together, but in fact, they are two separate movements. A video by the Los Angeles Times outlines the differences between the two, noting that Antifa \"opposes white supremacy, patriarchy and capitalism\" - while Black Bloc \"says it battles police brutality, corporate greed, immigration bans and the erosion of civil liberties.\"\n\nBlack Bloc's rhetoric tends to be anti-corporate but not necessarily anti-capitalist; Antifa's rhetoric is often disdainful of capitalism. Some Antifa activists have identified as anarchists, but many consider themselves socialists."

      "text": "Here's the real reason so many on the right are terrified of antifa\n\nWith his tweet suggesting that Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old man who was violently shoved to the ground by Buffalo police during a protest last week, may have been an antifa super-ninja, Trump's ooga-booga about anti-fascist activists descended into farce. And he isn't alone. Locals on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state terrorized a multiracial family of four who were just out for a nice camping trip because they decided they were antifa activists. The Verge reports that \"mythical buses full of bloodthirsty antifa protesters are causing panic in rural counties throughout the country,\" leading small towns to board up shop windows and shut down their main streets. And this week, the Turkish regime under Recep Erdoğan blamed the Kurdistan Workers Party for training antifa units to commit acts of violence in the United States.\n\nThe reality, as you may know if you're not a Fox News fan, is that while there are some local organized antifa groups, antifa is a philosophy, and a loose network of activists, rather than an organization. In its current iteration in the US, the movement arose from the punk scene, and some antifa activists engage in street fights with the Proud Boys and similar far-right groups. There has long been a debate on the left about the utility of those tactics (which I've written about ).\n\nBut one thing that many mainstream commenters don't acknowledge is that most antifa activism has nothing to do with physical confrontation. As Caroline Orr wrote at Medium, \"antifascist activity is incredibly diverse, encompassing everything from journalism , developing educational materials , and writing protest songs , to infiltrating far-right extremist groups and subverting them from within .\"\n\nIt's that last part that is so infuriating to the right. Many anti-fascist activists, whether or not they identify as such, do their work from behind a keyboard. They're basically online sleuths, who scour the fever swamps of the internet, try to identify anonymous members of extremist groups and expose them.\n\nThe point is to attach professional and social costs to membership in white supremacist, neo-Nazi and similar organizations. Whenever you read about a cop or schoolteacher being fired or a service member being discharged from the military for being affiliated with far-right groups, or for abhorrent expressions of racism or homophobia or antisemitism, an anti-fascist probably brought those activities to light. (Reasonable people can debate the ethics of \"doxxing,\" which is a tactic that can be turned against anyone.)\n\nWhile conservatives are obviously engaging in some ridiculous fear-mongering about hordes of bloodthirsty antifa rioters to delegitimize the Black Lives Matter protests sweeping the country and to distract from Trump's many miserable failures, there's more to it than that. For years, many on the right--including mainstream conservatives--have embraced the idea that freedom of speech includes the freedom from facing any consequences for offensive speech. The First Amendment, in their formulation, doesn't just constrain the government from punishing people for expressing their views. It should also prevent people from being fired by their employers, businesses from being boycotted and writers and artists from losing their perches.\n\nJust last week, for example, there was widespread outrage on the right when Andrew Sullivan, who has a long history of offering inflammatory takes on race, revealed that NY Magazine wouldn't publish a column on the George Floyd protests and that his writings on these issue would receive extra scrutiny by the magazine's editors going forward. The New York Post was one of many conservative publications to characterize what was a routine editorial decision as \"censorship.\"\n\nSome antifa activists have committed acts of vandalism and bloodied some noses of far-right goons. They've made what many see as tactical errors at times. Most tend to play the media relations game poorly, and some have assaulted the wrong targets.\n\nBut they have also decimated the alt-right--the less extreme version of more hardcore fascist groups--by making it hard to be a member without one's neighbors and employers finding out about it. And that's what many on the right really find so terrifying."

      "text": "What Is Antifa, Really?\n\nThe Charlottesville white supremacist rally left one woman dead, dozens injured and a country grappling with questions about how such a thing could happen on the streets of a supposedly liberal college town. Adding media insult to national injury, the tragedy inspired a festival of false equivalency from pundits on both sides of the aisle, who considered the anti-fascist or Antifa counterprotesters just as bad as those chanting \"blood and soil.\"\n\nMarc A. Thiessen wrote in the Washington Post that \"Neo-Nazis are the violent advocates of a murderous ideology that killed 25 million people last century. Antifa members are the violent advocates of a murderous ideology that, according to 'The Black Book of Communism,' killed between 85 million and 100 million people last century.\"\n\nAntifa groups have been misunderstood , condemned for being violent and mischaracterized as a centralized group with membership cards and a headquarters. In reality, Antifa is a label, used by those following a guiding principle oriented against all forms of fascism, racism and white supremacy.\n\nTo clear up some of the confusion, AlterNet spoke with Mark Bray, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook . We discussed the origins of anti-fascism, the fight against Donald Trump and the far right, and the huge commitment people make to be part of the Antifa movement.\n\nThe interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nIlana Novick: How you would define Antifa?\n\nMark Bray: Antifa is, of course, short for anti-fascism. But it really is a shorthand for a specific tendency that in English is usually referred to as militant anti-fascism. Militant anti-fascism is essentially a pan-radical-left politic of direct action against the far right.\n\nIN: Is it more of a tactic or a guiding principle, rather than a specific movement that someone can join?\n\nMB: Think about it like socialism. Is socialism something that someone can join? No, it's a politic. But are there socialist groups you can join? Yeah. Same with Antifa. Antifa is either an activity or a mode of politics, depending on exactly what kind of phrasing you prefer. In that sense, anyone can make their own Antifa group. There is no Antifa central command, but there are Antifa groups with membership that you could join. Or you could make your own group.\n\nIn that way, it's no one group, but there are groups.\n\nIN: In your book, you trace Antifa principles to post-World War II Europe. Can you talk about how that started and why?\n\nMB: Sure. It's a slightly different conversation if you talk about the U.K. versus continental Europe, in part because in continental Europe, many of the governments that emerged out of the ashes of World War II established themselves as officially anti-fascist institutions. In that sense, their solution for stopping a rebirth of fascism, or Nazism, was to make it illegal. Laws were passed against Nazi or fascist politics. That was an official governmental anti-fascism.\n\nDecades later, really in the '80s and '90s, when you get a neo-Nazi skinhead movement, militant anti-fascism in continental Europe emerged as an alternative vision of anti-fascism that rejected turning to the state or the police, or legislation to stop the far right, but advocated for direct action from below. In that sense, it was sort of a contestation within continental Europe over what anti-fascism really means.\n\nIn Britain, it's a different conversation, because right after World War II, the government essentially allowed a lot more leeway for fascism far-right groups to reestablish themselves. In that sense, the militant anti-fascist resumes right again in 1946, and continues onward. Whereas in continental Europe, the importance of anti-fascism, in a real and literal sense, does not really reemerge until the '80s.\n\nIN: What, if anything, sets American anti-fascism apart from its European counterpart?\n\nMB: Part of it is a question of defining terms, of course. If you want to think of anti-fascism or opposition to white supremacy in a wider lens, of course, you can go back to opposition to the KKK. It can stretch far back. But if we're talking about the history of the specific Antifa politics that we're talking about, that would pretty much date with the creation of anti-racist action in the U.S., Canada, and somewhat beyond in the late '80s, into the '90s. That was largely modeled on the British anti-fascists action. It was created largely, initially by anti-racist-skinheads pushing back against the emergence of a neo-Nazi skinhead movement. They felt like the language of anti-racism fit in the American context better than anti-fascism.\n\nAnti-racist action was the name of this network. It grew to have hundreds of chapters around the continent, with thousands of members, and was really a major force in pushing back against the far right in the '90s, into the 2000s. That's the lineage and legacy that today's Antifa groups grow out of.\n\nIN: What were some of the other hallmarks of their tactics, in terms of direct action or recruitment? Is that still going on today? I remember seeing anti-racist action groups at punk shows in the late '90s and early 2000s.\n\nMB: Sure. You're right that part of what they accomplished was creating an anti-racist youth culture. Especially in punk and alternative music, which was important, because the far right was trying to recruit in those scenes in the '80s and '90s. Being able to push back in that way was very important.\n\nSometimes anti-racist groups, sometimes through infiltration, or through spying on these groups, would figure out where that [recruiting] spot was, and show up with 150 people in that meetup spot, so the meetup couldn't happen, to disseminate the location for the show. A lot of it was this kind of local-level pushback against attempts to embed this in the punk scene. But it grew beyond that to have wider influences in hip-hop communities, and other kinds of left political groups.\n\nIN: Did that drop off after the late '90s or early 2000s?\n\nMB: The people that I've spoken to definitely seem to indicate that into the mid-2000s, the role of militant anti-fascism in the radical left scene in the U.S. declined. The people that formed some of the oldest currently existing groups like Rose City Antifa in Portland, Oregon, which was founded in 2007, and others that formed groups in the late 2000s, early 20-teens, emphasized that during that era, it was a real challenge convincing other leftists that it was a worthwhile use of time to monitor, and track, and counteract the far right.\n\nThe politics was at a lull during this period, then made a resurgence, it seems, largely with the growth of the alt-right, and especially the Trump campaign. To some extent, that had to do with a kind of decline in the perceived need to fight back against these groups, and others. Just with the profile of the anti-war movement, into Occupy Wall Street, and people just putting time into other things.\n\nIN: Following Charlottesville, much of the media coverage of Antifa focused on their willingness to use violence. Is that accurate? And why?\n\nMB: Taken as a whole, the percentage of what [Antifa groups] do that entails physical confrontation is a very small percentage. The time commitment that's required to be part of one of these Antifa groups is massive. One person likened it, in terms of the amount of time they spend, to it being like a second job. To gain entry to some of these groups, it sometimes requires a long vetting process that takes months, with background checks, and a requirement that people participate in all sorts of activities to kind of demonstrate their commitment.\n\nMuch of it is research. Much of it entails figuring out who far-right groups [are], their membership, who they're working with, where they're holding their events; tracking individuals across multiple social media platforms; reading through message boards; figuring out what they're trying to do; trying to contact the owners of the venues to cancel the events. If the owners of the venue are resistant to canceling, organizing boycotts or pickets. Or gathering community support to shut down a white-collar rock show at a VFW.\n\nA lot of it entails public education. In the '90s, anti-racist action also had an educational component where sometimes they would speak to schools and so forth. It also involved, as we discussed, cultural work, holding concert series, tabling at alternative venues. Trying to push back against the tendency of the far right to try and gain a foothold in subcultural spaces.\n\nDanish anti-fascists in the '90s would sometimes, once they figured out who these neo-Nazi skinheads were, call their parents, and get their parents to stop them from going out and meeting with these people. It entailed noise protests, singing protests, putting up flyers and propaganda to kind of claim public space. Doxxing is a huge part of it.\n\nIN: It sounds like a lot of time and effort and screening is involved, in order to be allowed in. Is that true for a lot of groups around the country?\n\nMB: Not all groups accept new members. The ones who do, go through significant and long-term screening processes. It's decentralized, but for example, there's a network called the Torch Network. That's sort of a descendant of the Anti-Racist Action Network. They have a dozen groups that are affiliated. But there are groups that are not affiliated, that still coordinate, share resources, share information.\n\nSome are also more secretive than others. In Michigan, Solidarity and Defense is a group that does not operate with as much security. They're more open-faced. They don't cover their faces. They try to do community work. Redneck Revolt is a network of anti-fascist groups that focus on bigger a left gun culture, and working to counter recruit at gun shows, to try and win white conservative men, especially in rural areas, away from the right, but towards the left. Sometimes they'll show up to demonstrations with firearms in open-carry states.\n\nIN: Where does Antifa fit in with the larger rise of, or just general interest in, activism since Trump's election?\n\nMB: Yeah, I mean you could even take it back further. I mean, this decade as a whole has witnessed a kind of rebirth of ... I don't know how you describe it, but kind of direction-action politics from below. Through Occupy, through Black Lives Matter, through anti-fascism, through organizing against the Dakota Access Pipeline, and other kinds of examples. So in that sense, the people that are part of these groups, also currently or in the past, have done other kinds of politic. Some of them have participated with Black Lives Matter or Occupy. Or have organized against gas pipelines and what have you.\n\nThere's the assumption there Antifa is sort of this one specific, very clearly defined box, and the people who participate in these groups are not also active in other groups. But... in my experience speaking to people, these folks don't just do one thing. It's also worth looking the development of a larger anti-racist movement, of which anti-fascism is one small facet, focused on direct-action resistance to the far right, and resistance to police brutality, and entails a broader vision white supremacy.\n\nIt's part of a larger conversation about what direct action can mean, and what kinds of power communities can mobilize on their own, without turning to politicians to solve problems for them.\n\nThe larger context here is that there's been, over the past few decades, a rebirth of anti-authoritarian and anarchist politics in the United States-not always labeled as such. That has been a key motivator behind some of the recent protest movements. It's certainly very influential with anti-fascism. Part of this is a larger debate about how social change happens, and what kind of a world different factions want to see."

      "text": "Internal review shows Trump's DHS concocted bogus intelligence blaming antifa for violence\n\nWe knew at the time that Donald Trump sent an army of contracted goons from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in to the city of Portland, Oregon, in the summer of 2020 to arrest citizens protesting against police brutality-summarily sweeping people off the street on the pretext of a kind of preventative arrest based on groundless speculation that they were \"antifa\" conspiring to \"burn down our cities,\" as Trump put it-that it was an outrage against the Constitution and the rule of law.\n\nWhat we didn't know (and an internal DHS review that only surfaced this week reveals) was that it was also an extraordinary exercise in authoritarian incompetence. It demonstrates that senior DHS leadership pushed unfounded conspiracy theories about antifascists, encouraged the contractors they hired to violate protesters' constitutional rights, and made spurious connections, based on no real evidence, between protesters who engaged in criminal activity. It also revealed poor training and inadequate guidance, which contributed to the federal intelligence officers' lack of knowledge on legal restrictions for the collection of such information, and turned the entire operation into a massive mess.\n\n\"The report was a stunning analysis of the incompetence and mismanagement and abuse of power during the summer of 2020,\" Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, who released a redacted version of the document Friday, told Oregon Public Broadcasting .\n\nOriginally released on Jan. 6-and its contents subsequently overlooked due to that day's events- the internal review focused on DHS's Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I/A). It found that senior DHS leaders attempted to politicize intelligence in order to support Trump's claims that a massive \"antifa\" conspiracy was behind the many anti-police protests around the nation, but particularly so in Portland. The same leaders pressured subordinates to illegally search phones, and when legal staff objected, sought to cut them out of the discussion.\n\nA team of open source intelligence collectors, tasked with analyzing information obtained from public sources, also created dossiers on protesters and journalists-which they called \"baseball cards\"-despite having no clear connections to domestic terrorism or security threats.\n\n\"The report documents shocking, coordinated efforts by our government to abuse its power and to invade liberty in violation of the Constitution,\" said Oregon federal public defender Lisa Hay. \"In Portland, we were concerned that the government unconstitutionally collected information, including through the illegal search of protestors' cellphones last summer. This report confirms that was their intent.\"\n\nOver the course of the summer, between June 4 and Aug. 31, DHS sent at least 755 officers-from agencies that ranged from Federal Protective Service to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as well as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Secret Service, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis personnel-to Portland, tasked with protecting the city's downtown federal courthouse. The building had come under regular attack during nightly social justice protests that arose initially from the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in late May.\n\nThe Floyd protests were an international phenomenon, spreading to over 2,000 cities and towns, occurring in all 50 states as well as in over 60 other countries. Demonstrators turned out en masse to support those seeking justice for Floyd and the wider Black Lives Matter movement, and standing up against police brutality. Most of these protests lasted one or two days; however, in Portland, where police brutality issues had taken on an extraordinary edge , the protests became a daily affair-one that eventually surpassed 100 consecutive days.\n\nBy early July, most of the protests had become quiet and nonviolent, with only sporadic violence and vandalism, with the notable exception of an arson attack on the federal courthouse downtown-which is about the time that DHS agents began showing up, wearing anonymous military gear, arresting protesters on the streets, and spiriting them away in unmarked vans .\n\nOver the next few nights, they clashed with protesters in the area around the courthouse, using flashbangs and munitions to disperse the crowds. One protester was shot in the forehead by an \"impact weapon\" round that caused him brain damage. Another protester-a Navy veteran who was attempting to speak with the DHS officers-was brutally beaten with batons , breaking his hand.\n\nThat was when the scene exploded. On the night of July 24, thousands of Portlanders took to the streets to protest the arrests. The protest was entirely peaceful-drum circles, groups of teachers and nurses, a marching band, a \"Wall of Moms\" wearing yellow shirts-until the DHS officers began unleashing tear gas on the crowd. A brigade of \"fathers\" arrived with leaf blowers and blew the gas back at the officers.\n\nThe escalated protests continued nightly. DHS officials called the protests \"criminal violence perpetrated by anarchists targeting city and federal properties.\" It brought in reinforcements on July 28, even though many of these officers lacked proper training , and both Mayor Ted Wheeler and Gov. Kate Brown-along with both of the state's senators-demanded the DHS police be withdrawn. Eventually, they negotiated a phased withdrawal , and the DHS arrests ceased.\n\nIt was shortly apparent that the right-wing attempt to make \"antifa\" and Black Lives Matter into bogeymen responsible for the protest violence was utterly bogus. An Associated Press review of the arrest documents from the summer's protests showed that most of the people taken into custody were not left-wing radicals and had no ties to larger movements. It had already been clear for months that \"antifa\" was not responsible for the violence -which in many instances appeared in fact to have been instigated by police pushing back on protesters. This didn't prevent Trump from declaring on Twitter that he intended to have antifa designated a terrorist organization, though in fact he lacked the statutory power to do so.\n\nThe internal review at DHS conducted afterward revealed that the push for concocting intelligence about antifa intended to fit this narrative came from the top. Though the names are redacted, it is safe to assume that Chad Wolf, the DHS unconfirmed \"acting secretary,\" was particularly involved, since he made numerous public statements at the time that mirror the shape of the discussions with the agency.\n\nAt the time the protests broke out, Wolf appeared on Fox News with Tucker Carlson and announced that the Department of Justice had plans \"targeting and investigating the head of these organizations, [and] the individuals that are paying for these individuals to move across the country.\"\n\nTrump himself appeared on Fox with Laura Ingraham and claimed that \"people that are in the dark shadows\" are \"controlling the streets\" of Democratic cities. When Ingraham warned him that he sounded like he was promoting a conspiracy theory, he doubled down with a pitch-perfect rendition of the \"evil antifa thug\" caricature central to the narrative attacking the movement.\n\n\"We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend, and in the plane it was almost completely loaded with thugs wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that,\" he claimed.\n\nThe DHS internal review found that Wolf and his immediate underlings at I/A pushed staffers to describe the protests as \"Violent Antifa Anarchist Inspired\" (VAAI) actions-an entirely new category that had no evidentiary support or background.\n\n\"You could see where this VAAI definition was coming from a mile away,\" a career analyst is quoted saying in the report. \"He got tired of [Redacted Name] telling him they did not have the reporting and he was convinced it was ANTIFA so he was going to fix the problem by changing what the collectors were reporting.\"\n\nAn email was sent to DHS senior leaders \"instructing them that henceforth, the violent opportunists in Portland were to be reported as VAAI, unless the intel 'show[ed]...something different.\"\n\nThe report says that the DHS leadership \"did make other attempts to controvert the collection-analysis processm,\" pointing particularly to the push for VAAI designations. One memo from the same leader posited that \"we have overwhelmingly intelligence regarding the ideologies driving individuals toward violence,\" but the analysts responded with factual reality: \"In fact, overwhelming intelligence regarding the motivations or affiliations of the violent protesters did not exist,\" the report says. \"Indeed, the review team could not identify any intelligence that existed to support [Redacted Name]'s assertion.\"\n\nWolf and his team even concocted an analytical framework for the protests-claiming that there are four distinct phases in which they develop-that appeared to have been pulled from their nether regions, and then required analysts to work overtime to come up with evidence to support it and put it into a report which then went utterly ignored:\n\nThe review also noted that Federal Protective Services officers requested assistance from DHS's Homeland Identities Targeting and Exploitation Center to search protesters' cellphones. The latter team found the searches were illegal, and resisted pressure from senior Homeland Security leaders to assist in the searches.\n\nAnd then there were the \"baseball cards.\" These dossiers were compiled by freshly hired collections analysts who targeted people arrested during the protest and suspected of having \"antifa\" or BLM connections. The internal review found that out of the 48 reports provided, 13 of them involved people accused of non-violent offenses, such as trespassing or failing to comply with an order, with no clear tie to any national security threat or mission. One \"baseball card\" report focused on a person who was arrested and accused of flying a drone and identified on social media as a journalist.\n\nRepublicans took the bogus narrative and functionally made it an official one widely believed across the country-namely, that \"antifa and BLM burned down cities across the nation\"-and have even used it to justify the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. At congressional hearings , they have even tried to claim that examples of lethal violence, such as the slaying of an FPS officer in Oakland, by far-right extremists was the product of \"antifa\" radicals.\n\nThe narrative also was primarily responsible for the failures by both DHS and other federal law-enforcement agencies, notably the FBI, to adequately take the very real and building threat of white-nationalist terrorism seriously. The result, in fact, unleashed a plague of far-right violence that reached a high-tide mark on Jan. 6, but which has still not receded.\n\n\"This was a textbook example of what happens when you send people in with a political agenda, inadequate training, and no real effort to correct the kind of problems that showed up early,\" Wyden told OPB . \"This was about politics. We know that Donald Trump tried to say again and again, 'Portland is really the problem.' And he would never really focus on the fact that his people, were basically okaying, for example, the use of tear gas near a school in our community.\""

At the time, he took to the online messaging app Telegram to shed light on the policy and encourage his followers to take advantage of it.\n\n\"Due to the new privacy policy at Twitter, things now unexpectedly work more in our favor as we can take down Antifa ... doxing pages more easily,\" the white nationalist and Nazi sympathizer wrote on Telegram. He also shared a list of approximately 50 Twitter accounts for anti-extremism journalists urging his followers to report the accounts.\n\nAccording to Twitter, that led to a \"coordinated and malicious\" on a specific group of journalists and researchers. Multiple journalists had their accounts and tweets flagged. One of the impacted Twitter accounts belonged to Gwen Snyder, an anti-fascist researcher in Philadelphia.

She suspects the rule could have a \"catastrophic\" chilling effect on other researchers working to expose extremists.\"\n\nTwitter's latest acknowledgment comes nearly a week after it rolled out the new policy.\n\nAlmost immediately after the social network made its announcement, it faced scrutiny for many of its confusing provisions."

      "text": "Pro-Trump parents are falling for a hoax that claims Antifa will report them to Child Protective Services\n\nHoaxes and bizarre conspiracy theories are common on the far right, and one of the recent ones involves Antifa: a fake Twitter account, @JoinAntifa , claims that Antifa is reporting conservative parents to Child Protective Services for supporting President Donald Trump. And even though it is total nonsense, that hasn't stopped right-wing activists like Patrick Howley from promoting it - or pro-Trump parents from believing it.\n\nOn Twitter, @JoinAntifa is a troll account: it isn't really operated by anyone from Antifa. And a recent post said, \"I just called the police on my neighbor. He has a Trump sign on his front lawn. I told the police that I think he is abusing his daughter.\"\n\nHowley, founder of Big League Politics, saw the tweet and forwarded it, asserting, \"BREAKING: Self-identified ANTIFA operatives are filing false reports on Trump-supporting parents to Child Protective Services, and encouraging others to do the same, knowing CPS is liberal. Lots of sources say this is happening - don't let them say this was a joke.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast's Will Sommer reports that even though the @JoinAntifa tweet was bogus, right-wing blogs have been claiming that it is authentic.\n\n\"Despite its popularity on the right, this idea is totally fake,\" Sommer reported on September 12. \"The entire claim is based on the single @JoinAntifa tweet. @JoinAntifa has just 36 followers, and is obviously set up to either troll Trump supporters or help create damaging fake news stories about Antifa.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday, September 11, Sommer reported, Twitter \"had limited the account's visibility on the site, apparently to stop it from spreading disinformation.\"\n\n@JoinAntifa has a page with some goofy, over-the-top graphics, one of which depicts five well-armed members of the \"Antifa Poll Protection Force\" and declares that they are \"legally armed and protecting poll integrity in red districts\" and will be \"coming November 2020.\"\n\nOf course, there is no such thing as the \"Antifa Poll Protection Force.\" And while Antifa is controversial - even on the left - their members aren't known for promoting the use of firearms."

      "text": "QAnon-loving Senate candidate wants martial law declared in Oregon to combat 'antifa'\n\nThe Oregon GOP nominee for the U.S. Senate, Jo Rae Perkins, decided to let her \"Q light\" shine on a Facebook livestream earlier this week-and it was a doozy.\n\nPerkins, an unrepentant \"QAnon\" conspiracy cultist, told her audience that the state needs to be placed under martial law, with the National Guard being sent not just to Portland-where there have been violent protests over police brutality-but to rural places like Klamath Falls and Bend. Her reasoning: Busloads of nefarious antifa activists, financed by the evil George Soros, are fanning out to these towns to wreak destruction.\n\n﻿\n\nThe only problem with Perkins' scenario: They're not. The only places \"antifa\" activists (as well as many others) have clashed with police-and the only protests in which damage has occurred-have been in Portland.\n\nThere have , however, been a string of far-right hoaxes that have found audiences with credulous residents and even law-enforcement officers in these rural areas-utterly spurious reports of buses loaded up with black-clad antifascists, coming to their towns to break windows and harass local businesses. In turn, large crowds of heavily armed men have turned out on the streets of those towns to fend off the invading antifa hordes.\n\nPerkins happily promoted those hoaxes, as well as a panoply of associated conspiracy theories, including the notoriously false and anti-Semitic claim that financier George Soros is secretly funding \"antifa.\" She also offered a new twist, claiming that the antifa hordes are \"the army that Obama put together a few years ago.\"\n\nAt the zenith of the rant, she demanded that martial law be imposed via the National Guard: \"This is insurrection. And the governors need to call in the National Guard,\" she said. \"We need martial law to squash this ASAP.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Let's think about this. We've been under a soft martial law since March, the middle of March ... You know that and I know that. And in some places, it is far beyond a soft martial law. It has gone into a hardcore martial law.\"\n\nThe solution, she said, was to call in troops: \"The National Guard needs to come in because there is not enough police officers to squash what is going on. We need the National Guard to do that.\"\n\nPerkins said she was \"in pure shock\" at reading reports that busfuls of antifa protesters were heading to these towns: \"This is ridiculous. In Klamath Falls?\" she said. \"People are out to protect their businesses. Two or three buses full of antifa came down from Portland. Wow! Wow!\"\n\nShe began praying aloud during the livestream: \"But Lord, now we have this evil, this antifa, Father God. And we say no more. Lord God, I ask that you bring out your warring angels to protect the cities, to protect the innocent people, to protect the business owners, Lord God.\"\n\nPerkins repeatedly described \"antifa\" as \"evil\": \"These cannot be people,\" she said. \"All I can see, Lord, is just the demonic outcry, oh God, of people that just people that feel they can just ... total disregard, total disregard for other people, for their property. All in the name of justice for George Floyd.\"\n\nIn short order, this became an attack on George Soros:\n\nShe later reiterated: \"Then we have the antifa thugs. Many many people believe that they are being paid for by George Soros. And I have seen anything to dispel that rumor. I have never seen George Soros come out and say he has nothing to do with it.\"\n\nPerkins added that \"the media are supporting antifa because they are all part of the same cabal,\" which she went on to explain was \"the Deep State.\"\n\nBut it wasn't just Soros to blame, according to Perkins. So was former President Barack Obama:\n\nThis is the army-this is the army that Obama put together a few years ago. Wasn't there an army that he put together a few years ago? I just read about it.\n\nFor the record: No buses bearing hordes of ravening antifascists appeared in Klamath Falls , or any other of the multiple locations where they were rumored to be about to descend-which in Oregon included such towns as Medford , Grants Pass, and Coquille . (In Curry County , the local sheriff shared the false rumor with his constituents on Facebook, then later deleted the post when it became apparent there was no there there.) There still are no reports, yet, of similar mythical buses headed for Bend or Pendleton, but given the ease with which they appear to spread on Facebook and among \"QAnon\" conspiracists, that likely is just a matter of time.\n\nPerkins will face incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley in the November general election."

      "text": "Documents Reveal Cops Chasing Absurd Antifa and BLM Tips\n\nThe graffiti on a port-a-potty in a gravel pit was, in the opinion of one Washington state resident, a sign that anti-fascists might blow up a nearby dam. Another local was convinced that a young man reading signs was actually an \"Antifa or BLM scout.\" A third person warned, via an anonymous email tip, that her ex-husband was part of an anti-fascist group that was coming to burn down the town.\n\nAll these complaints were forwarded throughout police ranks in Washington, where officials urged vigilance against the leftist threat.\n\nAs racial justice protests flared across the country in summer 2020, so did conservative fears of leftist protesters. From Oregon to Virginia , social media lit up with rumors about anti-fascists (\"antifa\") or Black Lives Matter participants, who were allegedly coming to terrorize small towns.\n\nAnacortes, a scenic city of 17,000 in coastal Washington, was no exception. From June to August 2020, the city's police department received repeated tips about supposed antifa threats, according to police documents obtained by the government transparency nonprofit Property of the People and shared with The Daily Beast. Even some of the most absurd claims found their way up to state-level law enforcement, those documents show.\n\nRyan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People, reiterated that the complaints came amid a summer of rumors and innuendo about antifa and Black Lives Matter. After fresh fears circulated in some conservative channels and law enforcement warned about the potential for mass unrest in the wake of the verdict in the Derek Chauvin murder case in Minnesota, it's safe to say that chatter has not subsided.\n\n\"Conservative and law enforcement panic about antifa and BLM hasn't gone anywhere,\" Shapiro told The Daily Beast. \"These documents aren't even a year old, and we've had an attempted coup in the interim. It's not like tensions have cooled. We now have tens of millions of people collectively consumed by manufactured paranoia about social justice movements, who also believe the presidential election was stolen with the aid of antifa and BLM. We're likely to see a new round of mass protests against police violence, and I expect the right-wing response will in some ways be even more ferocious than last year.\"\n\nThe documents, obtained via Freedom of Information request, reveal the absurdity of some of last year's complaints.\n\nIn mid-June, an Anacortes resident contacted the local Skagit County Sheriff's Office via the neighborhood-based social network NextDoor. She and her neighbors often held tailgates where \"we all fly the American Flag. We are very peaceful. We have signs like Support your Local Police, Support our Troops, Defend the Police, Proud to be an American, Home of the Free Because of the Brave etc,\" she wrote.\n\nBut on a recent weekend, she continued, \"there was a young man with very short bleached blond hair who walked around in the street right in front of us and read every one of our signs. Paticularly [sic] the Support your Local Police. He had a mean look on his face and looked inside my Jeep where the tail gate was up and he could see more of our signs and American Flags.\n\n\"Then he ran across the street and got in a car with someone else and drove off. I have never seen him before. I thought it was odd but one of our group is a retired school principal and very astute. He, with all confidence said that the young man was an Antifa or BLM scout. When he said that to me it immediately rang true and I was quite sure he was right.\"\n\n<p><i><strong><em>Do you know something we should about the far right, or how police respond to the left? Email Kelly.Weill@TheDailyBeast.com or securely at </i>kellyweill@protonmail.com<i> from a non-work device.</i></strong></em></p>\n\nShe said she hoped \"Antifa or BLM does not come to Anacortes to harass us or put people in danger. Is there any way you can check up on their plans?\"\n\nThe Skagit County Sheriff forwarded the message to the Anacortes Police Department. The sheriff's office told The Daily Beast they'd forwarded the message because the tipster lived in Anacortes.\n\nMid-June was a popular time for rumors about the left. The following day, the Anacortes Police Department received its own tip, this one anonymous, from someone who claimed that \"my ex husband is in a group with antifa. He called me and said do not go anywhere. stay home on Sunday because they are coming to Anacortes to break up a group on Commmercial [sic] street on sunday. I love Anacortes. I left Seattle to live a better life here with my kids. And I do not want anacorte burned up and people hurt and cops hurt.\"\n\nAnacortes Police Chief John Small then forwarded both tips to sheriffs, chiefs, and detectives at five local law enforcement agencies, plus a commander and a sergeant with the Washington State Patrol.\n\n\"I received the below e-mail from Undersheriff Clark yesterday which was interesting,\" Small wrote, adding, \"Today I received the attached anonymous letter alluding to Antifa coming to Anacortes this Sunday to wreak their havoc... We will be increasing our staffing on Sunday, but in reality it's still not many people. If we start to yell for help on the radio I didn't want it to be a surprise.\"\n\nContacted by The Daily Beast, Small said none of those supposed threats were ever substantiated, but that it wasn't unusual for police to forward tips among law enforcement agencies.\n\n\"I can't speak for all law enforcement in our state, but all the agencies in Skagit County are small agencies and we commonly share this type of information since we rely on each other for 'mutual aid' in response to a significant event,\" Small told The Daily Beast.\n\nWashington was not the only state to see law enforcement bombarded with antifa rumors online. In Coquille, Oregon , last summer, a sheriff helped fan antifa fears when he posted on Facebook that \"3 buss [sic] loads of ANTIFA protestors are making their way from Douglas County headed for Coquille then to Coos Bay.\" The fabled buses never appeared. And when a hoaxer publicized a fake antifa flag-burning event in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in July, police arrived at the scene that was overrun with far-right groups who had come to oppose the left.\n\nThe following month, another alleged antifa threat, even wilder than the others, found its way to the Skagit County Sheriff, documents show. In this case, it involved two overturned port-a-potties in a gravel pit near a boat launch in Concrete, Washington.\n\nOne of the port-a-potties had been spray painted with the acronym \"ACAB,\" short for \"all cops are bastards.\" The other was tagged with an A in a circle, an anarchist symbol. But where some observers might have seen common vandalism symbols, the tipster who photographed the port-a-potties saw something more ominous-maybe even part of a plot to blow up a dam.\n\n\"Looks like Antifa has been up to Lake Shannon,\" the tipster wrote in an email that was forwarded to the Skagit County Sheriff. \"That's incredibly worrisome. The anarchy symbol, 'ACAB' (all cops are bastards)... that's an Antifa signature. Too close to town, for sure... but really worrisome when you consider Antifa is now using explosives in cities, organizing with firearms, and... by being at the lake, they were right next to the dam. Just sayin'. Can'tbe [sic] too careful, you know? Not in these times.\"\n\nA sergeant ordered the area to be monitored, claiming that anti-fascists might have previously used the gravel pit as a \"training area.\"\n\n\"Please be aware that there have been some antifa type graffiti at the Lake Shannon boat launch and surrounding area,\" the sergeant wrote. \"Please monitor the area and be careful. A few years ago we had information that some of them were using the pit for training purposes.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Skagit County Sheriff spokesperson told The Daily Beast the department did not have any information about incidents at the gravel pit.\n\nShapiro stressed that, while the complaints were far-fetched, they indicated a populace on edge about vague threats, and police departments receptive to those fears. And that has ominous implications as protesters once again take to the streets in large numbers-and police show signs of harsh tactics.\n\n\"When individuals and law enforcement have been whipped into such a paranoid frenzy that they're primed to see 'antifa' or 'BLM' terrorist conspiracies literally in the toilet, the situation is a powder keg,\" Shapiro said. \"There's a direct line from this sort of deliberately induced political hysteria to violent, repressive crackdowns on progressive dissent.\"\n\nkelly.weill@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Whistleblower: DHS Hyped 'Antifa,' Soft-Pedaled White Supremacist Threat\n\nDownplay the white supremacist threat. Hype up rhetoric about anti-fascists and other \"left-wing\" groups stoking violence.\n\nThat's what the Department of Homeland Security's leadership ordered one of its top intelligence officials to do, according to a complaint from that staffer, Brian Murphy, released Tuesday.\n\nIn a filing with the Department's Inspector General, Murphy, until recently a top official in the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, alleges he was recently demoted for his repeated refusals to cook the books on DHS intelligence, particularly that which did not favor the Trump administration. Murphy, who alleges unfair retaliation, claims he was pressured to downplay threats posed by white supremacists and Russian election interference, and instead told to inflate fears around immigrants, anarchists, anti-fascists, China, and Iran.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn October 2018, for example, then-DHS Deputy Chief of Staff Miles Taylor and DHS Counselor Kristen Marquadt allegedly pressured Murphy into distorting information on immigrants, so that it \"supported the policy argument that large numbers of [known or suspected terrorists] were entering the United States through the southwest border.\"\n\nMurphy says he declined to manipulate the data, and that he and a supervisor agreed that doing so would constitute a felony. Nevertheless, he claims, immigration data was distorted on multiple occasions, including oral testimony then-DHS head Kirstjen Nielsen gave to Congress, in which she claimed 3,755 known or suspected terrorists had crossed the southern border.\n\nIn a meeting with Nielsen and then-DHS Chief of Staff Chad Wolf, Murphy offered documentation showing that no more than three people of that description had crossed the border. Even those descriptions might have been inappropriate, Murphy added, since they simply shared the \"name or phone number of a person who was known to be in contact with a terrorist. At that point, Mr. Murphy was removed from the meeting by Mr. Wolf.\"\n\n(In a brief interview with The Daily Beast, Taylor said,\"the allegation is false. The real reason the Department of Homeland Security issued a fact cheat clarifying the number of terrorists crossing the southern border was because senior DHS leadership was worried that the White House was misstating the numbers of terrorists crossing the southern border, so we wanted to clarify the numbers and provide more accurate information to the public.\")\n\nIn May 2020, Murphy claims, Wolf-by then the acting DHS Secretary-ordered him to stop giving reports on the threat of Russian interference in the U.S., and instead focus on potential interference by China and Iran.\n\n\"Mr. Wolf stated that these instructions specifically originated from White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien,\" Murphy alleges.\n\n(The Daily Beast previously reported that O'Brien told his staff not to engage with Congress and other outsiders on the election security issue. In a statement provided after the publication of this story, White House spokesperson Sarah Matthews said, \"Ambassador O'Brien has never sought to dictate the Intelligence Community's focus on threats to the integrity of our elections or on any other topic; any contrary suggestion by a disgruntled former employee, who he has never met or heard of, is false and defamatory. Rather, Ambassador O'Brien has consistently and publicly advocated for a holistic focus on all threats to our elections-whether from Russia, Iran, China, or any other malign actor.\")\n\nMurphy alleges that Wolf ordered him again in July to stop investigating Russian interference. \"Mr. Wolf stated to Mr. Murphy the intelligence notification should be 'held' because it 'made the President look bad,'\" the whistleblower report reads. When Murphy again declined, Wolf allegedly made moves to exclude him from future meetings on the subject.\n\nConcurrently, the DHS was compiling a Homeland Threat Assessment [HTA], which listed Russian interference and white supremacy as two chief concerns. Murphy claims acting DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli told him to downplay those two sections and specifically to \"modify the section on White Supremacy in a manner that made the threat appear less severe, as well as include information on the prominence of violent 'left-wing' groups.\"\n\n(Another former DHS official recently told The Daily Beast that she was \"advised by senior officials in the White House\" not to even use the terms \"domestic terrorism or white supremacy,\" which were considered to be \" trigger words \" for Trump.)\n\nMurphy's supervisor allegedly told him Wolf and Cuccinelli wanted to withhold publication of the HTA because they worried how it \"would reflect upon President Trump.\"\n\nThe pressure to identify leftist groups as a threat appears to have mounted as racial justice protests swept the country and President Donald Trump increasingly demonized the left in public and in campaign literature.\n\n\"Mr. Murphy was instructed by Mr. Wolf and/or Mr. Cuccinelli to modify intelligence assessments to ensure they matched up with the public comments by President Trump on the subject of ANTIFA and 'anarchist' groups,\" Murphy's complaint reads.\n\nMurphy claims he was specifically asked to alter the report to include incidents in Portland, Oregon, which have attracted Trump and Wolf's particular interest over left-wing protests.\n\nThe DHS and Department of Justice have taken special interest in identifying anarchists and anti-fascists as threats, even if the actual criminal cases stemming from this year's protests show a minimal footprint from people with those political affiliations. Nevertheless, the DHS in July issued a list of supposed anarchist violence in Portland, much of which amounted to graffiti incidents. Wolf has recently appeared on Fox News suggesting the U.S. treat anti-fascists and Black Lives Matter protesters like terrorists, possibly using racketeering or conspiracy law against them ( legal experts say the move would constitute a massive legal stretch).\n\nTrump himself has tweeted repeatedly about anarchists and anti-fascists, threatening to designate the latter as a terrorist organization. (Such a designation would also strain legal feasibility , although a recently leaked DHS memo suggested the groundwork for falsely designating the broad anti-fascist movement as a foreign terror organization, based on a handful of anti-fascists who fought ISIS in the Kurdish separatist area of Rojava.)\n\nAlthough Murphy claims to have been demoted for his refusal, his complaint alleges ongoing tampering with intelligence in his old department.\n\n\"On September 3, 2020, Mr. Murphy learned the new draft was provided to Mr. Wolf, who had ordered the HTA to be redesigned with the policy office completing the revisions,\" his complaint reads. \"It is Mr. Murphy's assessment that the final version of the HTA will more closely resemble a policy document with references to ANTIFA and 'anarchist' groups than an intelligence document as originally formulated by DHS I&A.\"\n\nMurphy served as principal deputy under secretary in the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis from March 2018 until July 31, 2020, when he claims he was \"retaliatorily demoted to the role of Assistant to the Deputy Under Secretary for the DHS Management Division.\"\n\nThe demotion came the day after acting DHS head Chad Wolf allegedly told Murphy that \"the removal and reassignment of Mr. Murphy would be politically good for Mr. Wolf, who wanted to be officially nominated as the DHS Secretary,\" according to Murphy's complaint. Wolf has not been formally nominated for the role, and Congress's independent Government Accountability Office recently found that he is ineligible to act in his current capacity.\n\nkelly.weill@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

It's a logo patch for the heavy metal band Anthrax.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast June, even as racial-justice protests swept the country, one pro-police event in Everett, Washington, made national headlines. There, in what critics described as an unequal application of justice , a teenager was arrested for taunting police with a doughnut, while a pro-police demonstrator was not arrested after putting a man in a headlock and drawing a gun.\n\nBut two months after the protest, the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office did circulate an internal bulletin about the gun-wielding man, according to records obtained by the transparency group Property Of The People and reviewed by The Daily Beast. The only problem: the document appeared to misclassify the man as a militant leftist, based on a flagrant misreading of his shirt.\n\nA representative for the band Anthrax did not immediately provide comment for this story. A Snohomish County Sheriff's spokesperson said that after the bulletin circulated, investigators had checked with the gun-wielding man, and learned that the patch was unrelated to antifa.\n\n\"Through the investigation it was determined to not be an ANTIFA patch,\" the spokesperson told The Daily Beast. \"The subject was contacted and the vest was checked-patch related to armed forces service and a band and not in any way related to ANTIFA.\"\n\nThe June 17, 2020, \"Back The Blue\" rally drew approximately 300 police supporters, and a small opposition crowd of Black Lives Matter activists. Outside the event, the two groups shouted opposing chants. Two teenagers reportedly taunted police with doughnuts on strings, leading to one of the teenager's well-publicized arrest . (\"Get that fucking shit away from my face or I'll whoop your ass, boy,\" an officer told the teen, before another officer shoved and arrested him. The young man was not charged in the incident.)\n\nBut when the pro-police crowd caught sight of the second doughnut-toting teen, a scuffle broke out, the Herald Net reported at the time . In the chaos, a long-haired man apparently from the pro-police side was filmed placing an opponent in a headlock and pointing a gun at the Black Lives Matter crowd.\n\nMatt Lincoln, the man who was placed in a headlock, told The Daily Beast the attack came as a shock.\n\n\"Someone grabbed me from behind and started choking me,\" Lincoln said. \"I'm holding onto a sign with both hands, so I was vulnerable. I put the sign down and pulled the guy off me, and he turned around and pulled a gun on me. Everyone started yelling 'gun!' He started aiming it at the crowd, not just me. Then he casually put the gun back. The police just stood there, let him walk away. We couldn't believe it. I was just shocked they brought guns to the protest.\"\n\nThe gun-carrying man was not arrested, and police told the Herald Net that they were unaware of the incident until reporters asked about it days later.\n\nBy late August, however, the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office had circulated an internal bulletin on the gun-wielding man. The bulletin, which was also distributed by the Washington State Attorney General's Office, included pictures of the man, as well as a possible indication of his political beliefs.\n\n\"A physical confrontation erupted, and this individual put a protest e r in a headlock followed by displaying a pistol for a few moments as the crowds reacted to the confrontation and the tension escalated,\" the bulletin reads. \"Law enforcement responded, but the subject was not contacted or identified. No shots were fired and the weapon was drawn and secured on the right side pocket of the vest. 'ANTIFA' is a patch on the right shoulder of the subject.\"\n\n\"Antifa,\" short for anti-fascist, refers to a broad movement of leftist demonstrators who oppose the far right. The movement has served, at times, as a bogeyman for police and the far right in general, with Snohomish's own police chief resigning last year, days before the Back The Blue rally, after he fueled rumors of an ominous antifa mob approaching town. Although the leftist menace never materialized, heavily armed groups on the right patrolled the streets, some of them toting Confederate flags or patches for hate groups. (The Snohomish Police Department and the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office work together , but are separate agencies.)\n\nThe bulletin's mention of an \"ANTIFA\" patch on the vest of a gun-brandishing man might have given police more reason to fear violence on the left. But, contrary to the bulletin's claims, the patch did not say \"ANTIFA.\" It was the spiky, stylized logo of Anthrax, a metal band.\n\nKim Kelly, a labor journalist, organizer, and Daily Beast contributor who is also the former heavy metal editor for Vice , said the patch was unequivocally the Anthrax logo.\n\n\"This is hilarious,\" Kelly told The Daily Beast. \"That is absolutely an Anthrax patch. It's the classic logo that dates back to their 1983 demo 'Soldiers of Metal' and was designed by lead guitarist Daniel Alan Spitz. You can see many more examples of that exact logo-including yellow versions-on everything from face masks and hand sanitizer to shot glasses in their official merchandise store.\"\n\nRyan Shapiro, executive director of Property Of The People, said the mix-up was part of a broader trend of law enforcement cracking down on the left.\n\n\"Law enforcement is so consumed by panic over progressive dissent that cops are now seeing the 'antifa' boogeyman in even the most ubiquitous mall-bought metal patches,\" Shapiro told The Daily Beast.\n\nThe Snohomish County Sheriff, Adam Fortney, has previously drawn attention for right-wing stances, including his refusal to enforce statewide COVID-19 restrictions last April. That decision, plus his reinstatement of three officers who had previously been fired for misconduct, became the subject of a now-dead effort to recall him as sheriff.\n\nLincoln, the man who was attacked on video, said he and other witnesses recognized the patch as that of a metal band. \"We know for sure it was an Anthrax patch,\" he said. \"We think he had a Slayer patch. Pretty much old school thrash metal kind of guy.\"\n\nNot only was the man's patch a Google-able metal logo, but it was surrounded on the man's vest by other patches for uber-famous metal bands like Iron Maiden.\n\n\"The thing is, too, that Anthrax is not exactly an underground cult favorite, nor are they an explicitly political band,\" Kelly said. \"It's not like dude was rocking a patch from Dawn Ray'd or Terminal Nation. Anthrax is one of the most famous thrash metal bands in existence, and rose to prominence in the 1980s alongside Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer; together, they were and still are known as The Big Four.\"\n\nLincoln, for his own part, is a musician in various punk bands himself. He said he'd been shown what activists believe are his attacker's social media accounts, which indicate a belief in various far-right conspiracy theories. \"It sucks. It takes advantage of naive people,\" Lincoln said of conspiracy theories.\n\nHe said he didn't wish to press charges against his attacker, but wished the man knew more about what they had in common.\n\n\"That's what kills me. If the guy knew me, personally, he'd feel horrible,\" he said. \"These are bands I love.\"\n\nkelly.weill@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Antifa-Hating Cops Keep Taking the Side of MAGA Terror\n\nTo successfully combat violent, far-right extremism in a post-Trump America, you absolutely do not need a new domestic front in the disastrous War on Terror . What you do need is for law enforcement to simply enforce laws that have been on the books for ages.\n\nAlso, it would be helpful if fewer cops ended up taking the side of MAGA extremists, far-right conspiracy theorists, and-of course- the Trumpist Capitol rioters .\n\nOn this week's episode of The Daily Beast's Fever Dreams podcast , hosts Asawin Suebsaeng and Kelly Weill welcome NBC News journalist (and Daily Beast alumnus) Ben Collins , who breaks down some of his latest reporting and investigations into online disinformation and political extremism-and how that kind of absurd disinformation can warp a police department's priorities.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Last year, there were these rumors of antifa buses that existed solely on the dumbest accounts on Instagram and Facebook. They didn't exist. There's no such thing as... this marauding magic school bus of antifa people just going around,\" Collins recounted. \"However, law enforcement [in California] put a helicopter in the sky to try to find an 'Antifa bus' that was rumored on Instagram and Facebook, in one of the dumbest Instagram posts that you'll ever see. They take that very seriously, when a lot of this stuff... is coming from the militias... This isn't just a police thing, or a training thing. It's like, how are law enforcement so targeted algorithmically by this stuff? Or how are they falling down these rabbit holes?\"\n\nCollins pointed out that \"one of the biggest vectors last year of these, 'Antifa is coming to your house personally to, you know, take your grandma's medicine' stuff was police Facebook pages, who have like blue checks next to the name on Facebook, who are trusted by the community... So there's a larger systemic problem there with how police interact with social media on a local level.\"\n\nElsewhere on this episode, Weill and Suebsaeng also discuss how the horse paste and \"sheep drench\" craze raging among many anti-vaccine COVID truthers -and to a certain extent, on Fox News-is getting so out of hand...  that the FDA had to spend part of its weekend telling people to knock it off .\n\nListen, and subscribe, to Fever Dreams on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , and Stitcher .\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Trump's 'ANTIFA' Threat Is Total Bullshit-And Totally Dangerous\n\nContributing Editor\n\nIt's not a real organization, \" ANTIFA .\" And even if it were, there is no such thing as a domestic federal terror designation .\n\nBut President Donald Trump's tweet that the U.S. \"will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization\" is a very real threat.\n\nTrump's Sunday offering came as federal and local authorities across the country scrambled to contain increasingly violent protests in the wake of George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis. Trump, who over several years has launched numerous tirades against anti-fascists, blamed the movement-really, a set of organizing tactics-for vandalism at the protests.\n\nAlthough he has previously threatened legal action against anti-fascists (\"ANTIFA,\" in his preferred Twitter styling), the tweet was followed by a statement from Attorney General William Barr claiming that \"violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"\n\nVeteran FBI agents and Homeland Security analysts immediately called the \"terrorism\" label little more than a cynical maneuver to encourage police violence at antiracist demonstrations that have increasingly been labeled the work of nefarious outsiders.\n\n\"Why the strong rhetoric directed at antifa when you haven't come out and condemned white supremacists as domestic terror groups?\" said Daryl Johnson , a former DHS analyst stifled during the Obama administration for warning about far-right extremism.\n\n\"Anti-fascist\" is, among many things, an adjective, not a group. The term can apply to people who personally object to fascism-a large segment of the American populace-as well as people who actively oppose fascism as part of several localized groups across the country.\n\nThere is, however, no centralized organization.\n\n\"Anti-fascism consists of a variety of different actors and actions,\" said Stanislav Vysotsky, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, and author of a forthcoming book on the subject. \"Those can be informal: any kind of practice that opposes fascism, and can be taken on by individuals, or they can be formal, which are based in affinity group structures. There's no formal organization, but there are people who organize as anti-fascists in order to oppose fascist activity.\n\nSarah Smith, who spoke to The Daily Beast under a pseudonym for fear of reprisal, is a member of Atlanta Antifascists, one of those organized groups. She said the broad usage of the term \"anti-fascist\" leads to right-wingers conflating everyone from members of organizations like hers, to \"anybody who says anything bad about Nazis, for example.\"\n\nShe added that groups like hers are often accused of being much further-reaching than they actually are. \"If a right-winger stubs their toe, it's 'oh no, it's antifa.' At a certain point, we've got a little inured to it,\" she said. \"But what Trump is saying is going to increase that trend of blaming us for everything people don't like, even though our mission is very specific. We really do what we say we do: we monitor the far-right locally.\"\n\nJust as \"ANTIFA\" doesn't exist in the sense that Trump pretends it does, neither does an official \"domestic terrorism\" label for groups inside the United States. Only the domestic adjuncts of foreign terrorist organizations fall under the rubric of \"designated\" terrorist organizations, as so labeled by the State Department. Moreover, the chief investigative and prosecutorial tools against such designated organizations are material-support statutes, designed to choke off the flow of money into banned groups. Antifa, which is not an organization, simply does not work that way.\n\nBut that doesn't mean federal and local agencies won't take action against anti-fascists in an attempt to comply with directives from Washington.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment Sunday on what \"counterterrorism\" measures it would take against anti-fascists. Barr, in a statement after Trump's tweet, pledged to use the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which combine state, local and federal law enforcement, to \"identify criminal organizers and instigators.\"\n\nMike German, a former FBI special agent who disrupted neo-nazi organizations in the 1990s, suggested Trump was making antifa into a scapegoat even as more nefarious right-wing actors were lurking on the periphery.\n\n\"It seems to be an effort to distract from the documented presence of white supremacist militia groups at these protests and their rhetoric in wanting to instigate further violence that would potentially flow into a civil war or a race war,\" he told The Daily Beast.\n\nBut experts said that, however pre-textually, Trump and Barr's directives pose real dangers to protesters.\n\nDHS' Fusion Centers, information hubs to state and local law enforcement, can run database checks and put out notices for local cops to monitor known or suspected criminals who might be protesting. German said he expected high-level pressure on the FBI and JTTFs to result in \"aggressive investigation and selective prosecution against people the FBI labels with this umbrella term\" of anti-fascist-resources he expected would flow out of investigations of violent white supremacist or militia groups. The DHS did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nAdding to the potential for harm is that, while more experienced activists may take measures to protect themselves from scrutiny, casual opponents of fascism might not, Smith, the Atlanta anti-fascist noted.\n\n\"We don't have any [membership] dues, we don't use real names. There would be nothing to make illegal,\" Smith noted. \"If the government is coming after us, it probably won't affect us as much as it would normal people who are engaged in normal, anti-fascist things.\"\n\nVysotsky echoed Smith's concern that an effort to target anti-fascists could affect \"any organization or individual that aligns left of fascism. It opens up a huge space to designate virtually any person who opposes any kind of authoritarian movement toward fundamental inequality and violence as being a terrorist.\"\n\nThat includes many of the thousands protesting racism and police brutality in the wake of Floyd's death.\n\nWelcome to the club, says the group New York City Antifa.\n\n\"For a lot of inexperienced folks who haven't engaged in activism much before, the realities of the police state and surveillance apparatus can be shocking or incredibly frightening,\" NYC Antifa told The Daily Beast, noting past government infiltration and surveillance of anti-war, environmental, and racial justice groups.\n\n\"Solidarity is essential, because the next person on these lists could really end up being you,\" they added. \"When we all support each other and know we don't have to face down the government alone, it circumvents the fallout of these 'terrorism' designations.\"\n\nEven though the feds have no mechanism to add an official \"domestic terror\" title for anti-fascists, people who could be described as antifa have previously faced aggressive prosecution when accused of \"conspiring\" with each other. In 2017, more than 100 protesters at Trump's inauguration were charged with an alleged conspiracy to riot, based on characteristics stereotypical of anti-fascists, like wearing black clothing. The charges, for which defendants faced decades in prison, were later dropped after it was revealed that prosecutors partially based their case on deceptively edited video from a right-wing organization.\n\nThe terror title is \"a convenient label for them to target activists with grand juries, investigations, arrests, and potentially longer prison sentences,\" NYC Antifa said.\n\nTrump previously threatened to label anti-fascists as \"a major Organization of Terror\" in July 2019. \"Would make it easier for police to do their job!\" he claimed.\n\nWhile provocative tweets emanate from him all the time, shots at \"antifa\" are one of Trump's preferred rhetorical ploys, German noted.\n\n\"It's somewhat of another method of Trump's rhetoric giving aid and comfort to white supremacists and militias and encouraging violence, whether it's state violence, police violence, or non-state groups,\" he said. \"The effort to label the demonstrators as 'outsiders' was meant to justify an increasingly aggressive and violent police response. That was indiscriminate. You didn't see them attack 'outsiders,' you saw them attack people in the streets and journalists.\"\n\nBut, he added, speaking forebodingly of the potential blowback on the street of such a statement on high, \"If anti-fascist organizations are your enemies, that is what law enforcement would call a clue.\"\n\nkelly.weill@thedailybeast.com\n\nContributing Editor\n\nspencerackerman@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Fox News Stars: America Had It Coming. Also Antifa Did It.\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nAll three Fox News primetime star hosts, along with a bevy of Newsmax TV personalities, found their newest baseless conspiracy theory on Wednesday, declaring that left-wing \"antifa\" activists were to blame for a mob of thousands of pro-Trump demonstrators stormed the U.S. Capitol .\n\nFurthermore, several Fox News stars also suggested that the U.S. government had it coming, largely because conservatives are angry over the Russia investigation and Trump's false belief that widespread voter fraud stole the election from him.\n\nPrior to a violent anti-democratic insurrection that resulted in at least one death and featured Trump supporters clashing with police officers while breaching the Capitol, President Donald Trump whipped up a MAGA crowd to \"walk down to Congress\" and \"fight\" for him to win the election he lost.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile abundantly clear it was far-right MAGA protesters who stormed the Capitol, it didn't take long for right-wing pundits to attempt to excuse the chaos-without a scintilla of evidence-by saying it was all the fault of antifa, a catch-all bogeyman for the right.\n\n\"So that you have a complete picture of what's going on, the last couple of times we've seen these rallies, it hasn't just been the president's supporters,\" Newsmax anchor Tom Basile said as Trump supporters ran wild in the Capitol. \"We have seen antifa, we have seen Black Lives Matter, we have seen other leftist groups that have tried to stir up violence.\"\n\n\"That's a great point, Tom, because I am hearing from some people on the ground that there is a question of, if antifa has infiltrated the Trump rally-goers and are fomenting some kind of unrest,\" White House correspondent Emerald Robinson credulously added. \"So that is the conversation that's being had outside of these doors.\"\n\nThis was far from the only time the Trump-boosting cable channel floated the conspiracy. In a later segment, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell-who has funded some futile Trump-backed legal efforts to overturn the election-claimed the riot was \"very peaceful\" and that there was \"probably some undercover antifa that dressed as Trump people and did some damage to windows and got in there.\"\n\n\"I've heard those reports, too,\" Newsmax host Chris Salcedo agreed.\n\nAnd the Trumpiest host on the network, Greg Kelly, took it several steps further during his 7 p.m. ET program, invoking liberal philanthropist George Soros , who also happens to be a villain in Newsmax's ongoing conspiracy theories about Dominion Voting Systems.\n\n\"We've heard about outside agitators all summer long with the Black Lives Matter protests that all the looting was done by, you know, foreign sources from some far away place,\" he declared. \"Look, these don't look like Trump supporters. Trump supporters don't do these things.\"\n\nOver on Fox News, meanwhile, primetime host Laura Ingraham got the ball rolling when she called in during the network's news coverage of the chaos, suggesting that antifa was responsible for the mayhem.\n\n\"We knew this would happen when you had a huge group of people descending on Capitol Hill, when you have members of the Trump support organizations and antifa threatening to show up at the same time,\" she said. \"We'll learn more to the extent that that happened. I'm getting a sense that there's clearly a big split in the MAGA groups that have come to peacefully protest with whoever is behind this intrusion in the Capitol, which by any account is unacceptable.\"\n\nFox Business host Lou Dobbs, who has been one of the biggest boosters of Trump's election conspiracie s and attempts to subvert the vote, brought on Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) and baselessly speculated that this could have been an antifa false flag . Brooks, meanwhile, delivered a barn-burning speech earlier at the \"Stop the Steal\" rally in which he helped whip the MAGA mob into a frenzy.\n\nAnd during his afternoon radio show, Trump friend and unofficial adviser Sean Hannity agreed with a caller who repeatedly claimed antifa was behind the chaos . The Fox host added that he \"heard these reports that they might even wear MAGA gear.\"\n\n\"I don't know who the people are that got in there,\" he added. (Hannity would also float the theory on his primetime Fox show, saying it was possible \"bad actors\" who may have been part of the \"radical left\" infiltrated the crowd.)\n\nFormer Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin, meanwhile, appeared for a lengthy Fox News interview with anchor Martha MacCallum on Wednesday evening, and wasted no time in peddling this same conspiracy.\n\n\"We don't know who all were the instigators in these horrible things that happened today, I think a lot of it is the antifa folks,\" she claimed, citing \"pictures\" sent to her.\n\nMacCallum-ostensibly a member of Fox's \"hard news\" roster-offered no skepticism or response to the former governor's baseless claims.\n\nAnd Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume took to Twitter on Wednesday evening to tell his followers to \"not be surprised if we learn in the days ahead that the Trump rioters were infiltrated by leftist extremists.\"\n\nDo not be surprised if we learn in the days ahead that the Trump rioters were infiltrated by leftist extremists. Note: this is not to excuse any of them.\n\nWhen Fox News stars weren't blaming antifa for the pro-Trump coup attempt, they were suggesting America had it coming.\n\nWhile the other cable news networks devoted live coverage to the Senate returning back to the Capitol floor to debate over the Electoral College vote, Fox News instead turned to far-right host Tucker Carlson for a monologue explicitly telling Trump supporters they are not to blame for the violence.\n\n\"Millions of American sincerely believe the last election was fake. You can dismiss them as crazy, call them conspiracy theorists, kick them off Twitter, that won't change their minds,\" he blared. \"Rather than try to change their minds to convince them and reassure them the system is real democracy works as he would do if you cared about the country, our new leaders will try to silence them. What happened today will be used by people taking power to justify stripping you with the rights you were born with as un-American.\"\n\nCarlson, framing reaction to the riots as a means for elites to strip Americans of their rights, then finished his monologue with this thought: \"It is not your fault, it is their fault!\"\n\nFox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade had a similar viewpoint just moments earlier during an interview with MacCallum.\n\n\"I do not know Trump supporters that have ever demonstrated violence that I know of in a big situation,\" he insisted before blaming the probe into Russian election interference as a reason why Trump supporters would storm the Capitol.\n\n\"I think this is a culmination of four years of them denying that their president won the election, claiming that the Russians flipped votes, this is four years of investigation,  four years of a very frustrated electorate, 75 million that voted,\" he exclaimed. \"They feel that they have not had their day in court, let alone lost in court.\"\n\nAnd, perhaps inevitably, Carlson finally gave voice to a right-wing live-streamer who speculated that \"maybe there were antifa infiltrators\" in the mob that stormed the Capitol. Carlson nodded along.\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Prosecutor Going After Antifa Peddled Antisemitic George Soros Conspiracies\n\nA district attorney pressing an unusual slate of conspiracy charges against anti-fascist protesters previously had a campaign site accusing philanthropist George Soros of funding anti-fascists to increase crime.\n\nSan Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan has brought a sweeping new conspiracy case against left-wing protesters who counter-demonstrated at a pro-Trump rally in San Diego on Jan. 9. The result was a beachside brawl, during which rallygoers on the right flashed a knife and a BB gun and protesters on the left fired pepper spray. But rather than result in simple assault charges, Stephan is pressing conspiracy charges-and only against demonstrators on the left.\n\nStephan has a history of obsessing about the anti-fascist movement. In 2018, while running against progressive challenger Geneviéve Jones-Wright, Stephan's campaign paid for a website that accused billionaire philanthropist Soros of supporting Jones-Wright because he \"backs anti-law enforcement candidates over experienced prosecutors, trying to tip the balance to the criminals.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe caption ran directly under a picture of black-clad anti-fascists-one of multiple such pictures that ran alongside photographs of Soros on the site.\n\nThe website, which has since been removed, drew backlash. Soros, a Holocaust survivor, is a frequent target of antisemitic conspiracy theories, including those that accuse him of funding \"antifa.\" (\"Claims that George Soros funds antifa or is otherwise involved in fomenting civil unrest related to Black Lives Matter protests are false and touch on longstanding, sometimes antisemitic conspiracy theories,\" the Anti-Defamation League notes.)\n\nWhen the Times of San Diego questioned Stephan about the website and antisemitism in 2018, she walked away from the interview without comment.\n\nIn September 2020, Stephan again appeared to suggest that leftist protests were secretly motivated by nefarious interests.\n\n\"We've seen where there's the peaceful protest and all of a sudden another group shows up without license plates, with generators and water, and there's not good things that are happening,\" Stephan said in 2020, adding that untoward events were unfolding \"behind the scenes.\"\n\n\"Somebody talked about subverting the truthful nature of the protesters, and that is going on,\" Stephan said . \"There are movements that are not what you would think of.\"\n\nAlthough a Stephan spokesperson declined to offer more information at the time, the Times of San Diego noted that online commenters interpreted Stephan's remarks as another allusion to Soros.\n\nA Stephan spokesperson did not return The Daily Beast's request for comment.\n\nUnfounded conspiracy theories about roving anti-fascists, especially in suspicious vehicles, were popular with elected officials in 2020, with one such hoax leading to an extensive police manhunt in California that year . Those theories promoted a vision of \"antifa\" as a well-organized, unified organization with significant funding, instead of what it is: a loosely affiliated political movement with some localized groups. People like Donald Trump, who promoted the myth of a vast anti-fascist conspiracy, sometimes stylize the movement as \"ANTIFA.\" Charging documents in the San Diego case do the same.\n\nThose conspiracy charges rely on several misconceptions about the anti-fascist movement, experts say. It doesn't help that Stephan has previously promoted some of those misconceptions on the campaign trail.\n\nMichael Loadenthal, executive director of the Prosecution Project, a research program tracking felony prosecution of political violence, said that some of the case's core conspiracy claims stemmed from simple acts, like defendants wearing black clothing.\n\n\"It has this equation of political organizing as akin to criminal conspiracy,\" Loadenthal told The Daily Beast. \"The 'acts in furtherance of,' which are always a big part of a charging document, in this case include things as mundane as clothing choices.\"\n\nThe Jan. 9 brawl took place in the shadow of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The San Diego event, advertised as a Patriot March, saw participation from multiple far-right groups, and at least five people who had been present at the Capitol just three days earlier, the Appeal reported at the time . One journalist filmed a marcher throwing a Nazi salute at counter-protesters while fellow rallygoers shouted \"fuck antifa.\"\n\nReporters on the scene described a clash between the left, the right, and cops; an Appeal reporter was struck with a right-wing participant's smoke grenade, and documented two Patriot March participants who wielded a knife or a BB gun. (Police reports also note the presence of those weapons.)\n\nCharging documents filed by Stephan's office this month only focus on the fight's leftist participants. The case's 11 defendants are described as spraying people with mace, throwing a chair and bottles, using a taser on someone, and striking people with fists and other objects.\n\nAll those charges, if proven in court, could result in serious assault convictions for individual defendants. But the case is more complicated than in a typical street fight. Instead of holding each defendant accountable for individual acts, it accuses them, and potential other \"unidentified co-conspirators\" of a prearranged conspiracy to riot. This more serious charge would hold counter-protesters responsible for each other's actions.\n\nThe argument poses a risk to people's freedom of assembly, said Dylan Petrohilos, a graphic designer who faced similar charges in a now-dismissed 2017 conspiracy case.\n\n\"It was a bit of deja vu for me, seeing those conspiracy to riot charges,\" Petrohilos said of the San Diego case. Social movements, even loosely affiliated ones, can be sitting ducks for conspiracy charges, so long as participants are seen as communicating with each other, he said. \"It's very easy for prosecutors then to add those [conspiracy] charges to social movements ... Even things like bringing signs, a protected free speech activity, can easily be criminalized because prosecutors think everyone got a memo.\"\n\nStephan's office offers two pieces of evidence for the alleged conspiracy to riot. One was a social media post \"calling for 'counterprotesting' and direct action\" against the Patriot March. Alleged conspirators (unnamed in the charging documents) \"pledged their support and participation by liking and sharing the post, in essence agreeing to take part in the 'direct action,'\" the charging documents read. Others allegedly conspired by showing up to the counterprotest in black clothing.\n\nWearing black, either as a fashion choice or as part of a popular tactic of blending into a protest, is a constitutionally protected right. Still, the specter of black-clad anti-fascists with conspiratorial intentions have featured prominently in Stephan's past campaign literature.\n\n\"ANTIFA is known to use force, fear, and violence to further their own interests and to suppress the interests of others,\" the document reads. \"This tactic is referred to as 'Direct Action' and is known to mean acts of violence such as assault, battery, assault with deadly weapons, arson, and vandalism.\"\n\nThat is not, in fact, what direct action means. A philosophy of pursuing a group's goals without government involvement, direct action tactics can range from counter-protesting a rally (instead of calling on lawmakers to cancel the event) to personally distributing free pandemic-era aid (instead of lobbying for federal assistance).\n\nThe argument that \"direct action\" means violence was recently laughed out of court, when neo-Nazi Chris Cantwell invoked it in trial last month. Cantwell attempted to argue that residents of Charlottesville, Virginia were threatening violence when they called for \"direct action\" against a deadly white supremacist rally in 2017. Cantwell lost his case and now owes his victims $500,000 in damages.\n\nIn the context of protesting a far-right rally, \"direct action could be community self-protection,\" Loadenthal said. \"Direct action could be patrolling a neighborhood to look for random assaults by right-wing activists. Direct action could be helping people across the street because people feel unsafe when there are right-wing demonstrations in their neighborhood.\"\n\nLoadenthal, who tracks conspiracy cases with the Prosecution Project, said that leftist and antifascist demonstrators have been slapped with conspiracy charges multiple times in the past decade, but that most or all of those cases involved property damage, not fighting.\n\nOne of those cases saw the arrests of hundreds of leftist protesters at Trump's Jan. 20, 2017 inauguration, including Petrohilos. Despite thin evidence (some defendants like Petrohilos were not accused of attending the protest), the group was accused of conspiracy to riot, based on supposed evidence of coordination, like wearing black clothing. The conspiracy charges held defendants responsible for the day's accumulated property damage, even if they weren't accused of committing it.\n\nThe case threatened decades in prison for defendants, but was dropped after prosecutors were revealed to have misleadingly altered video evidence.\n\nBut the San Diego case risks setting a similar precedent, casting a wide net of blame for specific actions at a street fight. That could mean trouble for future counter-protests where fights break out.\n\n\"The object of the far right assembly is to sow fear and insecurity amongst marginalized communities and to mobilize xenophobic and racist and nativist energy,\" Loadenthal said. \"Antifascists and other anti-racist activists and community members respond.\n\n\"It's a response to that threat and that's very different than conspiring to initiate a riot.\"\n\nkelly.weill@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "What is antifa and why is Donald Trump targeting it?\n\nThe president proposed the US designate it a terrorist organization - but experts say it's just a loosely organized movement\n\nDonald Trump promised on Twitter this week that \"the United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization\".\n\nLegal experts immediately threw cold water on the proposal ,  arguing that there may be no means by which any domestic entity can be designated in this way.\n\nBut, perhaps more importantly, experts also say that there is no actual antifa organization for Trump to define in this way. Put simply: antifa does not really exist as a distinct entity.\n\nAntifa is a useful umbrella term that denotes a broad spectrum of groups and individuals of far-left or anarchist tendencies. The term itself means simply anti-fascist.\n\nMark Bray, a historian and the author of Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, said in a telephone conversation that antifa is a loose movement of \"decentralized revolutionary self defense\" opposed to the far right.\n\nAntifa conspiracy theories are common amongst rightwing politicians, media and activists. Bray said: \"The right describes antifa as a unitary organization with leaders and even secret funding\" though that is simply not true.\n\nAn antisemitic conspiracy theory that the billionaire financier George Soros funds antifa also has widespread currency on the right, including among influential Trump-world figures .\n\nAlthough the president and his allies wish to conflate large protests in every city with radical anti-fascist groups, Bray says they \"drastically overstate the numbers and influence\" of committed Antifa activists.\n\nThe antifa movement traces its heritage to radical left groups that resisted dictators such as Mussolini and Hitler in Europe in the 1930s. In Germany, the communist-aligned Antifaschistische Aktion fought street battles with Hitler's followers until it was forcibly disbanded in 1933.\n\nThis tradition was revived in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s, with the rise of nazi skinheads and other far right groups. It arrived in the US in the late 1980s, with the creation of Anti Racist Action (ARA) in Minneapolis.\n\nThe movement - which is also strongly associated with anarchist politics - is not defined by lasting institutions. ARA no longer exists and the oldest identifiable group in the US is probably Portland's Rose City Antifa, which dates from 2007.\n\nContemporary antifa groups have a distinctive repertoire of tactics ranging from publicly identifying members of far-right groups, to physically resisting them in the streets. Often, in street protests, activists dress in \"black bloc\" attire including balaclavas or masks to conceal their identity.\n\nSometimes, antifa street demonstrations involve violence: between activists and police, or members of far-right groups, or both.\n\nThe most controversial recent episodes have involved violent confrontations with rightwing social media personalities and sometimes, with journalists and photographers who activists believe will compromise their anonymity.\n\nBray says that antifa's actions in this respect \"are nothing like the violence police have visited on journalists\" in recent days as dozens of reporters have been beaten, teargassed, shot and arrested by police covering the Black Lives Matter protests."

      "text": "Fears mount over Kash Patel's use of FBI to persecute leftwing protest groups\n\nConcern over crackdown on anti-fascists and Black Lives Matter movement as Trump loyalist takes control of agency\n\nFears are mounting that Kash Patel, an outspoken Maga disciple and newly appointed director of the FBI , will make good on past comments about crackdowns on anti-fascists and Black Lives Matter protesters.\n\nFor years, Donald Trump has also called for designating \"Antifa\" or more broadly, all anti-fascist activists - as an official domestic terrorist organization. While that has not materialized into official policy, Trump's top national security leaders at the FBI, CIA and the Pentagon are all hardcore loyalists intent on carrying out his political agenda.\n\nEven from inside the FBI, an anonymous agent has publicly warned that the domestic counter-terrorism strategy could switch from inquiries against the hyper-violent far right to leftwing protest movements.\n\nThough the bureau has never been a friend to anti-fascist or Black protest movements in the past, today's activists have taken note of the electoral changes and the promises for retribution in store for what Trump called \"enemies from within\" at his many rallies.\n\n\"We see opposition to fascism under Trump's fascist rule to be an increasingly dangerous endeavor,\" said Walter Tull, a member of the Antifa international social media collective. \"Many of us are taking far more precautions than we've ever done before.\"\n\nTull believes Trump will once again attempt to hit anti-fascist activists with a terrorist designation, like he has Mexican cartels (another of Trump's major talking points), because \"people who attempt to outlaw opposition to fascism are fascists\".\n\n\"But we are also inspired by the massive opposition shown by people taking to the streets and doing everything possible to oppose Trump,\" added Tull.\n\nPatel has long made anti-fascist activists part of his rhetorical list of enemies. In March 2023 , Patel was a guest on a conspiracy theorist's podcast and excoriated the Biden administration for not prosecuting two lawyers that allegedly burned an NYPD vehicle at a BLM protest in Brooklyn during the summer of 2020.\n\n\"Go back to the Antifa riots,\" said Patel. \"Two liberal attorneys, white-shoe lawyers, firebombed a New York City police car and burned it to the ground with molotov cocktails.\"\n\nPatel falsely said the judge then \"gave them basically probation\". Both lawyers were disbarred and received sentencing .\n\nHe further claimed the only correction to this system was \"a massive overhaul\" requiring control of the executive branch, with a partisan attorney general. After that, according to the now director of the FBI, \"you have to wipe out the FBI\" and close down its nerve center in Washington DC.\n\nSo far, Patel's dream has become reality: Trump is in the White House with Pam Bondi as his attorney general and Patel has already relocated up to 1,500 agents from FBI headquarters at the J Edgar Hoover building in DC. Targeting \"Antifa\" could very well be among his next actions.\n\nBut the FBI ignoring the threat of domestic terrorism emanating from the far right, in favor of focusing on anti-fascist or BLM protesters from years ago, risks emboldening neo-Nazi groups that are already rebuilding under a friendlier law enforcement climate.\n\n\"There is no major domestic terrorism threat, or concern for public safety in terms of violence directed at people, from the anti-fascist movement,\" said Heidi Beirich, who cited well-known statistics pointing to the far right as the overwhelming domestic terror threat to the US. \"The FBI would pursue pure folly - letting violent actors metastasize, while hunting a bogeyman that doesn't exist.\n\n\"And I should add there is no 'Antifa' organization - just loose groups across the country who don't murder people based on their racist ideology like white supremacists do.\"\n\nBeirich believes it is likely that Patel will dispatch the FBI to pursue the political and personal grievances the president has been listing during his presidential campaign.\n\n\"I assume he will use the FBI not to protect us, but to carry out his and Trump's personal vendettas,\" she said.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nDuring the tail end of his first presidency, Trump became obsessed with name-checking Antifa and the protest movement surrounding the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He infamously held a Bible to the sky as armed police rounded up BLM protesters in DC.\n\nMere months after that incident, US Marshals controversially gunned down an anti-fascist activist in Washington, while 750 federal officers were sent to Portland on a mission of law and order that Trump personally urged.\n\nA chapter of anti-fascist activists in Atlanta, one of the most effective in the country at outing the identities of influential neo-Nazis and rightwing extremists, told the Guardian it was prepared and being proactive, rather than giving in to fear.\n\n\"This is a serious situation and we don't want to minimize it,\" said the Atlanta anti-fascists in an email, noting the Biden administration also used its justice department to pursue grassroots protesters. \"However, the stakes have always been serious for us.\"\n\nBut stopping their activism, the Atlanta anti-fascists say, will never be an option.\n\n\"We're going to keep doing what we always do: monitoring, exposing and countering open fascists,\" they said, while acknowledging rightwing extremists will probably have more state support than them in the coming years. \"Anti-fascists may need to take practical steps against the threat of repression, such as adopting even stronger information security measures.\"\n\nCounter-terrorism experts have also spoken out over the dangers of diverting policing resources to pursuing leftists, which according to data, do not pose a serious danger to public or national security.\n\n\"If you asked 10 non-partisan counter-terrorism analysts where the most significant domestic terrorism threat emanates from, close to 10 would say the far right,\" said Colin Clarke the director of research at the Soufan Group who considers himself among those types of apolitical watchdogs. \"That's not an opinion, it's based on data and empirical evidence.\"\n\nClarke did make clear there is a small and growing threat from organizations he described as \"far left\".\n\n\"But when it comes to allocating resources to counter-terrorism,\" said Clarke, \"going after Antifa instead of homegrown violent extremists motivated by jihadism or white supremacy, makes little sense.\""

      "text": "Revealed: how California police chased a nonexistent 'antifa bus'\n\nAuthorities in rural northern counties spread misinformation and launched aircraft surveillance in response to false rumors about antifa 'infiltrators', according to records obtained by the Guardian\n\nOn 1 June 2020, a law enforcement official in the small northern California city of Redding sent screenshots of two social media posts to her staff, asking them to investigate.\n\nOne was an Instagram story. \"BE AWARE ... I have heard, from a reliable source, that ANTIFA buses with close to 200 people (domestic terrorists) are planning to infiltrate Redding and possibly cause distraction and destruction,\" it read.\n\nThe second, a Facebook post, warned that buses of protesters planning to \"riot\" had stopped in Klamath Falls in southern Oregon, \"but there was no rioting or burning as they decided to move on\". The post included a grainy image of a small van with \"Black Lives Matter\" written on the back.\n\nElizabeth Barkley, then chief of the California Highway Patrol (CHP) northern division, which covers rural parts of the state just south of Oregon, asked her colleagues to look into the claims and \"notify our allied agencies in town\". Ninety minutes later, another CHP official forwarded the message to officers saying, \"The thought is these buses are roaming - looking for events to attend (and possibly cause problems).\"\n\nFifteen minutes after that, a CHP sergeant told a listserv of commanders that \"possible ANTIFA buses [are] heading to Redding\", adding that the agency's tactical alert center had been notified. The official said that CHP aircraft operations were now actively trying to locate a vehicle on the freeway. The sheriff of nearby Humboldt county, William Honsal, shared the information with his entire staff, saying, \"BOL [be on the lookout] for ANTIFA buses from Oregon.\"\n\nThe actions of officials in Shasta and Humboldt counties last summer were outlined in internal documents obtained through a public records request by Property of the People , a not-for-profit transparency group, and shared with the Guardian.\n\nThey show how officers in these rural counties, known for weed farms and hiking and overwhelmingly white, were swiftly duped by unfounded allegations about \"Antifa buses\" threatening to \"infiltrate\" the community as the United States wrestled with the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that sprung up in the aftermath.\n\nThe records also show how the agencies' response to those unsubstantiated allegations helped spread misinformation rooted in online conspiracy theories. The files were particularly troubling, experts said, because antifa conspiracy theories have inspired armed rightwing vigilantes to organize in response, sometimes with violent demonstrations.\n\nUnverified warnings about antifa threats and buses of leftwing activists making their way to various protest sites were all over the internet on 1 June, amplified by rightwing accounts, including Donald Trump Jr's Instagram account.\n\nAlready that day, NBC News reported that at least some of the rumors were started by a white nationalist group, posing on Twitter as \"antifa\" and threatening to \"move into the residential areas\" of \"white hoods\" and \"take what's ours\".\n\nOn the morning of 2 June, however, Honsal, the Humboldt county sheriff, emailed staff to say he had \"confirmed with CHP that the bus is currently in Redding\" and that CHP had a \"surveillance team\" monitoring. At the same time, journalists, disinformation experts and some law enforcement officials were debunking the antifa bus rumors across the US.\n\nStill, at a press conference on 4 June, Honsal publicly raised concerns about antifa threats, saying his agency had \"substantiated law enforcement reports\" that \"antifa did have people in buses\" and suggesting the groups \"want to disrupt things and want to cause violence\".\n\nThe sheriff, records show, soon received emails from a resident asking why he was continuing to make such claims \"without a shred of evidence\", along with questions from a county supervisor about his comments.\n\nA week later, however, Honsal released a new statement to local media, once again repeating his warnings. \"CHP confirmed the reports of an Antifa bus or buses,\" he asserted, adding that he would \"continue to share information on radical groups (right or left) that promote violence\".\n\nA spokesperson for Honsal told the Guardian the sheriff had \"made those statements based upon information provided to us by the California Highway Patrol\". The sheriff's office, she said, was not involved in the antifa bus investigations and no bus was located in Humboldt county.\n\nA CHP spokeswoman told the Guardian that the agency had received no evidence about possible buses beyond the two screenshots, and said its investigative unit reviewed the social media posts \"to evaluate potential public safety issues\". She noted that Oregon police had raised similar concerns.\n\n\"A CHP air unit conducted a short search for the buses; however, they were unable to locate them,\" the spokeswoman said in an email, adding that no specific individuals were surveilled, contacted or apprehended, and that no threat was identified. The full extent of the operation is unclear, though the spokesperson said the actual aerial search was brief: \"The Antifa bus mission was a 12-minute event.\"\n\nIt's also unclear why Honsal said there was a \"confirmed\" bus in Redding. A 2 June report from the CHP northern division on \"George Floyd protests\" said no arrests were made, and noted that all related protests in the region were \"expected to be peaceful\".\n\nWhat is clear to experts, however, is that the correspondence between the agencies suggest they lacked \"basic news and social media information literacy\" said Ryan Shapiro, the executive director of Property of the People, who has investigated how police monitor antifascist activists .\n\nCHP had \"relied on obviously baseless rightwing social media posts to launch military-style aerial surveillance missions for nonexistent ... antifa convoys\", he added.\n\nThe photo of a specific van with the \"be on the lookout\" warning could have \"resulted in serious harm to people who are driving that kind of bus when there was no evidence that anybody has done anything wrong\", said Michael German, fellow with the Brennan Center and former FBI agent. \"Based on the vagueness of the rumor, it's hard to imagine why they would have deployed those tactical resources,\" he added.\n\nThe documents also appeared to fit a pattern of police aggressively responding to \"mild progressive dissent\", said Shapiro.\n\nOther records in the data set point in a similar direction. On 1 September last year, the Humboldt undersheriff, Justin Braud, sent an email to staff, saying, \"We are in trying times for sure, and we must prepare accordingly.\" He encouraged officers to read an attached document, which he said contained \"good material on preparedness for the unknown, mentally and physically\".\n\nThe document was a police newsletter called \"Nor Cal Sheepdog\" about \"off-duty safety\" in the \"era of Anonymous, Antifa, and BLM\". Written by law enforcement consultants, the authors said these groups should not be \"underestimated\" and that their \"tactics include attacks on officers\". The letter advised officers to \"maintain vigilant watch for threats while off duty\", always be \"armed and ready\", \"train with your off-duty weapon\", \"prepare for the possibility of being a victim\" and be \"paranoid\".\n\nIt warned officers that they could face attacks anywhere, including in their homes, adding, \"Indecision is fatal. You must switch to the on-duty mindset.\"\n\nVida B Johnson, Georgetown University law professor and policing expert, said the messages reflected \"a pretty paranoid, self-centered worldview\", and that police seemed more concerned with their own safety, than broader public safety.\n\nAsked about Braud's email, the sheriff spokeswoman said, \"During the time this particular email was sent, there was a lot of fear in law enforcement of officers and their families being targeted or attacked due to the current climate.\"\n\nBut to German, they provide a window into pervasive ideologies in US police departments. Departments have repeatedly shared baseless claims about BLM endangering them, he said, but have downplayed or ignored real threats to their safety whether from Covid or far-right extremists .\n\n\"Something that really does kill police officers is treated as not a problem while imaginary threats are treated as real,\" German said.\n\nThe rumors about antifa threats last year were not without consequences. They prompted some rightwing militias and conservatives to patrol their neighborhoods while heavily armed. In Washington state, armed residents harassed a multiracial family that was passing through on a camping trip, falsely accusing them of being \"antifa protesters\". Repeated false claims about \"antifa arsonists\" starting wildfires led armed civilians in Oregon to set up roadblocks , .\n\nIn some cases, police have expressed tacit support for such responses.\n\nIn one of the CHP emails from June, a captain spoke positively about the militias that responded to \"antifa bus\" threats in Oregon, saying that locals \"armed with long rifles, shotguns and pistols, wearing blue arm bands (to be recognized by police as friendly)\" showed up \"to deter violence in their city\".\n\nShane Burley, a researcher and expert on the far right, noted that when police describe antifa as a major domestic terror threat, \"it legitimizes vigilante violence\". He cited the rise in car attacks against BLM protesters, and armed rightwing men threatening demonstrators.\n\nAt least one official in Humboldt county has expressed frustration that law enforcement seemed more concerned with BLM than with legitimate violent threats from the far right.\n\nTwo days after the 6 January insurrection, one county government leader emailed the sheriff and others expressing her dismay that officials had not condemned the \"attempted coup\" in DC. She noted that a local group had also protested at the Humboldt courthouse that day, but law enforcement did not communicate with government employees about it, even though \"police escorts had previously been offered when there were rumors of a BLM protest\".\n\nThe sheriff responded that he had received no intelligence reports suggesting that there would be a violent local protest and said the demonstrators \"were exercising their constitutional rights\". And while he called the violence at the US Capitol \"horrifying and deplorable\", he also corrected her language.\n\nAccording to the FBI, he said, the attack was \"not considered a coup d'état\"."

      "text": "Anti-fascists linked to zero murders in the US in 25 years\n\nAs Trump rails against 'far-left' fascism, new database shows leftwing attacks have left far fewer people dead than violence by rightwing extremists\n\nEditor's note: Since this piece was published in July 2020, the data has changed: domestic terrorism experts now link one homicide in the US to a self-described anti-fascist, the first such killing in 25 years.\n\nDonald Trump has made warnings about the threat of antifa and \" far-left fascism \" a central part of his re-election campaign . But in reality leftwing attacks have left far fewer people dead than violence by rightwing extremists, new research indicates, and antifa activists have not been linked to a single murder in decades.\n\nA new database of nearly 900 politically motivated attacks and plots in the United States since 1994 includes just one attack staged by an anti-fascist that led to fatalities. In that case, the single person killed was the perpetrator.\n\nOver the same time period, American white supremacists and other rightwing extremists have carried out attacks that left at least 329 victims dead, according to the database.\n\nMore broadly, the database lists 21 victims killed in leftwing attacks since 2010 , and 117 victims of rightwing attacks in that same period - nearly six times as much . Attacks inspired by the Islamic State and similar jihadist groups, in contrast, killed 95 people since 2010, slightly fewer than rightwing extremists, according to the data set. More than half of these victims died in a a single attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016.\n\nThe database was assembled by researchers at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a centrist thinktank, and reviewed by the Guardian.\n\nIts launch comes as Trump administration officials have echoed the president's warnings of a violent \"leftwing\" revolution. \"Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate, violent and extremist agenda,\" the attorney general, William Barr, said amid nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd. A new justice department taskforce on violent anti-government extremists listed \"antifa\" as a major threat , while making no mention of white supremacy.\n\nDefining which violent incidents constitute politically motivated acts of terrorism, and trying to sort political violence into leftwing and rightwing categories, is inherently messy and debatable work. This is particularly true in the US, where highly publicized mass shootings are common, and some have no clear political motivation at all.\n\nStated political motives for violent attacks often overlap with other potential factors, including life crises, anger issues, a history of violent behavior and, in some cases, serious mental health conditions.\n\nWhile researchers sometimes disagree on how to categorize the ideology of specific attacks, multiple databases that track extremist violence, including data maintained by the Anti-Defamation League , and from journalists at the Center for Investigative Reporting , have found the same trend: It's violent rightwing attacks, not \"far-left\" violence, that presents the greater deadly threat to Americans today.\n\n\"Leftwing violence has not been a major terrorism threat,\" said Seth Jones, a counter-terrorism expert who led the creation of CSIS's dataset. .\n\nMost of the deadly extremist attacks the CSIS researchers categorized as \"leftwing\" were killings of police officers by black men, many of them US military veterans, who described acting out of anger or retribution for police killings of black Americans.\n\nThese shooting attacks include the murder of two police officers in New York City in 2014, after Michael Brown and Eric Garner's killings; and the murders of five officers in Dallas, Texas , and three officers in Baton Rouge , Louisiana, in 2016.\n\nSome of the gunmen who killed police had connections to black nationalist groups, which extremism researchers at CSIS and elsewhere said they typically categorize as leftwing, largely because in the 1960s, influential black nationalist groups like the Black Panther party were anti-capitalist and considered part of the New Left.\n\nMaking that categorization is less straightforward today, some researchers acknowledge, since some prominent black nationalist organizations express homophobic, misogynistic and antisemitic views, values that set them in opposition to the current American left.\n\nMark Pitcavage, a senior fellow at the ADL's Center on Extremism, noted that Gavin Eugene Long, who staged an attack on police in Baton Rouge, had ties to black nationalism and was also part of an offshoot of the sovereign citizens movement, an anti-government ideology that is typically categorized as rightwing.\n\nIn several of the high-profile leftwing attacks included in the CSIS list the only fatality was the perpetrator. A mass shooting attack on a group of congressional Republicans during a baseball practice outside of Washington DC, in 2017 left the Republican congressman Steve Scalise seriously injured, and three other people shot.\n\nThe gunman, James Hodgkinson, 66, was the only one killed in the attack. Hodgkinson had deliberately targeted Republicans and had expressed disgust with Trump.\n\nMany of the other leftwing attacks or plots in the CSIS database, including by anarchists, environmental groups and others, resulted in no deaths at all. Often, leftwing plots, particularly by animal rights activists, have targeted businesses or buildings, \"and their primary weapons have been incendiaries designed to create fires or destroy infrastructure - not kill people,\" said Jones, the researcher who led the creation of the data set.\n\nThe one deadly anti-fascist attack listed in the database occurred in July 2019, when Willem von Spronsen, a 69-year-old white man, was shot dead by police outside an Ice detention center in Tacoma, Washington. Authorities said von Spronsen had been throwing molotov cocktails, setting flares, that he set a car on fire and that he had a rifle. Local activists told media outlets they believed he had been trying to destroy buses parked outside the facility that were used to transport people who were being deported.\n\nVon Spronsen, who had previously been arrested at a protest outside the detention center, was involved in a contentious divorce, and both a friend and his ex-wife had described him as suicidal. In a letter he wrote to friends before his death, Von Spronsen called detention centers \"concentration camps\" and said he wanted to take action against evil, BuzzFeed News reported . \"I am antifa,\" he reportedly wrote.\n\nNo one was harmed in the attack except Von Spronsen, according to media reports.\n\nResearchers who monitor extremist groups at the Anti-Defamation League and the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism said they, too, were not aware of a single murder linked to an American anti-fascist in the last 20 to 25 years.\n\nHeidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said some leftwing groups were known for more radical and violent tactics in the 1960s, adding: \"It's just not the case today.\"\n\nMark Pitcavage said he knew of only one killing, 27 years ago, that might potentially be classified as connected to anti-fascist activism: the shooting of a racist skinhead, Eric Banks , by an anti-racist skinhead, John Bair, in Portland, Oregon, in 1993.\n\nGiven the discrepancies between the deadly toll of leftwing and rightwing violence, American law enforcement agencies have long faced criticism for failing to take the threat of white supremacist violence seriously, while at the same time overstating the risks posed by leftwing protesters. After a violent rally in California in 2016, law enforcement officers worked with neo-Nazis to build criminal cases against anti-fascist protesters, while not recommending charges against neo-Nazis for stabbing the anti-fascists .\n\nAntifa activists have been the targets of domestic terror attacks by white supremacists, including in a terror plot early this year, in which law enforcement officials alleged that members of the neo-Nazi group the Base had planned to murder a married couple in Georgia they believed were anti-fascist organizers.\n\n\"Antifa is not going around murdering people like rightwing extremists are. It's a false equivalence,\" said Beirich.\n\n\"I've at times been critical of antifa for getting into fights with Nazis at rallies and that kind of violence, but I can't think of one case in which an antifa person was accused of murder,\" she added.\n\nThe new CSIS database only includes attacks through early May 2020, and does not yet list incidents connected with the massive national protests against police violence after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd, including the killings of two California law enforcement officers by a man authorities say was linked to the rightwing \"boogaloo\" movement .\n\nToday, Jones said, \"the most significant domestic terrorism threat comes from white supremacists, anti-government militias and a handful of individuals associated with the 'boogaloo' movement that are attempting to create a civil war in the United States.\"\n\nDaily interpersonal violence and state violence pose a much greater threat to Americans than any kind of extremist terror attack. More than 100,000 people have been killed in gun homicides in the United States in the past decade, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. US police officers shoot nearly 1,000 Americans to death each year. Black Americans are more than twice as likely to be shot by the police as white Americans, according to analysis by the Washington Post and the Guardian .\n\nBut the president's rhetoric about \"antifa\" violence has dangerous consequences, not just for anti-fascists, but for any Americans who decide to protest, some activists said.\n\nYvette Felarca, a California-based organizer and anti-fascist activist, said she saw Trump's claims about antifa violence, particularly during the George Floyd protests, as a message to his \"hardcore\" supporters that it was appropriate to attack people who came out to protest.\n\n\"It's his way of saying to his supporters: 'Yeah, go after them. Beat them or kill them to the point where they go back home and stay home afraid,'\" Felarca said."

Some were published as late as this year by the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and other federal and state agencies.\n\nAll of this material was then circulated to local law enforcement through anti-terrorist fusion centers and other information coordinating elements of the US's counter-terrorism apparatus.\n\nExperts say that the conspiracy theories being voiced on the ground largely reflect those cooked up earlier in the intelligence arms of federal agencies.\n\nIn one example during April and May this year, in the immediate prelude to the killing of George Floyd and the wave of protests around the nation, a range of agencies asserted, with scant evidence, that \"anarchist extremists\" were planning arson attacks on 5G infrastructure, in a planned \"International Sabotage Day\".\n\nOn 23 April 2020, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued an \"intelligence alert\" claiming: \"Multiple international social media posts related to anarchist ideology are promoting acts of sabotage in what they are calling an 'International Sabotage Day' scheduled for 30 April.\". It added: \"U.S. and European Officials have grown concerned over the anarchists' calls for action, which may have attributed [sic] to the recent wave of vandalism and arson against 5G cell towers in across Europe.\"\n\nDespite the claims of \"multiple\" posts, searches by the Guardian, including of internet archive sites, reveal only one contemporaneous post proposing the idea, on a leftist Spanish Facebook page with about 2,000 followers.\n\nNevertheless, the CBP intelligence alert continued: \"Multiple European based groups have been identified linking the COVID-19 pandemic with 5G infrastructures in Europe. In the past few weeks, the United Kingdom experienced over 50 acts of vandalism against 5G towers.\"\n\nWhile attacks on 5G infrastructure did take place in early 2020 in the UK and beyond, no reputable reporting linked them to leftist political activists. Instead they were widely attributed to a conspiracy theory festering inside certain online communities, and occasionally promoted by celebrities .\n\nApril 30 came and went without the projected attacks taking place, but federal government agencies continued to press the idea of an \"International Sabotage Day\".\n\nOn 14 May, a Joint Intelligence Bulletin issued by the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) warned: \"Multiple social media posts, including some by racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists (RMVE) and possible anarchist extremists, shared instructional videos for the destruction of radio and cell towers, as well as online calls for 'international days of action' to potentially vandalize 5G towers, often citing the dozens of arson incidents in Europe as inspiration or guidance as to how to impact society.\"\n\nThe evidence cited for the warning was a video posted to Telegram, a \"social media\" post from an \"unidentified individual\", and calls inside an \"identified Facebook group ... associated with anarchist extremist ideology\" for an \"International Day of Sabotage\" on 30 April or 1 May - all of which had failed to transpire almost two weeks before the bulletin was issued.\n\nOn 15 May 2020, the NYPD Shield program warned in an intelligence assessment that \"an anarchist group called the 'Bristling Badger Brigade' claimed responsibility for an arson attack on a cell tower in Philadelphia on May Day, stating that 'we don't know the difference between 4G and 5G. All we know is we want none of it.'\" The source cited was \"social media posts\".\n\nOn this basis, the assessment went on to say: \"Other anarchist groups or ideologically-motivated threat actors may make similar claims in order to mobilize supporters to conduct acts of violence against telecommunications infrastructure.\"\n\nHowever the claim of responsibility - by an organization of unknown membership, importance, or substance - turned out to be false, as reported the same day in a \"situational awareness brief\" from the Minnesota Fusion Center, which noted that the real cause was \"a small, accidental fire caused by a spark at the top of the tower\".\n\nNevertheless, by 20 May, the idea that \"anarchist extremists\" had responsibility for arson attacks was being presented as a settled fact by further intelligence reports citing reports like these.\n\nOn that day, the Railway Awareness Network (RAN) issued a \"Situational Awareness Message\" asserting: \"Online postings, many by self-described anarchists or extremists, have urged targeting of 5G infrastructure, which is cast as a source of lethal harm, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19), that is destroying communities.\n\n\"Despite the fallacy of these assertions, they have contributed to the motivations of perpetrators responsible for more than 100 reported attacks on 5G infrastructure through late April 2020,\" the message continued, without specifying how leftists had fed the motivations of any attacker.\n\nThe reports, which are dense with citations to one another or to other products of what Blueleaks reveals as a vast and prolific network of police intelligence bodies, continue a longer trend in associating leftists with arson, which stretches back decades.\n\nPortland, Oregon-based Kristian Williams is the author of Our Enemies in Blue and other critical accounts of American policing. He says the downward spiral of bad information on show in the reports is exemplary of the \"garbage in, garbage out\" nature of police intelligence that he and other observers of police have noted for some time.\n\n\"Police in one jurisdiction will write a report that under other circumstances might be considered as libel, and another agency will take it up as gospel truth,\" Williams said.\n\nMike German, a Brennan Center fellow and former FBI special agent, who recently testified before Congress about Portland protests, broadly agreed. He said that while Facebook had been criticized as \"an accelerator of conspiracy theories, it's not different to the way that these internal communication platforms affect law enforcement and intelligence gathering\".\n\nThe Guardian emailed detailed lists of questions to all of the involved agencies, including questions about whether it was responsible to send poor-quality information to local law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe FBI responded: \"While our standard practice is to not comment on specific intelligence products, the FBI routinely shares information with our law enforcement partners in order to assist in protecting the communities they serve.\"\n\nOther agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt appeared that some local law enforcement in fire-affected areas was primed to believe tales of anti-fascist (antifa) arson by September.\n\nIn fire-menaced Clackamas county, Oregon, the site of several incidents of wildfire-related vigilantism, a Clackamas county sheriff's office (CCSO) deputy was suspended after being caught on tape promoting rumors of antifa sabotage. A CCSO captain was upbraided by a county commissioner after promoting similar ideas at a commission meeting.\n\nSocial media rumors and some rural vigilantism by militia groups then forced both the Portland FBI and CCSO to issue statements scotching the idea that antifa had been responsible for the fires."

Not all those people were neo-Nazis, not all those people were white supremacists\", Melville House rushed into action.\n\nThe independent publisher worked around the clock to get a new book printed following Trump's remarks, and one week later, Antifa: the Anti-fascist Handbook is on bookshop shelves. A history of and guide to the anti-fascism movement, Antifa had originally been scheduled for September, but \"everything in Charlottesville, and Trump's odd behaviour around it, meant we tried to accelerate it even more,\" said Melville House co-founder Dennis Johnson. \"When the president said what he said, it made the book seem even more urgent.\"\n\nAfter an initial print run of 10,000 copies, Melville House has already printed another 20,000. \"It's day by day and developing,\" said Johnson. \"It's really taking off very fast.\"\n\nJohnson had signed up author Mark Bray, a political movement scholar and Occupy Wall Street organiser, after hearing him speak on the radio about the masked, black-clad antifa activists who prevented rightwing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos from appearing in Berkeley , California earlier this year. Activists told the Guardian at the time that \"it's absolutely acceptable to use violence. They are 100% certain to use it against us.\"\n\n\"It was a programme about whether or not that was censorship, and then Mark Bray came on and said 'we have to fight fascism differently',\" said Johnson. \"I thought it was fascinating, and I had an agreement with him to write a book by that evening. The word antifa is in the air, and it hadn't been before. Americans don't have the first-hand experience of fascism that Europeans have.\"\n\nBray's book Antifa covers the history of the anti-fascism movement, from its origins in Europe in the 1920s to its exponential growth in the US over the last year. As well as interviews with antifa activists, it also details the tactics of the movement and the philosophy behind it. Bray describes his book as \"an unabashedly partisan call to arms that aims to equip a new generation of anti-fascists with the history and theory necessary to defeat the resurgent far right\".\n\n\"It argues that militant anti-fascism is a reasonable, historically informed response to the fascist threat that persisted after 1945 and that has become especially menacing in recent years. You may not walk away from this book a convinced anti-fascist, but at least you will understand that anti-fascism is a legitimate political tradition growing out of a century of global struggle,\" he writes. \"I hope Antifa will aid and inspire those who will take up the fight against fascism in the years to come so that someday there will be no need for this book.\"\n\nJohnson said that \"people are very puzzled by the president's support of Nazis\" in America. \"Most of us have someone who fought the Nazis, and people don't know how to respond,\" he said. \"People are puzzled by how to react - should they stand up to violence with violence, or should they not?\"\n\nOne \"classic anti-fascist situation\" was seen in Charlottesville, he said, when a group of antifa activists protected a group of clergy. One of them, Reverend Seth Wispelwey told ThinkProgress after: \"A group of white supremacists broke through our line with shields. Some of them were screaming and spitting slurs [as they] physically shoved clergy aside with their shields. That's when antifa saved our lives.\"\n\nOne of the most fundamental principles of antifa is \"no platform for fascism\", Bray argues , and is a rejection of \"the liberal notion that fascism is a school of thought worthy of open debate and consideration.\" Their activities include educational campaigns, working with communities, monitoring fascist individuals and being prepared to \"physically confront the far right when necessary\".\n\n\"Though this last facet of anti-fascism gets the most attention, it is actually only a small fraction of the thankless drudgery that is committing oneself to tracking the scum of the earth,\" Bray said.\n\nAntifa is the first in what Johnson said will be a series on the current political climate in the US. The next book, which is not by Bray, will cover impeachment. \"The word Trump never appears in the book, but it is a history of impeachment, and what the rules are,\" Johnson said. \"It's something we've concocted on how to deal with the political situation in the US. It is just all-consuming, and we're trying to put out books to help deal with it.\""

      "text": "And Tomorrow the Entire World review - German antifa drama skewers left and right\n\nJulia von Heinz's film brings current conflicts to Venice, as a law student in an anti-fascist group finds everyone is compromised\n\nR aised in a good German family, 20-year-old Luisa (Mala Emde) is now in open revolt, part of a different breed of good family. She's a first-year law student and ardent antifa warrior, determined to defeat a resurgent wave of neo-Nazis in her town. Her parents are part of a local hunting group and like to hang up their kills in the woods - but Luisa is now veggie and wants no part of that world. \"A pity,\" says her dad. \"You were always our best shot.\"\n\nThis year's Venice film festival has been notably lacking in big studio films and this has freed up space for the occasional rogue interloper or narrow-eyed insurrectionist. And Tomorrow the Entire World, by the German writer-director Julia von Heinz, blasts on to the Lido to tell us about harsh reality and the current field of conflict; a terrain that's at once under our very noses and impossibly removed from the sunny tourist haunts of Venice. The tale drifts and falters when I wished it would have hit home with more conviction, but that may be partly the point. The struggle is endless, unwinnable. Everybody is compromised.\n\nWe're in the city of Mannheim, although it could be any number of others. Von Heinz's drama unfolds in a no man's land of underpasses, kebab shops and unclaimed ground. It's a place of doorstep drinkers and bus-shelter smokers, a place to be fought over by left and right alike. In class, Luisa learns that the German constitution allows for pre-emptive action to be taken against non-democratic groups. But who makes that call? Who decides which group is which? It depends which end of the telescope you're looking down.\n\nOn TV, for instance, the newsreader refers to \"clashes between rightwing protesters and leftwing protesters\" and the blithe moral equivalence - the reductive even-handedness of the comment - immediately sticks in the craw. But, in the case of P31, Luisa's antifa collective, it may not be entirely wide of the mark. The group is led by Noah Saavedra's preening, macho Alfa (the name is a little too on-the-nose), who appears to have little interest in ideology and idealism beyond the opportunities they provide to pick fights or get laid. Alfa, by and large, is in antifa for the thrill, and his unconvincing relationship with Luisa is probably the film's weak link.\n\nOr perhaps what Von Heinz is showing is a crucial changing of the guard: the way in which a new arrival such as Luisa - for all her baggage and privilege - can redirect the movement back to its core principles. Tellingly, this is a film full of flawed men. They're either playing the role of a pound-shop Che Guevara, like Alfa, or living a lonely hermit's existence like Dietmar (Andreas Lust), a legendary 90s radical who's now gone to ground. The women, by contrast, are the tale's true believers.\n\nAfter a scuffle with skinheads, Luisa and Alfa get their hands on a cheap burner phone. This in turn leads them to a Nazi rally by the rail tracks and a mysterious lock-up garage outside town. Proceeding along its stealthy course, Von Heinz's tense, well-textured film treads a chilly, liminal country. Its activists are bundled in fleeces and scarves, warming themselves around matches and rollies, like soldiers in the trenches of a new kind of campaign. When a pigeon beats its wings inside a darkened multi-storey, it sounds for all the world like a grenade going off."

      "text": "Rightwing vigilantes on armed patrol after fake rumours of antifa threat\n\nFalse social media rumors about so-called antifa activists traveling en masse into rural areas of America have led rightwing vigilantes to carry out armed patrols of small cities and towns in the western United States and beyond.\n\nIn some cases, local activists planning peaceful protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and in protest at the killing of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer have been inundated with death threats.\n\nSince Donald Trump tweeted recently that antifa would be declared a terrorist group, the term has gained broader currency on the American right and is seen as a dire threat. In fact, it simply means \"anti-fascist\" and is used to describe a wide spectrum of leftist and anarchist groups and individuals. It has no existence as a separate organization.\n\nThe FBI has said there is \"no evidence\" of antifa involvement in violence linked to the Floyd protests and NBC News has reported one supposed antifa group posting violent rhetoric on the internet was in fact linked to white supremacists.\n\nBut in the Idaho city of Coeur d'Alene groups of 30-50 men armed with semi-automatic weapons have occupied downtown streets on successive evenings this week, guarding against supposed busloads of radical leftists rumored to traveling from cities such as Spokane or Seattle, according to local residents and social media materials obtained by the Guardian.\n\nVideos posted to social media by supporters of the vigilante groups showed dozens of people walking up and down a downtown shopping strip, with many open-carrying AR-15s and other semi-automatic long guns, and sporting tactical apparel.\n\nIn a cellphone video, as a videographer pans over the scene, he is heard to say: \"If you guys are thinking of coming to Coeur D'Alene, to riot or loot, you'd better think again. Because we ain't having it in our town.\"\n\nHe adds: \"I guess there's a big rumor that people from Spokane are gonna come out here and act up. But that shit ain't gonna happen.\"\n\nIn a separate video, a YouTube personality associated with the \"prepper\" survivalist movement filming the same scene is heard to say: \"There'a a lot of good guys with guns out here. I don't think they'll be setting foot in Idaho.\"\n\nA gallery posted to Facebook by a local photographer who has supported rightwing causes showed some of the armed men bear the insignia of conservative militia groups such as the Three Percenters, and the Fallen Saints, a motorcycle club made up of veterans and active duty soldiers .\n\nAlso in the town of just over 50,000 residents, almost five hours' drive east from Seattle, storekeepers were reportedly boarding up shop windows on Tuesday night ahead of an antifa influx that never came, and for which there was no evidence.\n\nThe only encounter that the impromptu militia had on either Monday or Tuesday night was with other locals, peacefully protesting in sympathy with Floyd.\n\nOn Wednesday night, some social media users redoubled their efforts to mobilize vigilantes, despite the fact that no radical leftists had arrived in the city.\n\nSimilar rumors have led to threats to young activists, and proposals that armed vigilantes mount downtown rooftops in Sonora, a city of 4,600 innorthern California, when a local protest condemning the death of Floyd was being planned.\n\nIn video and audio recordings of a public meeting held on Tuesday night in the city, a crowd of about 100 local residents is addressed by a succession of speakers associated with the secessionist and pro-militia \"State of Jefferson\" movement, which seeks to carve out a new state in northern California and southern Oregon, and militia groups like the Oath Keepers and the Northern California militia.\n\nIn one speech, the Tuolumne county committee chair of the State of Jefferson, David Titchenal, instructs the crowd to organize in order to provide a \"visual deterrent to potential looters and rioters, who may not be from Tuolumne county\". He should they should take up firing positions on top of buildings and become \"roof rednecks\".\n\nHe also asks them to secure critical infrastructure and the entrances to the city.\n\nLater, the crowd was addressed by Sonora chief of police, Turu VanderWiel. While urging people not to attend armed, VanderWiel appeared to endorse the plan for vigilante action, saying in a video recorded at the event, \"as for coming out, I very much appreciate it. Extra eyes, extra bodies, standing together as a community.\"\n\nVanderWiel did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the event.\n\nOrganizers of the Floyd protest in Sonora, meanwhile, passed on evidence of social media threats, and said that their cars were followed in the nights leading up to the event.\n\nOne organizer, whose name has been withheld for safety reasons, said that no one outside the community had been involved in organizing the event, and their plan was simply \"to stand in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement\".\n\n\"We just believe that black lives matter,\" they added, but they had been subject to threats, including one from a local resident threatening to \"riot\" in their workplace.\n\nA livestream of the entirely peaceful event shared by a local media outlet shows it was counter-protested by scores of people in \"all lives matter shirts\", and a large contingent sent by an out of town motorcycle club. At one point in the video, a member of that club appears to hurl a racial slur at the demonstrators.\n\nSimilar rumors have animated large demonstrations or counter-protests by armed vigilantes in many cities around the country including Snohomish, Washington; Sandpoint, Idaho; and Bentonville, Arkansas.\n\nIn Forks, Washington, a family of four campers were harassed by locals who thought they were outside agitators and trees were cut down to form an impromptu roadblock, trapping them in their campsite.\n\nIn an email, Lindsay Schubiner, the program director at the progressive Western States Center, said: \"Far-right and anti-government groups are eagerly helping spread misinformation about anti-fascist protesters gathering in local communities.\"\n\nShe added: \"The rumors may not be true, but extremist groups find them useful for activating their supporters and sowing turmoil and division. We encourage law enforcement, media and the general public to carefully evaluate claims and guard against spreading misinformation.\""

      "text": "'No Fascist USA!': how hardcore punk fuels the Antifa movement\n\nThe anti-fascist movement draws on punk's political awareness and network for activism - and right now may be its most crucial moment\n\n\"No Trump! No KKK! No Fascist USA!\"\n\nWhen Green Day chanted the repurposed lyrics from Texan punk trailblazers MDC's 1981 song Born to Die during the 2016 American Music Awards , it gave the burgeoning anti-Trump, anti-fascist movement the slogan it needed - and it would soon appear on placards, T-shirts and be chanted by protesters in their thousands in months to come.\n\nIt was a tiny piece of punk history writ large on American cultural life - but it only gave the merest hint of US hardcore punk's influence on the current political landscape.\n\nAs political commentators struggle to nail down the exact nature of Antifa 's masked legions, they've overlooked one thing: Antifa has been critically influenced by hardcore punk for nearly four decades.From the collectivist principles of anarchist punk bands such as Crass and Conflict, the political outrage of groups such as the Dead Kennedys, MDC and Discharge, Antifa draws on decades of protest, self-protection and informal networks under the auspices of a musical movement.\n\nMark Bray, author of The Antifa Handbook , says that \"in many cases, the North American modern Antifa movement grew up as a way to defend the punk scene from the neo-Nazi skinhead movement, and the founders of the original Anti-Racist Action network in North America were anti-racist skinheads. The fascist/anti-fascist struggle was essentially a fight for control of the punk scene [during the 1980s], and that was true across of much of north America and in parts of Europe in this era.\"\n\n\"There's a huge overlap between radical left politics and the punk scene, and there's a stereotype about dirty anarchists and punks, which is an oversimplification but grounded in a certain amount of truth.\"\n\nDrawing influence from anti-fascist groups in 1930s Germany, the UK-based Anti-Fascist Action formed in the late 70s in reaction the growing popularity of rightwing political parties such as the National Front and the British Movement. They would shut down extreme-right meetings at every opportunity, whether it be a march or a gathering in a room above a pub. Inspired by this, anti-racist skinheads in Minneapolis formed Anti-Racist Action, which soon gained traction in punk scenes across the US. Meanwhile, in New York, a movement called Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice sprung up.\n\nThe term \"Antifa\" was adopted by German antifascists in the 80s, accompanied by the twin-flag logo, which then spread around Europe, and finally pitched up in the US after being adopted by an anarchist collective in Portland, Oregon.\n\nFor Thomas Barnett, singer with popular hardcore punk band Strike Anywhere , his punk ethics and the direct-action philosophy of Antifa go hand in hand, and, with Trump's presidency emboldening the extreme right, the stakes couldn't be higher: \"This isn't just a raft of right-wing ideas - this is actual hate and violence, and the destruction of entire sections of humanity. Of course, I don't believe in the false equivalence [between Antifa and the alt-right]. I think anti-fascists' pre-emptive street violence against Nazis is righteous and important.\"\n\nMany adopt direct-action tactics, whether it be the recent Antifa protests across the US, the black-block tactics employed during the WTO and G7 protests around the world, or even the decision made by Brace Belden to leave California to join the YPG, the far-left Kurdish guerrilla group battling Isis.\n\n\"Punk itself wasn't a direct influence on my joining a guerrilla group, of course, but punk did help to cement my radical politics. Being in a community with a certain degree of consciousness and solidarity between people helped immensely in that regard,\" says Belden.\n\nBands, record labels, zine writers and venues around the world have co-operated to create a network that exists entirely outside of the mainstream, providing an off-grid template for Antifa activists to draw from. In America, there is Appalachian Terror Unit , a young band with heavy Antifa leanings from the Trump heartland of West Virginia. In Oakland, Antifa-related punk/oi! band Hard Left have taken part in benefit shows for protesters involved in the events at Charlottesville. In Texas, Antifa are organizing community relief efforts for victims of the Houston floods.\n\n\"There's definitely an overlap between the leaderless politics and the DIY ethos and the notion that 'if there's a problem in our punk scene, we're not going to be able to count on the mainstream to necessarily give a shit,'\" explains Bray.\n\nStrike Anywhere singer Barnett says: \"It's also about community self-defence. The punk experience is like the flow of water. You can put up dams, you can run it underground - it will still get through. It also carries on the folk tradition that was speaking truth to power before there was even electric power.\"\n\nIf there was ever a person unafraid to speak truth to power, it would be Jello Biafra, former singer of the Dead Kennedys and the man responsible for their 1981 call-to-arms Nazi Punks Fuck Off . So it might come as a surprise that he is withering in his criticism of Antifa's actions in recent months.\n\n\"I'm not down with confronting [the extreme right's] provocations of violence with actual violence. I mean, self-defence is one thing, but going to a Trumpist rally with the express purpose of beating up fascists - what does that accomplish? Who's the fascist now? It plays right into their hands,\" he says.\n\n\"More than ever, we have to keep our heads right now. And I am all about freedom of speech, but I think protesting these people non-violently is the way to go, because it lets the targets of the fascist speakers know they're not alone and lets the fascists who show up know that there's an awful lot of people who are not down with them, and a chorus of raised middle fingers is better than showing up with some kind of a weapon. Escalating the violence is not the way to go.\"\n\nWith his current band, the Guantanamo School of Medicine, he has updated his 1981 song and called it Nazi Trumps Fuck Off , but it comes with a caveat: Trump is the target, not his supporters.\n\n\"I usually talk about the song on stage for a while before we play it, pointing out that almost everybody in the audience, especially if we're playing in Texas or Southern California, know people in their family, close friends, at school or work, whatever, who think that Trump is really cool. And I point out that the last thing we should do is to dismiss these people as rednecks or stupid or 'I'm not going being your friend anymore, fuck you' - that's not going to persuade anybody of anything and it helps Trump divide the country. My point is that you don't do that, you sit down and talk to somebody, not blog in an echo chamber. It might be stomach-churning, but you might plant a seed, and if someone wakes up three weeks, three months, three years later and thinks, 'Wow, that person that called me on my bigotry was right.' All this racist, anti-immigrant fascism isn't getting us anywhere. I don't want any part of it anymore.\"\n\nAuthor and punk historian Jon Savage, a champion of the Dead Kennedys during his stint as a music journalist in the 70s, isn't so sure: \"It's very idealistic and very laudable, but it's like arguing with Brexiters over here (in the UK). You're not going to get any change out of that. There is a proportion of people who can discuss things in a rational way, but here you're talking about core beliefs and wishes and feelings, and these are irrational, and they are even less rational when they are tested against reality.\" For Savage, Antifa's direct action tactics are as legitimate a tool as Biafra's more measured approach: \"If you don't protest the way things are, then nothing is going to change. You're reacting to fascism and entropy. You need a variety of approaches, and in politics I wouldn't discount any approach. It's probably useful to have sensible people because they can say, 'Well, look what happens when you don't listen to me and see what the nutters are going to do.'\n\nFor Barnett, even the current terminology is under debate. \"Calling it 'Antifa' is like calling it this weird exotic cult, instead of calling it 'everyday life'. Every aspect of media coverage of it is insidious, turning public opinion against us, making us a violent spectacle that's both something terrible and un-American, when this is the fucking Boston Tea Party,\" he says. \"If people want to talk about how the heritage of American culture and our patriotic destiny fits in [to anti-fascism] - it's basic math to me, and to many, many others.\"\n\nBiafra and Strike Anywhere's Thomas Barnett at least find some accord on the rebranding of the right, however. \"You know what they called the alt-right two years ago? Neo-fucking-Nazis!\" says Biafra. \"Now it's alt-right, like alt-country or alternative pop music.\"\n\nBarnett concurs: \"They don't get to be alt-right. They just get to be digital-age Nazis, or white supremacists or terrorists. And that's what [the media] are doing to anti-fascist action.\"\n\nRegardless, Barnett says the antifascist movement isn't taking anything for granted. \"These rallies, whatever the next one is, whatever form it takes, are Trojan-horse events to invite and welcome white terrorist groups, and are just platforms for them to go into communities to hurt and intimidate people. And that's what anti-fascist action has always known, and that's what the punks have always known.\"\n\nOr, in the bald terms of someone who put his teenage years in a punk band called Warkrime behind him to go and fight in an actual war, former YPG militia member Belden says: \"When I was younger my friends and I used to beat the shit out Nazis that would roll out to punk shows [in California]. And guess what? They'd leave and never come back. Violence works.\""

      "text": "Intelligence report appeared to endorse view leftwing protesters were 'terrorists'\n\nExperts say the report produced before the Charlottesville rally mischaracterizes the dynamics of the street violence\n\nAn intelligence report produced for law enforcement agencies in the months before the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, in which a neo-Nazi killed one protester by driving a car into a crowd, appeared to endorse a view that leftist demonstrators were \"terrorists\" and at least equally as responsible for street violence as white nationalists, the Guardian can reveal.\n\nThe report , Antifa/Anti-antifa: Violence in the Streets, was produced by the Regional Organized Crime Information Center (ROCIC) in May 2017. It was obtained with a Foia request from the not-for-profit transparency group Property of the People . Antifa is the name given to groups of leftwing protests who confront white nationalists, often violently.\n\nExperts say the report mischaracterizes the dynamics of the street violence that was emerging at that time, and is mistaken in characterizing white nationalist groups as \"anti-antifa\", suggesting they act in opposition to leftwing groups or out of a sense of anarchism rather than having their own political and violent agenda.\n\nROCIC is one of six Regional Intelligence Sharing System (RISS) Centers throughout the country. RISS is a federally funded program designed to share intelligence between federal, state and local agencies. ROCIC serves 14 southern states, including Virginia, the site of the 2017 Unite the Right rally.\n\nDocuments accompanying the Foia request indicate that the US Secret Service was among the agencies that the report was provided to.\n\nThe report frames political street violence in America as an evenly-poised battle between \"antifa's\", described as \"an alliance between anarchists and communists to confront and defeat fascists and white supremacists by whatever means necessary\", and \"anti-antifa, a loose collection of white supremacists, neo-Nazis, white nationalists, Ku Klux Klanners, white identity groups and a group called the alt-right\".\n\nThe report blames the two sides equally for the violence, continuing: \"So it's the anarchists versus the nationalists, the communists versus the Nazis, the leftwing extremists versus the rightwing extremists and the confrontations are becoming more violent and destructive.\"\n\nMichael German, a former FBI agent who infiltrated far right groups in the 1990s, and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the report's framing was wrong.\n\n\"Somehow they have this set up almost like antifa is the antagonist, and anti-antifa has developed to resist it,\" he said \"What it seems to do is completely whitewash the history of white supremacist violence in this country.\"\n\nGerman said that framing it this way belies the way in which \"far-right groups use these public spectacles as the method to incite violence. And they come knowing that it will attract protest groups from the community.\"\n\nSuch groups \"intentionally go to places to provoke protesters to come out, and they go armed for a real street fight\", German said.\n\nThe report also reproduces an opinion piece by Republican National Committee member Shawn Steel, on clashes at UC Berkeley in February 2017, first published in the conservative Washington Times. The excerpted text reads \"the mob of antifa terrorists that violently attacked the [student union] ... were as much declaring war on the ideology of the man for whom the building is named (Martin Luther King) and its citizens. America's left was sending a message: Violence is the answer.\"\n\nThe report takes the description of anti-fascists as \"terrorists\" at face value, something many experts disagree with.\n\nMark Bray, a lecturer at Dartmouth College and author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook , said the \"anti-antifa\" designation for American far-right groups is also potentially misleading.\n\n\"I don't get the sense that that is the main source of their self-identification,\" he said.\n\nThe report makes further assertions about the relationship between the groups that experts say are unsupported by facts. At one point, the report says: \"The antifa can be considered leftwing anarchism and the anti-antifa can be considered rightwing anarchism.\"\n\nBray said: \"That's ludicrous ... most of these rightwing groups are not opposed to the state as a form of social organization. Many of them are fascists of some sort or another and believe in a strong state.\"\n\nShane Burley, the author of Fascism Today: What it is and how to fight it, agreed, saying that \"this idea that it's rightwing anarchists, that's not a phenomenon, that's not a thing that actually exists\".\n\nThe report is heavily redacted, but spends much of its unredacted length discussing alleged antifascist violence, and sometimes implicitly blames those groups for violence visited upon them.\n\nAt one point, it focuses in particular on an event in Sacramento in June 2016, which led the FBI to open a controversial investigation on a leftwing group.\n\nAt that time, groups including By Any Means Necessary (Bamn) organized a counter-protest against a white supremacist rally which included members of the Traditionalist Workers party and the Golden State Skinheads, some of whom were wielding knives. Several people were stabbed at the event, including at least seven counter-protesters.\n\nFollowing this event, California law enforcement cooperated with neo-Nazis to identify counter-protesters, pursued charges against counter-protesters, including stabbing victims and did not prosecute neo-Nazis over the stabbings.\n\nIn February, the Guardian revealed that the FBI had responded to the event by surveilling and investigating Bamn.\n\nIn the ROCIC report there is also no discussion of the specific groups actively organizing the Unite the Right rally not long after the report's publication date. Neo-confederate groups such as the League of the South; neo-Nazi and Identitarian groups such as Vanguard America, the National Socialist Movement, the Rise Above Movement and Identity Evropa; and street-fighting groups such as the Fraternal Order of Alt Knights and the Proud Boys are not mentioned.\n\nAll of these groups were involved in the demonstration in Charlottesville, which culminated in the killing of Heather Heyer by James Alex Fields, who marched with Vanguard America.\n\nThe report also extensively sources information from conservative media and rightwing advocacy groups. It quotes a report from Glenn Beck's the Blaze, which cites the Washington Times, and Laura Ingraham's conservative lifestyle website LifeZette alongside more reputable sources, including the Guardian.\n\nBray criticized the thinness of the report's sourcing. \"There's a wealth of literature out there about the nature of far-right politics in Europe and the United States. It just sounds like someone got tasked with Googling this,\" he added.\n\nRyan Shapiro, the executive director of Property of the People, which sourced the documents, said: \"US intelligence agencies have a long, sad history of targeting progressive movements as threats to American security\"\n\nNeither ROCIC nor RISS replied to repeated requests for comment on the report."

      "text": "He Tweeted That He Was the Leader of Antifa. Then the FBI Asked Him to Be an Informant.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Charlotte, North Carolina, man tweeted in protest because he thought the Trump administration's designation of antifa as a terror group was absurd.\n\nIt all began with a tweet. Chandler Wirostek, of Charlotte, North Carolina, was reading the news last Monday when he saw that the attorney general had declared that the leaderless anti-fascist movement known as antifa was engaged in domestic terrorism. The 24-year-old found the notion absurd, so he decided to say something.\n\nAddressing himself to the FBI's main Twitter account and the bureau's Charlotte office, Wirostek wrote: \"Hi, I am the leader of Charlotte, NC Antifa. DM me for my address, or I can turn myself in. I'd be happy to let you test your bullshit terrorism statute in a U.S. court. Anyone who thinks antifascists are the bad guys are fascists.\" Wirostek signed the tweet, \"#IAMAntifa.\"\n\nTwo days later, the bureau came calling. \"First, they called my mom,\" Wirostek told The Intercept. When the FBI finally reached him, Wirostek was in his kitchen. With his phone on speaker, a friend filmed a portion of the conversation, which Wirostek shared with The Intercept.\n\n\"What makes you email the FBI saying you're the leader of antifa in Charlotte?\" the agent on the other end of the line asked.\n\nWirostek explained that he was not, in fact, the local leader of antifa, and that the tweet \"was just a statement of solidarity.\" By that point, his friend had stopped filming the call, but according to Wirostek, the agent told him that's what he suspected and that he was simply following a supervisor's orders. He asked Wirostek if he knew any antifa members or had any information about the movement's structure. After a bit of small talk, the agent asked the young man if he would be interested in becoming an informant for the FBI.\n\nWhile he did not mention antifa directly, Wirostek felt that the agent's previous questions about the anti-fascist movement made the bureau's interests abundantly clear.\n\n\"Sure,\" Wirostek told him. \"Just send me the information.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nShelley Lynch, a public affairs specialist at the FBI's Charlotte office, said Wirostek's experience was simply the result of run-of-the-mill police work. \"While I cannot comment on any specific social media post, I can say the FBI receives information from the public in a variety of ways including online/email, via phone, or as a walk-in to one of our local offices,\" Lynch said in an email to The Intercept. \"The same way we would return a phone call from a citizen, it is not [un]usual for us to reach out to someone directly who tried to contact us via social media to see if they need assistance.\"\n\nThe Intercept also contacted the FBI's headquarters in Washington, D.C. to see if the bureau has augmented its approach to social media posts concerning antifa in light of the attorney general's recent statement, which reported that the Department of Justice had activated all 56 Joint Terrorism Task Forces - bodies that coordinate between federal investigators and local law enforcement - in a hunt to \"identify criminal organizers and instigators\" affiliated with the anti-fascist movement.\n\nThe FBI responded to the inquiry with a statement that did not address the question. \"The FBI is supporting our state, local, and federal law enforcement partners with maintaining public safety in the communities we serve,\" a spokesperson at FBI headquarters said in a statement. \"Our efforts are focused on identifying, investigating, and disrupting individuals that are inciting violence and engaging in criminal activity. We are not focused on peaceful protests.\"\n\nWith protests against police brutality sweeping the country, the Trump administration and the political right have seized on antifa as a buzzword and boogeyman, projecting a notion that the nationwide uprising against police violence and unaccountability has been infiltrated and co-opted by a sophisticated network of left-wing radicals .\n\n\"Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur,\" the president tweeted Tuesday morning. He was referring to a viral video showing riot police in New York, shoving 75-year-old Martin Gugino to the ground and splitting his head open. Trump went on to baselessly claim that Gugino, a longtime activist with nonviolent protest movements such as the Plowshares and the Catholic worker, \"fell harder than was pushed.\"\n\n\"Could be a set up?\" the president wrote.\n\nTrump's words were the latest example of a steadily expanding antifa paranoia that has infected both American citizens and law enforcement. In Klamath Falls, Oregon, a wave of Facebook-assisted conspiracy theories spread word that antifa was coming to town by the busloads, prompting local residents to take up arms and flood the streets. The New York Police Department, meanwhile, has turned over residents arrested for curfew violations to FBI agents for interrogations about their political beliefs .\n\nMichael German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice and former FBI agent, said Wirostek's experience had the signs of a rank-and-file agent being given an assignment that he knew to be meritless, and going through the motions to satisfy his boss. That said, the fact that at least some FBI supervisors are apparently directing their subordinates to run-down low-level, antifa-related information suggested a deeper problem.\n\n\"Based on the reporting coming out of New York that FBI agents are interrogating detainees that are arrested at protests, whether they're involved in some kind of misconduct or just out after curfew, for antifa information is a dangerous sign,\" German told The Intercept. \"It appears that the FBI is trying to make President Trump's tantrum come true, and willing to use questionable methods in order for that to happen.\"\n\nRecently, the FBI's Charlotte office notified the public of a pattern of spoofers making calls pretending to be special agents, so late last week, Wirostek called the office back to confirm that the person who reached to him did in fact work for the bureau. After explaining his experience to an operator, Wirostek received another call from the agent he spoke to earlier, who identified himself as Newsome. He did not give his first name.\n\nWirostek told The Intercept that he had no intention of actually helping the FBI, though he was interested in what the on-boarding process for a federal snitch might look like. \"I just kind of wanted to get that information,\" he explained.\n\nWith a degree in political science, Wirostek works in the anti-money laundering department of a bank. Having come of age during the war on terror, he developed a deep concern regarding the \"coercive power of the state,\" he explained, particularly as it pertains to the expression of political views that challenge or question that power. With plans to go to law school in the fall, Wirostek has avoided physically joining the protests out of concern that he might be arrested. He described his tweet as his way of speaking out against an inexcusable attempt to criminalize anti-fascist dissent.\n\n\"I'm not involved with it in any way,\" he explained. \"But I do support them and don't really want them to be labeled a terrorist organization.\"\n\nOnline, Wirostek's Twitter avatar is a Japanese ad for the movie \"Point Break\" featuring Keanu Reeves. The image has its own page on the website \" Know Your Meme .\" Anyone with basic familiarity with the internet, or anti-fascism, for that matter, could see that Wirostek's post was not grounded in reality - so why did the country's premiere domestic intelligence and law enforcement agency choose to follow up?\n\nIt's possible that despite seeing itself as a cutting-edge army of investigators, the FBI remains largely internet illiterate - agent Newsome, after all, repeatedly referred to Wirostek's tweet as an \"email.\" Wirostek is not so sure: \"It seems like obviously that's not a real lead to follow up on.\" Alternatively, it could be the case that the bureau knew the claim was untrue, and that the purpose of the call was not to investigate the substance of the tweet, but to send a message to those who would show support for a movement that the Trump administration has deemed an enemy.\n\nIf that's the case, Wirostek said, then the bureau had a degree of success. \"I'm definitely thinking and being hesitant before I say anything online,\" he explained, \"which could be the intention of those types of calls, to kind of chill speech.\"\n\nWhile he was not the subject of direct surveillance, Wirostek recognizes that his interaction with the FBI could result in his placement on one of the many opaque and often invasive watch lists that U.S. law enforcement maintains. That kind of surveillance, he argued, which the United States has embraced with historic vigor in the years following the September 11 attacks: \"definitely chills political discourse, even if it's not explicit.\"\n\nUpdate: June 9, 2020, 1:11 p.m. ET This story has been updated to include a response from FBI headquarters received after publication.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "The Life and Death of an Anti-Fascist\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nSean Kealiher was a defining presence on Portland's protest scene. Why was his murder never solved?\n\nFew anti-fascists were as influential on Portland's recent protest scene as Sean Kealiher. He rarely missed a protest, and he would have been front and center last summer when the insurrectionary activism he had long advocated for became a staple on Portland streets. But he wasn't. In October 2019, at 23, he was killed in front of the state Democratic Party building, which protesters vandalized on Inauguration Day this year. Kealiher's death, which was ruled a homicide, shocked Portland's activist community. But no arrests were ever made, and no persons of interest were ever named. Those in Kealiher's circle saw his unsolved murder as further confirmation of the police's double standards and antagonism toward the left. The Portland Police Bureau did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis week on Intercepted: While it was largely former President Donald Trump who elevated antifa, short for anti-fascists, to a household name, generations of Portland anti-fascists have for decades opposed far-right, racist extremists as well as police. Reporter Alice Speri dives into Kealiher's ideology and murder, Portland's legacy of anti-fascist activism and its deeply intertwined history of white supremacist violence, and how law enforcement's obsession with antifa led to intelligence failures like U.S. Capitol riot.\n\n[Introductory theme.]\n\nJeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted.\n\nHarris Faulkner: The FBI is involved in investigating the death of a man after a video surfaced showing a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on his neck.\n\nJake Tapper: The video posted on Facebook goes on for 10 minutes. You can hear several witnesses ask the officer why does he still have his knee on George Floyd's neck.\n\nChuck Todd: The video then shows Floyd repeatedly telling the officer that he can't breathe. But the officer remains with his knee on Floyd's neck for around seven minutes.\n\nProtestor: What's his name?\n\nProtestors: [chanting] George Floyd!\n\nProtestor: Say it again!\n\nProtestors: [chanting] George Floyd!\n\nNewscaster: Federal agents sent to restore order in Portland have poured petrol on disorder. What was a largely peaceful protest has escalated into violence.\n\n[Sounds of glass breaking, shouting, gunshots.]\n\nAlice Speri: Very quickly, Portland became kind of the epicenter of the George Floyd protest movement this summer. There were almost uninterrupted protests for 120 days - basically like four months of protests, nonstop. And the police responded really brutally to them. There was teargas almost every other night and there were hundreds and hundreds of arrests. Trump really kind of fixated on Portland as like the example of what was happening, and he's the one that really kind of trained the spotlight to Portland.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump: Portland is a disaster. It's been a disaster for many, many years - lawless writers, and agitators, and anarchists, that's what they are. Sick, disturbed people.\n\nAS: The Trump administration reassigned dozens of Justice Department investigators and FBI agents who have been busy working on investigations across the country, including - mostly - on white supremacist, far-right violence. And he sent all those people to Portland in an effort to kind of build this case against antifa, right? Which had become Trump's fixation, really.\n\nDJT: The violence and radicalism is being led by antifa and other radical, left-wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses, and burning down buildings.\n\nAS: It's just so interesting that they were just fixated on this threat, antifa, that just never materialized the way that the far-right threat did.\n\nMy name is Alice Speri, and I am a reporter at The Intercept. This is the story of Sean Kealiher, who was a 23-year-old anarchist, anti-fascist activist, who was very well-known in Portland's protest scene. It was a story of an unsolved murder.\n\nNewscaster: The mystery began around midnight, and police say an SUV crashed into a building. And then they say, at some point, someone fired shots into that car.\n\nNewscaster: A known Portland-area activist killed on the streets. Tonight, officers say the 23-year-old's death is linked to a car crash and gunfire.\n\nNewscaster: A victim had been taken by friends to the hospital where he was pronounced dead; police now naming him as 23-year-old Sean Kealiher. An autopsy concluded his death was a homicide caused by blunt-force trauma.\n\nNewscaster: Sean Kealiher was active in the anarchist community. He also went by the name Armeanio, and there are reports he may have just left the nearby Cider Riot! bar. There had been a brawl there several months ago between left- and right-wing activists.\n\nNewscaster: That's where he was injured. You can see there's his nickname there, \"Armeanio Rest In Power\" written on the building in chalk, and then below that roses and candles to memorialize him.\n\nNewscaster: Right now, police are not saying exactly what led up to the crash and also the gunfire here. They say if you have any information about this incident, you should call Portland Police. Back to you.\n\nAS: Sean's death was ruled a homicide, but no arrests were ever made; no persons of interest in the case were ever named. To this day, a year and a half after Sean was killed, there is no official update, nobody has been arrested, and the homicide remains unsolved. Even after people came to the conclusion that the killing was probably not politically motivated, a lot of people in Portland's activist community thought that the lack of investigation was very much politically motivated. I was really interested in kind of understanding not so much what happened that night but what was the impact of this killing, and why was this killing not solved. Most of Sean's friends from anarchist and anti-fascist spaces spoke with me on the condition that they remain anonymous. But I did speak with Gregory McElvey, who is a well-known Black Lives Matter activist in Portland and was a good friend of Sean.\n\nGregory McElvey: I mean, it's been so long and to not know who did it - and it really felt like the police didn't care that much. Had he been someone else, his murder would have been solved. Especially because he's white. And I feel like the police know. I feel like the police know. The police certainly all knew who he was. And I just think that like, I wouldn't be surprised if police officers were not very interested in investigating his murder.\n\nGregory McElvey (radio interview): Today, we have a special guest. I'm here with Armeanio, and he is a local anti-fascist, which I think we should all be anti-fascist. But could you introduce yourself?\n\nSean Kealiher ( Armeanio Lewis ): Yeah. Sure. Hi, I'm Armeanio. I'm a Portland anti-fascist. And I've been doing this activity probably for the better part of 10 years now, since before Occupy Portland.\n\nGM: I mean, I met him sometime in 2016. And by then, he was fully formed in his political thought, I think.\n\nSK: I do not believe in left unity, personally. I believe in unity from the bottom. And what that means is in the context of fascist attacks, and labor disputes, I will unite with anybody. I will be on the picket line with anybody as long as you were there to hold that picket line.\n\nGM: Sure.\n\nSK: Outside of that, I have no reason to organize with Trotskyists, Maoists or anything like that.\n\nGM: He knew so much. Like anything anarchist history-wise, he knew it. Like, where they have been persecuted and stuff like that.\n\nSK: The Anarchist CNT, the biggest union - which is actually still around -\n\nGM: Wow.\n\nSK: - and the communists POUM, who were Trotskyists -\n\nSK: - the Haymarket massacre, in which anarchists were killed by the police, and seven of them, the most famous being Louis Lingg, were executed for a bombing that they didn't even commit -\n\nGM: He was very funny, very fun to hang out with, smoked a lot of cigarettes. He didn't usually bring up politics on its own. He was a good hang. He wasn't famous, but he was incredibly influential, and potentially more so than almost anybody in our protest scene. And he was super not materialistic - he, like, he wore the same hoodie every day like a cartoon character; he wore the same shoes, like work boots type thing every day. He really just did not care about that kind of stuff.\n\nSK: What we need to do is remove ourselves from that left-right, dogmatic spectrum that America has and really establish ourselves as communist, as socialist, and really make that point clear. You know, we want a free working class that does not have to have their surplus value extracted from them - as simple as that. But we're not going to do that as long as we're attached to the Democratic Party. They're complete morons, and we need to just cut the slate clean.\n\nGM: It really was often the more radical factions and anarchists and stuff who would protect people at protests when shit really hit the fan. Like if he saw somebody and knew they were like, a right-wing person, like he's confronting them, for sure. Like, he could be alone, he could be with a group of people, it wouldn't matter. And then the other thing is he's not calling the cops, and none of his friends are calling the cops. So like, it was not abnormal to think: Oh, he could have gotten in a fight and it went bad, right? The person got in their car and drove him down after that is what I've just assumed happened. But I don't know. I don't know. Police seem to be using their authority in political ways and that intersected in his life and in his death.\n\nAS: I think a lot of people felt that it was really unusual for a killing like this to go unsolved, particularly because the car that was used for this murder was left on the scene, so police have plenty of evidence to at least start their investigation with.\n\nWe don't know a lot of details about what happened that night. What we do know is that on October 12, 2019, Sean was walking with two friends outside Cider Riot!, which was this pub that was popular among anti-fascists and leftists, and there was some kind of argument that erupted between him and his friends and another group of people. At some point, that group got into an SUV and drove away, and then pulled around, accelerated, and slammed right into Sean and crashed into the building, which was actually the Oregon's Democratic Party headquarters. And then the driver of the car tried to reverse, one of Sean's friends pulled out a gun and fired at the car. And he later said to his lawyers that he believed the driver was about to just drive over Sean again. And, at that point, the people in the car got out and ran off and left, and left the car behind. And the two friends who were with Sean didn't call 911. I think that really speaks to that broken relationship with police that so many communities have, which in turn, makes it harder for police to solve crimes. But he was unconscious already. And he ultimately passed away.\n\nLaura Kealiher: So when the murder happened that night, the first thing that the detectives wanted to know was who his friends were - who he was associated with. They didn't want to know what had happened. They wanted to try to get somebody on the left for whatever charges they could get.\n\nAS: Sean's mom, her name is Laura Kealiher, I spoke with her a lot. And I am really grateful to her for opening up so much about her son and her own life. And a lot of the people that spoke with me only did so on the condition that they remain anonymous.\n\nLK: Because at first I got the call, I thought, \"Oh, what did Sean do now? You know, it's probably gonna be something silly.\" But I knew as soon as they said \"chaplain\" what that meant. They wouldn't let me see his body. And they said, \"Oh, it's just too bad.\" And what people don't understand: I don't care how bad it would've been. I needed to see him so I could say goodbye. My honest opinion is they know that the left knows who did it. And they're hoping to get one of them to do something so they can target them. Because the only questions I really get from the police is: \"Who gave you the information? Who was he involved with?\" That has nothing to do with the case.\n\nThen I didn't hear anything. I didn't hear anything, and I kept trying to get a hold of somebody, trying to get a hold of somebody. I'd call the detectives so many times; never a return call. Nothing. You know, still stupidly believed that there has to be some kind of decent justice system in America - they really are doing their job! And I realized at that point, maybe they're not. They really hated Sean. I think I always worried that he could be hurt, but I didn't think that he could be killed. But he wasn't killed because of his activism - but he's not getting justice because of it.\n\nSean was your very typical, very sweet, sheltered child. He was the crossing guard, he was a straight-A student, advanced for his age - very smart. He - oh, taekwondo was a huge part of his life. He even taught for Portland Parks and Recreation when he was 14.\n\nAS: Sean was the oldest of three children. Laura was a single mother and she raised them all by herself. She raised her kids in a fairly liberal, but not really political family. She was just like your kind of regular, middle-class American, white American.\n\nAnd then when Sean was 12, their life changed basically overnight. There was a family disagreement, and she was forced to move out of the middle class, white neighborhood where they lived all their life and into a much poorer one. And Sean had to transfer from a great public school into a struggling, much more diverse public school where he really kind of was exposed to the politics of segregation and inequality for the first time.\n\nLK: I think he saw the injustice of what happened to us and really being poor, working class really affected him. He went from middle class to poor  - you know, poor, working class. I mean, there was one Christmas I had nothing under the tree for my kids [crying]. You know, I went without eating numerous times so they could eat.\n\nAS: And all of this kind of coincided with Sean being a preteen and an early teenager, and beginning to look at the world in terms of class politics and injustice. As a 15-year-old, he went on a school field trip to downtown Portland and saw an Occupy Portland camp. And he just kind of was captivated by this and he started lying to his mother about going to sleep at friend's houses, and instead he would go downtown and camp there.\n\nLK: Then he found Occupy, and I think he found his calling. He found his voice. He found a way to go out there and say: \"This is what is going on. We need to fight this. The working class needs to stand up and we need to -\" He really, really wanted to help all those that didn't have a voice find their voice, and he fought for that. He took to the streets.\n\nSpeaker : I got you Sean. I filmed the whole thing. Angstrom punched you in the face?\n\nSK: Yeah, that's the one. That's the one that punched me in the face.\n\nSpeaker: Wow. Yeah, Portland Police Bureau radicalizing teenagers, one knuckle sandwich at a time.\n\nLK: And his first arrest, I can actually remember. I got called to downtown Portland. And when I went inside, there were 20 police officers surrounding me at the table and yelling at me saying that was the worst kid in the world, how horrible he was because Sean had a mouth. [Laughs.] And he's like, \"Fuck you. You can't stop me.\" So it started with that. They hated him because he was not afraid. And when I got him, I had to take him to the hospital. He was just covered in bruises; he had a sprained ankle. And as a mother, I feel horrible, because I raised my kids, \"Oh, the police are good, they're protecting you!\" And that was the first time he saw the truth.\n\nAS: After Occupy, Sean kind of moved in and out of many of Portland's leftist groups, and she says that Sean is the one who radicalized her and opened her eyes to a different way to understand the world we live in. But she really understood and respected his passion, right? And she was proud that he was so devoted to social justice. And she credits him for really politicizing her and radicalizing her.\n\nLK: I was so naive. I was the typical American that really believed, you know, you just gotta work harder, just gotta work harder, and the police are our friends, and the government's great, you know, dah-dah, dah-dah.\n\nI thank God that Sean radicalized me enough to understand that the system is so broken. He believed that we need to be revolutionized, that the common people need to get out there on the streets. He really believed that the working class needed to get out there and on the streets. I mean, he stood up for anybody who couldn't get their voices heard. He stood up for it and the police hated him. He was a proud anti-fascist. This was his life. He lived it. I mean, there was not a moment where if something was going down, he would be there. He wasn't afraid to say what he thought. Sean was an asshole. I love him dearly, but he was an asshole. I mean [laughing] -\n\nSK: Go join your friends, and have fun in Portland. Quit trying to fucking pick on people smaller than you, because you're some -\n\nFar right group member: Who's picking on anybody?\n\nSK: You're some fucking sad-ass, insecure piece of shit. Go fuck yourself. You had 12 of your motherfuckers roll up on me and get in your shit. Go have fun with your friends.\n\nAS: On top of what every mother who loses a child has to deal with, she also has just been bombarded by online abuse, just relentless harassment and hatred. And regardless of what you may think about Sean and his politics, the treatment of Laura has been pretty horrifying.\n\nLK: So as far as the harassment goes, I fucking hate Patriot Prayer. I hate the goddamn Proud Boys. They pissed on my son's vigil and sent me pictures. They tried to interrupt his memorial. They came to my home. I have a disabled child and an elderly mother. Sorry - they just - [voice breaking] - the things they said about my child. They said he was a terrorist, a piece of shit, a scum. It got so bad I couldn't take any more than that.\n\nMy son wasn't just an anti-fascist. My son was my, my - he was my oldest child. He was my firstborn. He was so much more.\n\nStanislav Vysotsky: The spirit of anti-fascism as in an opposition to an ideology that believes in an inherent inequality between people and enforces that inequality through violence. I trace that all the way back to, in the U.S., the history of even the abolitionist movement.\n\nAS: Stanislav Vysotsky is a sociologist who has written a book about the tactics and history of American anti-fascists. I spoke with him to get a better understanding of this history, and traditional anti-racist and anti-fascist activism in the U.S., which is a much longer and much richer history than I think most people realize.\n\nSV: Opposition to slavery, and to the kind of authoritarian tendencies that developed in the slave states of the South, that people like John Brown, who are icons to the contemporary anti-fascist movement, are, in some ways, proto anti-fascists. So there's this history in the United States of people opposing that kind of ideology, even before it had a name. And then it becomes formalized, obviously, with the growth of fascist movements in the interwar period. So, the German-American Bund.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney: The conviction in Suffolk County of a German-American Settlement League and its incorporators is notice to Hitler that America intends to shape her own destiny. We want no citizens here who pledge our allegiance. And at the Nazi camp in this county, the swastika flag was saluted, Hitler recognized as their spiritual leader, and the members of the Bund pledged allegiance to him.\n\nSV: There was anti-fascist opposition by the people who were being targeted by those organizations, primarily from the Jewish community. And certainly people on the left as well.\n\nNewscaster: Even then, there were those who foresaw the evil future Hitler would bring. In New York and Philadelphia, thousands marched in protest against the man who wants to lead the world in the most savage war in history.\n\nSV: So it's this coalition of the historically marginalized people who are being targeted in the interwar period, and the communist, and socialist, and anarchist groups in the United States. And so, of course, immediately after World War II, you have the development of George Lincoln Rockwell's American Nazi Party, and the rise of the segregationist movement in response to the civil rights movement, were explicitly anti-fascist in their anti-racism.\n\nJames Zwerg: Segregation must be stopped. It must be broken down. We're dedicated to this. We'll take hitting; we'll take beating. We're willing to accept death. But we're going to keep coming.\n\nSV: Contemporary anti-fascists look to those kinds of groups as, again, being sort of in that historical tradition.\n\nAnd then there's contemporary anti-fascism in the United States. And that really appears in the 1980s. The John Brown Anti-Klan Committee comes out of that movement and out of those Marxist movements, and becomes a formally organized group that represents the transition from that kind of 60s radical tradition into the modern, contemporary anti-fascism.\n\nVivian Altmann: In the cities, it is the racist skinheads that are the most visible recruits to the Nazi cause. Gangs of young white skinheads take their racist ideology to the streets and music clubs, inciting violence against people of color, lesbians and gay men, Jews, and any whites they consider race traitors.\n\nSV: They were some of the earliest people to oppose racist skinhead organizing in the United States and oppose it militantly. So they were willing to use force and confrontation. And this brought them into the same kind of milieu and into the same scene as people involved in the punk scene. It's in that that we see the beginnings of what would become the contemporary anti-fascist movement in United States with the formation of Anti-Racist Action out of the Baldies from Minneapolis who allied with other anti-racist punks and skinheads throughout the United States, and formed the Anti-Racist Action Network.\n\nNewscaster: Not all skinheads are racists.\n\nSHARP member: True skinheads, that's not what we're about. We're about racial harmony. We're of all racists. And those people who shave their heads and have, you know, copied our style aren't skinheads, they're boneheads.\n\nVA: Groups such as Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice, or SHARP, Anti-Racist Action, and the Syndicate actively confront racist skinheads.\n\nSV: Anti-Racist Action becomes the framework, and that's where anti-fascism starts to come in. And the first group to formally call itself anti-fascist was Northeast Anti-Fascists out of Boston, which formed in 2002. They wanted to be explicit about what they were doing: they were not engaging with these structural systemic issues, at least not through that organization, and they were chasing fascists. So they used that. But also because there was a strong influence of European and Latin American activists in that group. And so they brought that European tradition of anti-fascist action to the name. And in 2007, Rose City Antifa forms, and they're the first group to use the shortened \"antifa,\" the grandparent of American anti-fascism. They're the old school anti-fascists, and they've been following this kind of morphing and change over the last 13 years.\n\nAS: Portland has a long, decades-old history of anti-racist and anti-fascist activism, which is deeply connected with its history of white supremacist violence. Oregon was founded as a whites-only state and has remained a hotbed of white supremacist groups throughout its history. In the 80s and in the 90s, it was kind of like a playground for racist skinheads and white supremacists, and in Portland that really culminates in the 1988 murder of Mulugeta Seraw, who was an Ethiopian student who was beaten to death with baseball bats by three members of the White Aryan Resistance Gang, which was a neo-Nazi gang.\n\nJournalist: You watched the fight?\n\n\"Julie\": Yes.\n\nJournalist: Were you horrified?\n\n\"Julie\": No.\n\nJournalist: Did you enjoy it?\n\n\"Julie\": I wouldn't say I enjoyed it. I would say it didn't bother me.\n\nJournalist: But an Ethiopian was killed.\n\n\"Julie\": We didn't know he was gonna die.\n\nJournalist: But somebody hit him with a baseball bat.\n\n\"Julie\": He didn't cover up his head.\n\nTom Metzger: He's dead. I don't cry for him. I didn't ask the Ethiopians to come over here. And they should have never been here.\n\nJournalist: Do you feel you're partly responsible for his death?\n\nTM: The only thing I regret is that a good, young, white man is doing life in prison for doing it.\n\nSV: You see a period starting in about 2015 and moving into certainly 2017, where the far-right becomes much more confrontational and violent in its responses to their opposition. And, at that point, law enforcement, of course, is going to focus on who's fighting. You've got these fascists on one side who are coming prepared for violence, and then you have their opposition. Law enforcement, in their search for order, also has a kind of authoritarian tendency to them and so they identify the anti-authoritarian, and certainly the more radical-left, anti-fascist elements as being the instigators of the conflict. And this aligns, to a certain extent, with the explicitly rightward shift with Trump and the Republican Party. So that you saw in 2017, these mobilizations that were nominally in support of Donald Trump that were almost entirely consisting of fascists.\n\nNewscaster: We did just hear from Attorney General William Barr who says that the protests have been hijacked by professionals who are professional at provoking violence and unrest. Barr says they have seen evidence of antifa being -\n\nBill Barr: In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchic and left, extremist groups - far-left, extremist groups - using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from outside the state to promote the violence.\n\nSV: So the right then gets this enemy, this villain, here is this left out of control that's coming for you, and it's violent, and dangerous, and foreign, and they're wearing all black, and they're really scary, and they're gonna burn your whatever down, and they're gonna come and beat you up because of your conservative beliefs - not because those beliefs are authoritarian, and hierarchical, and are supporting of violence against marginalized people. They're coming for you because you just believe something that's quote-unquote unpopular. And that's the origin of the antifa boogeyman, really.\n\nIt produces and reproduces itself in right-wing media as these far-right mobilizations happen, as there are these clashes, as these things occur. By doing so, what they've done is they've allowed the far-right, the racist right, to move into mainstream discourse. It's how the Proud Boys have become the street-fighting force of the far-right is that they're the defenders of conservatism in Western civilization against this antifa threat.\n\nNewscaster: Boiling out of control as antifa and right-wing activists clash during a conservative march. Watch this. [Sounds of protest.] Anti-fascists pelting eggs, water bottles, and even firecrackers at the Patriot Prayers group. Portland police making several arrests -\n\nDJT: Somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left, because this is not a right-wing problem. This is a left-wing problem. This is a left-wing problem.\n\nPresident Joe Biden: His own FBI director said that - antifa is an idea and not an organization.\n\nDJT: Oh, you gotta be kidding me.\n\nJB: His FBI director -\n\nAS: For many years, I've been doing reporting on political policing. You know, all policing is political, but I've been really kind of focused on the policing, and the surveillance, and the targeting of dissent. It became pretty clear to me in the last few years that there was a deliberate attempt to build this big conspiracy case against anti-fascists and the far-left. But there was obviously a false equivalency that was drawn between the supposed threat posed by anti-fascists and the much greater, much more violent threat that white supremacists and far-right groups have posed for decades.\n\nAnd so, to me, it was just staggering to see people, including police, talk about how shocked and surprised they were by the Capitol attack, when anyone who paid any attention to these groups saw that coming. The problem is law enforcement were too busy worrying about Black Lives Matter and antifa all this time to see that coming. And I think what happened after Sean's death speaks to this climate that's certainly very real in Portland and has been for a long time, but I think that's something that exists across the country - these escalating tensions that have just been inflamed over and over in the last four years and that are not going anywhere now that Trump is gone, I think.\n\n[Credits music.]\n\nJS: And that does it for this episode of Intercepted.

      "text": "Trump's Threats to Antifa Are an Affront to Black Agency and a Risk to All Protest\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nLiberal voices claiming to support racial justice and oppose Trump have offered support for the pernicious \"outside agitator\" narrative.\n\nPeople hold up their fists after protesting near the spot where George Floyd died in Minneapolis police custody, on May 26, 2020, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nOn Sunday, in the midst of the largest popular uprising in at least a decade, President Donald Trump posted a most Trumpian tweet . It appeared to combine a profound ignorance of - or disregard for - the official mechanisms of U.S. governance, a deep connection to the mentality of his white supremacist base, a desire to distract and distort, and an authoritarian (grimly justified) confidence in the political consequences of his raging online proclamations. \"The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,\" he wrote.\n\nIn a literal sense, the tweet will likely prove false. No actionable legal statute will designate antifa - an abbreviation of \"anti-fascist\" - a terrorist organization. Trump has not, in one fell tweet, shifted the legal status of anti-fascist activity or antifa affiliations. He has, however, signaled the strategy he plans to take to discredit a powerful, black-led liberation struggle, while further encouraging and legitimizing law enforcement crackdowns and white supremacist vigilantism against broad swaths of anti-racist, leftist dissent.\n\nBlaming antifa is a move as cynical as it is predictable for the president and his bootlickers. Meanwhile, liberal voices - claiming to support racial justice and oppose Trump with vigor - have been offering both tacit and explicit support for this pernicious \"outside agitator\" narrative. By now, this should also come as no surprise.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nTo speak first to the limitations of Trump's effort to scapegoat antifa as a terrorist organization: For one, as has been stated ad nauseam, antifa is not an organization but a set of practices, deployed by activists for nearly a century, which aim to create intolerable material consequence for those who engage in fascist activity. There are groups who come together under the \"antifa\" banner, but there is zero centralized leadership or membership structure.\n\nSecondly, the U.S. has no statutes under which groups are designated domestic terror organizations. The U.S. government only formally designates foreign groups as \"terrorist organizations\"; the fact that actions are taken internationally by autonomous collectives in the name of \"antifa\" would not be sufficient to earn an official State Department terror label. Nonetheless, federal law enforcement uses domestic terrorism categories to organize and describe cases, and a host of anti-terrorism laws are available for use against \"domestic extremists.\" Trump's tweet was by no means meaningless, even if illogical.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nTrump's anti-antifa statements commit rhetorical violence, and provoke physical violence, in a number of directions. For one, it is a historical racist trope to suggest that black communities could not rise up and self-organize huge revolutionary action. In every major city, it is abundantly clear that these uprisings are being led by young black people. The promulgating of outside agitator myths is an affront to the agency of communities organizing on the front lines of these battles. The divide-and-conquer strategy is as old and tired as any \"bad protester versus good protester\" dyad, which again and again distracts from the plague of police violence attending every moment of antiracist protest. It just so happens that it was a strategy favored by the Ku Klux Klan. In the 1930s, the Klan issued flyers in Alabama stating that \"paid organizers for the communists are only trying\" to get black people \"in trouble.\" As James Baldwin wrote in 1961, \"It is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult implying, as it does, that Negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated.\"\n\nWhen Trump has railed against \"radical-left anarchists\" in recent days, the assumption is clear that these so-called infiltrators are white. There is little doubt that white anarchists are taking part in current protests and, at times, taking militant action. Having been involved in anarchist organizing in the U.S. for a decade, I can assure you that there are simply far too few radical leftists to account for the vast scope of insurrectionary activity we are seeing. And, more to the point, the black people taking radical action in this movement have no need for white leftist instigation. When politicians like New York Mayor Bill de Blasio blame \"anarchists\" for the riotous protests in their cities, the tacit suggestion is that a furious eruption against the constant violence exerted against black life is somehow illegitimate or inexplicable - that it must come from outside. Not to mention, most of these claims are provably false. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said on Saturday that 81 percent of protest arrestees were not locals; numerous press reports found that over 80 percent of arrestees had local addresses.\n\n\"Blaming anarchists and antifa, with absolutely no evidence, is a way to make what's happening seem fringe and marginal when these are popular uprisings,\" said scott crow, an Austin-based anarchist, in a statement from the anarchist platform Agency. \"This is a time of mass outrage at an unjust system.\"\n\nRelated Trump Boosts Video of Dallas Clash Edited to Cast Machete-Wielding Vigilante as Victim\n\nThere are no doubt strong disagreements between those taking part in the current protests about preferable and acceptable tactics. Questions over property destruction and looting and even the meaning of \"violence\" in these historic uprisings are far from settled; I will hardly settle them here, and nor will I repeat arguments that I and so many others have made about the violence done by the liberal demand for civility. Suffice it to say that the government, its police, and the capital they protect are not interested in preserving and respecting black lives. The disproportionate, devastating deadly effects of the coronavirus pandemic on people of color, made to work and left to die, has made ever clearer what was already well exposed.\n\nA woman receives first aid after a driver plowed into a crowd of counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 12, 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, white supremacists and the far right have committed over 70 percent of extremist murders in this country in the last decade; not one killing is attributable to anti-fascist activism. The FBI under Trump has also taken steps to obscure whether it is investigating white supremacist organizations. Whether you agree or disagree with the confrontational tactics typically associated with antifa, the Trump administration's focus on these activities is, without question, in the defense of white supremacy.\n\nSince there is no formal antifa organization, the label is also expansive enough to provide cover for a wide range of crackdowns and retaliations against any number of protesters. Trump has blamed \"ANTIFA\" and Attorney General Bill Barr followed up by stating that the Justice Department will use its network of 56 regional FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces to identify the \"criminal organizers and instigators,\" while specifically naming \"antifa and other similar groups.\" At the same time that pointing the finger at \"antifa\" can rhetorically deny black agency, it can also be a tool to unleash the weight of federal law enforcement against black protesters, as and when the government decides to apply the potentially capacious antifa label. And leftist groups that have openly organized under the banner of anti-fascism will face further threats from law enforcement, which have already escalated under Trump.\n\nSince day one of Trump's presidency, his far-right regime has targeted anti-fascist activity. On Inauguration Day, over 200 anti-fascist protesters were mass-arrested and hit with hefty felony riot charges, all of which were later dismissed or dropped. In the wake of deadly white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, Trump fired up crowds at his vanity rallies with roaring condemnations of \"anteeefa!\" In 2019, he tweeted a threat to declare \"ANTIFA\" a \"major Organization of Terror.\" His lackeys in Congress then put forth a nonbinding resolution , which could have precisely zero legal consequence, to name \"antifa\" a domestic terror group. Dozens of repressive anti-protest laws have been added by state legislatures, in which all manner of collective dissent is designated an illegal riot .\n\nIt is a little on the nose: a presidency committed to policies and politics of fascistic racism, while explicitly naming anti-fascism as its enemy. Yet the liberals of the so-called resistance have been willing enablers of the anti-anti-fascist narrative. As I have noted , it remains a striking fact of centrist-to-right wing convergence that, in the month that followed the intolerable events in Charlottesville, America's six top broadsheet newspapers ran more opinion pieces condemning anti-fascist action than pieces condemning white supremacists and Trump's failure to disavow them. And now, too, the president's dangerous ranting about antifa has not produced liberal opposition; from MSNBC pundits to the New York mayor, the infirm Trumpian narrative on this most historic moment is being affirmed. Once again, as Martin Luther King Jr. observed in his 1963 \" Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" \"the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice\" provides as great a \"stumbling block\" to black liberation as the explicit white supremacist.\n\nThis is not an aberration but a continuation of a norm that long predates Trump. Yet, as with the deadly and extreme violence carried out by riot police on city streets this week, we are observing a dangerous and fascistic escalation by the state. On Monday evening, Trump made perhaps his most formally fascist statement to date. After demonstrators outside St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., were tear-gassed to make room for his photo-op, Trump threatened to deploy the U.S. military against protesters. \"If a city or state refuses to take the actions necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,\" he said.\n\nToday's unprecedented uprisings sit firmly in the legacy of the black radical tradition; \"anti-fascist\" as a label need not apply. Yet, as a description, it should not be ceded to Trumpian vitriol. In every major city where streets have been stormed, riot police have been confronted, and fires have blazed, we see anti-racist anti-fascism at work.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have?

      "text": "Leaked Documents Show Police Knew Far-Right Extremists Were the Real Threat at Protests, Not \"Antifa\"\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAn analysis of leaked law enforcement documents reveals an obsession with \"antifa\" despite evidence of threats of violence to police and protesters.\n\nAs protests against police violence spread to every state in the U.S. and dramatic images flooded in from cities across the country, President Donald Trump and his attorney general spun an ominous story of opportunistic leftists exploiting a national trauma to sow chaos and disorder. They were the anti-fascists known as \"antifa\", and according to the administration they were domestic terrorists who would be policed accordingly.\n\nBut while the White House beat the drum for a crackdown on a leaderless movement on the left, law enforcement offices across the country were sharing detailed reports of far-right extremists seeking to attack the protesters and police during the country's historic demonstrations, a trove of newly leaked documents reveals.\n\nAmong the steady stream of threats from the far-right were repeated encounters between law enforcement and heavily armed adherents of the so-called boogaloo movement, which welcomes armed confrontation with cops as means to trigger civil war. With much of the U.S. policing apparatus on the hunt for antifa instigators, those violent aspirations appear to have materialized in a string of targeted attacks in California that left a federal protective services officer and a sheriff's deputy dead and several other law enforcement officials wounded.\n\nThe cache of law enforcement materials was recently hacked and posted online under the title \"BlueLeaks,\" providing an unprecedented look at the communications between state, local, and federal law enforcement in the face of the nationwide protests. In an analysis of nearly 300 documents that reference \"antifa,\" The Intercept found repeated instances of antifa and left-wing protesting activities cast in cartoonishly grim terms alongside more substantive reports of lethal right-wing violence and threats that have received scant mention from top Trump administration officials.\n\n\"Throughout the documents you see counterterrorism agencies using extremism so broadly as to mean virtually anything that encompasses dissent,\" Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU's National Security Project, told The Intercept. \"There are instances in which people engaging in white supremacist violence get the benefit of the doubt as potential lone offenders, while people of color and those who dissent against government injustice are smeared as threats with guilt by association.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nMichael German, a former FBI agent specializing in domestic terrorism and current fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the materials were rife with examples of law enforcement intelligence being politicized in ways that endangered both protesters and police alike. \"Terrorism is distinguished from other violence by its political nature and, as a result, counterterrorism is often highly politicized as well,\" German told The Intercept. \"Here we're seeing where this politicization of counterterrorism is being reflected in intelligence documents that are going out and are intended to inform state and local law enforcement on the ground.\" He added: \"Overall, what you see is a strange sensationalization of the antifa threats - and that doesn't exist when looking at the boogaloo documents.\"\n\nGerman argued that the impulse to paint both sides of the political spectrum with the same brush, despite the fact that only the far right is actively killing people, is among the most dangerous features of modern American law enforcement. In his review of the documents produced in response to the recent protests, German said purported \"threats\" from antifa were routinely overblown, often framed vandalism as terrorism and were typically absent of concrete evidence of serious criminal activity.\n\n\"It's chatter, it's 'intelligence reporting suggests,'\" he said. On June 2, for example, the Department of Homeland Security circulated a tweet to law enforcement agencies across the country reporting that antifa was stashing bricks to \"fuel protests.\" The intelligence made its way to a law enforcement fusion center in Maine. Last week, Mainer magazine tracked down the original source of the tweet : a far-right, pro-Trump biker who goes by the name \"the Wolfman,\" who claimed that Facebook kept deleting his brick-planting evidence \"because they are BLM supporters.\"\n\nEven if antifa were staging bricks, German said, \"you have these heavily armed groups right there, who have a much more direct and lengthy history of violence than anything antifa or anarchist-involved does.\" Unlike the information circulated about antifa, much of the intelligence reporting in the BlueLeaks documents regarding threats from the far right is tightly focused on specific events, German noted. \"That's the way it should be,\" he said. Far-right extremists have been targeting and killing law enforcement, not to mention members of the general public, for generations, German explained, and in fact, the government's own documents show that those ideas were percolating in extremist corners of the right at the same time that Trump and U.S. Attorney General William Barr were preparing to crack down on the left.\n\nWhile antifa has been a right-wing boogeyman for years, the administration's rhetoric ramped up in late May, with Trump tweeting that he would designate the movement as a terrorist organization. Barr followed the tweet with a Department of Justice statement reporting that federal investigators would work to \"identify criminal organizers and instigators\" who were \"hijacking\" the protests, and warning that \"the violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"\n\nIn the weeks since Barr's statement was issued, The Intercept has published accounts of FBI agents in multiple states targeting individuals with a perceived relationship to antifa for interviews and potential informant work. Meanwhile, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, an official fundraising arm of the president, has been running campaign ads urging donors to send money to show support for the administration's antifa enforcement campaign.\n\nYet the leaked materials show that on May 29, two days before Trump tweeted that antifa would be labeled a terrorist organization and Barr issued his DOJ statement, the president's own DHS analysts issued an open source intelligence report detailing how a white supremacist channel on Telegram, an encrypted messaging service, was encouraging followers to capitalize on the unrest by targeting the police with Molotov cocktails and firearms.\n\n\"The use of firearms greatly influences the scale and intensity of these events,\" a source in the group, titled \"National Accelerationist Revival,\" wrote on May 27, advising followers to break police lines \"with cocktails, chainsaws, and firearms.\" At the time, DHS reported, the group included more than 3,400 subscribers. \"Looting and shoplifting are both cool and whites should be doing it way more,\" the source went on. \"When the laws no longer benefit you, break them for personal gain. If you don't feel like buying something, steal it. If you don't feel like driving slow, drive fast. If you don't like someone, hurt them.\"\n\n\"We ought to revel in the destruction of the police state,\" they wrote. \"It is just as necessary to break down the police state and the system of control as it is to spread racial hatred.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIn a separate document disseminated the following day, DHS warned its workforce that the nation's \"period of darkness\" would soon worsen, as \"violent protest movements\" grew. Domestic extremists would capitalize on the unrest to \"take over government facilities and attack law enforcement,\" DHS predicted, with protests following police killings of civilians \"posing a high risk of escalating to both premeditated and random attacks targeting law enforcement officers nationwide.\" The document went on to describe how \"users of a white supremacist extremist Telegram channel attempted to incite followers to engage in violence and start the 'boogaloo' - a term used by some violent extremists to refer to the start of a second Civil War - by shooting in a crowd.\"\n\nAmong the developments cited in the bulletin was the May 29 assassination of a federal court security guard in Oakland. The alleged perpetrator would later be identified as Steven Carrillo , a 32-year-old sergeant in an elite Air Force security unit. According to authorities, Carrillo would go on to ambush and kill a sheriff's deputy and wound several others in a second targeted attack days later. In court filings last month, the FBI reported that the airman had a ballistics vest bearing a boogaloo patch. Following a shootout with police, Carrillo reportedly used his own blood to scrawl phrases associated with the movement on the hood of a vehicle he had carjacked.\n\nIn the run-up to the initial attack, federal authorities said Carrillo made several comments in a Facebook group with his accused accomplices arguing that the protests were an ideal opportunity to kill law enforcement - whom he referred to as \"soup bois,\" a reference to the \"alphabet soup\" of law enforcement titles - and kick off a broader nationwide conflagration. \"Go to the riots and support our own cause,\" Carrillo reportedly wrote on the morning of the attacks. \"Show them the real targets. Use their anger to fuel our fire. Think outside the box. We have mobs of angry people to use to our advantage.\"\n\nAt approximately 9:44 p.m, Carrillo and his accused partner, Robert Alvin Justus Jr., rolled up in a white van outside the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building. The side door of the vehicle slid open and Carrillo opened fire. Fifty-three-year-old David Patrick Underwood was shot dead. His partner was wounded. \"Did you see how they fucking fell?\" Justus would later recall Carrillo exclaiming, as the van took off into the night.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol officers keep a road closed in Ben Lomond near Santa Cruz, Calif., on June 8, 2020, as FBI agents continue processing the scene where Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Sgt. Damon Gutzwiller was killed by Staff Sgt. Steven Carrillo.\n\nWhile Carrillo was on the run in California, the FBI's Minneapolis office circulated uncorroborated \"online discussions\" between unidentified individuals indicating that \"Antifa wanted to 'massacre' National Guard personnel at the Minnesota State Capitol\" in an unprecedented vehicle-born explosive attack. In the June 1 report , the bureau's Minneapolis office noted that the intelligence coming in was based on photos of National Guard vehicles that did not appear to come from Minnesota, that it was the product of an outside office, and that \"given current circumstances in the Twin Cities, the FBI Minneapolis Field Office cautions that the source may have potentially provided intelligence to influence recipients.\"\n\nThat same morning, Trump tweeted a quote from \"Fox and Friends\" co-host Brian Kilmeade: \"I don't see any indication that there were any white supremist [sic] groups mixing in. This is an ANTIFA Organization. It seems that the first time we saw it in a major way was Occupy Wall Street. It's the same mindset.\" The president endorsed Kilmeade's assessment, writing in all caps, \"TRUE!\" Later in the day, Trump appeared in the Rose Garden of the White House to announce that he would mobilize military forces to quash \"the violence and restore security and safety in America.\" The president was quick to point out the role of \"professional anarchists, violent mobs ... arsonists, looters, criminals, rider rioters, Antifa, and others\" in creating unrest. \"A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero, was shot and killed,\" he said, referring to Underwood and the targeted attack in Oakland.\n\nRelated In Buried Report, U.S. Government Admits Major Failures in Confronting Domestic Terrorism\n\nTrump made no mention of groups on the far right. Behind the scenes, however, DHS was acknowledging \"media reports\" indicating \"that neo-Nazi, and other paramilitary far-right groups, are calling for terror attacks during the ongoing unrest throughout the United States.\"\n\n\"A series of Telegram accounts linked to a wider network of paramilitary far-right extremists have indicated that ongoing disturbances are spreading America's police forces thin, making this the ideal time to strike with a strategic attack,\" the agency reported in a round-up of intelligence reports coming in from around the country, published the following morning. \"One account, with thousands of followers and links to several neo-Nazi terror groups like The Base and the Nordic Resistance Movement, called for attacks on critical infrastructure.\" The agency noted that Twitter had recently removed a fake antifa account \"created by a known white supremacist group\" that had issued a call to violence.\n\n\"Although the account only had a few hundred followers, it is an example of white supremacists seeking to inflame tensions in the United States,\" DHS reported.\n\nAccording to a distribution list at the bottom of the report, the document was shared with the White House Situation Room, DHS headquarters, federal interagency operations centers, and state and local partners. The Intercept sent detailed lists of questions regarding documents in the BlueLeaks trove to the White House, the Department of Justice, and DHS. None responded. The FBI referred The Intercept to an interview director Christopher Wray gave to Fox News in a late June, in which he appeared to distance the bureau from the more strident antifa rhetoric of Barr and Trump. \"Our efforts are focused on identifying, investigating, and disrupting individuals that are inciting violence and engaging in criminal activity,\" the bureau said in a statement. \"We are not focused on peaceful protests.\"\n\nDespite the apparent stream of intelligence indicating that the far right was looking to use the protests as cover to attack law enforcement and create disorder, the FBI, by June 2, was still uncertain whether the attack in Oakland was linked to the demonstrations. \"At this time, the FBI is unable to determine if this incident is related to the civil unrest in the Oakland area,\" the bureau noted in a lengthy situation report . Carrillo's arrest was still four days away.\n\nOn the heels of Barr's antifa statement, the FBI noted that its field offices had been \"encouraged to canvass sources for intelligence associated with violent or illegal extremist activity.\" The bureau added that \"any attempts by law enforcement to arrest individuals\" openly carrying guns at protests, as well as increased use of the National Guard, was likely to draw more anti-government militias into the streets. The 16-page FBI report did not mention the boogaloo movement nor any of the many other domestic extremist groups of the American far right, by name. It did, however, highlight antifa and anarchists more than a half dozen times.\n\nIn Newark, New Jersey, police and FBI investigators had identified \"a probable 'Antifa' related individual,\" who was arrested for possessing a knife, a hatchet, and a jar of gasoline. Though the man's charge was unclear, the FBI reported that it had \"obtained one of his Facebook posts which contained a video of him at the riots inciting others to steal from the stores while he stood guard.\" With the man having described himself as \"anti-government and anti-authority,\" the FBI reported that its Newark office \"believes this profile is consistent with 'Antifa.'\" While agents were investigating the man in Newark, the FBI's field office in Spokane, Washington, was looking into an \"antifa group\" reportedly headed through Idaho and on to Minneapolis. In Denver, meanwhile, the FBI was investigating the alleged transfer of \"riot supplies\" to \"antifa members,\" and in Philadelphia, authorities were \"attempting to confirm if any of the individuals arrested by Philadelphia Police Department have 'Antifa' affiliations.\"\n\nThe portrait the FBI painted of the country was chaotic, with nearly three dozen FBI SWAT teams in various stages of deployment nationwide. The report noted \"multiple officer related shootings\" in the 12 hours preceding its dissemination, including the killing of a police officer in Las Vegas and an \"assailant\" who allegedly fired on police officers and a National Guard patrol in Kentucky. Nearly 200 pistols and rifles had been stolen from locations in San Francisco and Albuquerque, New Mexico, the FBI reported; it was unclear by whom.\n\nWhile a variety of groups had been linked to the unrest, the FBI noted that \"much of the violence and vandalism is perpetrated by opportunistic, individual actors acting without specific direction.\" Nonetheless, the bureau would \"continue to aggressively ... seek to corroborate whether or not there is in fact an organized effort to incite violence by either known criminal groups or domestic violent extremists,\" which apparently included running down \"uncorroborated intelligence about alleged participation of Venezuelan and Nicaraguan socialist groups.\" According to the report, with more than 4,000 arrests across the country, the FBI had tagged nearly 200 incidents as \"riot related threats\" and was in the process of investigating 40 \"cases associated with violent protests.\"\n\nWith Trump hyping antifa hysteria in Washington, D.C., reports of lurking leftists began cropping around the country. In Colorado, a Denver resident reported that they had followed a \"suspicious person\" into their apartment complex who looked to be attempting to set the building on fire. \"Fairly certain he was a member of an Antifa like group,\" the resident wrote, adding that there were \"two Antifa safe houses on our block.\" \"I know this because they have been walking past our house telling us they can offer shelter, food, supplies, etc. also they have been hiding on our stoop when Swat drives by and they keep discussing their plans and where they are going. They have a central phone # they are calling to get updates and where they need to go to,\" the resident said. \"Please nip this shit in the ass. This is the second time in two days we had someone attempt to burn down our apartment building/neighboring buildings. Get these terrorists out of our city please!\"\n\nThe Colorado Information Analysis Center, a law enforcement fusion center, listed the type of activity described in the complaint as \"terrorism.\" CIAC did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nIt wasn't just residents worried about antifa. CIAC also received a request from the Douglas County Sheriff's Department seeking \"information on ANTIFA, and possibility of acts targeting our AOR\" - area of operations. In neighboring Nebraska, the FBI's Omaha office was running down information indicating that an \"unidentified individual who claimed to be a member of ANTIFA\" had posted a Craigslist ad offering to \"pay up to 1,000 individuals $25 per hour to 'cause as much chaos and destruction as possible'\" in \"nightly violent protests.\" In Virginia, the FBI warned that black lines spray-painted on federal buildings was a sign of antifa vandalism to come .\n\nAll over the country, from California to Texas to West Virginia, law enforcement was chasing antifa leads and looking to hunt down instigators. The BlueLeaks documents suggest a borderline obsession on the part of some law enforcement offices with painting antifa, anarchists, and left-wing dissent more broadly as a serious terrorist threat. In early June, New Jersey's Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness (NJOHSP) issued a two-page report detailing how legal observers with the National Lawyers Guild, a progressive association of attorneys and legal advocates that has been around since the 1930s and sends representatives to public protests to monitor police activity, were in fact \"an anarchist extremist subgroup.\"\n\n\"'Lawyers' may be identified by their bright neon green hats or clothing; however, these individual [sic] may or may not be licensed lawyers,\" the office warned . \"Their role is to record information regarding the interactions Antifa members are having during an arrest. This individual will record the interaction with the aid of another member, while noting information. The 'lawyer' will also obtain booking information and are known to argue with police over arrests and interactions.\"\n\nAnti-fascists were bent on infiltrating protests over the killing of George Floyd by Minnesota police Officer Derek Chauvin \"to further their violent ideology,\" the New Jersey office reported, and \"continue to attack government institutions; use violent counter-protest tactics against adversarial groups, including law enforcement; and target political figures representing disparate views.\"\n\nThis was not the first time the New Jersey's homeland security office had set its sights on leftists. In a 2018 report , the office compiled a color-coded chart of the biggest terror threats to New Jersey. Anarchist extremists were third, in the \"moderate\" section below Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula but above the Islamic State. Anarchists made the list again in 2019 , this time climbing to second, just below \"Homegrown Violent Extremists.\" They fell to third in 2020 , however, with \"White Supremacist Extremists\" finally cracking New Jersey's top three after several centuries of organized terror and killing.\n\nThe Intercept asked NJOHSP about its justification for considering anarchists a greater public safety threat than terror groups that have killed thousands of people, and whether the office has ever aided investigations into legal observers. The office said that it \"does not disclose operational or investigative details and sources.\"\n\nThe government fusion centers that produce the kind of \"intelligence\" found in the BlueLeaks breach have been a problem for years, said Freddy Martinez, a policy analyst at Open the Government, a nonpartisan, nonprofit collective that works to peel back post-9/11 government secrecy through research and open records collection. Martinez was a lead author on a report published earlier this year detailing how the government's billion-dollar network of fusion centers \"exhibit a persistent pattern of violating Americans' privacy and civil liberties, producing unreliable and ineffective information, and resisting financial and other types of standard public accountability.\"\n\nThe BlueLeaks documents show that the problems with fusion centers go beyond efficiency, Martinez argued. \"It would be easy to say that the information is inaccurate, wrong, costly, which I think is true, but it also sort of describes what the priorities of the federal government are on counterterrorism,\" he said. \"The government is aware of what they're doing. It's a very intentional, 'Well, we're just going to criminalize dissent any way we can.'\"\n\nGerman, the former FBI agent, described how sensationalized, incomplete, or biased fusion center reporting can have a dangerous impact on the ground, particularly in complex, emotionally charged protest situations. \"I always try to read these and put myself in the shoes of a young police officer that doesn't know anything about this subject,\" he said. \"All this tells me to do is be very afraid of these people and imagine the worst of anything that they do.\"\n\n\"You can kind of understand why their response is so aggressive and violent,\" he said. \"They're scared to death, and they're scared to death because there's this echo chamber of right-wing media, White House statements and, unfortunately, law enforcement intelligence.\"\n\nAttorney General William Barr speaks during in a roundtable with law enforcement officials in the State Dining Room of the White House, on June, 8, 2020 in Washington, D.C.\n\nAs law enforcement worked to find cases that would support the attorney general's portrait of a looming antifa menace, evidence mounted in late May and early June of right-wing extremists amassing weapons, plotting terror attacks, and killing law enforcement officials.\n\nIn Denver, CAIC reported a police seizure of \"several military-style assault rifles from a vehicle occupied by a group of self-identified anti-government individuals who call themselves 'Boogaloo Bois'\" near a protest on May 29. The report , which began by noting that an anarchist blog had referred to police as \"pigs\" and included photos of anarchy \"A's\" spray-painted on buildings, went on to list eight examples of far-right extremists across the country \"vigorously threatening violence towards recent protests,\" including sharing images of weapons stockpiles and tips on sabotaging police vehicles, neo-Nazis encouraging their brethren to \"dress up as law enforcement and film themselves attacking black people\" and calls to form small \"crews\" that would be \"willing to shed blood.\"\n\nSimilar reports were filtering in from law enforcement in Minneapolis and Austin, Texas, where intelligence analysts released a bulletin advising law enforcement to be on the lookout for three young men in tactical gear who were detained \"in possession of two AR style rifles, one AK style rifle, two handguns, and several hundred rounds of ammunition, as well as gas masks.\" The men gave \"conflicting statements about where they had been and what they were doing in Austin,\" the Austin Regional Intelligence Center reported. \"Searches of social media show sympathetic views toward the Boogaloo Bois, an anti-government movement, as well as several other anti-police sentiments,\" the report stated, adding that one of the subject's Facebook pages included a post that said he did not \"expect to be here next year\" and other comments suggesting that \"he may take action against\" law enforcement.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage BlueLeaks\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nOn June 4, the U.S. military weighed in on the protests in the form of a report published by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service , which noted that federal prosecutors had \"charged three men connected with the boogaloo movement with terrorism offenses\" intended to \"spark violence\" at protests related to Floyd's killing. Like Carrillo in California, all three of the men - Navy veteran Stephan Parshall, Army reservist Andrew Lynam, and Air Force veteran William Loomis - had ties to the U.S. military, NCIS noted, adding that it had published a \"Threat Awareness Message\" regarding the boogaloo movement earlier this year.\n\n\"Racially motivated violent extremist (RMVE) movements that subscribe to boogaloo have engaged in conceptual discussions about recruiting military or former military members for their perceived knowledge of combat training,\" the naval investigative agency stated. \"NCIS cannot discount the possibility of DoD affiliated individuals sympathetic to or engaged in the boogaloo movement.\"\n\nA number of the details surrounding the Nevada arrests track with a longer history of militant, far-right extremism in the United States, said Kathleen Belew, a history professor at the University of Chicago and author of the book \"Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America.\" Prosecutors in the case allege that before setting their sights on a Black Lives Matter protest in Las Vegas, the three men discussed a potential attack targeting facilities at the Hoover Dam. According to Belew, the dam has been a target in the collective imagination of far-right extremists going back decades, including extremists linked to Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. \"This goes way back,\" Belew told The Intercept. \"It's not just that there's a social movement that is attempting to kill cops and damage infrastructure targets and attack protesters - it's that it's a movement that has been trying to do this for decades, if not generations, and has largely gone unopposed by our courts, by our law enforcement, by our military, by our executives.\"\n\nThe leaked documents charting law enforcement's treatment of antifa versus groups like the boogaloo bois reflect a dangerous American impulse to draw equivalencies, Belew argued. \"Many reasonable people carry around with them as part of the way that we learn about how politics works this idea that there are two sides of everything,\" she said. \"This is a deeply ingrained belief in our culture, and there's a historical set of reasons why we think about politics that way, but this is actually not a case where there are two sides of things that are the same.\"\n\n\"This is a case where there is a long casualty list carried out by the white power movement, which has declared war against the country,\" she said. \"And there is, I think, a quite localized social movement of people who oppose it, but who have not attacked civilians, who have not attacked infrastructure, who have not attempted to overthrow the country.\"\n\nWith a pandemic still raging, soaring unemployment, the most expansive civil rights protests in generations, and a coming presidential election, the nation is facing an interlocking set of problems that elevate the risk for far-right violence, Belew noted. \"We're off the map in a number of ways,\" she said, and while historians are trained not to forecast the future, she added, \"I will say that as somebody who has been studying this for more than a decade, I've never been so worried.\" What's particularly troubling, she argued, is that the historical archive shows a clear link between wars abroad and rising right-wing violence at home - Belew's book charts that history from the Vietnam War through militia movements of the 1990s. With the country now having been at war for close to two decades, the question of blowback is not a matter of if, but when and how. \"This set of conditions is very, very troubling for people who are concerned about white power violence,\" Belew said.\n\nOn June 6, the FBI released another situation report detailing the state of protests across the country. Though Barr and Trump had pointed fingers at a shadowy network of leftist agitators pulling the protests' strings, the bureau continued to assess that the \"majority of the violence and vandalism\" appeared \"opportunistic\" in nature. With more than 13,600 arrests nationwide, the FBI reported that the Department of Justice had charged 70 individuals with federal crimes, most involving property damage and illegal activities that involved crossing state lines. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had reported 81 burglaries involving the theft of guns, the FBI noted, leading to \"an estimated loss of 1,116 firearms,\" as well as \"876 reported arsons\" and \"76 explosive incidents.\"\n\nWhile the FBI report did note that both \"right wing and anarchist extremists\" could be involved in efforts to \"further ignite violence,\" it was again only antifa that was singled out by name. At one point, the FBI suggested that videos of law enforcement officers flashing the \"OK\" hand signal often used by white nationalists and the far right might actually be part of a left-wing plot to make police look bad. \"Some protestors and possible 'ANTIFA' members attempted to bait law enforcement into displaying the 'OK' hand sign,\" the FBI reported. \"These individuals plan to photograph the officers and use the photographs as propaganda to discredit the officers.\"\n\nWith the election four months away, the Trump administration has pressed forward with a seemingly coordinated effort to link the nebulous antifa movement to acts of violence committed by the far right.\n\nMourners view the body of Federal Protective Services Officer Dave Patrick Underwood after a memorial service on June 19, 2020, in Pinole, Calif.\n\nOn June 26, Fox News published an op-ed by Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of DHS, noting that Patrick Underwood, the federal court security officer gunned down in Oakland, was also a Black man whose life mattered. Cuccinelli suggested that his killing had been ignored because he was a member of law enforcement. As close trackers of the agency were quick to point out , Cuccinelli failed to mention that the man accused of killing Underwood has been linked to the boogaloo movement, which DHS leadership and the administration have been publicly quiet about. Cuccinelli, for his part, has been clear about the actors he sees as responsible for unrest in the country, tweeting on June 5 , while his own agency was raising internal alarms about the far right and Underwood's family was still grieving, \"Their silence is deafening. Cities across America burn at the hands of antifa and anarchists while many political leaders are refusing to call it what it is: domestic terrorism.\"\n\nThe same day Cuccinelli's op-ed was published, Barr sent a memo to top Justice Department officials announcing the creation of a new \"Task Force on Violent Anti-Government Extremists.\" In the memo, the attorney general argued that both antifa and the boogaloo movement \"pose continuing threats to lawlessness.\" Appearing at a law enforcement roundtable in Arkansas last week, Barr said that more than 150 people have been hit with federal charges in relation to the recent protests. Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which partner FBI agents with state and local authorities, are currently pursuing more than 500 investigations, Barr added, targeting \"hardcore instigators.\"\n\n\"We are building up our intelligence on these instigators,\" Barr said , noting that the JTTFs, which were \"previously used really for self-radicalized Jihadi\" threats, are \"now focusing on groups like antifa and boogaloo bois and others that are involved in this activity.\"\n\nShamsi said the Trump administration was using antifa as \"political bait.\"\n\n\"It is a very dangerous thing when the top law enforcement official unleashes the massive weight of vague and overbroad terrorism labels and authorities for surveillance and investigation for political purposes,\" she said. \"Unsurprisingly, given what we've been warning about for years, those authorities are being used in deeply problematic ways. It's law enforcement agencies engaging in unjustified discriminatory investigations and bias-based profiling, which in turn generates inaccurate or unreliable information, which is then used by other federal, state and local agencies in a variety of contexts. That's the problem with JTTFs and fusion centers and the post-911 infrastructure at its core.\"\n\nFor all of the government's talk of antifa, Mark Bray, a historian and author of the book \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\" said he was less than impressed with the depth of the Trump administration's research into the generations-old international struggle to combat fascism. \"What stood out to me is, among their sources, they have zero books,\" Bray told The Intercept, after reviewing fusion center documents from 2016 and 2017 aiming to explain antifa to law enforcement . \"Most of the research seems like someone who spent a weekend on Google,\" Bray said.\n\nIt's not difficult to see why an administration like Trump's might zero in on antifa as a law enforcement target, Bray said. \"The fact that it's this coalition politics of the radical left and that it does not have one specific united organization means that with some very rough reading of what antifa is, you can basically kind of paint the entire radical left as more or less antifa, and considering that there is a broad identification with the politics of anti-fascism beyond membership to a specific group, you can see how that could be useful,\" he said. \"I do think that that's certainly part of the equation and was part of the motivation.\"\n\nRelated Law Enforcement Scoured Protester Communications and Exaggerated Threats to Minneapolis Cops, Leaked Documents Show\n\nWhile Trump's threatened designation of antifa as a terror organization has not come about for important legal and logistical reasons , that was never really the point, German argued. \"They know as well as anybody does, because they're not stupid people, that there is no organization called antifa,\" the former FBI agent said. \"It's an absurdity what they're talking about, but they're using it as this umbrella term to justify militant or vigilante violence against these groups, and also police violence against these groups. They're identifying the enemy - and that's what's very dangerous.\"\n\nIn a letter to the heads of the CIA and the FBI on Tuesday, Democratic Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois and Peter Welch of Vermont, both members of House Intelligence Committee, sought information on the spread of false information regarding antifa. In a statement to The Intercept Wednesday morning, Krishnamoorthi's office said: \"The prevalence of misinformation on falsely advertised Antifa gatherings and 'invasions' calls into question how our federal, state, and local law enforcement are combating, and determining the origins of these rumors. Our Congressional inquiry intends to further explore the involvement of fusion centers in possibly exacerbating these rumors, which appear intended to stoke fear and division in local communities across the country.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has capitalized on the perceived threats that rattle around the conservative media echo chamber for political gain before, and the effects on public safety have been disastrous and tragic. During the 2018 midterm elections, the president seized on the supposed threat of migrant caravans making their way north from Central America as a sign that the out-of-control left was destroying the country. Far-right domestic terrorists cited the immigration invasion rhetoric to justify attacks targeting Mexicans and Jews in Texas and Pennsylvania that left dozens of people dead.\n\nDuring a July 4 address from the White House honoring the U.S. military and affirming his commitment to protect monuments to the confederacy, Trump described the work his administration is engaged in as the 2020 election approaches and protests across the country continue. \"We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters, and people who in many instances have absolutely no clue what they are doing,\" he said .\n\nGerman, who recently testified before lawmakers in Oregon about the longstanding problem of white supremacist infiltration in policing agencies , said it is critical to understand how the president's language will be interpreted in many corners of the law enforcement community.\n\n\"This rhetoric, reinforced by the attorney general, is not falling on unsympathetic ears - the law enforcement intelligence network has been demonizing anarchists and other police violence protesters as a more dangerous threat for a long time,\" he said. \"We've seen the way that the police responded to nonviolent civil disobedience at Standing Rock or in Ferguson versus the laissez-faire approach they've used in a number of these white supremacist riots. They clearly can regulate their behavior. Why they choose not to when it's groups protesting police violence is what I think local government needs to understand.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "In Buried Report, U.S. Government Admits Major Failures in Confronting Domestic Terrorism\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe analysis offers an unusually self-critical view of gaps and weaknesses in the government's response to homegrown terror threats.\n\nFor weeks , President Donald Trump and top advisers like Attorney General William Barr have sought to blame antifa for sporadic violence and rioting during the ongoing Black Lives Matters protests. With little evidence, Trump even threatened to label antifa, an amorphous left-wing movement opposed to fascism, as a domestic terrorist organization .\n\nBut the president's strategy of pinning blame on antifa in quick, broad brushstrokes is undercut not only by constitutional hurdles and conflicting evidence on the ground, but also by a sobering report from his own intelligence officials that calls for an entirely revamped approach to domestic extremism. The analysis from the National Counterterrorism Center, which has not been previously reported, offers an unusually self-critical view of the gaps and weaknesses in combating homegrown terror threats, and it suggests that the focus needs to be on individual actors who break the law, rather than groups.\n\nThe report raises troubling questions about the government's ability to head off a major attack from extremists at home. In stark terms, it depicts a system ill-equipped to deal with the rising threat of domestic extremists because of splintered approaches by different agencies.\n\nThe report warned bluntly that \"there is no whole-of-government [domestic terrorism] threat picture.\" Federal officials cannot even agree on what to call violent extremists inside the United States, their efforts are \"rarely integrated,\" and combating the \"potent\" threat is not a top priority in some agencies, said the report, which grew out of a high-level summit of government officials and outside experts last fall.\n\nAs a result, intelligence officials are hampered by a \"lack of analytic research\" and formal threat assessments to draw on in their work, the report said, and that gap in valuable intelligence \"in turn reinforces the lack of policymaker prioritization.\"\n\nThe six-page report summarized the key takeaways from a highly unusual two-day conference on domestic terrorism organized last September outside Washington, D.C., by the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security. It brought together more than 120 experts on the subject, including officials across the federal government, as well as local law enforcement officers, academics, and private-sector analysts.\n\nJoseph Maguire, who was then the acting director of national intelligence, spoke to the group himself and deemed the event a \"call to action\" to confront the growing domestic terror threat, according to the report.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence refused to comment on the report, and a spokesperson declined to say what steps intelligence officials had taken in response to the findings. The report from the counterterrorism center, which is part of the DNI's office, is dated January of this year and was posted online by the office in March.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nA number of the outside experts invited to participate the conference said that the government's acknowledgement of shortcomings in identifying domestic extremists was a significant step by an administration that had shown little interest in the problem. But turnover and tumult among Trump's intelligence advisers make it unclear what changes, if any, may take place as a result of the findings.\n\n\"It's true there's no whole-of-government approach, and that needs to change,\" former Justice Department official Mary McCord, who gave a presentation at the invitation-only conference, said in an interview. \"If you're going to get serious about thwarting domestic terrorism plots, you're going to have to use more tools than we do.\"\n\nThe findings come as intelligence officials have been grappling not only with far-right violence connected to the ongoing Black Lives Matter protests, but also with conflicting messages from Trump and his top advisers about the real source of the violence.\n\nSince the protests began, Trump has tried to cast blame on antifa and what he called \"a lot of radical left, bad people\" for occasional bursts of violence during what have been largely peaceful demonstrations. Beyond threatening to designate antifa as a terrorist organization - a move constitutional scholars say would likely be illegal - he went so far as to fuel a baseless conspiracy theory about a 75-year-old Buffalo, New York, protester badly hurt by police, accusing the injured man of being a covert \"antifa provocateur.\"\n\nRudy Giuliani, the president's private counsel and personal adviser, blamed \"antifa, Black Lives Matter, the communists, and their allies\" for episodes of violence and destruction around the country in an appearance last week on Fox News.\n\nBarr, meanwhile, declared at the very start of the protests that \"the violence instigated and carried out by antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\" He announced on Friday that he was creating a federal task force to confront \"anti-government extremists engaged in indefensible acts of violence designed to undermine public order.\" He again pointed the finger at antifa, but this time, he also named a far-right group: supporters of the so-called Boogaloo movement , a white extremist group that envisions a coming \"civil war.\"\n\nPeople, including those with the \"Boogaloo\" movement, demonstrate against business closures due to concern about Covid-19, at the State House in Concord, N.H., on May 2, 2020.\n\nBut there is little evidence to back up Trump administration claims that antifa is driving the violence. Instead, law enforcement officials on the ground point mainly to the far-right groups - principally the \"Boogaloo Boys\" - for stoking violence and rioting.\n\nIn Oakland, authorities accused an active-duty Air Force sergeant who declared himself a Boogaloo of ambushing two federal security officers near a protest, killing one and wounding the other. And in Las Vegas, three men aligned with that same white extremist group - all of them military veterans - were arrested at a protest and charged with plotting to detonate Molotov cocktails and stoke violence among the crowds of protesters.\n\nEven before the Black Lives Matters protests, a string of deadly attacks against minorities by white supremacists - including the rampage last August at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, which killed 22 people, most of them Latinos - had prompted the FBI and DHS to elevate the threat posed by domestic extremists. The agencies put them on a par with foreign-based terrorist groups like the Islamic State and other Islamist extremists, which have been the dominant focus of counterterrorism officials since the September 11 attacks.\n\nOne of the most alarming far-right plots emerged just last week, and like several earlier episodes, it involved an American soldier.\n\nFederal prosecutors said that a 22-year-old Army private from Kentucky named Ethan Melzer aligned himself with a violent neo-Nazi group and sent along sensitive military information about deployment schedules to facilitate an attack on his own unit in Turkey. In private chat messages, Meltzer told members of the neo-Nazi group, known as the \"RapeWaffen Division\" or \"Order of the Nine Angles,\" that he wanted to inflict mass casualties and start \"a new war,\" even if it meant he himself might be killed, according to his indictment. The authorities said that Melzer confessed after his arrest last month and \"declared himself to be a traitor against the United States whose conduct was tantamount to treason.\"\n\nInvestigators with the FBI and the military appear to have had a confidential source within the neo-Nazi group whom they used to find out about the plot as it was being hatched, according to an unsealed affidavit in the case.\n\nBut the broad findings from the National Counterterrorism Center report suggest that authorities could be left in the dark about other extremist plots - and unable to head them off - without wide changes to the system.\n\nTrump himself has shown little inclination to go after domestic extremists, even before the recent racial unrest. In one of his most notorious proclamations, he said there were \"very fine people on both sides\" at the violent neo-Nazi demonstration in 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia, and after last year's massacre of 49 Muslims at two New Zealand mosques, he rejected the suggestion that white nationalists were a growing global threat, characterizing them instead as \"a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.\" At the same time, his administration gutted funding for an Obama-era program called Countering Violent Extremism, meant to head off the radicalization of Americans.\n\nThe latest accusations against Trump of fanning racial tensions came this weekend, when he retweeted a video from Florida that included a supporter yelling \"White Power!\" at protesters. The president later took down the post.\n\nGiven the administration's record, \"a lot of us were pleasantly surprised that this conference was convened in the first place - it was overdue,\" said Brian Levin, who runs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University in San Bernardino and helped lead a discussion at the event. \"There was a message from the top saying, 'I get it.'\"\n\nBut that message has now become muddled, Levin and other participants said, after the Trump administration fired both Maguire, the acting intelligence chief, and Russ Travers, the acting head of the counterterrorism center, within weeks of each other earlier this year. Trump was reportedly furious with Maguire - and questioned his loyalty - for allowing an aide to give a classified congressional briefing about Russian meddling in the 2020 election.\n\nDarryl Johnson, a former senior analyst on far-right extremism at DHS, said in an interview he was optimistic after taking part in the conference that federal officials were determined to develop a more thorough approach to domestic terrorism . But with the recent changeover among intelligence officials, \"we're back to square one, spinning our wheels,\" he said.\n\nJohnson, who now runs his own threat-analysis firm, authored a report at DHS in 2009 on the rising threat of right-wing extremism, but the Obama administration retracted it after a fierce backlash from Republicans. He was also involved in DHS's internal efforts to develop a common \"lexicon\" to describe political extremists and their ideologies, but that, too, was scuttled.\n\nJohnson said it is clear to him that intelligence officials today are still missing comprehensive and valuable data on violent extremists, even as the threat has risen. \"So if you're not collecting data,\" he asked, \"how can you have any kind of analysis of what the threat is?\"\n\nLegal conflicts have hindered the effort, as well.\n\nFor decades, federal prosecutors have commonly used terrorism laws on the books to charge violent extremists in the United States connected to Islamic or foreign terror organizations, but they have applied the terrorism label much less often when it comes to domestic attacks involving young white, American-born men rather than Muslims of Middle Eastern heritage.\n\nThe intelligence report alluded to the dual treatment, saying that the government's criteria for publicly labeling attacks as \"domestic terrorism\" is \"opaque and inconsistent.\" It said that \"the U.S. government needs to find a way to increase public trust by being transparent with the public about how [domestic terrorism] definitions are derived, defined, and used.\"\n\n\"Fusion\" centers in each state now bring together local and federal officials to identify public safety and terrorism threats. But these types of cooperative efforts remain fractured, with partners working at \"cross-purposes,\" the report said, and it encouraged federal officials to work more closely with local law enforcement agencies nationwide and with private technology companies, which \"are emerging as the dominant funder of research on violent extremism.\" One open-source tool that officials highlighted was identifying locales with \"the greatest amount of internet searches related to white supremacy.\"\n\nSuch tactics carry legal risks, however, because of free speech rights and civil liberties safeguards. For instance, designating a group inside the United States as a \"domestic terrorism\" organization - as Trump threatened to do with antifa - \"could be perceived as government overreach and/or unconstitutional,\" the report said.\n\nThe FBI, in particular, has a long history of improperly harassing and spying on political opponents and activists under the guise of national security, most notoriously against civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s under then-Director J. Edgar Hoover.\n\nSome officials at the conference argued for trying to expand current laws to carve out a new criminal statute specific to domestic terrorism, bringing more legal powers with it. But Heidi Beirich, a longtime specialist on domestic extremism, argued at the meeting that while federal officials should be focusing more resources on violent white supremacists, new domestic terror laws are unnecessary and could trample on civil liberties.\n\n\"When you increase the powers of federal agencies, it can boomerang back and hit activists and marginalized groups, and it doesn't hit the intended target,\" Beirich, who recently co-founded an advocacy group called the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said in an interview.\n\nBeirich said the weaknesses that federal officials acknowledged regarding domestic extremists could have been \"a turning point,\" but she now worries that they will come to nothing because of a lack of political will.\n\n\"The threat continues, and we remain with blinders on,\" Beirich said. \"The next mass attack is virtually assured, and there'll be nobody who saw it coming.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Is Antifa Counterproductive? White Nationalist Richard Spencer Would Beg to Differ.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe \"alt-right\" poster boy said antifa's confrontations led him to cancel upcoming speaking dates.\n\nRichard Spencer isn't having fun anymore. In a lengthy YouTube video posted on Sunday, the white nationalist announced that he would be suspending upcoming public speaking engagements and halting his controversial \"college tour.\" He said of his rallies, \"When they become violent clashes and pitched battles, they aren't fun.\"\n\n\"I really hate to say this, and I definitely hesitate to say this,\" said the poster boy of the so-called alt-right. \"Antifa is winning to the extent that they're willing to go further than anyone else, in the sense that they will do things in terms of just violence, intimidating, and general nastiness.\" He stated that the willingness of far-left activists to use any means necessary in attempts to shut down his speeches has left the far right \"up the creek without a paddle.\"\n\nSpencer's announcement came a week after he gave a scarcely attended speech at Michigan State University. The appearance drew antifa protesters that clashed with Spencer's far-right supporters, landing 20 people under arrest - nearly all from the antifa contingent.\n\nSpencer's statement, celebrated by antifa groups and supporters across social media, offers a sharp rebuttal to the glut of claims that antifa practices serve as a gift to the far right. Antifa, which is short for anti-fascist, is not a group or an organization, but a set of political practices aimed at expunging neo-Nazi, white nationalist, and adjacent groups from public spaces on and offline. While these practices, which include but are not limited to physical confrontations, have been deployed against fascists since the early 20th century, President Donald Trump's election and the resurgence of overt white supremacy brought antifa opposition to the fore. Where white nationalists gather - from Berkeley to Boston to Charlottesville - antifa has been there with the intent to disrupt those gatherings.\n\nA cottage industry of panicked media commentary has dedicated itself to decrying the threats that antifa and its \"no-platforming\" stance pose to free speech. Suffice to say, this all-too-prevalent media position is deeply flawed . The aspect of those criticisms that is relevant for our purposes here is the claim that antifa action is not effective. Critics even claim that antifa's approach is counterproductive, giving oxygen to the attention-grabbing white supremacist fire it would extinguish. Noam Chomsky was far from alone in calling antifa \"a major gift\" to the far right. Instead, critics argue that the best way to defeat the far right was to debate them, to shed light on the paucity of their arguments, to reason white supremacy away.\n\nSpencer's latest message suggests the very opposite. \"The idea of a college tour was going into the belly of the beast - going into academic, Marxist-controlled territory - and giving a speech that introduces that basic ideas of identitarianism and the 'alt-right,'\" he said in his video, emphasizing the use of \"public-facing\" events to spread and normalize the \"alt-right\" message. Anyone who has watched Spencer and his ilk in public debates with liberals on the question of race should see how the belief that his violent white supremacy can be reasoned away is flawed. He sticks to his guns about the necessity of a white \"ethno-state,\" and his liberal interlocutors call him a monstrous racist. The result is that anti-racists agree with the liberals and racists agree with Spencer. The effect, as both sides hold to their arguments, is mere entrenchment of an intolerable status quo - or, worse yet, closet racists decide Spencer's arguments license them to come out publicly, too.\n\nInstead of this deteriorating stalemate, the antifa strategy aims to create material, felt consequences for neo-Nazi, white supremacist groups, and those who would organize with them. The approach takes seriously that young, white, often alienated men see promise, belonging, and elevation in these organizations. They don't join groups like Identity Evropa, an American white supremacist group which has focused heavily on campus propaganda, because of the strength of their arguments - and they won't leave such communities because of the flawed logic of their ideology, either.\n\nTo make the consequences of joining the white nationalist movement appear less appealing - to take the \"fun\" out of fascism - is precisely the antifa strategy to stymie the movement's spread. Spencer stating that his rallies are no longer \"fun\" is music to antifa ears.\n\nIt is no accident that antifa tactics beat back the rise of neo-Nazism in the 1970s and 1980s punk scene, or that fighting squads of Jewish ex-service members halted the upsurge of Oswald Mosley's anti-Semitic, fascist organizing in Britain after World War II. And it's no surprise that the so-called alt-right has been forced to reconsider its tactics today. While writers for the New York Times opinion section may seek to paint the antifa position as little more than punch-seeking thuggery, the strategy of creating serious consequences for white nationalists who would organize is based on a well-grounded understanding of the desire for fascism and how it spreads.\n\nSpencer has not declared the \"alt-right\" defeated, and his message certainly signals no death knell for the white supremacy that permeates this country's DNA. As I've noted , the Anti-Defamation League found that last year, white supremacist propaganda tripled on campuses across America and far-right extremism accounted for 71 percent of extremist attacks. Spencer is also just one personality; the far right doesn't hinge on his college appearances.\n\nSome may argue that Spencer's plans to become less public-facing, to organize more secretive meetings such that antifa will not be able to turn up, creates more dangerous possibilities for a movement to spread out of sight. The idea, however, that a movement forced underground - whatever that looks like in the age of social media organizing - is more likely to gain traction is unfounded and unempirical.\n\nIf \"alt-right\" speakers do go \"underground,\" where they will lack police lines and university establishment protections, antifa will be sure to follow them there, too. An antifa tactic that gets less media coverage than Nazi-punching involves intensive online research dedicated exposing who, where, and how groups are connecting and organizing. That's the whole point of antifa: to do the work, by whatever means necessary, so that the far right has nowhere left to go.\n\nTop photo: White nationalist Richard Spencer, who popularized the term \"alt-right,\" speaks during a press conference at the Curtis M. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts in Gainesville, Fla., on Oct. 19, 2017.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Ted Cruz's Hearing on Anarchist Protest Violence Was a Total Farce\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nCruz kept mentioning Democrats' failure to condemn a murder that was actually carried out by the far right - and refused to be corrected.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, at Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 4, 2020.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, with Congress still failing to agree on an urgent pandemic relief package, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, brought together a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee to propagandize. Instead of helping the pandemic-stricken, Cruz chaired an hourslong spectacle of a hearing designed to peddle misleading narratives about anarchists and anti-fascists.\n\nIf the propagandistic title of the hearing - \"The Right of the People Peaceably to Assemble: Protecting Speech by Stopping Anarchist Violence\" - wasn't enough to show his aims, Cruz's own comments made clear the proceedings' purpose as political theater. In a telling moment, Cruz twice chastised his Democratic colleagues for praising peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters while failing to condemn \"antifa\" and the \"terrorists\" who killed a federal security officer, Dave Patrick Underwood, during a May protest in Oakland. Cruz's implication was clear: The left killed Underwood.\n\nYet Underwood was killed by a member of the far right - one of 329 murders carried out by right-wing extremists since 1994.\n\nIn the same period, a grand total of zero murders have been attributed to antifa participants.\n\nThe political affiliations of the man charged in Underwood's murder have been public knowledge for nearly two months. The alleged killer, Air Force Sgt. Steve Carillo, who also killed another federal officer during the premeditated ambush, is an open adherent of the boogaloo movement, which is aimed at hastening a second civil war.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pointed out Cruz's error after the Texas Republican's first mention of Underwood, noting that the killer was on the far right. This did not stop Cruz raising the killing again later in the hearing, once again within the context of a blustering speech about antifa.\n\nThe hearing was just the latest stage for baseless overtures on the threat of the far left. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, made numerous attempts to change the afternoon's focus onto a more worthy target - deadly white supremacist violence - to little avail.\n\nFor the government to ignore white supremacist violence and focus instead on the far left is nothing new. The Intercept reported last month, based on leaked law enforcement documents, that while the Trump administration has sought to demonize and target antifa, reports amassed of deadly white supremacist violence and substantive threats - including to the police themselves.\n\nNot that the police should be let off the hook for the right's pernicious priorities. U.S. law enforcement has an unbroken history of deprioritizing, if not outright aiding, white supremacist movements. During Tuesday's unnecessary hearing, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Erin Nealy Cox said that she was overseeing a task force to investigate current anti-government threats, which was not focused on white supremacists.\n\nOne of the few voices of reason throughout the afternoon, Michael German, a former FBI agent specializing in domestic terrorism who is now a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, noted the \"sensationalized\" focus on the far left has \"distracted from focus on the deadly threats\" posed by the far right. \"As a matter of policy, far-right violence is deprioritized,\" German said.\n\nIn line with German's criticism, the hearing proceeded with paranoiac speeches about the tactics of anti-racist, anti-fascist protesters. Acting Deputy Secretary of of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli discussed protesters using laser pointers and small projectiles, like frozen water bottles, against brutal federal agents in Portland, Oregon. He spoke as if he was describing weapons of mass destruction when he said that demonstrators were taking up \"the oldest weapon in history\" - rocks.\n\nMeanwhile, as German previously told The Intercept, on the far right \"you have these heavily armed groups right there, who have a much more direct and lengthy history of violence than anything antifa or anarchist-involved does.\"\n\nThe only member of the media called to testify was right-wing provocateur Andy Ngo. Ngo spoke of the long history of antifa organizing in Portland, but unsurprisingly omitted the most obvious reason for it: In recent years, Portland has become an epicenter of far-right violence, to which anti-fascist action is a rightful response.\n\nKyle Shideler of the Center for Security Policy also testified as an alleged expert on the nature of antifa as an organization of international terrorism, drawing comparisons to Al Qaeda. As Hirono pointed out at the hearing, the Center for Security Policy is designated by the Southern Policy Law Center as an anti-Muslim hate group. Only one witness identified as an anti-fascist and a participant in the ongoing anti-racist protests for Black lives, Nkenge Harmon Johnson of the Portland Urban League; she was asked no questions by the committee after her brief statement in support of the movement. Cruz, meanwhile, gave Shideler extra speaking time to defend his hate group against criticism.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nCruz closed the proceedings with a frenzied tirade about the dangers of Black Lives Matter - purported criticisms that bear no repeating. Suffice it to say that Cruz, a racist police apologist, is no fan of Black liberation icons like Angela Davis and Assata Shakur.\n\nYet - and there's no surprise here - Senate Democrats at the hearing did no favors to the ongoing uprisings either. Hirono may have made welcome reference to the scourge of white supremacist violence, but she also dismissed the serious and reasonable demand to defund the police at the center of the protests. \"Who takes that literally?\" she said, \"I certainly don't.\" Such are the establishment powers against which anarchists, among many others, have good reason to act.\n\nWAIT!

A short time later, without explanation or apology, the White House deleted the video from its official Twitter and Facebook feeds - but only after it had been viewed more than a million times on Twitter alone.\n\nA screenshot showing that a video was removed from the White House Facebook feed on Wednesday.\n\nAlthough the White House tried to hide the video once it became clear just how riddled with errors it was, The Intercept saved a copy before it disappeared.\n\nThe video is worth examining in detail, since it shows just how unconcerned with the truth people in the White House are, as they conduct a frantic search for evidence to support the president's baseless claim that the protests over racial injustice and police impunity have been hijacked by phantom \"professional protesters.\"\n\nThe compilation includes seven clips showing bricks, rocks or paving stones that the people who filmed them found suspicious. Three of the clips were broadcast a day earlier in a report from \"Inside Edition,\" which told its viewers that \"police say small bands of the so-called 'professional agitators' are taking advantage of the crisis and hijacking peaceful demonstrations.\"\n\n\"Piles of bricks have also appeared at the scenes of major demonstrations,\" a reporter for the tabloid news show added. \"There is speculation they may have been planted there by Antifa, for use as projectiles aimed at cops and storefront windows.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nHowever, as open-source investigators for BBC News , Buzzfeed and Vice had already reported before the White House compiled the clips, almost all of the video included in it showed ordinary piles of bricks used in construction projects which were underway before the wave of protests began in response to the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, by Minneapolis police officers last week.\n\nIn the first clip , recorded in Dallas on Saturday night, a young black protester addresses the camera, and shares the conspiratorial idea that a pallet of bricks outside a courthouse must have been planted there to provoke a riot.\n\nThe Dallas protest was a lot of things. But I was very disappointed to see this RANDOM stack of bricks in front of the courthouse. #setup #BlackLivesMatters #makeblackcount pic.twitter.com/CULGXPzMun\n\n- Reuben Lael (@reubengotsoul) May 30, 2020\n\n\"This is a set-up,\" the young man says to the camera in the original video, which was posted on Twitter by a black activist. \"You got to do better,\" the man adds, wagging his finger in a sarcastic scolding of the slipshod provocateurs he imagines were responsible. In the background, another protester can be heard saying, \"there ain't no damned construction around here.\"\n\nThat is not quite correct, however. Photographs and video shot on May 5 at the same location , outside the Dallas County Courthouse - during a protest by the far-right Oathkeepers in support of Shelley Luther, a salon owner who was jailed for reopening her business during the coronavirus lockdown - showed that there were extensive roadworks and piles of bricks at that same street corner three weeks before George Floyd was killed.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Oathkeepers/status/1257755220538343424\n\nEven if the roadwork had been largely or entirely completed by last Saturday, it seems far more likely that the bricks had just not been cleared away than that they were removed and then planted again, outside a courthouse, by left-wing agitators.\n\nIn an interview, the man who recorded this video and posted it online, Reuben Lael, told me that he took the threat of \"interlopers,\" meaning \"anarchists or any other anti-America groups,\" using violence to distort the meaning of the Black Lives Matter protests very seriously. \"America is vulnerable and on the radar of people who want to destroy the country,\" he said. Lael argued that it was important to him \"to protect the young protesters\" and \"kind of keep the narrative clear\" by at least letting the young man who suspected the bricks might have been a set-up make it plain that he was not a rioter and not interested in violence.\n\nAnother clip used by the White House, and \"Inside Edition,\" shows a pile of bricks in Fayetteville, North Carolina, in video that was posted on Twitter on Saturday. However, as Benjamin Strick of The BBC reported on Tuesday , the bricks were clearly visible at the same spot in video posted on YouTube on May 24, one day before the killing of George Floyd.\n\nHi @WhiteHouse . You are wrong. Some of these \"staging bricks\" to \"instigate violence\" videos are false. This one filmed in #Fayetteville ( https://t.co/AqRBp85oeC ) the bricks were there pre-May 24 in this video here: https://t.co/gnwqUk7r9u .

However, Mark Treyger, a New York City Council member who represents that area responded to the commissioner's tweet a short time later, calling his accusation that the stones had been placed there by antifascists false. \"This is in my district. I went to the site. This construction debris was left near a construction site on Ave X in Gravesend,\" Treyger wrote on Twitter.\n\nThis is in my district. I went to the site. This construction debris was left near a construction site on Ave X in Gravesend. Could be evidence of a developer breaking law since phase 1 hasn't begun, but there was no evidence of organized looting on X last night that I'm aware of https://t.co/oTEn0wMzAR\n\n- Mark Treyger ? (@MarkTreyger718) June 3, 2020\n\nIt is nor clear where the fourth clip in the White House compilation was shot, but it shows what look like ordinary construction materials.\n\nThe sixth clip, of young protesters in Manhattan picking up bricks during a march on Saturday night, was edited by the White House to cut out the start of the scene, in which they could be seen first breaking down a barrier around a clearly defined construction site in the East Village. The original clip, posted by a reporter, showed a yellow fence around the building materials and a sign reading \"LANE CLOSED CAUTION,\" before it was pulled down by the protesters to get at the bricks.\n\n\"Yo, we got bricks. We got bricks!\"- #Rioters in Manhattan chanced upon a cache in the street equipped with bricks and a shovel at 10:01 p.m. on Second Ave between St. Marks Pl. and Seventh St. pic.twitter.com/dYB7vHdYqL\n\n- Kevin R Hogan (@KRHogan_NTD) May 31, 2020\n\nThe seventh and final clip offered by the White House as supposed proof of anti-fascists \"staging bricks\" was perhaps the most embarrassing mistake. That viral clip showed several piles of large rocks inside six metal cages on a sidewalk in Sherman Oaks, California, which people on social platforms speculated were caches of ammunition for future riots.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/talialikeitis/status/1267649632366137349\n\nIn fact, as the Chabad of Sherman Oaks had already explained on its Facebook page on Monday, in response to the viral rumor that these were stones prepared for rioting, the structures were in fact security barriers that had been in place outside the Jewish center for nearly a year.\n\nPeople keep RTing this like it's prep for looters. That's a hoax. This is in front of Chabad in Sherman Oaks. They're bolted to the cement to keep people from ramming a car into the place of worship & are getting boarded up.

(@JennieRoberson) June 1, 2020\n\n\"Nevertheless to alleviate people's concern that they may be vandalized and used by rioters, they were temporarily removed,\" the center said in a message posted on Facebook with a photo of the cages after the rocks had been removed.\n\nA screenshot of a Facebook message posted on Monday, debunking a viral rumor.\n\nThe White House social media director, Dan Scavino, did not reply to a request for comment on why the video was posted after most of its contents had already been debunked, and why it was removed without explanation.\n\nDespite a lack of evidence, belief in the president's conspiracy theory that \"outside agitators\" from the ranks of the anti-fascists are infiltrating protests to spark violence has become an article of faith among his supporters, and has been echoed from senior officers in some police departments. On Monday, Terence Monahan, the chief of department and the highest-ranked uniformed police officer in the NYPD, told a local television crew that it was time \"to get those groups out of here - from California, from all over this country, who are being paid to take this movement, which is a good movement, and turn it into violence\" against police officers.\n\nNYPD is being led by a chief, Terence Monahan, who reveals here that he believes the baseless conspiracy theory that groups from other parts of the country \"are being paid\" to hijack the protests and inflict violence on the police. He's in charge. https://t.co/yVgXzsmPPi\n\n- Robert Mackey (@RobertMackey) June 2, 2020\n\nOther departments have found themselves forced to debunk viral rumors of imminent attacks from anti-fascists, who use the term antifa as a nickname, but are not members of an organized group, as Trump and his followers seem to believe.\n\nOn Monday, a police department in Idaho wrote on Facebook that a viral rumor spread by a rightwing militia group, that \"Antifa has sent a plane load of their people into Boise and three bus loads from Seattle into the rural areas,\" was entirely untrue. \"The Payette County Sheriff's Office has been monitoring social media posts that have stated FALSE information,\" the department wrote. \"The Payette County Sheriff's Office has not had contact with and has not verified that Antifa is in Payette County. The Payette County Sheriff's Office has not given any specific warnings to our citizens about Antifa or other organizations.\"\n\nAhead of a protest on Sunday, the Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce tweeted that it \"had received tips from unnamed sources that protesters from outside of Sioux Falls planned to attend the rally and incite violence.\"\n\nSioux Falls Police Chief Matt Burns told The Argus Leader , a local newspaper, on Monday \"that authorities were looking for the buses and didn't find any evidence of them arriving and unloading protesters.\"\n\nBut unverified claims that \"pallets of bricks\" have been mysteriously delivered to protest sites have also been embraced by some anti-Trump activists on the left. The podcaster Tonya Tko used many of the same viral clips of bricks in her own video analysis posted on Facebook on Monday, in which she concluded that the government must be trying to undermine peaceful protests in favor of racial justice by inciting people to violence. Tko's video, \"Bricks Planted in Protest Cities Across the U.S.: IT'S A SET-UP!\" in which she also suggests that the Covid-19 pandemic might have been part of a wider government plot, has already been viewed 3.4 million times.\n\nLast Updated: Friday, June 5, 1:30 a.m. PDT This article was updated to add comments from Reuben Lael, who filmed a protest in Dallas, to report Tonya Tko's video analysis, and to note reporting from Benjamin Strick of the BBC indicating that the second and fifth clips in the White House compilation video seem to show the same pile of paving stones in Fayetteville, North Carolina, at different times of the day. Screenshots were also added to show the video on the White House Twitter feed, before it was deleted, and the error message that appeared after it was removed from the White House Facebook feed.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Before Portland, Trump's Shock Troops Went After Border Activists\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe purported threat of antifa was long used to justify militarized targeting of immigration activists. Now it's being used against protesters in Portland.\n\nImages of Border Patrol agents in military-style tactical gear grabbing protesters off the street in Portland, Oregon, have drawn condemnation from Democratic lawmakers, who have described the teams as \"secret police.\" For immigration advocates like Kaji Douša, a senior pastor at Park Avenue Christian Church in New York City, there is nothing secret - or particularly new - about them.\n\nAs the co-chair of the New Sanctuary Coalition, an immigrant rights organization, Douša knows what it's like to have the weight of the Department of Homeland Security come down on you - she has a growing stack of internal DHS documents, produced in ongoing litigation surrounding the agency's surveillance of her and dozens of lawyers, journalists, and asylum advocates who were targeted in a sweeping DHS spying operation during the 2018 midterm elections. \"We were perceived to be radicals,\" Douša told The Intercept. \"A lot of white people turned away because it wasn't them, but now that it's them in Portland, everybody's like, 'Oh, this is crazy.'\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe surveillance was just one politicized DHS operation among many that have taken place under the Trump administration. The same Border Patrol tactical teams currently on the ground in Oregon were also deployed to provide muscle and a visible show of strength for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers conducting a crackdown on New York and other so-called sanctuary cities earlier this year. During the enforcement blitz , an ICE officer dressed in tactical gear was spotted knocking on doors in a Bronx apartment building with a rifle propped against his shoulder. In Brooklyn, a team of ICE officers shot a man in the face while attempting to make an arrest. As The Intercept reported in March , the escalated enforcement came as New York City was becoming the global epicenter for the coronavirus pandemic and led to the filling of local jails, which in turn became hot spots for Covid-19.\n\n\"We were raising the alarm about it,\" Douša said. \"It feels like we've been screaming into a vacuum.\"\n\nLong before DHS deployed masked paramilitary agents to the Pacific Northwest, the agency was directing its intelligence efforts against opponents of the president's policies on the southern border, citing the coordinated circulation of public information, tweets, and potential vandalism as a precursor to extremist violence and domestic terrorism.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, when the Trump administration was taking children from their parents by the thousands in an effort to ward off asylum-seekers at the southern border, a New York City-based data artist designed a tool for scraping LinkedIn that would collect and share information that ICE personnel had posted about themselves online. Alarm bells went off inside DHS.\n\n\"Multiple incidents of doxing of DHS personnel and facilities could result in actualized violence against DHS employees by violent extremist actors,\" the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis warned in a June 29, 2018 intelligence note , describing the actors in question as \"individuals vehemently opposed to purported or perceived DHS actions regarding immigration policy.\"\n\nWhile protests against the administration's family separation policy were massive, widespread, and diverse, the note went on to say that \"the current publicity surrounding federal immigration policy most likely will resonate with anarchist extremists or individuals who self-identify or subscribe to anti-fascist (ANTIFA) anarchist extremist ideology.\" The DHS intelligence office reported with \"medium confidence\" that \"if any criminal acts were to be conducted by these domestic terrorists, these acts would most likely be limited to destruction of critical infrastructure.\"\n\nRelated In Portland, Questions Swirl Around Local Police's Coordination With Federal Officers\n\nThe intelligence note is among a trove of law enforcement documents that were recently hacked and posted online under the title BlueLeaks. The leaked documents reveal several instances in recent years of DHS and its subagencies circulating warnings about a dangerous anarchist or antifa element constituting a domestic terrorist threat. The documents bolster past reporting that has repeatedly demonstrated the agency's targeting of leftist opponents of the Trump administration's immigration and border policies, which set the stage for the federal law enforcement campaign the president is now seeking to take nationwide.\n\nThe materials are particularly noteworthy in light of recent events in Portland, in which DHS has cited the actions of \"violent anarchists\" as a justification for its show of force on the city's streets, pointed to doxxing as the reason that agents' names are hidden from the public, and where the same DHS office that has hyped a threat from the left is now overseeing the intelligence work driving arrests on the ground.\n\nThe Intercept sent DHS a list of questions for this story, including clarification on how the agency is determining the political ideology of individual protesters accused of violence on the ground in Portland - earlier this month, for example, acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf issued a press release blaming \"violent anarchists\" for 70 incidents of \"lawless destruction and violence\" in Portland (nearly all of the incidents involved graffiti or property destruction). The agency did not respond.\n\nWhen considering the Trump administration's actions in Portland, \"it's impossible not to recall the Department of Homeland Security's targeting of activists and civil society organizations on the border for surveillance and criminal investigation,\" said Brian Griffey, a researcher at Amnesty International. In 2019, Griffey was the lead investigator on a report that documented how DHS engaged in a sweeping, multi-year campaign targeting human rights defenders, attorneys, and journalists working on the border . \"To label these political activists terrorists, it's just the same in my mind as how they labeled activists and immigration lawyers on the border as criminals and smugglers,\" he said.\n\nHaving previously conducted human rights research in eastern Ukraine, Griffey has found himself increasingly concerned with the direction the administration now appears to be taking. \"A lot of what's happening here seems incredibly familiar,\" he said. \"From little green men, to the encouragement of far-right protesters to stage armed demonstrations outside Capitol buildings in regional areas. As we get into election season this is a recipe for trouble if they don't roll back the rhetoric and stop threatening civil society.\"\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrest an undocumented Mexican immigrant during a raid in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn on April 11, 2018 in New York City.\n\nThere is no legal definition of a sanctuary city. For the Trump administration, the term has typically meant ostensibly liberal jurisdictions where local law enforcement has pulled back on some element of cooperation with ICE - though ICE still operates in those cities, and in places like New York, a low-level brush with the New York Police Department can still lead to deportation. President Donald Trump has repeatedly identified such jurisdictions as his political enemies. The federal law enforcement posture that has garnered so much attention in the past month is largely an extension of that view and is being rolled out alongside a reelection effort framed around the notion that leftist activists and political leaders are in cahoots to destroy the country.\n\nAs Douša and Griffey noted, much of what's happened in recent weeks, from the DHS operations themselves to the units involved to the government's characterization of the perceived threat, would be familiar to anyone who's had a close eye on the border in recent years.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nOn January 17, 2018, a specialized Border Patrol unit conducted a raid on a humanitarian aid station in the unincorporated border community of Ajo, Arizona. Scott Warren , a geographer and volunteer with the faith-based organization No More Deaths and several other humanitarian groups was arrested along with two young undocumented men from Central American who were attempting to cross one of the deadliest stretches of the Sonoran Desert. A Border Patrol agent who later admitted that he did not know how to secure a warrant for a wiretap had conducted a multi-month \" investigation \" into the aid facility. The U.S. Attorney's Office pursued the case aggressively, hitting Warren with two federal felony counts of harboring and one count of conspiracy. He faced up to 20 years in prison. The office brought nine other federal cases against No More Deaths volunteers accused of leaving jugs of water for migrants crossing the desert on public lands.\n\nTrump administration prosecutors spent two years trying to lock Warren away. When the first trial ended in a hung jury , they brought another. The second jury returned a verdict of not guilty after just two hours of deliberations. Throughout Warren's ordeal, prosecutors alleged that No More Deaths and groups like it were effectively a border-wide anarchist conspiracy network aimed at breaking U.S. immigration laws.\n\nWarren's case was among the first clear signs that the Trump administration was willing to devote considerable resources to aggressive and politically symbolic law enforcement activity in matters related to the president's border agenda.\n\nWhile Warren was able to avoid time behind bars during his brush with the Trump administration's politicized brand of border law enforcement, others were not so fortunate.\n\nOn August 3, 2018, ICE agents in Texas arrested 18-year-old Sergio Salazar at an Occupy ICE encampment in San Antonio, Texas. As The Intercept reported last year , Salazar's tweets landed them on the radar of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), which forwarded the posts to an FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force in San Antonio that included ICE personnel. Federal authorities surveilled Salazar and the Occupy ICE encampment for weeks. Tactical agents in masks not unlike those in Portland visited the camp at night. One day after Salazar's protections against deportation under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals expired, an ICE team moved in and placed them under arrest. In an evidence packet ICE compiled to support Salazar's deportation, which Salazar shared with The Intercept, DHS argued that the recent high school graduate's social media revealed their affiliation with the \"Anarchist Extremist Group 'ANTIFA.'\" Salazar was locked up for 43 days before being deported - \"banished,\" in their words - from the only country they had ever known.\n\nThe BlueLeaks documents show that Salazar's case was referenced in a report circulated by a law enforcement fusion center in Colorado the following year: \"On 03 August 2018, an 18-year-old Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient was arrested by the FBI after posting instructional videos for making bombs to kill ICE agents. He also posted several anonymous messages online against ICE agents.\" Salazar was not arrested by the FBI nor were they ever charged or accused of a crime. The source of the fusion center's reporting was an article published by the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization with longstanding ties to Trump's top immigration architect, White House adviser Stephen Miller - the Southern Poverty Law Center includes the organization among its designated hate groups . CIS rejects the characterization .\n\nThe author of the CIS post was Todd Bensman, a former senior intelligence analyst at the Texas Department of Public Safety who, according to biographies on CIS's website and his own , had a supervisory role at DPS that \"frequently\" involved sharing intelligence with JTTFs and ICE at the time that DPS shared Salazar's tweets with FBI. Bensman left DPS for CIS the month of Salazar's arrest, where he proceeded to write multiple articles and posted a video about the national security threat that people like Salazar posed, drawing comparisons to \"ISIS propagandists who become the targets of hellfire missiles overseas because their incitement has proven so mortally effective.\"\n\nBensman told The Intercept he was aware of Salazar's case during his tenure at DPS, but that he went to \"great pains\" to compartmentalize his work in law enforcement from the public facing reporting he produces at CIS. Though he believes federal law enforcement would not have devoted the resources to the Salazar case that it did absent a serious threat, he acknowledged that he did not have access to the case file ICE presented laying out its purported evidence to support that claim. \"If there was exculpatory information about that investigation, I certainly would have written about it,\" Bensman told The Intercept.\n\nSalazar's life was upended entirely by the investigation Bensman's previous office set in motion. From an apartment in Mexico, they wrote: \"Despite the hateful behavior and writings of the DHS and its employees against a teenage me, I still believe a better world is possible and still hold in my heart a vision of a world where migration is not criminalized or regulated through violence.\"\n\nThe BlueLeaks documents show that on June 22, 2018 , while much of the country was reacting in horror at the Trump administration's family separation policy, and Salazar and their friends were occupying the ICE facility in Texas, U.S. Customs and Border Protection was reporting \"an increase in social media threats targeting DHS personnel.\" The threats included \"advocating violence against ICE officials and destruction of government property, the release of DHS officials' personally identifiable information (PII), and the release of DHS facility locations.\"\n\nFor the most part, DHS facility locations, like the details government employees post on their LinkedIn pages, are publicly available information. CBP acknowledged that \"while doxxing itself may be constitutionally protected,\" the government would continue to monitor \"incidents of doxing where there is a reasonable belief that the doxed information could lead to violent domestic extremist activity.\" In a preview of what would become a Trump administration talking point regarding the recent protests, CBP warned that \"anarchist extremists have previously exploited constitutionally protected events to engage in violence against police.\" The agency listed nearly a dozen \"indicators of planned criminal or violent domestic extremist activity,\" which included \"preoperational surveillance of government buildings, symbols of capitalism, or symbols of corporate globalization\" and \"possessing anarchist signs.\"\n\n\"Some of these behavioral indicators involve constitutionally protected activities,\" CBP noted. \"These indicators, therefore, only support a reasonable suspicion of violent activity when considered in conjunction with additional, supporting facts.\"\n\nIn the months after the alerts were issued, the Trump administration shifted into election mode, zeroing in on migrant caravans making their way north from Central America to rally the president's base for the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nCentral American migrants run away from tear gas thrown by the Border Patrol after they tried to cross from Tijuana to San Diego, as seen from Mexico on Jan. 1, 2019.\n\nWhen the caravans reached Tijuana at the end of the year, they were met with tear gas lobbed over the border wall by DHS officers and agents. Last February, The Intercept revealed that the agency had embarked on a sprawling, binational intelligence-gathering operation run by U.S. and Mexican law enforcement focused on journalists, immigration attorneys, and asylum advocates in the area. Targets of the program were routinely interrogated by DHS personnel when crossing into San Diego, in some cases for hours at a time. Multiple lawyers and photojournalists were barred from traveling internationally. Members of the press were forced to turn over their notes, cameras, and phones while plainclothes U.S. border officials pumped them for information about activists working with the caravans.\n\nA month after The Intercept's investigation, NBC San Diego obtained a cache of documents , leaked by an ICE whistleblower , showing that DHS had built a \"secret database of activists, journalists, and social media influencers tied to the migrant caravan and in some cases, placed alerts on their passports.\" The program featured the lead DHS border and immigration enforcement agencies, as well as the FBI, and it fell under the umbrella of \"Operation Secure Line,\" the Trump administration's border surge of military units during the midterms initially dubbed \"Faithful Patriot.\" Douša was among the immigrant rights advocates included in the database. In a section of Douša's classified DHS file titled \"Target Significance,\" CBP's San Diego Intelligence Unit wrote, \"Possible connection to recent ANTIFA movement along the southwestern border.\"\n\n\"There were 59 of us in the Operation Secure Line targeting database that basically tied all of us to so-called antifa,\" Douša said. \"I have no idea what that is.\"\n\nThe DHS border spying revelations prompted a bipartisan letter to the head of CBP from Sens. Ron Wyden and Chuck Grassley last March demanding answers . The border enforcement agency initially dismissed the matter then, four months after the story broke, admitted that U.S. and Mexican authorities had indeed engaged in a cross-border intelligence operation. In October, the American Civil Liberties Union sued on behalf of asylum advocates caught in the surveillance program, accusing CBP, ICE, and the FBI of First and Fourth Amendment violations. \"The government's powers are not limitless,\" the complaint read.\n\nIn July of last year, Willem Van Spronsen, a 69-year-old, self-identified anarchist, who went by the pen name Emma Durutti , was shot dead by police while allegedly carrying a rifle and throwing \"lit objects\" at vehicles used at a privately run ICE jail in Tacoma, Washington. The incident is the most serious escalation of force involving leftists challenging DHS to date. Other reported threats that federal authorities have investigated in recent years appear far shakier.\n\nLast May, the FBI circulated a report, later leaked to Yahoo News and included in the BlueLeaks cache, titled \"Anarchist Extremists Very Likely Increasing Targeting of US Government Entities in Arizona, Increasing Risk of Armed Conflict.\" As Yahoo News noted in its coverage, which included interviews with individuals included in the document, \"almost all of the evidence cited in the report involved nonviolent protest activity.\" The reporting came just months after the San Diego Union-Tribune broke the news that the Trump administration's targeting of journalists and advocates at the border may have been linked to a bizarre FBI investigation in which an alleged \"Mexico-based cartel associate known as Cobra Commander\" was suspected of trying to sell guns to antifa in order to \"stage an armed rebellion at the border.\"\n\nLike many of the materials that have emerged from the Blue Leaks trove, DHS documents concerning antifa suggest that the agency struggles to identify real threats in a world rife with internet jokes. In July 2019, for example, CBP alerted personnel about a social media user who had compared immigration agents to the \"gestapo\" and written \"kill all ICE agents,\" and \"an Antifa member\" who had written the following: \"I have perfected an acid that you can mix into milkshakes that will still taste refreshing and creamy but give you 3rd degree chemical burns hit me up.\" CBP followed the milkshake intel with a list of precautions \"to reduce the risk of targeting or attack.\"\n\nThe antifa-anarchist boogeyman that has haunted the minds of the nation's border and immigration agencies for the past three and a half years has now gone national. According to a leaked DHS document obtained by Lawfare , the same office of intelligence and analysis that described \"anti-fascist (ANTIFA) anarchist extremists\" as domestic terrorists in 2018 is now collecting intelligence for federal law enforcement operations in Portland.\n\nJust days after George Floyd was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis and a local precinct went up in flames, Trump declared that he would designate antifa a terrorist organization. Highlighting antifa by name, Attorney General William Barr announced that the nation's JTTFs, the same federal task forces involved in Salazar's deportation, would be called upon to \" identify criminal organizers and instigators \" whose role in hijacking the nationwide protests amounted to \"domestic terrorism.\" According the attorney general, the FBI is currently pursuing more than 500 such investigations. Incidentally, \"instigator,\" along with the word \"antifa,\" was one of the markers used in the secret DHS database of advocates on the border.\n\n\"We shouldn't be looking at DHS in isolation from DOJ,\" Faiza Patel, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told The Intercept. \"Historically those two agencies have been engaged in turf battles, but it does seem that they are working pretty much in tandem here.\"\n\nAs The Intercept reported earlier this month, an official Trump Super PAC has pointed to the administration's antifa crackdown to raise money for the president's reelection campaign. \"This is a political move,\" Patel said. \"The feds don't normally respond to graffiti when the local police say they can handle it.\" In a press conference on Wednesday, the president, accompanied by Barr and the heads of DHS and the FBI, announced that ramped-up federal law enforcement will be coming to several other cities around the country.\n\nWhen the White House began pushing DHS into New York as part of the sanctuary city crackdown earlier this year, an underground network of advocates organized a rapid response system for identifying ICE activity in immigrant communities. Experiences like that are now informing how immigration advocates interpret and respond to the present moment, Douša explained. \"It's very concerning to us, but it doesn't feel all that different to me yet,\" she said. To the extent that there have been any radical shifts in the past few weeks, she said, it's the fact \"that white people are starting to care.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don't have ads, so we depend on our members to help us hold the powerful to account.

      "text": "Republicans Keep Pretending Antifa Is Equivalent to Violent White Supremacists\n\nJohn Minchillo/AP\n\nSenators investigating the lack of police preparation that contributed to the January 6 Capitol ransacking by right-wing extremists grilled FBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday about the intelligence the bureau had gathered, and with whom it had shared information prior to the attack.\n\nSome lawmakers, though, used the opportunity to question Wray about the FBI's domestic terrorism efforts. In his opening statement, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, spent more time asking Wray about far-left extremists. \"How do you plan to make your left-wing anarchist domestic extremism program as robust as your right-wing and white supremacist domestic extremism program?\" he asked, after spending several minutes listing instances of violence and rioting allegedly undertaken by Black Lives Matter protesters, Antifa, and anarchists the previous summer.\n\nWray sidestepped the trap, noting that the FBI doesn't classify domestic terrorism as \"right\" or \"left,\" but rather looks at ideological motivations, such as white supremacy and anti-government or anti-immigrant sentiments.\n\nBut Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) fired back at Grassley's disingenuous line of questioning. While he himself condemns left-wing violence, too, Durbin said, such violence pales in comparison with the spike of violent right-wing behavior America has witnessed under Trump. \"Let's stop pretending that the threat of Antifa is equivalent to the white supremacist threat,\" he said. \"Vandalizing a federal courthouse in Portland is a crime. It should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. But it is not equivalent to a violent attempt to overthrow the results of elections, nor is it equivalent to mass shootings targeting minority communities.\"\n\nThe agency's lack of focus may help explain why an FBI memo outlining the credible threat of violence on January 6 was all but ignored by law enforcement agencies. During a Senate hearing last week, former US Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund testified that some officers in his department had received the memo, sent by the FBI's Norfolk office on January 5, but that it was never brought up the chain of command. In fact, Sund claimed he only learned of the memo 24 hours prior to his testimony.\n\nAfter more needling from Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) about how the FBI monitors and assesses domestic terrorist groups, Wray made a stunning revelation: the FBI does not maintain lists of right-wing extremist groups such as the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, or even the Ku Klux Klan because, he said, there's no legal definition for a domestic terror group-just international terror groups. His revelation tracks with concerns Senate Democrats raised in a letter to Wray last week, accusing the FBI of \"taking steps in recent years that minimize the threat of white supremacist and far-right violence.\" Even Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-SC.), a diehard Trump loyalist, told Wray \"it's time\" the FBI started to think about defining domestic terrorism organizations.\n\nWray described the Norfolk memo as \"raw, unverified, uncorroborated\" information that the FBI had gathered from online posts. The agency had shared it as an email to the Joint Terrorism Task Force, in a briefing at the bureau's DC field office, and at a meeting at FBI headquarters that involved DC police. It also was shared through a law enforcement portal, Wray testified. But Sund, along with the former House and Senate Sergeants-at-arms Paul Irving and Michael Stenger, along with Metropolitan Police Department acting chief Robert Contee blamed the FBI for providing insufficient intelligence.\n\nWhile the Norfolk memo remains undisclosed, the Washington Post reported that it contained at least one social media thread that called for violence on January 6: \"Be ready to fight. Congress needs to hear glass breaking, doors being kicked in, and blood from their BLM and Pantifa slave soldiers being spilled. Get violent. Stop calling this a march, or rally, or a protest. Go there ready for war. We get our President or we die. NOTHING else will achieve this goal.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Facebook Announces Crackdown on QAnon, Antifa, and Militias\n\nRomanian supporters of QAnon protest against the government's measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infections during a rally in Bucharest, Romania on Monday. AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda\n\nFacebook said on Wednesday that it will be taking enforcement action targeting communities related to the QAnon conspiracy theory amid a larger crackdown against what it said were \"anarchist groups that support violent acts amidst protests\" including elements of Antifa and \"US-based militia organizations.\"\n\nIn a post on its website, Facebook explained that people from these groups would still be allowed to post on its platform \"so long as they do not otherwise violate our content policies\" but that the company would \"restrict their ability to organize on our platform.\"\n\nFacebook said that the new enforcement would cover pages and groups on its namesake product as well as accounts on Instagram involved in discussions of violence.\n\nUnder the changes, Facebook says it has already removed over 790 groups, 100 pages, and 1,500 ads tied to QAnon, blocked over 300 hashtags on both Facebook and Instagram, and \"additionally imposed restrictions\" on over 12,000 Instagram and Facebook pages.\n\nIn the post , the company outlined plans to limit the spread and reach of the targeted groups by either removing them from Facebook outright, or through a series of actions including limiting their appearances in recommendations, searches, and on users' newsfeeds. The company said that it would also prohibit such groups from using ads and monetization and fundraising tools.\n\nIt's not immediately clear why Facebook would include antifa alongside action targeting QAnon and militia organizations. Since 1994, right-wing terrorism has been responsible for the murder of hundreds , while antifa has been responsible for zero deaths.\n\nQAnon, the sprawling right-wing conspiracy theory about a cabal of elite liberal pedophiles has already likely been responsible for at least one murder in its three short years of existence. The FBI has also deemed it to be a pressing threat. One of the creators of a dataset at the Center for Strategic and International Studies tracking terrorism incidents explained to the Guardian that the data shows that \"the most significant domestic terrorism threat comes from white supremacists\" as well as \"anti-government militias.\" He noted that the data found that \"left-wing terrorism\" was not a \"major terrorism threat.\"\n\nFacebook has strained to project a measure of evenhandedness in its enforcement actions, even in cases where problems are largely confined to its right-wing users. For example, the head of Facebook's D.C. office Joel Kaplan, for example, pushed Mark Zuckerberg to include right-wing sites like the Daily Caller in its fact-checking programs alongside centrist news outlets, despite its ties to white supremacists . Facebook's decision to include antifa and anarchists alongside groups with established records of violence is consistent with that strategy.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump's Lawyer Falsely Blames Insurrection on Antifa, Directly Contradicting FBI\n\nAP\n\nMichael van der Veen, an attorney for Donald Trump's defense in his second impeachment trial, suggested on Friday that Antifa was responsible for the January 6 Capitol insurrection-a false accusation that blatantly contradicts the assessment of the FBI .\n\nThe lie echoes House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who asserted last month that \"everybody across this country\" bears responsibility for the Capitol attack. These are attempts to obscure the fact that the former president fomented his supporters to unleash violence in order to stop the election certification while recalling Trump's infamous claim that \"both sides\"-left and right-were to blame for the white supremacist-borne violence in Charlottesville in 2017. (Later on Friday, Trump's lawyers made the mind-boggling decision to re-air Trump's Charlottesville meltdown to once again rewrite that history .)\n\nAs I wrote at the time, by extending blame for the Capitol insurrection to everyone , McCarthy has rendered responsibility a moot point. Trump's defense team has now one-upped that by falsely accusing extremists of \"various different stripes and political persuasions\" were behind the pro-Trump Capitol attack last month when countless pieces of video evidence, charging documents, and law enforcement assessments rebut that bold lie. But with a defense so weak that debuted dead on arrival, who can afford to care about the truth?\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Inside the Underground Anti-Racist Movement That Brings the Fight to White Supremacists\n\nWes Enzinna May/June 2017 Issue\n\nArt by Max-O-Matic\n\nAt lunchtime on May 19, 2012, 18 masked men and women shouldered through the front door of the Ashford House restaurant in Tinley Park, Illinois, a working-class suburb of Chicago. Some diners mistook the mob for armed robbers. Others thought they might be playing a practical joke. But Steven Speers, a stalactite-bearded 33-year-old who had just sat down for appetizers at a white nationalist meet and greet, had a hunch who they were. The gang filing in with baseball bats, police batons, hammers, and nunchucks were members of Anti-Racist Action (ARA) and the Hoosier Anti-Racist Movement (HARM), two groups dedicated to violently confronting white supremacists.\n\n\"Hey, bitches!\" one of the anti-racists shouted before charging Speers' table. \"ARA is going to fuck this place up!\"\n\nSpeers stood up and warned his seven companions to prepare to fight. His girlfriend, Beckie Williams, who had organized the lunchtime gathering on the white supremacist website Stormfront, grabbed a butter knife. Francis Gilroy, a homeless man who had driven up from Florida to find \"work for whites,\" as an online ad for the meeting promised, tried to pull the attackers off his companions. Williams was clubbed on the arm. Speers was hit on the head so hard he vomited.\n\nAn 80-year-old woman celebrating her granddaughter's high school graduation at a nearby table was also pushed to the floor. A retired cop who believed he was witnessing a terrorist attack used a chair to knock out one of the masked intruders. That's when they ran off, dragging their dazed companion.\n\nIn less than two minutes, the anti-racists had unleashed a flurry of destruction . A mosaic of smashed glass covered the floor. Blood polka-dotted the ceiling. Three people required medical care.\n\nOne group of attackers raced away in a cherry red Dodge Neon. Jason Sutherlin, a 33-year-old with the words \"TIME BOMB\" tattooed across his knuckles, rode shotgun. His half-brother Dylan drove, and his half-brother Cody, along with their cousin John Tucker, squeezed into the backseat with 22-year-old Alex Stuck, who'd been decked in the restaurant. They sped toward Interstate 80, which would take them home to central Indiana.\n\nAn off-duty police sergeant who'd heard a radio call about the attack spotted the Neon and turned on her siren. When she looked inside the parked car, amid the sweaty men she saw a baton, a baseball cap that said \"Anti-Racist,\" and a black and red scarf spelling out \"HARM.\" The men were arrested and charged with felony mob action and aggravated battery, which together carried up to seven years behind bars. (Speers and Gilroy were also arrested-Speers for a charge of possessing child pornography.)\n\nSutherlin and his four compatriots would soon come to be known as the Tinley Park Five. Though they had launched the Hoosier Anti-Racist Movement just six months earlier, the attack would make them the public faces of a small yet militant movement that had been waging war on right-wing extremists for decades. HARM was part of Anti-Racist Action, a national group that had spent more than 20 years trying to expose and combat radical right-wing activity with tactics that ranged from counseling kids in neo-Nazi gangs to harassment and physical violence. Most of their actions received little attention, though they occasionally made headlines, like after the 2002 Battle of York , where ARA members attacked a white supremacist march in a Pennsylvania town, or the time in 2009 when pepper-spray-wielding ARA members broke up a New York City speech by the British Holocaust denier David Irving. But mostly, this war was invisible beyond the predominantly white working-class youths caught up in it.\n\nAs the election of Donald Trump has ushered white supremacists and their ideas from the fringes to the mainstream, their most militant foes have also come out of the shadows. On Inauguration Day, Richard Spencer, the white nationalist who coined the term \"alt-right,\" was punched in the face on a Washington, DC, street corner. The blow was caught on video, spawning countless remixes and a debate over the ethics and efficacy of \"Nazi punching.\" That same night, a Trump supporter shot and wounded an anti-fascist, or \"antifa,\" who was protesting a speech by Breitbart provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos at the University of Washington in Seattle. Less than two weeks later, \"black bloc\" protesters in Berkeley, California, helped force the cancellation of another Yiannopoulos speech , setting fires, smashing windows, and punching a Milo fan. Nationwide, new militant groups like Redneck Revolt are recruiting the next generation of activists who believe that white liberals are not up to the challenge of beating back right-wing extremists. The story of HARM's rise and fall is a prequel to this moment, and a revealing tale about an underground war that's been simmering for years and may now be poised to explode.\n\nThe seed for HARM was planted in People's Park, a tangle of trees and footpaths in downtown Bloomington, Indiana, where in 1968 an African American graduate student named Clarence Turner opened a small store called the Black Market . In a state with a long history of white supremacism (in 1925, nearly one-third of all adult white males there belonged to the Ku Klux Klan, and the governor was a sympathizer), the shop celebrated African and African American culture by selling dashikis and Malcolm X speeches. A few months after it opened, two Klan members firebombed it on Christmas. \"This will not be an open season on niggers,\" Turner shouted during a rally in front of the ashen skeleton of his shop.\n\nBy the 1990s, People's Park had become a hangout spot for punks, ravers, hippies, petty drug dealers, and college kids looking to score. It was there around 1996 that Jason Sutherlin met Telly, another teen from a nearby town. Telly introduced Sutherlin to Nomad, a hulking, half-Puerto Rican tattoo artist. (These names are aliases that they asked me to use to avoid being targeted by white supremacists; the investigation into the Tinley Park assaults is ongoing.) Long before they would become leaders of the local anti-racist movement, the three teens \"chased the same cute punk girls,\" Sutherlin recalls. \"At first, they were my competition, but then we became pals.\"\n\nThe trio shared a love of hip-hop and punk and a hatred for bullies. It was at house parties and concerts that they got their first introduction to Indiana's numerous white supremacist gangs-specifically, the Hammerskins and the Vinlanders Social Club. Sutherlin recalls attending a show where a Hammerskin stabbed a Latino kid. At another show, concertgoers tried to kick out a group of neo-Nazis, one of whom fired a gun into the air. (More recently, three Vinlanders nearly beat a homeless black man to death in Indianapolis in 2007.) Sutherlin was shocked by the neo-Nazis' boldness, but he was just as impressed by how the older punks stood up to them. \"That culture of not taking any shit seeped into my consciousness.\"\n\nSutherlin had grown up in a diverse, working-class family that moved frequently between Indiana, Texas, and Florida. \"We were crazy white trash, but my mom ran a very multicultural household,\" he said. He had a gay Latino babysitter and his younger sister's dad is black. Sutherlin recalled walking down the street with her near their home outside Bloomington when she was four. \"Look,\" a man shouted from the window of his pickup. \"He's got his own little nigger!\" When the 14-year-old Sutherlin launched a bottle of Snapple at the truck, the man jumped out and beat him up. \"In that moment, I realized that if there's anything in life worth throwing down over,\" he said, \"that was it.\"\n\nIn July 1999, a 21-year-old Indiana University student who had fallen under the sway of a neo-Nazi cult called the World Church of the Creator went on a two-state, three-day shooting spree , wounding nine people and killing two, including a Korean graduate student in Bloomington. Still, Sutherlin and his friends weren't overtly interested in politics yet-they just liked hanging out in the park, going to shows, drinking, and getting into fights. Sutherlin describes himself during his teens and early 20s as a \"hoodrat.\" One night in 1999, after he'd dropped out of school, he burglarized a house, stealing several computers to get money to buy cocaine. He was sentenced to two years. An acquaintance who was also an inmate at the same facility later joined the prison branch of the Vinlanders Social Club. \"He wasn't even racist,\" Sutherlin said, \"but I think the power of the group appealed to him. If you're a disaffected young man, any strong masculine identity will hold sway over you.\"\n\nSutherlin became active in politics after getting out of prison and having a child. \"Bringing a son into this world made me feel like I had to make things better for him,\" he said. Punk, rap lyrics, and his family's diversity had fostered his interest in left-wing ideas, but now he read voraciously about slavery, capitalism, and sexism. Michelle Alexander's book The New Jim Crow , which documents the link between race and mass incarceration, \"blew my mind.\" He became fascinated by the militant 19th-century abolitionist John Brown. He went on a diet and lost nearly 150 pounds.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, Sutherlin took it as a sign that America might finally be reckoning with its racist past. \"He was the first president I ever believed in,\" he says. \"Like, I was telling my family to vote for him.\" But after Obama's election, the political climate seemed to sour and the racial progress Sutherlin had hoped for never materialized. \"America just would not accept a black man as its leader. It enraged me to fully realize that.\"\n\nFanning the flames of Sutherlin's anger was the emergence of the tea party and birtherism, and the \"failure of mainstream Democratic or Republican politicians to aggressively challenge\" these movements' racist and nativist messages. This frustration led him to People's Park, where a small crowd gathered at the former site of the Black Market one night in October 2011. Just three weeks after Occupy Wall Street took over New York's Zuccotti Park, Occupy Bloomington was born. Sutherlin helped build a kitchen and cook communal meals, and he didn't sleep for two days. He was thrilled to be involved in activism of some kind, even if it wasn't directly addressing racism.\n\nToward the end of the year, Thomas Buhls, a former Marine and organizer for the Knights, the public wing of the Ku Klux Klan, showed up around People's Park handing out recruitment pamphlets and talking about \"white genocide.\" Buhls was part of a new wave of young white supremacists who pioneered the recruitment approach since adopted by the so-called alt-right: rebranding white nationalism not as a philosophy of racial superiority, but as a common-sense extension of identity politics in which the white working class is portrayed as victims of immigration, affirmative action, and multiculturalism. In this world-view, white anti-racists were an especially loathsome threat to racial solidarity. \"If I tell the obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the white race, Liberals and respectable conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews,\" wrote Robert Whitaker, a former Reagan administration aide, in his \"Mantra,\" a mini-manifesto that appeared online in 2006 and has served as a touchstone for white nationalists. \"They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-white. 'Anti-racist' is a code word for anti-white.\"\n\n\"Buhls was telling people the recession happened because of the Jew bankers, because the Latinos were stealing jobs,\" Sutherlin remembers. He and Telly would confront Buhls when they got the chance, and Sutherlin told him not to bother people in the park. \"His audacity, man, of showing up at the spot where the Black Market had been firebombed.\"\n\n\"I wasn't sure if I was racist or anti-racist,\" recalls Alex Stuck. \"I just knew I was pissed off.\" A high school dropout from Terre Haute, Indiana, who also participated in Occupy Bloomington, Stuck worked at a pizza shop beneath the pub where Sutherlin was a bartender and bouncer. Stuck had a cockatiel Mohawk, a teardrop inked beneath his right eye, and an underbite reminiscent of a French bulldog. \"I was your average dumb kid,\" he says. \"I'd tell a racist joke or use a racist slur.\" But Sutherlin began to school him about white privilege, sexism, and structural racism. \"Before that, I was a muggle,\" Stuck says, referring to the term for Harry Potter characters without magical powers.\n\nThe magic Sutherlin introduced him to was the history of the secret war between anti-racists and white supremacists. Like most wars, this one had its own martyrs and heroes. There was the tragedy of Greensboro, North Carolina, where in 1979 Klansmen and neo-Nazis opened fire on a \"Death to the Klan\" rally, killing five participants. There were the Baldies, a 1980s Minneapolis street crew , whose shaved heads, bomber jackets, boots, and braces mirrored the attire of the racist skinheads they booted out of town. And then there was Anti-Racist Action, which merged the moralism of America's abolitionist tradition with the nihilism of punk rock and viewed the culture war as a literal war on racists, sexists, and homophobes, whom they denounced as fascists. \"Racism is an idea,\" an anonymous ARA member said in the 2000 documentary Invisible Revolution , but \"fascism is an idea mixed with action. It took fascism to establish Jim Crow and before that, slavery...Anti-Semitism has been around a long time, but it took fascism to [make] the Holocaust...When you cross that threshold, you negate your rights to a calm, collective conversation.\"\n\nIf ARA was the brawn of the anti-racist movement, its most prominent brain was Noel Ignatiev, a Marxist, an ex-steelworker, and a former lecturer for Harvard University's African American studies department. He founded a journal, Race Traitor , as a vehicle for his theories about how to attack and erode white privilege. Anti-racist whites must commit \"treason to whiteness\" by rejecting the benefits skin color confers upon them, Ignatiev argued. \"Be reverse Oreos,\" he told the New York Times in 1997 . \"Defy the rules of whiteness-flagrantly, publicly. When someone makes a racial slur in your presence, say, 'You probably think I'm white because I look white.'\" He added that \"challenging people on their whiteness can lead to harsh confrontations, even blows.\" Breitbart described him as the \"Harvard professor [who] calls for the 'destruction' of the 'white race.'\"\n\nSutherlin, Telly, and Nomad cited this legacy as inspiration for the group they formed in the winter of 2011, just before Occupy Bloomington was evicted from People's Park. \"The feeling was that Occupy had been too moderate and unfocused,\" says Sutherlin's cousin John Tucker, who worked with Sutherlin as a bouncer. He credits his interest in HARM to teenage run-ins with neo-Nazis and to the times he heard his mother, who has a dark complexion, being called \"wetback\" and \"squaw\" by strangers in Bloomington. \"This was going to be something more effective,\" Tucker said. \"Protesting and camping is nice, but this was going to have results.\"\n\nAt HARM's first official meeting, a few dozen people showed up at Sutherlin's apartment with potluck dishes and beer. Telly stood before the crowd and announced the new group's name and mission. Adopting Anti-Racist Action's four-point platform, HARM promised to fight racists with direct action, eschewing protests or legislative efforts in favor of, say, hacking neo-Nazis' email accounts, providing security at gay pride parades, and exposing the shady pasts of bigoted candidates. \"This is a war,\" Telly said, \"and we intend to win.\"\n\nThat's when all but about 10 people left. \"Some of them were hipster liberals,\" said Stuck. \"Once it came down to the nitty-gritty and we started discussing tactics, they were like, 'We don't wanna be a part of this.'\"\n\nThose who stayed included Tucker, who'd never been involved in politics before, and Sutherlin's affable 23-year-old half-brother, Cody. Nomad arrived later that night. Stuck recalls seeing him-muscular as a middleweight, his head Bic-razored, his throat adorned with a tattoo of a switchblade-and thinking, \"That's who I want to be.\" \"I was a disenfranchised white youth,\" Stuck says, \"and thank God that [HARM] got to me first. I could have easily went the opposite direction.\"\n\nNomad had that exact fear about his 14-year-old son, who had recently come home with a neo-Nazi recruitment flyer. White supremacists had even shown up at the tattoo parlor where Nomad worked and tried to recruit him, not realizing he was a militant anti-racist-and half Puerto Rican. \"They are poisoning these kids,\" Nomad said.\n\nTelly was particularly alarmed by the growing acceptance of extreme right-wing ideas and figures. \"It was terrifying,\" he said. The birther movement and Arizona's 2010 anti-immigrant law were \"barely veiled racist sentiments that sounded like stuff white supremacists would advocate, not what members of the Republican Party would typically find acceptable.\" Telly recalled J.T. Ready, an Arizona Republican committeeman and a former member of the National Socialist Movement who killed his family and himself after the FBI began investigating his border militia group for the murder of undocumented immigrants. There was also Jack Hunter, who had worked as an aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) until it came out that he'd made pro-Confederate statements and written that \"John Wilkes Booth's heart was in the right place.\" These people didn't have much influence, Telly acknowledged, but \"it was fucking insane that they had any influence whatsoever. Things had gone so far to the right, and we wanted to pull them back to the left.\"\n\nWith its core members assembled, HARM planned an action: It would confront Buhls, who was holding a \"European Heritage\" rally in downtown Bloomington. In preparation, the activists lifted weights in Sutherlin's garage \"to beef up so we could break bones better,\" says Stuck, half-seriously. On the day of the rally, in April 2012, more than 100 people came out to protest Buhls, who showed up with just one friend. The HARM members didn't have a concrete plan to challenge Buhls, and before they could do anything two protesters ran up and punched him. His \"Celebrate White Heritage\" sign capsized into a sea of counterprotesters. Police whisked him away in a patrol car for his own safety.\n\nA few weeks later, HARM stormed the restaurant in Illinois. While Sutherlin and the rest of the Tinley Park Five sat in jail, their comrades found their next target: the newly formed White Student Union at Indiana University. Matthew Heimbach, a white nationalist leader from Maryland , had pioneered the first White Student Union at Towson University outside Baltimore before helping spread the concept to other schools. Bloomington's White Student Union announced its presence on campus by planning an \"American White History Month.\"\n\nBut less than a week after the White Student Union made its debut, a disturbing notice was posted on the group's Facebook page by its founder, an IU undergrad:\n\nI just spent all night in the hospital.\n\nWhile walking down 10th...a blue van pulled up and four figures poured out of the vehicle...All of them wore all black clothing and had either ski masks or bandanas covering their faces...\n\nWhat's up...? That's the only thing they said. I got hit in the head with something from behind. I fell down and told them that was enough. At this point all...of them proceeded to kick me for what felt like hours. At some point I passed out. I didn't think I would ever wake up again.\n\nNone of it was true-it was an elaborate psyops scheme. HARM had plastered flyers all over Bloomington denouncing the White Student Union's founder as a racist and then promised to stop only if he handed over access to the group's Facebook page. Amazingly, he did. Then HARM invented the story of the beating to elicit notes of sympathy from other white supremacists. Once the post was up, they \"doxed\" those who replied, posting their real names and email addresses online.\n\n\"Though we support direct action against white supremacy,\" an anonymous HARM member gloated on the group's website after revealing the hoax, \"we also believe in proportional responses and it is our belief that this fictitious action would have been overkill.\" In other words, actually beating up the college kid who started the White Student Union would have been a step too far, but harassing him and outing his sympathizers was not. Heimbach \"found a young naive conservative kid and turned him into the next battle in the war against racial supremacy,\" the HARM member wrote, adding that the student had agreed to disband the White Student Union as a result of the hacking. \"White supremacists are like rabid dogs...Just like rabid dogs, putting them down is always the most humane approach.\"\n\nI met Telly and Nomad in Columbus, Ohio, several months after the Tinley Park attack. Sutherlin and his brothers, his cousin, and Stuck were in Chicago awaiting trial, and Telly and Nomad were participating in a fundraiser to pay bail. They led me to a carriage house behind a \"big-ass, beautiful mansion,\" as Nomad described it, where a crowd of about 50 people greeted us. Many were HARM and ARA members, and I wondered if any of the remaining 13 fugitives were among them. (I never found out.) They were dressed in Mad Max-style punk garb-black jeans, black hoodies, bomber jackets, and combat boots, with neck and face tattoos, septum piercings, and rainbow-colored bandannas. They included a few African Americans and a dozen women. As Bob Fitrakis, a political-science professor and voting rights activist who hosted the event, wrote, they \"exuded an aura that made the Weathermen look like the Brady Bunch.\"\n\nFitrakis, a paunchy man with a ducktail mullet, was running for Congress as the candidate of the Green Party, which had co-sponsored the evening with ARA. His supporters, who had paid $25 to attend, mingled awkwardly with the radicals. Circulating among them was the Green Party's then-vice presidential candidate, an anti-poverty activist named Cheri Honkala. \"Dude,\" Nomad said to me after a woman wearing a pearl brooch offered him a glass of zinfandel on a silver tray. The switchblade tattooed across his throat wiggled as he spoke. \"This is a little out of my league.\"\n\n\"These kids are the future,\" said a sweaty, elderly man who asked that I not use his name because he was a \"prominent professor.\" He wore a black blazer over a T-shirt with a peace sign. \"This is what the left needs-working-class, radical youth who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty and scare the bejesus out of the teabaggers!\"\n\n\"I guess there's a time and a place for everything, even electoral politics,\" Nomad said as he handed me a PBR, glaring at the clean-cut and middle-aged partygoers around us. He took a swig from a bottle of Southern Comfort he'd stashed in his back pocket. \"But-and I hate to use gendered language like this-liberals are fucking pussies, man. Sometimes you've got to put on the big-boy boots and stomp through some mud.\"\n\nAfter Honkala made a speech about her work as a housing activist in Philadelphia, Telly and two other ARA members sat at the front of the room and described what had happened at the Ashford House. Nomad, standing beside me, snorted tearfully into a red handkerchief when Telly read a letter Jason Sutherlin had sent from jail. \"People might think our actions are extreme,\" Telly told the crowd, \"but these guys\"-neo-Nazis-\"are often so far beyond the law that they don't respond to legal appeals. They don't care if hate crime legislation is enacted; it makes no difference to them. The situation in America has reached a critical tipping point, and we need to fight back with whatever tactics are effective at sending these guys back into the caves they crawled out of.\"\n\n\"Right on, brother,\" a snowy-haired man said.\n\nOther Green Party members golf-clapped. The professor in the black blazer raised his champagne glass.\n\nA hand suddenly shot up in the crowd. \"Am I hearing you right?\" asked an elegant African American woman with a bundle of silver-streaked hair and a \"No War in Iraq\" button on her straw purse. \"You guys advocate violence?\" She'd never heard of HARM or ARA and had been attracted by their names, she explained, but weren't they just as bad as the people they were fighting? \"Doesn't your approach make you just like the Nazis?\"\n\n\"Bullshit,\" an ARA activist fake-sneezed, flashing a shit-eating smile. The questioner stormed out of the room. Telly ran a hand over his shaved head and sighed. \"We're not remotely the same,\" he told the remaining crowd. \"We support a diversity of tactics.\" He reminded listeners that most of ARA's actions were nonviolent-removing swastika tattoos from ex-convicts, counseling juvenile offenders, providing security at protests. \"Violence is never our default response, and it's a tiny fraction of what we do,\" he said. \"But it is one weapon in our tool kit. We're not afraid to acknowledge when nonviolence is obviously not working. What you're doing, what the liberal left is doing, frankly isn't working.\"\n\nFive months later , I met Jason Sutherlin at East Moline Correctional Center, a turreted fortress circled by razor wire rising out of the cornfields of western Illinois, where he'd been sentenced to six years following a plea deal. His brothers, his cousin, and Stuck were sent elsewhere in the state to serve terms ranging from three and a half to six years. (A sixth Ashford House attacker, 28-year-old Jason Hammond, was later arrested and sentenced to three and a half years. His twin brother, Jeremy, is serving a 10-year sentence for hacking the security company Stratfor.) The rest of the Tinley Park attackers remain at large and are unknown.\n\nSutherlin shook my hand, the T-I-M-E on his knuckles interlacing through mine, as he sheepishly slipped the B-O-M-B hand into the pocket of his prison denims. \"That guy acts tougher than he is,\" he said, nodding toward a beefy prisoner sitting near us in the visitation room, bouncing his son on a leg adorned with a large swastika tattoo. Sutherlin's eyes are cottonseed blue and heavily lidded, and his slightly upturned nose gives him a wary, porcine appearance. On his bicep is a tattoo that says \"Fools Rush In,\" and he has the physique of a dead lifter, a huge torso held up by a pair of tiny sawhorse legs. \"My best friend in here is a queer black dude,\" he told me, grinning. \"But the Nazis don't mess with us.\"\n\nWhite supremacist gangs have an active presence in some Illinois prisons, and Sutherlin told me a story about a white guard who had approached him one day and said, menacingly, \"I know why you're in here.\" Later, Sutherlin found himself alone with the same guard. The guard walked up to Sutherlin and flashed a photo of his wife, who is African American. \"I think you'll be all right in this prison,\" the guard said. \"I totally misread the dude,\" Sutherlin told me. \"He was congratulating me.\"\n\nWhy risk so much to fight racism? I asked. Is this even his fight?\n\n\"My sister is black,\" he said, \"and that gave me a different experience of growing up in Indiana. Today, racism has reached a whole other level. It literally makes me sick to my stomach.\"\n\n\"But why is violence necessary?\" I pressed him. \"You seem awfully preoccupied with morality-isn't violence wrong?\"\n\n\"Part of me feels bad for the whole attack,\" he said. \"Some central part of me thinks that all violence is oppression, and it's never, ever right to oppress another person for their beliefs, identity, sexuality, or any other reason, no matter how heinous. But another part of me thinks that these guys aren't worth that consideration-they're such scumbags. All you can do is stop them from influencing others at this point.\"\n\n\"Is it a danger to dehumanize them?\"\n\n\"Yeah, man, it is. I think about that every day. I don't want to dehumanize anybody.\"\n\nI later spoke with Brandon Spiller, whom Sutherlin had hit in the head with a steel baton at Tinley Park. He told me that being attacked had strengthened his conviction that whites are under siege in America. In the months after the assault, he said he'd received dozens of threatening phone calls from ARA members at his home in Wisconsin. \"It's definitely made me more likely to use my gun next time,\" he said.\n\nThis is one of the paradoxes of militant anti-racist tactics: Attempting to stop hate crimes by policing thought crimes may reinforce the narrative of victimization that radicalizes some extremists in the first place. Research also suggests that violent protest may drive would-be allies toward more reactionary positions. Even Ignatiev, the anti-racist intellectual, doubts the efficacy of attacks like the one at the Ashford House. Activists should focus on dismantling the institutions and social structure that perpetuate racism, he has written. \"Race is not the work of racists.\"\n\nHeimbach, now the head of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, told me that groups like ARA help his cause. (Heimbach was filmed shoving a protester at a Trump campaign rally in Louisville, Kentucky, in April 2016.) \"They help reinforce our narrative of white victimization and make recruitment easier.\"\n\nBeckie Williams, however, wrote two weeks after the attack that the incident had caused her to abandon the white power movement. \"Because of the relentless harassment by the ARA TERRORISTS,\" she posted on Stormfront, \"my already tenuous health is being impacted in a extremely severe way. My only recourse is to step away from activism for the sake of my continued survival.\" (The other targets of the Tinley Park attack could not be reached for comment.)\n\nAfter buying Sutherlin another microwave cheeseburger, I suggested that, while his actions might be appropriate in a society like Nazi Germany, in a democracy like ours, maybe they're not. But he didn't buy that; he believes it's the responsibility of groups like HARM to police the boundary between democracy and fascism, keeping right-wing extremists in check, disorganized and unable to spread their ideas in public or harass people. \"We're not living in a fascist society,\" Sutherlin said. \"I know that. But it's happening all around us, in fits and starts.\"\n\nAs Sutherlin scarfed down a third vending-machine cheeseburger, I asked him about Tony Horwitz's book Midnight Rising: John Brown and the Raid That Sparked the Civil War , which I'd mailed him. \"I feel like that book found me at just the right moment,\" he said, a bead of grease dribbling down his chin. We'd been discussing the lesser-known details of Brown's life, like his murder of slavery advocates at Pottawatomie Creek in Kansas in 1856, and the fact that his raid on Harpers Ferry was widely denounced as fanatical violence, even by President Abraham Lincoln. \"I don't know if we're headed for a similar moment in American politics,\" Sutherlin continued. \"But if we are, I want to be someone who did something to stop it, not someone who played it safe and stood by.\"\n\nTen feet away, the guy with the swastika tattoo kissed his son goodbye, and a guard led him away. The brawny, bearded Nazi could have been mistaken for one of Sutherlin's brothers, the resemblance was so strong.\n\nIn January, just before Trump's inauguration, I spoke with Sutherlin and Telly. All six of the Tinley Park attackers had been released from prison and HARM had gone dormant. Telly lives on the East Coast and has helped create a new group, the Torch Network , which combines several of the most radical ARA chapters, including those in Chicago, Philadelphia, and Central Texas. It promises to be just as militant as ARA, if not more. \"New groups call me up and ask for advice,\" Telly said. He cited the emergence of anti-fascist groups like the John Brown Militia, Redneck Revolt, and the Bastards Motorcycle Club as reasons to be optimistic, but otherwise he was gloomy. \"I don't know what to tell them,\" he said. \"We lost. Someone like Trump is what we were trying to prevent from happening.\"\n\n\"I thought we were being alarmist,\" Sutherlin said with a chuckle when I called him at his home outside Bloomington, \"but it turns out things were way worse than even we imagined.\" He's no longer on parole and has been lying low, taking care of his six-year-old son and going to anti-Trump rallies but avoiding more militant activism. Since the election, he said, he'd also heard from people who were inspired by his example and seeking his advice. One was a childhood friend, a \"gun-loving backwoods survivalist\" who had never been political until Trump was elected but recently bought more weapons and talked about defending himself against the radical right wing. \"I think a lot of people are now realizing that you can't be neutral,\" Sutherlin said. \"A lot of people are suddenly realizing you have to pick a side and go to war.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump's Pick for Counterrorism Called for Arresting BLM Leaders as Terrorists\n\nJoe Kent listening to testimony by Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's nominee to be Director of National Intelligence, during her Senate confirmation hearing last week. Tom Williams/AP\n\nJoe Kent, a former Green Beret who is Donald Trump's pick to lead the National Counterterrorism Center, completed 11 combat deployments during the War on Terror. The combat left scars. In 2019, an ISIS suicide bomber killed his wife, a Navy cryptologist and linguist, in Syria. By the time he returned home, his worldview had shifted: Kent came to believe, as I wrote in a 2022 profile, that his early tours in Iraq gave him a \"special gift of clarity.\" He understood how quickly a society could come undone.\n\nAfter this, Kent went from apolitical to active. The Black Lives Matter and antifa protests in Portland during the summer of 2020 triggered fears for him that the United States could similarly implode. Everything, he felt, was crumbling. He and his two young boys quickly left the city for rural Washington.\n\n\"We need to treat antifa and BLM like terrorist organizations. We need to use the tools of the federal government, the FBI, the US Marshals-go after them like organized criminals and terrorists,\" Kent said in a 2021 conversation with the podcaster Tim Pool about the group's leaders. \"So, when we start arresting these guys and charging them with federal terrorism charges, that's going to take away a lot of the incentive to go out and riot.\"\n\nThat is part of what makes putting Kent in charge of the National Counterterrorism Center so unsettling. He is a trained counterinsurgent who is now far more attuned to threats from within than those from overseas.\n\nThe idea that America could quickly collapse but for the vigilance of people like him could serve to justify any number of abuses of power. It was the origin of the political awakening that led to him launch two unsuccessful runs for Congress in 2022 and 2024 defined by his turn toward hard-right politics.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Kent will be a key player in the intelligence apparatus that helped push the United States into the wars he helped fight. The counterterrorism center he is set to lead is itself a response to the 9/11 attacks that shaped so much of his life. As its leader, Kent would work closely with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to share information with state and local law enforcement about potential terrorist threats. He is on track to report to former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, another Iraq-war veteran, who Trump has picked for Director of National Intelligence.\n\nUnder the law, the National Counterterrorism Center is not supposed to handle \"intelligence pertaining exclusively to domestic terrorism.\" But that provision may be less meaningful in an administration that is so obviously willing to violate democratic norms and Congressional intent.\n\nTo an unusual extent for an unapologetically MAGA figure, what even a liberal might make of Kent depends on what part of an interview they hear. When talking about Iraq and Afghanistan, he could be mistaken for Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.). Not only were those wars useless in his telling, they were corrupt conspiracies in which former Vice President Dick Cheney and his cronies at Halliburton enriched themselves with the blood of a volunteer army. (He frames the loss of America's manufacturing base through a similar anti-elite lens.)\n\nWhere Kent would lose a liberal or centrist listener is when he describes returning home to his hometown of Portland, Oregon, following the death of his wife in 2019. Kent made clear in the same interviews that he had come to see fellow citizens as akin to the insurgents he had once fought abroad. \"We thought our war would just be overseas and that we would all come home and finally relax a little,\" he has said. \"But that's just not the case.\" As I wrote in 2022:\n\nKent is the candidate of our not-quite forever war bending back on itself. His campaign did not respond to interview requests, but he has laid out his worldview in hours-long interviews with fellow veterans and right-wing podcasters. The conversations make clear that his enemies are the generals he blames for the deaths of family and friends, the elites waging \"hybrid warfare\" against middle-class Americans, and groups like antifa and Black Lives Matter that operate as \"organized crime syndicates\" and \"terrorist organizations.\" He positions himself as a New Right class warrior. But unlike so many of the New Right's leaders , who skew rich and Ivy League, Kent is not a campus reactionary now out in the world. He is a soldier radicalized by senseless wars.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

YouTube personality Lily Marston tweeted a video of supporters lining the streets to welcome Trump's arrival and noted the \"lack of riot gear or military control to ensure the protection and safety of this very large crowd\"-a tongue-in-cheek clapback to military enforcements present at the massive protests in Washington, DC, against the police killing of George Floyd and Trump's race-baiting behavior and attitudes toward Black Americans.\n\nTrump shared Marston's tweet to explain that \"Riot gear or military control is not necessary because ANTIFA & other Wacko groups of Anarchists aren't present to cause trouble,\" Trump wrote. He called his own throngs of fans \"incredible people.\"\n\nRiot gear or military control is not necessary because ANTIFA & other Wacko groups of Anarchists aren't present to cause trouble. Incredible people. Thank you Maine! https://t.co/KGOcoQORMg\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2020\n\nTrump has been referring to the protesters as \"antifa,\" short for \"antifascist.\" People who affiliate with the label sometimes use violence to oppose fascism. After Trump ordered the National Guard to Minneapolis to break up protests on May 31, Trump congratulated the troops for shutting down the \" ANTIFA led anarchists.\" On Wednesday, Trump referred to the protesters as \"killers, terrorists, arsonists, anarchists, thugs, hoodlums, looters, ANTIFA & others.\" The demonstrations have been largely peaceful, and there is no evidence to suggest antifa has played any major role in them.\n\nEven so, Trump has ordered a hefty military presence as huge crowds continue to gather outside the White House. Their clashes became violent on Monday* when the president ordered federal police to spray tear gas and fire rubber bullets at a crowd so he could walk to St. John's Episcopal Church and take a photograph with a Bible.\n\n*Correction: An original version of this post stated the photo op was on Tuesday, not Monday.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Anarchist Activists Say Facebook Banned Them to Placate the Right\n\nMichael Dwyer\n\nLast month, Facebook finally made an announcement that it had been teasing for weeks. The company said that it would begin taking more aggressive measures targeting QAnon and US-based militia, two groups that have increasingly posed domestic terror threats, including by banning some accounts and pages from its site. At the same time, the social media company announced it would target groups whose origins' lie on the left by taking down anarchist or antifascist accounts that \"support violent acts amidst protests.\"\n\nThe plan's optics offered a surface-level sort of fairness and evenhandedness, implying that groups espousing violence will be banned regardless of politics, no questions asked. But in practice, according to extremism experts and activists, Facebook's enactment of this ban on antifascist accounts has been convoluted, unclear, and unjustified by the standards Facebook has laid out.\n\nAbout a week after the ban was announced, a friend called Kelly C. Wright to let her know that her account had disappeared. With the exception of the removal of a couple of comments she had left on news story posts, Wright says Facebook had never taken action on her account before or given her a warning about breaking their rules.\n\n\"I had read your story earlier in the day, so I whipped out my phone and saw that I had been logged off. And then I popped Facebook up onto my laptop to check, and my account had been banned,\" she recalled over the phone, referencing a post I wrote detailing Facebook's announcement of the ban.\n\nAfter reaching out to some friends, Wright guessed that her account might have been banned because she serves as an administrator of the \"Leftists for Self Defense and Firearm Freedom\" Facebook page, a small page that had barely 1,800 likes. The other moderators of the group also appeared to have been banned, and the page had been suspended.\n\n\"We didn't ever post anything that even supported revolutionary violence or anything like that,\" says Jason Lee, another moderator. \"The cover picture for the page was Black Panthers at the California statehouse . It wasn't anything that advocated for violence.\"\n\nOther members of the page said that any support of violence found there would only have be voiced on the condition it was defensive, a posture that Facebook says would not violate its rules.\n\nFacebook didn't just ban Leftists for Self Defense and Firearm Freedom. When announcing the new policy, the company said it took down 980 groups and 520 pages related to militias and antifascists. While the company declined to break out this data, it did tell me that antifascists made up a comparatively small silver of the numbers. (Facebook also took action against 890 Facebook groups and pages it identified as being associated with QAnon.)\n\nAmong other pages taken down were two large news sources: It's Going Down , an anarchist platform that helps track far-right extremism, and Crimethinc , \"a decentralized anarchist collective\" that has published antifascist articles. Neither appears to have a history of openly advocating for violence.\n\nFacebook spokesperson Sally Aldous declined to comment on the ban's targeting of Crimethinc , It's Going Down , or Leftists for Self Defense and Firearm Freedom, or to provide more detailed reasoning for the removals, but she noted that Facebook looks at on and offline factors when making these decisions.\n\nFacebook's decision to take down the antifascist pages and groups is \"extremely bizarre\" according to Megan Squire, a computer science professor who researches online extremism at Elon University. \"It's not in line with the standards they wrote...This is a very dangerous path that they're going down.\"\n\nTo Squire, one of the most concerning aspects is Facebook's seeming willingness to capitulate to the right's desire for tit for tat moderation, regardless of circumstances. Squire and antifascist activists suspect that the bans are exactly what they look like: a \"both-sides\" attempt to placate conservatives who might get mad that only their side is getting moderated.\n\n\"The idea that they would feel a perverse need to both sides this is ridiculous,\" she said on the phone, before recounting a conversation she had with a member of Facebook's policy team who reached out to learn about her research. \"The very first question that they asked me was, 'Well, do you study both sides?', which is a ridiculous question,\" Squire recalled, explaining that there simply is not an equivalent to far-right extremism.\n\nWhile a Facebook spokesperson denied that antifascists were included in August's prominent moderation action in an attempt to appease the right, it is impossible to look at their inclusion in the same announcement as a QAnon and militia crackdown and not be suspicious.\n\nWhile the looming danger of antifa to America is a well-worn conservative talking point, it doesn't bear out under any scrutiny. While right-wing internet users have seized on reports that police are investigating a man who has voiced support for antifa in Saturday's deadly shooting of a man in Portland, antifascists have practically no contemporary record of harming people in the United States. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a centrist think tank, has cataloged domestic terror attacks since 1994 and found that in that time period, antifascists killed no one. In that same window, right-wing violence had claimed the lives of 329 people, including 117 victims over the past ten years.\n\n\"Leftwing violence has not been a major terrorism threat,\" Seth Jones, a CSIS researcher who led the project, told The Guardian .\n\nWhen pressed on its decision to include antifascists alongside far-right groups, a Facebook spokesperson did not have clear answers but stressed that the measures were aimed at addressing groups advocating violence through \"veiled language\" or promoting \"hypothetical violence\" that would be a threat to public safety. The company did not give a reason as to why anarchists were targeted before other violent groups that remain on the platform. While Facebook announced at the end of June that it would ban groups associated with the boogaloo movement, an armed right-wing sub-culture which says it is preparing for a civil war, many pages supporting the group remain.\n\nFacebook's own parameters for what constitutes anarchist and antifascist advocation of violence are extremely vague. In addition to \"hypothetical violence,\" the spokesperson explained that \"aspirationally encouraging violence\" against individuals or property could qualify. But the company has said not all types of property would be protected from threat, while declining to specify further. Depicting individuals holding weapons, especially in a \"militant\" way, could trigger action from Facebook. If all that sounds ambiguous, it's because it is.\n\n\"I actually don't have problems with starting to question and push back against any individual that supports violence in the U.S.,\" says Jones. But even though some antifascists argue that violence is justified in certain instances, says Jones, it's extremely rare that they ever proactively act on these ideas.\n\nAt least some of the antifascist groups Facebook targeted don't appear to be committed to proactively carrying out violence. Wright and other moderators of Leftists for Self Defense and Firearm Freedom say they are not, leading them to guess that the group's banner picture depicting armed Black Panthers somehow triggered their takedown.\n\nMike Andrews, a member of the It's Going Down editorial collective, explains that violence isn't a core part of his platform's ideology. \"We don't want to kill people or hurt people. We're for people bettering their own conditions. We want to excite people about coming together and doing things,\" Andrews said. While he surmises the site's ban could have been prompted by occasional positive coverage of armed groups to oppose neo-confederates.\n\nLast spring Crimethinc published a piece titled \" Against the Logic of the Guillotine ,\" which was critical of vengeful violence as a political tool. It has also posted other thoughtful meditations on how society conceptualizes when violence is and isn't legitimate and how the state has a monopoly on it. Such thinking represents a stark contrast with QAnon's fantasies about murdering supposed pedophiles or the gruesome fantasies envisioned by many armed militia members.\n\n\"Facebook is not being thoughtful or taking expertise on this issue,\" Squire says. \"They're just figuring it out as they going along.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Right-Wing Conspiracists Linked Antifa to the Wildfires. Then They Got a Big Boost From Russian Media.\n\nMisha Friedman via Getty/Kevin Jantzer via AP/Mother Jones illustration\n\nWildfires have long been weaponized by climate deniers wanting to sow political division. But this week, the blazes consuming the West Coast became part of an election cycle culture war when claims that antifa started wildfires in Portland went viral. There's no evidence that antifa started any wildfires, but conservatives on social media ran with the claim anyway, spreading it far and wide in Facebook groups and on YouTube.\n\nIt's unclear how the conspiracy theory originated, but its first big boost appears to have come courtesy of RT (formerly Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled media outlet known for mixing news with Russian propaganda.) RT's signal boost came in the form of an article that smashed together separate pieces of information about policing in Portland and the wildfires, insinuating a nefarious (and non-existent) link between the two.\n\n\"'Antifa are thrilled to hear this': Portland police ask protesters not to start blazes amid statewide wildfire emergency,\" read a RT headline from September 9th. The story focused on how the Portland Police Department was imploring protestors not to use fire during their demonstrations \"since fire danger is very high right now.\" While the facts of the story are technically true, RT goes out of its way to connect the current wildfire crisis with antifa, by eliding dates, and wrongly conflating incidents. The Sheriff's call for protesters not to use fire came on September 9. The last time protestors set large fires during a protest was on the evening of September 6, lasting into the early hours of the next day. Regardless, RT used video from that night of the 6th (without noting the date the footage) as the primary art for the story.\n\nThe headline is also misleading. Portland Police never said \"Antifa are thrilled to hear this\". That quote was in a tweet from Andy Ngo, a right-wing propagandist who has been associated with the violent far-right group, Patriot Prayer.\n\nTaken together, RT insinuates that antifa, the disparate and splintered group of antifascists, was a catalyst for the wildfires. No such evidence exists. But while they signal-boosted that false claim, RT didn't invent it from whole cloth. By the time Russian state media's post came out, rumors about antifa intentionally starting wildfires had already spread in online forums like Reddit and Facebook for at least a day.\n\nThe most viral post supporting the conspiracy theory that followed RT's article was Law Enforcement Today's now-altered article, initially titled \"Sources: Series of wildfires on the West Coast may be 'coordinated and planned' attack.\" Law Enforcement Today changed it to \"Arson arrests made across the west coast as fires rage on,\" and appended an editor's note, but not before it went viral , further feeding the online right-wing ecosystem.\n\nA day after RT's post, American right-wing websites like The Post Millennial, the right's attempt to create a millennial Breitbart , and the conspiracy-laundering Gateway Pundit , ran their own misleading stories about an alleged arsonist who set a strip of grass in a highway median ablaze in Washington state. The Gateway Pundit initially published an article with the headline \"Antifa Radical Arrested for Arson in Washington State\" on Friday, even though there was no reason to believe that the arson suspect had any ties to antifa (it later quietly removed \"antifa\" from the headline.) The Post Millennial's story was only slightly less misleading, blaming the arson on a BLM activist-on the grounds that his Facebook account showed him attending one Black Lives Matter protest. The publication also claimed he \"led\" the gathering. A video shows him at the front of a protest, but there's no evidence that he organized it.\n\nMatt Binder, a journalist who writes a newsletter on misinformation and who noticed RT trying to link antifa to wildfires , noted that this is how Russian political interference often works. \"A lot of the coverage of the Russia stuff always sort of pushes the idea that Russia is creating narratives and then spreading,\" he explained over the phone. \"That's not what happens. They see the stuff already happening online, and then they just help push it.\"\n\nThat's potentially what happened in this case. Antifa wildfire rumors started online, and then RT helped provide the framing to give the idea more credence, before more cavalier, domestic right-wing sites blew the conspiracy out of control.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Blood on the Sidewalk: A Look at the Political Clashes of the Trump Era\n\nText by Alissa Quart; Photography by Rian Dundon October 25, 2019\n\nSupporters and opponents of Milo Yiannopoulos rally at the University of California campus in Berkeley for a \"free speech\" event where the conservative pundit was scheduled to speak on Sunday, September 24, 2017. Rian Dundon\n\nThis article was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project .\n\nFor the last two years, photojournalist Rian Dundon has documented the escalating protests by Trump supporters and right-wing extremists like the Proud Boys in addition to their antifa counterparts on the left. Each of Dundon's images examines what the media theorist Daniel Boorstin in the early 1960s called pseudo-events , or politics as spectacle. Boorstin's pseudo-events were fabrications by news corporations and political leaders, but today's pseudo events are concocted by extremist groups like the Proud Boys and iPhone-wielding bystanders rather than, say, CBS . The protests Dundon attended were all relatively small-the largest far-right demonstration in Portland in the Trump era comprised a mere 500 activists-but many in attendance were bloggers, YouTubers, and even amateur photographers busily documenting their own expressions of hate or outrage, which amplified the public's perception of these gatherings.\n\nPerformance politics also factor heavily into these demonstrations, by which we mean groups ranging from the Proud Boys and the Patriot Prayer protesters to the black-clad antifa members and congregants of the left-leaning Satanic Temple. At a recent demonstration, Dundon watched Satanists goad Christian right groups with slogans like, \"I fucked God and turned him gay.\"\n\nIt would be a mistake to dismiss these protests as mere theatrics-the extreme emotions on display can be quite authentic. In that sense, these photos also serve as evidence of visceral politics fueled by a key emotion: hate. We ignore the rise of this sort of extreme political affect-the vicious slogans, the narrowed eyes, the contorted faces and the ecstatic embrace of masculine violence-at our own peril. As the scholar William Davies writes in his recent book on the subject, Nervous States: Democracy and the Decline of Reason , \"We have to take people's feelings seriously as political issues, and not simply dismiss them as irrational.\" Democracies, he contends, are being rewritten by the \"power of feelings in ways that cannot be ignored or reversed. This is our reality now.\"\n\nAt a recent rally in Portland, where Dundon lives, he witnessed self-proclaimed patriots, most of whom were white men, marching through the streets. One of them casually told a black woman wearing fatigues and waving an upside-down American flag to protest the current administration that she should \"go back to Africa.\" The images that follow illustrate this new level of antipathy and bigotry, but they also point to these protests' radical tourism, showmanship, and excessive political feeling, in what I can barely believe is still America.\n\nMarchers and counter protesters mix at a rain-soaked \"prayer march\" in downtown Portland, Ore., on September 15, 2019.\n\nA young man reacts in surprise after being assaulted by unidentified assailants during political street skirmishes in Portland, Ore., on August 17, 2019.\n\nSupporters and opponents of Milo Yiannopoulos rally at the University of California campus in Berkeley for a \"free speech\" event where the conservative pundit was scheduled to speak on Sunday, September 24, 2017.\n\nMilitant anti-fascists congregate in Berkeley's Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park during a \"Rally Against Hate\" demonstration on August 27, 2017.\n\nSupporters and opponents of Milo Yiannopoulos rally at the University of California campus in Berkeley for a \"free speech\" event where the conservative pundit was scheduled to speak on Sunday, September 24, 2017.\n\nAnti-fascist Satanists hold a counter protest at a Patriot Prayer march in downtown Portland, Ore., on September 15, 2019.\n\nCounter protesters at a rally organized by the right wing Patriot Prayer group in downtown Portland, Ore., on September 15, 2019.\n\nAttendees at a Proud Boys rally flash hand signs for the camera in Portland, Ore., on August 17, 2019.\n\nAnti-fascist activists confront police in the aftermath of a Proud Boys demonstration in Portland, Ore., on August 17, 2019.\n\nLeftwing activists and members of the media corner a Trump supporter during a \"Rally Against Hate\" demonstration in Berkeley, Calif., on August 27, 2017.\n\nA man displays wounds inflicted by police bean bag rounds in the aftermath of a Proud Boys march in Portland, Ore., on August 17, 2019.\n\nCameramen film Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson during a rally in downtown Portland, Ore., on September 15, 2019.\n\nStreet fighting broke out between anti-fascist activists and right wing attendees at a rally in Portland, Ore., on August 17, 2019.\n\nPatriot Prayer rally, Portland, Ore., October 6, 2019.\n\nA blood stained sidewalk in downtown Portland, Ore., during a day of skirmishes between far-right supporters of the Proud Boys, Antifa, and police on August 17, 2019.\n\nOnlookers watch as police arrest counter protesters on the day of a Proud Boys march in Portland, Ore., on August 17, 2019.\n\nProud Boys rally, Portland, Ore., August 17, 2019.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "There's a Standoff Between Far-Right and Far-Left Groups in Portland. Trump Just Picked Sides.\n\nMultiple groups, including Rose City Antifa and the Proud Boys, protest in Portland, Ore., on June 29, 2019. Dave Killen/The Oregonian via AP\n\nThe city of Portland, Oregon, has been bracing itself for a showdown on Saturday between the Proud Boys, an all-male far-right group, and self-described anti-fascists, known collectively as Antifa . The face-off is expected at the \"End Domestic Terrorism\" rally, a far-right gathering with a stated purpose of getting Antifa declared as a domestic terrorist organization.\n\nIn a tweet an hour before the rally was expected to begin, President Donald Trump weighed in, noting that he was giving \"major consideration\" to naming Antifa an \"organization of terror.\"\n\nMajor consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an \"ORGANIZATION OF TERROR.\" Portland is being watched very closely. Hopefully the Mayor will be able to properly do his job!\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2019\n\nIt was a curious decision, to say the least. The Proud Boys, a self-described \"Western chauvinist\" organization, has been designated as a general hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. It has organized a number of rallies in Portland over the last three years, and each of them have come with their attendant threats of-and at times, realized-violence: For example, several people were injured when the Proud Boys clashed with activists commemorating Pride Month in the city in June. Portland, a liberal bastion known for its progressivism, has been the chosen site for these clashes thanks in part to Rose City Antifa, the country's oldest anti-fascism group.\n\nThis Saturday's planned \"End Domestic Terrorism\" rally promised to be no different. Joe Biggs-a Florida-based Proud Boy, former staffer of the far-right conspiracy theorist site Infowars, and organizer of the rally, wrote \"DEATH TO ANTIFA!!!!!!\" in a since-deleted tweet. He also told his followers, \"Get a gun. Get ammo. Get your gun license. Get training,\" in another .\n\nAntifa is a diffuse group of leftists and anarchists who promote using violence to combat racist or fascist ideas. In confrontations with right-wing groups, its followers often wear masks, helmets, and other protective gear.\n\nThis isn't the first time the president has threatened this designation against Antifa. In July, Trump tweeted something similar , stating that Antifa was made up of \"Radical Left Wack Jobs.\" On August 7, just three days after nine people died in a massacre in Dayton, Ohio, Trump wrote that the shooter \"had a history\" of supporting Antifa, as well as 2020 Democratic hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. CNN reported that a Twitter account that appears to belong to the shooter retweeted tweets supporting Antifa protesters.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.\" @OANN I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you!\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2019\n\nBesides far-right activists, naming Antifa a domestic terrorism organization has been the stated goal of a number of Republican lawmakers. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), have introduced a congressional resolution to that effect.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Activate your online access\n\nAn antifascist flag seen during a gathering near City Hall in Portland, Ore., on February 8. (John Rudoff / Sipa USA via AP Images)\n\nThis week I started joining right-wing militias again. It's easy to find a variety of far-right \"patriot\" groups on Facebook, and most don't screen their membership. I joined as many pages as I could, and monitored them for one thing: Was anyone planning to show up armed to Black Lives Matter protests? I also tracked several chats on Discord, a chatting app with text and audio capabilities, focused around \"Boogaloo\" ideology-the loose, mostly white supremacist movement whose most ardent desire is to spark a race war. (\"Boogaloo\" is derived from the 1984 breakdance movie sequel Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo , and the movement is similarly focused around a sequel-a second civil war.) My goal there was the same: find out about specific plans and record the gear people said they had. One Discord group, for example, featured users boasting about their ARs, gunsights, SIG Sauers, and Glocks. And if any useful information cropped up, I could get in touch with people who would pass it on to activists on the ground. Related Article Bari Weiss's 'How to Fight Anti-Semitism' Is Just a Frustrating, Book-Length Op-Ed Talia Lavin I use a fake Facebook account, which I've used dozens of times for this and similar purposes. The name is false, and the profile is built out with an array of far-right groups, \"patriotic\" interests, and dog-whistle posts designed to maintain plausibility. I've made so many accounts on so many apps over the past few years that I have to take care not to lose track of my pseudonyms. Although it kicked into high gear during research for my book on the online far right, infiltrating hate groups isn't just a strange hobby or a journalistic endeavor; it's antifascism. While the image that comes to mind when most people think about \"antifa\" is a legion of black-clad militants ready to throw punches, this kind of research is antifascist work too. In fact, monitoring is integral to antifascist operations. Antifa is a series of organizing tactics and an ethos, not any specific organization; while any decentralized group encompasses a variety of ideas, antifa consists of opposing fascist groups by any means available, including, if necessary, violence. For many antifascists, however, infiltration, monitoring, and research are their primary or sole ways of engaging in antifascism. Fighting militant fascist groups is a large and complicated endeavor, and while aiming a fist at a Nazi's face can be part of that opposition, it is only one way. Just as other forms of social activism require a diversity of tactics-the protester who marches, the planner who puts together a city budget to defund police forces, the person who attends city council meetings-so too does antifascism. The research is unglamorous, exhausting, and involves psychologically torturous degrees of deception. You have to expose yourself to a disgusting mass of racist bile, which takes a grinding toll on the spirit. It also must be done carefully: Members of far-right groups can and do target activists and their families with death threats, harassment, and even violence. But the work serves the sole purpose of antifa: preventing the escalation of far-right organizing and defending our communities from their hatred. Antifascism online comes in a multitude of forms. Infiltrating far-right groups can help get the details of upcoming fascist marches. But in other instances, with false identities and nuanced understandings of the tensions between different racist groups, antifascists attempt to derail the far right by creating dissent from within. The journalist Aaron Gell reported in Medium's GEN magazine that an antifascist operation prevented a sequel to the deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va. Through a scheme involving multiple fake personas and the careful stoking of conflict between paramilitary neo-Nazi groups and the more optics-oriented \"alt-light,\" antifascists culled a planned 2018 march of 1,000 far-rightists down to 20. Throwing punches isn't the only way to protect communities: With a lot work and a little luck, you can throw fascists off their game.

Last month, an antifascist Twitter account posted documentation that appeared to show that a middle-school social studies teacher in South Carolina, Timothy Manning, was a key organizer of the 2017 Unite the Right rally. In a 20-tweet thread, the account, Identify Dixie-a spin on Identity Dixie, a neoconfederate group that describes themselves as the \"true sons of the South\"-meticulously tied Manning to Discord and Twitter posts by \"SCNazi\" and to enthusiastic planning of the 2017 Charlottesville rally. Online, Manning allegedly referred to \"building showers\" (i.e., gas chambers) for Jews, used images of SS iconography, and deplored \"kike power.\" Identify Dixie seems to show Manning arranging transportation and accommodation for the marchers who shouted, \"Jews will not replace us!\" in Charlottesville. All the while, he taught children and coached the girls' volleyball team at Pleasant Hill Middle School in Lexington, S.C. One day after the anonymous account posted the damning documentation, the school placed Manning on administrative leave , though Manning denied having Nazi ties. A further investigation by The State revealed other white supremacist social-media activity by Manning and his father. Last week, Manning quit rather than wait for a reinstatement . I spoke to the person behind the Identify Dixie Twitter account, who wishes to remain anonymous, about the role of research in antifascism. \"I feel that knowledge is power. The distance of being online has always allowed people to feel more comfortable saying and doing things they wouldn't ever think about doing face to face,\" the person told me by Twitter DM. \"I use that same anonymity to show the extremist online abusers to their community. I feel community shame kept many from being bad before and I bring that aspect back to their lives.\" Current Issue View our current issue The online spaces where fascists congregate are spaces where hatred is open and gleeful. In the chats I've monitored, I've seen countless racial slurs, grisly videos of black people dying, the exchange of racist books and texts, and incitement to violence against Jews. But when these streams of invective are tied to a face and a name and revealed to neighbors and employers, a social cost is reimposed on such racist behavior. The person behind the Identify Dixie Twitter account told me that since establishing the account in 2019, they have unmasked three different teachers, a Florida highway patrolman, and an active-duty military officer as being part of neo-Nazi and neoconfederate groups. Their primary sources are an archived edition of a Facebook vetting group that required would-be neoconfederates to confirm their real name and face before joining Identity Dixie; and the massive, searchable cache of far-right Discord chats leaked to the leftist media outlet Unicorn Riot. The rest is careful cross-referencing on social media and search engines from Google to Bing and Yandex. Over the course of two years, the activist has outed 30 members of Identity Dixie to their communities. \"I'm a Southerner,\" they told me. \"It's why I target them mostly, and why their hate is a danger to me and those I love.\" The core of antifa is just that: protecting those you love from hatred. For those not temperamentally inclined or physically able to hit the streets (or to hit Nazis), there are ways to participate that are no less valuable or radical. Research and monitoring take fortitude, savvy, deception, and a willingness to engage in obsessive digital scouring, but are necessary work. This is not terrorism, as the Trump administration claims, but the prevention of terror. And if you're willing, you too can be an antifascist from your couch.\n\nTalia Lavin\n\nI use a fake Facebook account, which I've used dozens of times for this and similar purposes.

Over the course of two years, the activist has outed 30 members of Identity Dixie to their communities. \"I'm a Southerner,\" they told me. \"It's why I target them mostly, and why their hate is a danger to me and those I love.\" The core of antifa is just that: protecting those you love from hatred. For those not temperamentally inclined or physically able to hit the streets (or to hit Nazis), there are ways to participate that are no less valuable or radical. Research and monitoring take fortitude, savvy, deception, and a willingness to engage in obsessive digital scouring, but are necessary work. This is not terrorism, as the Trump administration claims, but the prevention of terror. And if you're willing, you too can be an antifascist from your couch.\n\nWhile the image that comes to mind when most people think about \"antifa\" is a legion of black-clad militants ready to throw punches, this kind of research is antifascist work too. In fact, monitoring is integral to antifascist operations. Antifa is a series of organizing tactics and an ethos, not any specific organization; while any decentralized group encompasses a variety of ideas, antifa consists of opposing fascist groups by any means available, including, if necessary, violence. For many antifascists, however, infiltration, monitoring, and research are their primary or sole ways of engaging in antifascism. Fighting militant fascist groups is a large and complicated endeavor, and while aiming a fist at a Nazi's face can be part of that opposition, it is only one way. Just as other forms of social activism require a diversity of tactics-the protester who marches, the planner who puts together a city budget to defund police forces, the person who attends city council meetings-so too does antifascism. The research is unglamorous, exhausting, and involves psychologically torturous degrees of deception. You have to expose yourself to a disgusting mass of racist bile, which takes a grinding toll on the spirit. It also must be done carefully: Members of far-right groups can and do target activists and their families with death threats, harassment, and even violence. But the work serves the sole purpose of antifa: preventing the escalation of far-right organizing and defending our communities from their hatred. Antifascism online comes in a multitude of forms. Infiltrating far-right groups can help get the details of upcoming fascist marches. But in other instances, with false identities and nuanced understandings of the tensions between different racist groups, antifascists attempt to derail the far right by creating dissent from within. The journalist Aaron Gell reported in Medium's GEN magazine that an antifascist operation prevented a sequel to the deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va. Through a scheme involving multiple fake personas and the careful stoking of conflict between paramilitary neo-Nazi groups and the more optics-oriented \"alt-light,\" antifascists culled a planned 2018 march of 1,000 far-rightists down to 20. Throwing punches isn't the only way to protect communities: With a lot work and a little luck, you can throw fascists off their game.

Last month, an antifascist Twitter account posted documentation that appeared to show that a middle-school social studies teacher in South Carolina, Timothy Manning, was a key organizer of the 2017 Unite the Right rally. In a 20-tweet thread, the account, Identify Dixie-a spin on Identity Dixie, a neoconfederate group that describes themselves as the \"true sons of the South\"-meticulously tied Manning to Discord and Twitter posts by \"SCNazi\" and to enthusiastic planning of the 2017 Charlottesville rally. Online, Manning allegedly referred to \"building showers\" (i.e., gas chambers) for Jews, used images of SS iconography, and deplored \"kike power.\" Identify Dixie seems to show Manning arranging transportation and accommodation for the marchers who shouted, \"Jews will not replace us!\" in Charlottesville. All the while, he taught children and coached the girls' volleyball team at Pleasant Hill Middle School in Lexington, S.C. One day after the anonymous account posted the damning documentation, the school placed Manning on administrative leave , though Manning denied having Nazi ties.

The intelligence report, titled \"The Syrian Conflict and Its Nexus to the U.S.-based Antifascist Movement,\" mentions several Americans, including a left-wing podcast host who traveled to Syria to fight ISIS. The report includes these individuals' personal information, including their Social Security numbers, home addresses, and social media accounts, much of the data generated by the DHS's Tactical Terrorism Response Teams. As the intelligence report states, \"ANTIFA is being analyzed under the 2019 DHS Strategic Framework for Countering Terrorism (CT) and Targeted Violence.\" Dated July 14, the document, marked for official use only and law enforcement sensitive , draws on a blend of publicly available information and state and federal law enforcement intelligence. It was provided to The Nation by a source who previously worked on DHS intelligence. \"They targeted Americans like they're Al Qaeda,\" a former senior DHS intelligence officer with knowledge of the operations told The Nation . The officer, who served for years in the DHS's Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), compared the operations to the illegal surveillance of activists during the civil rights era. \"They essentially were violating people's rights like this was the '60s...the type of shit the Church and Pike committee[s] had to address.\" Whither Antifa The FBI Finds 'No Intel Indicating Antifa Involvement' in Sunday's Violence Ken Klippenstein While the law generally prohibits intelligence agencies from spying on US residents, many of those protections do not apply if the individual is believed to be acting as an agent of a foreign power. \"Designating someone as foreign-sponsored can make a huge legal and practical difference in the government's ability to pursue them,\" explained Steven Aftergood, who heads the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. \"It's a crucial distinction.

Cuccinelli, at I&A's request, curtailed the requirement that the DHS's Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties approve I&A's intelligence products before distribution to law enforcement partners. The intelligence report's executive summary states: In June 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) National Targeting Center (NTC) Counter Network Division (CND) compiled CBP encounter data on individuals who returned from Syria and fought with the Yekîneyên Parastina Gel (YPG, translation: PEOPLE'S PROTECTION UNITS), and had some with reported ties to a U.S.-based ANTIFA (Anti-fascist) movement. CBP concerns about and interest in these individuals stem from the types of skills and motivations that may have developed during their time overseas in foreign conflicts. These skills were also appreciated by the US military, which cooperated with the YPG in fighting ISIS for years. Last year Trump enraged many in the US military when he green-lit a Turkish offensive against the Kurdish militia. Jim Mattis reportedly resigned as defense secretary in part because of what he considered a betrayal of our Kurdish allies. The intelligence report describes over half a dozen people who traveled to Syria in order to fight alongside Kurdish factions-usually the YPG but also other Kurdish groups like the PKK and the Peshmerga. Some of the individuals described have denied membership in antifa but variously identified with far-left causes. The DHS appears to define antifa broadly to encompass various left-wing tendencies: \"Antifa is driven by a mixed range of far-left political ideologies, including anti-capitalism, communism, socialism, and anarchism.\" In two cases, evidence of antifa affiliation was limited to photos taken in front of an antifa flag. As the intelligence report notes, \"ANTIFA claims no official leadership,\" raising questions about whether antifa even exists in any sort of operational capacity. The first individual mentioned in the intelligence report, Brace Belden, cohosts the popular left-wing podcast TrueAnon and fought with the YPG in 2016. The report appears to be partly drawn from a 2017 article on Belden in Rolling Stone , and describes him as \"a minor criminal and drug addict who started reading Marx and Lenin in drug rehabilitation treatment and became involved in a number of political causes before deciding to fight alongside the YPG.\" The report says of an encounter between Belden and border authorities: U.S. citizen (USC) Brace BELDEN was encountered on 08 April 2017, arriving in San Francisco, California from Frankfurt, Germany. BELDEN was returning from a six month tour of volunteering to fight with the YPG under the umbrella of the Syrian Democrat Forces (SDF) fighting ISIS in Syria as part of the ongoing Raqqa offensive starting in November 2016 to retake Raqqa from ISIS. BELDEN stated he recently learned that an open source article had been written about him and his \"Anarchist\" fighters. Belden scoffed at the association. \"I am not now, nor have I ever been a member of any antifa organization,\" he told The Nation . \"The US government has been spying on and smearing communists for 100 years, but they usually have the decency not to call a Red an anarchist.\" \"There appears to be a clear connection...between ANTIFA ideology and Kurdish democratic federalism teachings and ideology,\" the intelligence report states. At least one of the activists listed is described as ethnically Kurdish. On May 31, Trump vowed to designate antifa a terrorist organization. While antifa groups have engaged in acts of property destruction, antifa has not been linked to a single killing in the United States, according to data compiled in the past 25 years by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. By contrast, the same data found that far-right extremist groups killed 329 people. The intelligence report appears to conclude that the individuals described were not acting on behalf of a foreign group-save for one unnamed person. \"Aside from a single instance derived from open-source reporting, there does not appear to be evidence of a centralized effort to give marching orders to returning ANTIFA-affiliated USPER [US person] foreign fighters once they return to the United States.\" &lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;﻿ N\n\nThe intelligence report, titled \"The Syrian Conflict and Its Nexus to the U.S.-based Antifascist Movement,\" mentions several Americans, including a left-wing podcast host who traveled to Syria to fight ISIS. The report includes these individuals' personal information, including their Social Security numbers, home addresses, and social media accounts, much of the data generated by the DHS's Tactical Terrorism Response Teams. As the intelligence report states, \"ANTIFA is being analyzed under the 2019 DHS Strategic Framework for Countering Terrorism (CT) and Targeted Violence.\" Dated July 14, the document, marked for official use only and law enforcement sensitive , draws on a blend of publicly available information and state and federal law enforcement intelligence. It was provided to The Nation by a source who previously worked on DHS intelligence. \"They targeted Americans like they're Al Qaeda,\" a former senior DHS intelligence officer with knowledge of the operations told The Nation . The officer, who served for years in the DHS's Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), compared the operations to the illegal surveillance of activists during the civil rights era. \"They essentially were violating people's rights like this was the '60s...the type of shit the Church and Pike committee[s] had to address.\" Whither Antifa The FBI Finds 'No Intel Indicating Antifa Involvement' in Sunday's Violence Ken Klippenstein While the law generally prohibits intelligence agencies from spying on US residents, many of those protections do not apply if the individual is believed to be acting as an agent of a foreign power. \"Designating someone as foreign-sponsored can make a huge legal and practical difference in the government's ability to pursue them,\" explained Steven Aftergood, who heads the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. \"It's a crucial distinction.

The intelligence report appears to conclude that the individuals described were not acting on behalf of a foreign group-save for one unnamed person. \"Aside from a single instance derived from open-source reporting, there does not appear to be evidence of a centralized effort to give marching orders to returning ANTIFA-affiliated USPER [US person] foreign fighters once they return to the United States.\" &lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&gt;﻿ N\n\n\"Designating someone as foreign-sponsored can make a huge legal and practical difference in the government's ability to pursue them,\" explained Steven Aftergood, who heads the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. \"It's a crucial distinction. Once someone (or some group) is identified as an agent of a foreign power, they are subject to warrantless search and surveillance in a way that would be illegal and unconstitutional for any other US person. The whole apparatus of US intelligence can be brought to bear on someone who is considered an agent of a foreign power.\" Current Issue View our current issue Last week the DHS reassigned its intelligence chief after The Washington Post revealed that the agency had been compiling intelligence reports on American journalists and activists in Portland, Ore. In response to President Trump's executive order to protect monuments and other federal property, the DHS created the Protecting American Communities Task Force, which sent DHS assets to Portland and other cities. The agency has found itself in transition under the Trump administration.\"They are always pressuring I&A for political reasons.

Cuccinelli, at I&A's request, curtailed the requirement that the DHS's Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties approve I&A's intelligence products before distribution to law enforcement partners. The intelligence report's executive summary states: In June 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) National Targeting Center (NTC) Counter Network Division (CND) compiled CBP encounter data on individuals who returned from Syria and fought with the Yekîneyên Parastina Gel (YPG, translation: PEOPLE'S PROTECTION UNITS), and had some with reported ties to a U.S.-based ANTIFA (Anti-fascist) movement. CBP concerns about and interest in these individuals stem from the types of skills and motivations that may have developed during their time overseas in foreign conflicts. These skills were also appreciated by the US military, which cooperated with the YPG in fighting ISIS for years. Last year Trump enraged many in the US military when he green-lit a Turkish offensive against the Kurdish militia. Jim Mattis reportedly resigned as defense secretary in part because of what he considered a betrayal of our Kurdish allies. The intelligence report describes over half a dozen people who traveled to Syria in order to fight alongside Kurdish factions-usually the YPG but also other Kurdish groups like the PKK and the Peshmerga. Some of the individuals described have denied membership in antifa but variously identified with far-left causes. The DHS appears to define antifa broadly to encompass various left-wing tendencies: \"Antifa is driven by a mixed range of far-left political ideologies, including anti-capitalism, communism, socialism, and anarchism.\" In two cases, evidence of antifa affiliation was limited to photos taken in front of an antifa flag. As the intelligence report notes, \"ANTIFA claims no official leadership,\" raising questions about whether antifa even exists in any sort of operational capacity. The first individual mentioned in the intelligence report, Brace Belden, cohosts the popular left-wing podcast TrueAnon and fought with the YPG in 2016. The report appears to be partly drawn from a 2017 article on Belden in Rolling Stone , and describes him as \"a minor criminal and drug addict who started reading Marx and Lenin in drug rehabilitation treatment and became involved in a number of political causes before deciding to fight alongside the YPG.\" The report says of an encounter between Belden and border authorities: U.S. citizen (USC) Brace BELDEN was encountered on 08 April 2017, arriving in San Francisco, California from Frankfurt, Germany. BELDEN was returning from a six month tour of volunteering to fight with the YPG under the umbrella of the Syrian Democrat Forces (SDF) fighting ISIS in Syria as part of the ongoing Raqqa offensive starting in November 2016 to retake Raqqa from ISIS. BELDEN stated he recently learned that an open source article had been written about him and his \"Anarchist\" fighters. Belden scoffed at the association. \"I am not now, nor have I ever been a member of any antifa organization,\" he told The Nation . \"The US government has been spying on and smearing communists for 100 years, but they usually have the decency not to call a Red an anarchist.\" \"There appears to be a clear connection...between ANTIFA ideology and Kurdish democratic federalism teachings and ideology,\" the intelligence report states. At least one of the activists listed is described as ethnically Kurdish. On May 31, Trump vowed to designate antifa a terrorist organization.

But after local anti-fascist groups mobilized to counterprotest, Howard contacted the Portland Police Bureau to cancel his event. When the KKK didn't show up, we held a victory party instead. Unfortunately, while we anti-fascists in Portland danced to a brass band dressed in banana costumes (the beloved Banana Bloc), more than a hundred members of the white nationalist group Patriot Front marched through the National Mall in Washington, DC, wearing white masks and chanting \"Reclaim America!\" and \"Life, liberty, victory!\" In the aftermath, #AntifaTerrorists trended on Twitter. The hashtag tends to emerge when the right has an optics problem and needs to spin the narrative. An optics problem like, for example, white nationalists marching through the nation's capital. For all of the right-wing hand-wringing over people dressed in black wielding silly string and oranges, nearly all the domestic terrorists in the United States emerge from the extreme right. A 2019 report from the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism showed that all 50 of the extremist killings in the United States in 2018 had links to right-wing extremists. Since 2001, the extreme right has killed 109 people . Over that same time period, anti-fascists are responsible for zero deaths. The goals of anti-fascism are simple: oppose hate and prevent its spread. The goal of white nationalism, as established in core texts such as Siege: The Collected Writings of James Mason and the white nationalist utopian novel The Turner Diaries , is to destabilize American society and initiate a civil war. Amid the chaos of a fragmenting country, the white nationalists plan to seize control and establish a white homeland. (That \"nationalist\" doesn't refer to the United States. It refers to the white nation they'll form from America's ashes.) It's far-fetched, but the improbability doesn't keep us safe from domestic terrorists working toward it. Related Article Neo-Nazi Richard Spencer Got Punched-You Can Thank the Black Bloc Natasha Lennard Domestic terrorists are like mushrooms. Mushrooms are the surface expression of a complex network that lives beneath the soil and can span thousands of acres. Above the surface: A hate-filled person-almost always a white man-commits an act of terror, like the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting or the El Paso massacre . The popular narrative may describe him as a \"lone wolf,\" lashing out at society because of a personal grievance. We want to believe that; it renders each horrific attack an isolated event. But white nationalists are deliberately encouraging vulnerable individuals to carry out terrorist acts. In addition to message boards like IronMarch, 4chan, and StormFront, white nationalists rely on rallies-like the one planned by Howard in Portland and the one carried out in Washington, DC-for recruitment and radicalization . Rallies give them an opportunity to identify and connect with individuals who they deem open to indoctrination, as well as generating a trove of often sensationalized media coverage that they can mine for online propaganda.

Emboldened by the Trump administration, they came to challenge Portland's reputation for progressive politics and values. Their intention was not to protest but to instigate conflict. They're frequently accompanied by members of the Proud Boys and known white supremacist groups, including the American Guard, the Three Percenters, and the Oath Keepers. They come dressed for battle, with helmets and body armor, sticks and bear spray, knives and guns. Oregon is an open-carry state, and the alt-right takes full advantage. Current Issue View our current issue They've been confronted by anti-fascist protesters marching in black bloc as well as those rallying in solidarity. But they've also been helped by the Portland Police Bureau-an organization that includes among its ranks an officer who built a shrine to Nazi soldiers in a public park. In a series of hundreds of friendly text messages between Portland Police Lieutenant Jeff Niiya and Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson from 2017 to 2018, the lieutenant shared information about anti-fascist activist movements, including the locations of unrelated leftist events. On the morning of a Patriot Prayer rally on August 4, 2018, police found members of Patriot Prayer with a cache of loaded weapons on a rooftop overlooking the location where the rally and anti-fascist counterprotest would take place. The weapons were taken and the Patriot Prayer members \"redirected.\" There were no arrests, and police returned the weapons after the event. The Portland Police Bureau informed neither the public nor the mayor's office of this potential sniper threat until months later. When the police form a line to separate one side from the other at these events, they always stand with their backs to the alt-right and their weapons facing the anti-fascist counterprotesters. Dispersal orders and crowd-control weapons like tear gas and stun grenades (\"flashbangs\") go only one way, often deployed against the anti-fascists to allow Patriot Prayer to leave the area. Nonviolent protesters have been struck and seriously injured by flashbangs fired directly into the crowd by the police. So why do we keep showing up to protest Patriot Prayer and their white supremacist friends? Why did we come together last Saturday to protest the KKK? Critics often tell us, \"Stop giving them the attention they're looking for!\" We keep showing up, because ignoring hate doesn't make it go away; it only allows it to spread further. If we permit white supremacists to march through our city, they'll grow bolder. If we don't show up each time and prove that we outnumber them, their numbers will swell. Imagine the recruiting power of an artfully edited video of white supremacists marching unchallenged through the streets of a major US city like Washington. On August 17, 2019, Patriot Prayer, the Proud Boys, and other extremists came back to Portland. Anti-fascist protesters recognized that videos of clashes have been used as right-wing propaganda, and so the anti-fascist group PopMob organized the Spectacle, an event designed to shut that down. PopMob encouraged Portlanders to wear whimsical costumes to an anti-fascist outdoor dance party adjacent to the far-right rally. That resulted in the confrontation of about 300 far-right demonstrators with roughly 1,500 unicorns, cats, witches, and bananas (the Banana Bloc, of course), joined by a contingent of protesters in a black bloc forming a front line to protect us. It was a very Portland protest, and it was also very effective. The far right called it quits after 30 minutes, retreated to their rental buses, and went home. This past Saturday, the KKK wanted to test Portland, and once again we organized and claimed victory. Portland leftist organizations including PopMob, Rose City Antifa, Portland DSA, Jobs with Justice, Banana Bloc, the Direct Action Alliance, and others have formed a community to face down right-wing extremists. When we counterprotest white supremacists in Portland, we're working to cut off white nationalists' recruitment and radicalization tools as early as possible. If you are opposed to fascism, you are an anti-fascist, and our fight is your fight. As a favorite chant at these anti-fascist rallies goes, \"We are many! They are few!\" We need to prove that nationwide.\n\nUnfortunately, while we anti-fascists in Portland danced to a brass band dressed in banana costumes (the beloved Banana Bloc), more than a hundred members of the white nationalist group Patriot Front marched through the National Mall in Washington, DC, wearing white masks and chanting \"Reclaim America!\" and \"Life, liberty, victory!\" In the aftermath, #AntifaTerrorists trended on Twitter.

Emboldened by the Trump administration, they came to challenge Portland's reputation for progressive politics and values. Their intention was not to protest but to instigate conflict. They're frequently accompanied by members of the Proud Boys and known white supremacist groups, including the American Guard, the Three Percenters, and the Oath Keepers. They come dressed for battle, with helmets and body armor, sticks and bear spray, knives and guns. Oregon is an open-carry state, and the alt-right takes full advantage. Current Issue View our current issue They've been confronted by anti-fascist protesters marching in black bloc as well as those rallying in solidarity. But they've also been helped by the Portland Police Bureau-an organization that includes among its ranks an officer who built a shrine to Nazi soldiers in a public park. In a series of hundreds of friendly text messages between Portland Police Lieutenant Jeff Niiya and Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson from 2017 to 2018, the lieutenant shared information about anti-fascist activist movements, including the locations of unrelated leftist events. On the morning of a Patriot Prayer rally on August 4, 2018, police found members of Patriot Prayer with a cache of loaded weapons on a rooftop overlooking the location where the rally and anti-fascist counterprotest would take place. The weapons were taken and the Patriot Prayer members \"redirected.\" There were no arrests, and police returned the weapons after the event. The Portland Police Bureau informed neither the public nor the mayor's office of this potential sniper threat until months later. When the police form a line to separate one side from the other at these events, they always stand with their backs to the alt-right and their weapons facing the anti-fascist counterprotesters. Dispersal orders and crowd-control weapons like tear gas and stun grenades (\"flashbangs\") go only one way, often deployed against the anti-fascists to allow Patriot Prayer to leave the area. Nonviolent protesters have been struck and seriously injured by flashbangs fired directly into the crowd by the police. So why do we keep showing up to protest Patriot Prayer and their white supremacist friends? Why did we come together last Saturday to protest the KKK? Critics often tell us, \"Stop giving them the attention they're looking for!\" We keep showing up, because ignoring hate doesn't make it go away; it only allows it to spread further. If we permit white supremacists to march through our city, they'll grow bolder. If we don't show up each time and prove that we outnumber them, their numbers will swell. Imagine the recruiting power of an artfully edited video of white supremacists marching unchallenged through the streets of a major US city like Washington. On August 17, 2019, Patriot Prayer, the Proud Boys, and other extremists came back to Portland. Anti-fascist protesters recognized that videos of clashes have been used as right-wing propaganda, and so the anti-fascist group PopMob organized the Spectacle, an event designed to shut that down. PopMob encouraged Portlanders to wear whimsical costumes to an anti-fascist outdoor dance party adjacent to the far-right rally. That resulted in the confrontation of about 300 far-right demonstrators with roughly 1,500 unicorns, cats, witches, and bananas (the Banana Bloc, of course), joined by a contingent of protesters in a black bloc forming a front line to protect us. It was a very Portland protest, and it was also very effective. The far right called it quits after 30 minutes, retreated to their rental buses, and went home. This past Saturday, the KKK wanted to test Portland, and once again we organized and claimed victory. Portland leftist organizations including PopMob, Rose City Antifa, Portland DSA, Jobs with Justice, Banana Bloc, the Direct Action Alliance, and others have formed a community to face down right-wing extremists. When we counterprotest white supremacists in Portland, we're working to cut off white nationalists' recruitment and radicalization tools as early as possible. If you are opposed to fascism, you are an anti-fascist, and our fight is your fight. As a favorite chant at these anti-fascist rallies goes, \"We are many! They are few!\" We need to prove that nationwide.\n\nThe goals of anti-fascism are simple: oppose hate and prevent its spread. The goal of white nationalism, as established in core texts such as Siege: The Collected Writings of James Mason and the white nationalist utopian novel The Turner Diaries , is to destabilize American society and initiate a civil war. Amid the chaos of a fragmenting country, the white nationalists plan to seize control and establish a white homeland. (That \"nationalist\" doesn't refer to the United States. It refers to the white nation they'll form from America's ashes.) It's far-fetched, but the improbability doesn't keep us safe from domestic terrorists working toward it.

Mushrooms are the surface expression of a complex network that lives beneath the soil and can span thousands of acres. Above the surface: A hate-filled person-almost always a white man-commits an act of terror, like the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting or the El Paso massacre . The popular narrative may describe him as a \"lone wolf,\" lashing out at society because of a personal grievance. We want to believe that; it renders each horrific attack an isolated event. But white nationalists are deliberately encouraging vulnerable individuals to carry out terrorist acts. In addition to message boards like IronMarch, 4chan, and StormFront, white nationalists rely on rallies-like the one planned by Howard in Portland and the one carried out in Washington, DC-for recruitment and radicalization . Rallies give them an opportunity to identify and connect with individuals who they deem open to indoctrination, as well as generating a trove of often sensationalized media coverage that they can mine for online propaganda.

PopMob encouraged Portlanders to wear whimsical costumes to an anti-fascist outdoor dance party adjacent to the far-right rally.

Will Europe's courts still greenlight Budapest's punitive search for leftists?\n\nOn February 11, 2023, neo-Nazis from across Europe descended on Budapest for the \"Day of Honor\" rally. The event commemorates an unusual set of martyrs: the German army and collaborationist Magyar fascists, defeated by the advancing Red Army during the siege of Budapest in the closing months of the Second World War. Thanks to the safe harbor provided by the authoritarian government of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, it has become an annual gathering. Hosted this past February 8, the 2025 edition again attracted some 4,000 sympathizers.\n\nThe 2023 Day of Honor has had a particularly long afterlife, however. That year's rally saw violent clashes between neo-Nazis and antifa activists-a not-uncommon occurrence anywhere the extreme right takes to the streets. Left-wingers were also drawn to Budapest, coming to voice their opposition to yet another celebration of neo-Nazism in the heart of the Hungarian capital.\n\nUnder Orbán's premiership, Budapest has become an epicenter of the European Union's shift to the far right. After a first stint in office in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a leading figure of Hungary's post-Communist political class, Orbán returned to power in 2010. He has since moved to tighten his grip over Hungarian society, concentrating media power among friends and attacking civil society and checks from the country's judiciary.\n\nThe force of Orbán's state apparatus has been on full display in its attempt to punish the 2023 counterdemonstrators. Hungarian authorities are now waging a concerted campaign to round up and seek punitive sentences against antifa activists, whom they accuse of violently assaulting Day of Honor attendees and inflicting what Budapest calls \"life-threatening injuries\" on the presumed neo-Nazis.\n\nIn the last two years, that campaign has even taken on the scale of a Europe-wide manhunt, as Budapest tries to use the EU's internal extradition protocols to round up left-wingers in other countries of the bloc. In total, Orbán's government has sought the arrest or extradition of over a dozen activists.\n\nOne such man is Rexhino Abajaz, more commonly known as Gino. Of Albanian nationality, the 32-year-old Gino has spent much of his life living in the European Union, predominantly in Italy and Finland.\n\nLast November, Gino was arrested in the Paris suburb of Montreuil, by officers of the French police's crack anti-terrorism unit. Gino's arrest followed the French government's reception from Budapest of a European Arrest Warrant, demanding that Gino be handed over to Hungarian authorities to stand trial for assault charges.\n\nDeemed a flight risk, he was held for four months at the Fresnes prison south of Paris, although on March 26 Gino's legal counsel won his release for the remaining duration of the trial. Gino had previously fled Finland for France when judges in the Scandinavian country moved towards his transfer to Hungary.\n\nIf a French court now authorizes Gino's extradition, he will face a steep legal battle back in Hungary, where Orbán's 15 years in power have twisted the country's justice system to the whims of his government, whittling away at the basic norms and rights of criminal procedure. The sentence that Gino might face in the event of a guilty verdict could have him incurring as many 16 years in prison. Given the show trial-like nature of the Day of Honor cases that have already made it to Hungarian court, Gino's supporters fear that that kind of sentencing may be a fait accompli if he's handed over.\n\n\"The charges being leveled against antifa activists and the possible sentences against them are totally disproportionate,\" Quentin, a representative of Gino's solidarity committee, told reporters at a press conference in February. \"Handing an antifascist activist over to Hungarian authorities would symbolize France's willful collaboration with a regime that does not respect basic rights.\" Gino's allies are demanding his release and protection in France.\n\nGino is only one target in Budapest's broader search of activists with alleged connections to the 2023 counterprotests. Hungary has sought the arrest of at least 13 individuals in total, including from leading European member states such as France, Italy, and Germany.\n\nIlaria Salis was arguably the first person to be caught up in the Hungarian government's roundup. An Italian teacher and activist, she was arrested in the Hungarian capital after the 2023 counterprotest, hauled from a taxi by police in the center of Budapest. An initial search of the belongings on Salis's person found nothing of potentially illegal or violent use. But in a second search, investigating officers produced a nightstick-like rod, which Salis claims had been placed there by authorities interested in building a case against her-and feeding the narrative of violent leftists bent on bringing chaos to the streets of Budapest.\n\n\"If Gino is extradited to Hungary, he will be put in the most inhumane detention conditions and would not receive a fair trial,\" Salis, who attended a March 12 hearing in Paris over Gino's case, told The Nation . \"I know this because of what I went through: in Hungary, antifascists can expect nothing even close to fair treatment.\"\n\nSalis's February 2023 arrest was the beginning of over 14 months of abuse in Hungarian prison and in the hands of the country's ersatz justice system. She was repeatedly interrogated without an attorney or translator. Spending upwards of a month in solitary confinement, she was barred from any contact with friends and family back home for months on end and forced to sleep in a bug-ridden cell. Her legal team was repeatedly denied access to the case file, while government officials spoke publicly of her as already guilty. During court hearings, neo-Nazi activists in paramilitary garb intimidated people in the audience suspected of attending out of solidarity with the defendant.\n\nSalis's draconian treatment made her into a cause célèbre on the Italian left, however. The shock back in Italy eventually led to her selection-from jail-as a candidate for the June 2024 elections to the European Parliament under the country's Green and Left alliance. After repeated prior requests, she was finally granted house arrest in May 2024 for the remainder of her trial, which was suspended because of her electoral victory and newfound immunity as a member of the EU parliament.\n\nOrbán's allies in the EU are currently brokering to unwind that reprieve, however, seeking a repeal of Salis's immunity in Strasbourg. A closed-door vote on her status is expected in the coming weeks.\n\nEuropean governments have largely balked on intervening to prevent Orbán's politically motivated roundup of leftist activists. As some speculate, that may in part be because of the fear of exacerbating the divisions that might arise from another spat with Budapest. Orbán has already been a thorn in the side for many of the EU's key players and power brokers, whether for his opposition to European consensus on opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine or his open embrace of Donald Trump.\n\nIn any case, refusal to block these pursuits comes despite the by-now countless warnings and condemnations leveled against Hungary over Orbán's attacks on the rule of law.\n\nBut the cruel irony now is that Orbán's government is conducting its punitive roundup in apparent accordance with EU norms and procedure.\n\nWhen the European Arrest Warrant was first introduced in the early 2000s, it was part of the march toward rationalization and simplification at the core of the European project. Here was a tool to harmonize the work of the justice systems in EU member states, streamlining the transferring across the bloc's internal borders of individuals wanted for a crime. By facilitating what became known as \"judicial surrender,\" the EAW replaced what jurists now call \"classical extradition,\" which required the greenlighting from political authorities in foreign affairs and justice ministries.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nChris Lehmann\n\nThe goal was to create a \"dialogue between judges,\" says Hélène Christodoulou, a legal scholar and expert on the EAW at the University of Toulouse. Judicial authorities in one state submit an EAW to be acted on by their counterparts in a second country, thereby removing extradition from the purview of political officials. \"Mutual confidence is the foundation of the system. The idea is that in the European Union we all have the same fundamental rights.\"\n\nThat vision had a lot going for it in the early years of the European Union, when common sense assumed that history pointed toward the extension of liberal legal institutions and practices. But with the rise of the far right across the continent-a trend of which Hungary is perhaps the leading example-those assumptions are coming under strain.\n\nAccording to Gino's defense attorneys, there is ample legal ground for a French judge to block his handover to Hungary. For example, a 2016 ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) stipulates that the execution of an EAW is conditioned on the assurance that the extradited individual would benefit from the full protection of their fundamental rights. Moreover, a bevy of European statutes and conventions set official standards for detention and incarceration-many of which have been violated in Hungarian jails, including by the individuals already caught up in Budapest's Day of Honor roundup. French law likewise holds that an individual cannot be extradited for political reasons, something that could be said to not apply here given that the execution of an EAW is technically not extradition.\n\n\"The CJEU makes it very clear that you cannot send someone to a country where they will face a risk of degrading and inhumane treatment, or where there's reliably objective evidence that they're at risk of undergoing an unfair trail,\" Youri Krassoulia, one of Gino's attorneys, told The Nation .\n\nElsewhere in Europe, the battles over the extraditions have yielded mixed results. The EAW for the arrest of Gabriele Marchesi, an Italian man in his early 20s, was blocked by a court in Milan in 2024. But as with all Orbán's targets, observers point out that nothing specifically prevents Budapest from issuing another warrant should Marchese travel from Italy to another EU country.\n\nAnother EAW ended with a victory for Hungary, although critics are calling foul. Maja T. , a gender-nonbinary activist from Germany, was also sought by Hungarian authorities for their participation in the Day of Honor counterdemonstration. Following a German court's greenlight for Maja's extradition, they were handed over to Hungarian officials last summer. Maja's extradition was contravened by the Germany's Federal Constitutional Court, however, which sanctioned the lower court that authorized their surrender to Hungary, ruling that the risks to Maja's rights were not taken into sufficient consideration.\n\nBy then it was too late: On February 21, Maja appeared in chains before a court in Budapest. \"I stand accused by a European state because I am an antifascist,\" they said from the bar .\n\nIn mid-January, the French appellate court charged with validating Gino's handover to Hungarian authorities acceded to the demands from the defendant's attorneys for supplementary information concerning the conditions of his potential detention and trial. Those alleged guarantees were the object of briefs submitted by Hungary and were debated on March 12.\n\nYet Gino's attorneys are far from satisfied by Budapest's assurances, which they decry as \"lacunary\" and \"incomplete\" in the court filing submitted prior to the March 12 hearing, and which The Nation was able to consult. \"Given the proof of governmental sway over the judiciary in Hungary, there is a credible risk that judges will be used by the executive to intimidate opponents by bringing legal proceedings against them, not on the basis of the evidence of their involvement in any offence, but solely on the grounds of their real or supposed political opinions,\" Gino's attorneys write.\n\nThat the French judges sought supplementary information is a signal that there is doubt as to the legal grounding of Hungary's demands. Gino's attorneys likewise see hope in the French judge's March 12 order to reconsider the terms of their client's temporary detention. A March 26 hearing will debate Gino's possible release to house arrest for the rest of the trial, with a verdict on his case expected this April.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Members of left-wing groups in black clothes showed up to confront them. Hundreds of non-masked counterprotesters came, too, along with 700 police officers. The police far outnumbered both the Nazis and masked groups. They spent most of the day protecting the white supremacists-ushering them around the city, and even over a bridge closed to pedestrian and car traffic so they could escape the wrath of Portland residents. Portland police tweeted that they were there to \"protect everyone's safety while facilitating everyone's 1st Amendment right to gather and speak. It is the foundation of our democracy and critical to Portland's identity.\" Events like this one happen like clockwork these days: A small number of Nazis protest somewhere, usually under the guise of freely expressing their opinions, and the police protect them under a mandate of upholding the First Amendment. By bolstering the narrative that speech should be protected at all costs, the police, perhaps unwittingly, help smuggle white supremacist thought, policy, and action into the American mainstream. Conservatives and many liberals, on their part, lambast \"antifa\" for not respecting free speech. Trump even tweeted that antifa might be considered a terrorist organization for interrupting the supposed rights of white supremacists to march. Over the last three years, I've been researching and writing a book about free speech in the United States -going to the front lines of free speech battles in Charlottesville and at other far-right protests, on college campuses, and at flashpoints of police repression like Standing Rock. What I've found through my research and reporting is that free speech has become a rhetorical tool to elide something much more sinister: the state's support and protection of white supremacists, and this country's unwillingness to grapple with its racism and vast inequality. I've been disheartened to see not only conservatives and fascists but also liberals criticizing those who protest against the free speech rights of the most vile groups in America. The New York Times op-ed pages-really, every paper's op-ed pages-have been filled with ostensible liberals warning that young, leftist, and progressive activists are pushing America toward fascism .

L et's start with the letter of the law: Nothing in the First Amendment prevents citizens (members of antifa or otherwise) from interrupting someone's protest. Nor does it guarantee police protection for white nationalists. It only limits the ability of Congress from passing laws that interfere with speech. Current Issue View our current issue Most leftists I talk to do not wish that the government would ban Nazi speech, as governments in Germany and France have. Instead, they wish that police departments would not spend vast amounts of resources protecting Nazis, something that they have no legal mandate to do. When the First Amendment is invoked by the Portland police and other government officials, they're simply misinterpreting the law, or reinterpreting it to be extremely broad in a way that's become acceptable largely thanks to decades of work on the part of right-wing think tanks. The other problem with the state's defense of Nazis' right to free speech is that it belies the fact that the state is itself suppressing speech in countless ways every day. We have already decided, for example, that private property rights supersede speech rights: I cannot protest in a Walmart without being kicked out or arrested, and I can even be shot if I decide to protest in someone's home in a Stand Your Ground state. State and local governments have decided, and courts have upheld, that requiring permits for protests is an acceptable limit on free speech, and that requiring insurance for any possible damage caused by protests is too-often limiting legal protest to groups that can afford it. And of course, there are many instances when police actively work against people's ability to speak, whether it be at the January 20, 2017, protests during which hundreds of people were arrested and charged with felony rioting for being in the vicinity of some broken windows, or at Standing Rock, where police and federal forces broke up a peaceful demonstration at the behest of a private corporation. How did we get here? Very intentionally, as it turns out: For decades, the right has claimed a monopoly on the idea of \"freedom\" more broadly-and speech is no exception. Until 2015, the Koch brothers employed a man named Richard Fink as a political adviser. In 1996 Fink outlined his philosophy of conservative revolution in Philanthropy Monthly : First, you invest in the \"intellectual raw materials\" of national discourse-professorships, books, student groups. These institutions go on to produce ideas that, in a \"middle stage of production,\" think tanks disseminate in digestible forms to the public. Then, according to Fink, it's the work of lobbyists and politicians to enact the final product: policy. In 1978, another conservative policy man named William Simon, who headed the archconservative Olin Foundation, wrote that \"ideas are weapons\" that do not just naturally bloom: They must be funded through \"grants, grants, and more grants, in exchange for books, books, and more books.\" In other words, ideas were investments as worthy to the right-wing cause as political influence or corporate power. These conservative influencers knew they couldn't simply push for environmental deregulation or tax cuts for the rich, ideas that were at the time odious to much of the public. And some conservative intellectuals insisted that they needed to be disingenuous, to frame their arguments in universally appealing terms like \"freedom\" or \"prosperity,\" in order to win over Americans. The best way to do this was to fund a long-term pipeline of academic research that would make its way into the mainstream. By 2015, the Kochs were subsidizing programs in at least 307 higher education institutions like Brown University's Political Theory Project and the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. The DeVos family (led by the parents of the current secretary of education, Betsy DeVos) also spent about $200 million on conservative education and research efforts, and helped found the James Madison Center for Free Speech, which was instrumental in defining money as a form of speech through the Citizens United ruling. Fundamental to all these centers for research was a conflation of freedom for corporations to do whatever they want with political and First Amendment freedom. The billionaires pushed a version of free speech that posited that limiting carbon emissions, taxing the rich, and any form of redistribution were equivalent to infractions on our constitutional rights. To do this, they not only needed to talk about market and economic deregulation; they needed to present their ideas as a radical remedy to the overbearing liberal state. So they funded dozens of books that argued that liberals were essentially limiting far-right speech through political correctness. Welcome to the era of our supposed free speech crisis. T he late 1980s and early 1990s saw the publication of plenty of \"books, books, and more books\" that claimed conservative speech was being trampled on by the left. Most popular was Allan Bloom's 1987 The Closing of the American Mind , which argued that college students no longer wanted to learn about American and European classics. Though the book's scope was relatively narrow, it was used as a jumping-off point for a media onslaught of anti-PC takes, including a cover story in Newsweek called \"Thought Police\" and features in New York magazine and The New York Times claiming that college students were out to suppress anyone who didn't agree with them. Bloom's scholarship was funded by the John M. Olin Center for Inquiry into the Theory and Practice of Democracy at the University of Chicago. It was straight out of the Kochs' raw material-to-public discourse pipeline. Today, the same manufactured \"free speech crisis\" can be seen across the United States, with conservative groups funded by the same people claiming their rights have been similar infringed upon on college campuses. The same groups have bankrolled provocateurs like Milo Yiannopoulos, and fund media outlets like Breitbart News whose coverage accentuates these supposed violations. Meanwhile, the mainstream media, along with many liberals, takes the conservatives at their word, not realizing it's playing a part in a multi-decade campaign to frame conservatives and white supremacists as victims, as opposed to perpetrators of hate. The billion-dollar investment in what is essentially right-wing propaganda has worked: We no longer think of free speech logically or accurately. Is a college protest over a conservative speaker really a violation of free speech? What about the college students' right to protest-is that not as important a free speech issue? Colleges are already some of the most restrictive speech environments in the world, deciding who can enter the campus via an admissions process, what gets taught in every classroom, and who gets to teach it. Is my rejection from UC Berkeley a free speech violation? I might disagree with their decision, but no, it's not. I don't expect to be invited to conservative Christian universities, and I don't view that as a violation of my free speech either. Why should conservatives expect an open invitation wherever they please? And more importantly, why are so many liberals defending them? Similarly: Are counterprotests and antifa tactics a violation of free speech? We limit protest all the time, and give the state permission to limit the speech of countless people without much of a fuss. I'd argue, for example, that mass incarceration and the disappearing of immigrants is a much bigger threat to free speech than the confrontation of Nazis on the streets. Even if you do believe that antifa's tactics amount to a free speech violation, you must then question why those violations retain your attention-and the ire of the political establishment and the mainstream media-while so many other limits on free speech have gotten a pass. Is it because they are the most important free speech battles in the country-or because we've been convinced, through decades of ingenious campaigning, to believe they are?\n\nThe police far outnumbered both the Nazis and masked groups.

Over the last three years, I've been researching and writing a book about free speech in the United States -going to the front lines of free speech battles in Charlottesville and at other far-right protests, on college campuses, and at flashpoints of police repression like Standing Rock. What I've found through my research and reporting is that free speech has become a rhetorical tool to elide something much more sinister: the state's support and protection of white supremacists, and this country's unwillingness to grapple with its racism and vast inequality. I've been disheartened to see not only conservatives and fascists but also liberals criticizing those who protest against the free speech rights of the most vile groups in America. The New York Times op-ed pages-really, every paper's op-ed pages-have been filled with ostensible liberals warning that young, leftist, and progressive activists are pushing America toward fascism .

L et's start with the letter of the law: Nothing in the First Amendment prevents citizens (members of antifa or otherwise) from interrupting someone's protest. Nor does it guarantee police protection for white nationalists. It only limits the ability of Congress from passing laws that interfere with speech. Current Issue View our current issue Most leftists I talk to do not wish that the government would ban Nazi speech, as governments in Germany and France have. Instead, they wish that police departments would not spend vast amounts of resources protecting Nazis, something that they have no legal mandate to do. When the First Amendment is invoked by the Portland police and other government officials, they're simply misinterpreting the law, or reinterpreting it to be extremely broad in a way that's become acceptable largely thanks to decades of work on the part of right-wing think tanks. The other problem with the state's defense of Nazis' right to free speech is that it belies the fact that the state is itself suppressing speech in countless ways every day. We have already decided, for example, that private property rights supersede speech rights: I cannot protest in a Walmart without being kicked out or arrested, and I can even be shot if I decide to protest in someone's home in a Stand Your Ground state. State and local governments have decided, and courts have upheld, that requiring permits for protests is an acceptable limit on free speech, and that requiring insurance for any possible damage caused by protests is too-often limiting legal protest to groups that can afford it. And of course, there are many instances when police actively work against people's ability to speak, whether it be at the January 20, 2017, protests during which hundreds of people were arrested and charged with felony rioting for being in the vicinity of some broken windows, or at Standing Rock, where police and federal forces broke up a peaceful demonstration at the behest of a private corporation. How did we get here? Very intentionally, as it turns out: For decades, the right has claimed a monopoly on the idea of \"freedom\" more broadly-and speech is no exception. Until 2015, the Koch brothers employed a man named Richard Fink as a political adviser. In 1996 Fink outlined his philosophy of conservative revolution in Philanthropy Monthly : First, you invest in the \"intellectual raw materials\" of national discourse-professorships, books, student groups. These institutions go on to produce ideas that, in a \"middle stage of production,\" think tanks disseminate in digestible forms to the public. Then, according to Fink, it's the work of lobbyists and politicians to enact the final product: policy. In 1978, another conservative policy man named William Simon, who headed the archconservative Olin Foundation, wrote that \"ideas are weapons\" that do not just naturally bloom: They must be funded through \"grants, grants, and more grants, in exchange for books, books, and more books.\" In other words, ideas were investments as worthy to the right-wing cause as political influence or corporate power. These conservative influencers knew they couldn't simply push for environmental deregulation or tax cuts for the rich, ideas that were at the time odious to much of the public. And some conservative intellectuals insisted that they needed to be disingenuous, to frame their arguments in universally appealing terms like \"freedom\" or \"prosperity,\" in order to win over Americans. The best way to do this was to fund a long-term pipeline of academic research that would make its way into the mainstream. By 2015, the Kochs were subsidizing programs in at least 307 higher education institutions like Brown University's Political Theory Project and the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. The DeVos family (led by the parents of the current secretary of education, Betsy DeVos) also spent about $200 million on conservative education and research efforts, and helped found the James Madison Center for Free Speech, which was instrumental in defining money as a form of speech through the Citizens United ruling. Fundamental to all these centers for research was a conflation of freedom for corporations to do whatever they want with political and First Amendment freedom. The billionaires pushed a version of free speech that posited that limiting carbon emissions, taxing the rich, and any form of redistribution were equivalent to infractions on our constitutional rights. To do this, they not only needed to talk about market and economic deregulation; they needed to present their ideas as a radical remedy to the overbearing liberal state. So they funded dozens of books that argued that liberals were essentially limiting far-right speech through political correctness. Welcome to the era of our supposed free speech crisis. T he late 1980s and early 1990s saw the publication of plenty of \"books, books, and more books\" that claimed conservative speech was being trampled on by the left. Most popular was Allan Bloom's 1987 The Closing of the American Mind , which argued that college students no longer wanted to learn about American and European classics. Though the book's scope was relatively narrow, it was used as a jumping-off point for a media onslaught of anti-PC takes, including a cover story in Newsweek called \"Thought Police\" and features in New York magazine and The New York Times claiming that college students were out to suppress anyone who didn't agree with them. Bloom's scholarship was funded by the John M. Olin Center for Inquiry into the Theory and Practice of Democracy at the University of Chicago. It was straight out of the Kochs' raw material-to-public discourse pipeline. Today, the same manufactured \"free speech crisis\" can be seen across the United States, with conservative groups funded by the same people claiming their rights have been similar infringed upon on college campuses. The same groups have bankrolled provocateurs like Milo Yiannopoulos, and fund media outlets like Breitbart News whose coverage accentuates these supposed violations. Meanwhile, the mainstream media, along with many liberals, takes the conservatives at their word, not realizing it's playing a part in a multi-decade campaign to frame conservatives and white supremacists as victims, as opposed to perpetrators of hate. The billion-dollar investment in what is essentially right-wing propaganda has worked: We no longer think of free speech logically or accurately. Is a college protest over a conservative speaker really a violation of free speech? What about the college students' right to protest-is that not as important a free speech issue? Colleges are already some of the most restrictive speech environments in the world, deciding who can enter the campus via an admissions process, what gets taught in every classroom, and who gets to teach it. Is my rejection from UC Berkeley a free speech violation? I might disagree with their decision, but no, it's not. I don't expect to be invited to conservative Christian universities, and I don't view that as a violation of my free speech either. Why should conservatives expect an open invitation wherever they please? And more importantly, why are so many liberals defending them? Similarly: Are counterprotests and antifa tactics a violation of free speech? We limit protest all the time, and give the state permission to limit the speech of countless people without much of a fuss. I'd argue, for example, that mass incarceration and the disappearing of immigrants is a much bigger threat to free speech than the confrontation of Nazis on the streets. Even if you do believe that antifa's tactics amount to a free speech violation, you must then question why those violations retain your attention-and the ire of the political establishment and the mainstream media-while so many other limits on free speech have gotten a pass. Is it because they are the most important free speech battles in the country-or because we've been convinced, through decades of ingenious campaigning, to believe they are?\n\nEvents like this one happen like clockwork these days: A small number of Nazis protest somewhere, usually under the guise of freely expressing their opinions, and the police protect them under a mandate of upholding the First Amendment. By bolstering the narrative that speech should be protected at all costs, the police, perhaps unwittingly, help smuggle white supremacist thought, policy, and action into the American mainstream. Conservatives and many liberals, on their part, lambast \"antifa\" for not respecting free speech. Trump even tweeted that antifa might be considered a terrorist organization for interrupting the supposed rights of white supremacists to march. Over the last three years, I've been researching and writing a book about free speech in the United States -going to the front lines of free speech battles in Charlottesville and at other far-right protests, on college campuses, and at flashpoints of police repression like Standing Rock.

So they funded dozens of books that argued that liberals were essentially limiting far-right speech through political correctness. Welcome to the era of our supposed free speech crisis. T he late 1980s and early 1990s saw the publication of plenty of \"books, books, and more books\" that claimed conservative speech was being trampled on by the left. Most popular was Allan Bloom's 1987 The Closing of the American Mind , which argued that college students no longer wanted to learn about American and European classics. Though the book's scope was relatively narrow, it was used as a jumping-off point for a media onslaught of anti-PC takes, including a cover story in Newsweek called \"Thought Police\" and features in New York magazine and The New York Times claiming that college students were out to suppress anyone who didn't agree with them. Bloom's scholarship was funded by the John M. Olin Center for Inquiry into the Theory and Practice of Democracy at the University of Chicago. It was straight out of the Kochs' raw material-to-public discourse pipeline. Today, the same manufactured \"free speech crisis\" can be seen across the United States, with conservative groups funded by the same people claiming their rights have been similar infringed upon on college campuses. The same groups have bankrolled provocateurs like Milo Yiannopoulos, and fund media outlets like Breitbart News whose coverage accentuates these supposed violations. Meanwhile, the mainstream media, along with many liberals, takes the conservatives at their word, not realizing it's playing a part in a multi-decade campaign to frame conservatives and white supremacists as victims, as opposed to perpetrators of hate. The billion-dollar investment in what is essentially right-wing propaganda has worked: We no longer think of free speech logically or accurately. Is a college protest over a conservative speaker really a violation of free speech? What about the college students' right to protest-is that not as important a free speech issue? Colleges are already some of the most restrictive speech environments in the world, deciding who can enter the campus via an admissions process, what gets taught in every classroom, and who gets to teach it. Is my rejection from UC Berkeley a free speech violation? I might disagree with their decision, but no, it's not. I don't expect to be invited to conservative Christian universities, and I don't view that as a violation of my free speech either. Why should conservatives expect an open invitation wherever they please? And more importantly, why are so many liberals defending them? Similarly: Are counterprotests and antifa tactics a violation of free speech? We limit protest all the time, and give the state permission to limit the speech of countless people without much of a fuss. I'd argue, for example, that mass incarceration and the disappearing of immigrants is a much bigger threat to free speech than the confrontation of Nazis on the streets. Even if you do believe that antifa's tactics amount to a free speech violation, you must then question why those violations retain your attention-and the ire of the political establishment and the mainstream media-while so many other limits on free speech have gotten a pass. Is it because they are the most important free speech battles in the country-or because we've been convinced, through decades of ingenious campaigning, to believe they are?\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nFeature / Vincent Bevins\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nFeature / Vincent Bevins\n\nTheir argument usually harks back to the oft-misattributed quote : \"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\" Their reasoning makes clear that most of the United States has a deep misunderstanding of what free speech means. L et's start with the letter of the law: Nothing in the First Amendment prevents citizens (members of antifa or otherwise) from interrupting someone's protest. Nor does it guarantee police protection for white nationalists. It only limits the ability of Congress from passing laws that interfere with speech. Current Issue View our current issue Most leftists I talk to do not wish that the government would ban Nazi speech, as governments in Germany and France have. Instead, they wish that police departments would not spend vast amounts of resources protecting Nazis, something that they have no legal mandate to do. When the First Amendment is invoked by the Portland police and other government officials, they're simply misinterpreting the law, or reinterpreting it to be extremely broad in a way that's become acceptable largely thanks to decades of work on the part of right-wing think tanks. The other problem with the state's defense of Nazis' right to free speech is that it belies the fact that the state is itself suppressing speech in countless ways every day. We have already decided, for example, that private property rights supersede speech rights: I cannot protest in a Walmart without being kicked out or arrested, and I can even be shot if I decide to protest in someone's home in a Stand Your Ground state. State and local governments have decided, and courts have upheld, that requiring permits for protests is an acceptable limit on free speech, and that requiring insurance for any possible damage caused by protests is too-often limiting legal protest to groups that can afford it. And of course, there are many instances when police actively work against people's ability to speak, whether it be at the January 20, 2017, protests during which hundreds of people were arrested and charged with felony rioting for being in the vicinity of some broken windows, or at Standing Rock, where police and federal forces broke up a peaceful demonstration at the behest of a private corporation. How did we get here? Very intentionally, as it turns out: For decades, the right has claimed a monopoly on the idea of \"freedom\" more broadly-and speech is no exception. Until 2015, the Koch brothers employed a man named Richard Fink as a political adviser. In 1996 Fink outlined his philosophy of conservative revolution in Philanthropy Monthly : First, you invest in the \"intellectual raw materials\" of national discourse-professorships, books, student groups. These institutions go on to produce ideas that, in a \"middle stage of production,\" think tanks disseminate in digestible forms to the public. Then, according to Fink, it's the work of lobbyists and politicians to enact the final product: policy. In 1978, another conservative policy man named William Simon, who headed the archconservative Olin Foundation, wrote that \"ideas are weapons\" that do not just naturally bloom: They must be funded through \"grants, grants, and more grants, in exchange for books, books, and more books.\" In other words, ideas were investments as worthy to the right-wing cause as political influence or corporate power. These conservative influencers knew they couldn't simply push for environmental deregulation or tax cuts for the rich, ideas that were at the time odious to much of the public. And some conservative intellectuals insisted that they needed to be disingenuous, to frame their arguments in universally appealing terms like \"freedom\" or \"prosperity,\" in order to win over Americans. The best way to do this was to fund a long-term pipeline of academic research that would make its way into the mainstream. By 2015, the Kochs were subsidizing programs in at least 307 higher education institutions like Brown University's Political Theory Project and the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. The DeVos family (led by the parents of the current secretary of education, Betsy DeVos) also spent about $200 million on conservative education and research efforts, and helped found the James Madison Center for Free Speech, which was instrumental in defining money as a form of speech through the Citizens United ruling. Fundamental to all these centers for research was a conflation of freedom for corporations to do whatever they want with political and First Amendment freedom.

So they funded dozens of books that argued that liberals were essentially limiting far-right speech through political correctness. Welcome to the era of our supposed free speech crisis. T he late 1980s and early 1990s saw the publication of plenty of \"books, books, and more books\" that claimed conservative speech was being trampled on by the left. Most popular was Allan Bloom's 1987 The Closing of the American Mind , which argued that college students no longer wanted to learn about American and European classics. Though the book's scope was relatively narrow, it was used as a jumping-off point for a media onslaught of anti-PC takes, including a cover story in Newsweek called \"Thought Police\" and features in New York magazine and The New York Times claiming that college students were out to suppress anyone who didn't agree with them. Bloom's scholarship was funded by the John M. Olin Center for Inquiry into the Theory and Practice of Democracy at the University of Chicago. It was straight out of the Kochs' raw material-to-public discourse pipeline. Today, the same manufactured \"free speech crisis\" can be seen across the United States, with conservative groups funded by the same people claiming their rights have been similar infringed upon on college campuses. The same groups have bankrolled provocateurs like Milo Yiannopoulos, and fund media outlets like Breitbart News whose coverage accentuates these supposed violations. Meanwhile, the mainstream media, along with many liberals, takes the conservatives at their word, not realizing it's playing a part in a multi-decade campaign to frame conservatives and white supremacists as victims, as opposed to perpetrators of hate. The billion-dollar investment in what is essentially right-wing propaganda has worked: We no longer think of free speech logically or accurately. Is a college protest over a conservative speaker really a violation of free speech? What about the college students' right to protest-is that not as important a free speech issue? Colleges are already some of the most restrictive speech environments in the world, deciding who can enter the campus via an admissions process, what gets taught in every classroom, and who gets to teach it. Is my rejection from UC Berkeley a free speech violation? I might disagree with their decision, but no, it's not. I don't expect to be invited to conservative Christian universities, and I don't view that as a violation of my free speech either. Why should conservatives expect an open invitation wherever they please? And more importantly, why are so many liberals defending them? Similarly: Are counterprotests and antifa tactics a violation of free speech? We limit protest all the time, and give the state permission to limit the speech of countless people without much of a fuss. I'd argue, for example, that mass incarceration and the disappearing of immigrants is a much bigger threat to free speech than the confrontation of Nazis on the streets. Even if you do believe that antifa's tactics amount to a free speech violation, you must then question why those violations retain your attention-and the ire of the political establishment and the mainstream media-while so many other limits on free speech have gotten a pass. Is it because they are the most important free speech battles in the country-or because we've been convinced, through decades of ingenious campaigning, to believe they are?\n\nAnd of course, there are many instances when police actively work against people's ability to speak, whether it be at the January 20, 2017, protests during which hundreds of people were arrested and charged with felony rioting for being in the vicinity of some broken windows, or at Standing Rock, where police and federal forces broke up a peaceful demonstration at the behest of a private corporation. How did we get here? Very intentionally, as it turns out: For decades, the right has claimed a monopoly on the idea of \"freedom\" more broadly-and speech is no exception. Until 2015, the Koch brothers employed a man named Richard Fink as a political adviser. In 1996 Fink outlined his philosophy of conservative revolution in Philanthropy Monthly : First, you invest in the \"intellectual raw materials\" of national discourse-professorships, books, student groups. These institutions go on to produce ideas that, in a \"middle stage of production,\" think tanks disseminate in digestible forms to the public. Then, according to Fink, it's the work of lobbyists and politicians to enact the final product: policy. In 1978, another conservative policy man named William Simon, who headed the archconservative Olin Foundation, wrote that \"ideas are weapons\" that do not just naturally bloom: They must be funded through \"grants, grants, and more grants, in exchange for books, books, and more books.\" In other words, ideas were investments as worthy to the right-wing cause as political influence or corporate power. These conservative influencers knew they couldn't simply push for environmental deregulation or tax cuts for the rich, ideas that were at the time odious to much of the public. And some conservative intellectuals insisted that they needed to be disingenuous, to frame their arguments in universally appealing terms like \"freedom\" or \"prosperity,\" in order to win over Americans. The best way to do this was to fund a long-term pipeline of academic research that would make its way into the mainstream. By 2015, the Kochs were subsidizing programs in at least 307 higher education institutions like Brown University's Political Theory Project and the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. The DeVos family (led by the parents of the current secretary of education, Betsy DeVos) also spent about $200 million on conservative education and research efforts, and helped found the James Madison Center for Free Speech, which was instrumental in defining money as a form of speech through the Citizens United ruling. Fundamental to all these centers for research was a conflation of freedom for corporations to do whatever they want with political and First Amendment freedom. The billionaires pushed a version of free speech that posited that limiting carbon emissions, taxing the rich, and any form of redistribution were equivalent to infractions on our constitutional rights.

Even if you do believe that antifa's tactics amount to a free speech violation, you must then question why those violations retain your attention-and the ire of the political establishment and the mainstream media-while so many other limits on free speech have gotten a pass. Is it because they are the most important free speech battles in the country-or because we've been convinced, through decades of ingenious campaigning, to believe they are?\n\nT he late 1980s and early 1990s saw the publication of plenty of \"books, books, and more books\" that claimed conservative speech was being trampled on by the left. Most popular was Allan Bloom's 1987 The Closing of the American Mind , which argued that college students no longer wanted to learn about American and European classics. Though the book's scope was relatively narrow, it was used as a jumping-off point for a media onslaught of anti-PC takes, including a cover story in Newsweek called \"Thought Police\" and features in New York magazine and The New York Times claiming that college students were out to suppress anyone who didn't agree with them. Bloom's scholarship was funded by the John M. Olin Center for Inquiry into the Theory and Practice of Democracy at the University of Chicago. It was straight out of the Kochs' raw material-to-public discourse pipeline. Today, the same manufactured \"free speech crisis\" can be seen across the United States, with conservative groups funded by the same people claiming their rights have been similar infringed upon on college campuses. The same groups have bankrolled provocateurs like Milo Yiannopoulos, and fund media outlets like Breitbart News whose coverage accentuates these supposed violations. Meanwhile, the mainstream media, along with many liberals, takes the conservatives at their word, not realizing it's playing a part in a multi-decade campaign to frame conservatives and white supremacists as victims, as opposed to perpetrators of hate. The billion-dollar investment in what is essentially right-wing propaganda has worked: We no longer think of free speech logically or accurately. Is a college protest over a conservative speaker really a violation of free speech? What about the college students' right to protest-is that not as important a free speech issue? Colleges are already some of the most restrictive speech environments in the world, deciding who can enter the campus via an admissions process, what gets taught in every classroom, and who gets to teach it. Is my rejection from UC Berkeley a free speech violation? I might disagree with their decision, but no, it's not. I don't expect to be invited to conservative Christian universities, and I don't view that as a violation of my free speech either. Why should conservatives expect an open invitation wherever they please? And more importantly, why are so many liberals defending them? Similarly: Are counterprotests and antifa tactics a violation of free speech? We limit protest all the time, and give the state permission to limit the speech of countless people without much of a fuss. I'd argue, for example, that mass incarceration and the disappearing of immigrants is a much bigger threat to free speech than the confrontation of Nazis on the streets.

In her new book, On Being Numerous: Essays on Non-Fascist Life , the essayist Natasha Lennard considers the meaning and the fearful reception of anti-fascist organizing today. In meditations on riots and surveillance, sex radicalism and First Amendment controversies, Lennard-who moved to the United States from London a decade ago and is now one of the most astute thinkers to emerge from the Occupy movement-offers a crystalline vision of how fascism can be fought without reliance on the state and why it must be. -Marissa Brostoff Marissa Brostoff: The press often treats anti-fascist organizing merely as a spectacle-the image of white men in black blocs circulates, but neither the meaning of those tactics nor a broader vision of anti-fascist movements seems to register. What is anti-fascism, and how has it been misunderstood? Natasha Lennard: \"Anti-fascist\" is a troublesome term. To state one's political position as anti-fascist after 1945 is, in a sense, close to meaningless: Most everyone claims to be anti-fascist, so long as they agree that Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco were baddies. A better conception of fascism, which sees its expression not only in historic state regimes but in aspects of daily life under capitalism, entails a more nuanced understanding of anti-fascism, too. I'm more interested in talking about anti-fascist tactics or practices, since as an identity \"anti-fascist\" is somewhat impossible. In the simplest, most popular sense, anti-fascist organizing-often known as antifa-is a militant, no-tolerance approach to far-right, racist nationalism. As a practice taken up by the far left, socialist and anarchist alike, antifa is an illiberal intervention that does not rely on the state, the justice system, or any liberal institution to resist fascism. It finds organization online, in the streets, on campuses-wherever fascism is to be found. Much antifa work today involves exposing white supremacists online and taking action to shut down spaces where fascistic desires get fostered, fueled, and legitimized. Sometimes this involves physical, confrontational tactics. What the media tends to get wrong is what undergirds these tactics and why they're necessary and effective. The mainstream press often calls for \"civility\" and reasoned debate. The problem is, fascism is not a position that is reasoned into; it is a set of perverted desires and tendencies that cannot be broken with reason alone. So anti-fascist interventions instead must make the entertainment and maintenance of fascist organizing intolerable. The use of anti-fascist violence is thus far from foolish thuggery: its goal is to create consequences for fascist organizing. For the most part it's based on a better philosophical understanding of how fascism proliferates than is held by most liberal centrists demanding civil debate.

Current Issue View our current issue NL: To be clear from the outset, while I do use this idea to defend, say, riotous protest against racist police killings or the punching of neo-Nazis, my point is not to deny the importance and historic success of movements who have used strategic and principled nonviolent protest. Rather, my point is that there is never, in any of these situations, really such a thing as nonviolence. The question is, where do we locate the violence in narratives about events like antifa activists fighting white supremacists in Charlottesville or Ferguson residents rising up after Mike Brown's execution? A categorical error is made in any media narrative resting on the idea that protests \"turn\" violent, or counterprotesters instigate violence in these circumstances. The error exists in the tacit suggestion that there was a situation of nonviolence, or peace, from which to turn. Any circumstance in which cops take black life with impunity, any context in which it is still necessary to state that Black Lives Matter, any situation where neo-Nazis march and murder, is a background state of constant violence. Yet the media consistently attributes the act of turning to violence to people who literally cannot turn from it, whose lives and deaths are organized by it. In the book, I cite the late philosopher Bernard Williams who wrote, \"To say peace where there is no peace is to say nothing.\" MB: One essay in Being Numerous has the provocative title \"Riots for Black Life.\" Is rioting a kind of anti-fascist action? How is anti-fascism racialized? More by Natasha Lennard This Is Not a Time for Civility Natasha Lennard The Term 'Terrorism' Is a State Weapon Natasha Lennard Why 1 Anarchist Is Choosing Jail Over Grand-Jury Testimony Natasha Lennard NL: The writer Raven Rakia made the point that the term \"riot\" is deeply racialized-white people get to protest, black protest is called \"riot\" to denigrate it as senseless and depoliticized. For this reason, I very much understand why some people refer to the riotous protests in Ferguson and Baltimore as uprisings, which they were. If we also want to hold on to the term \"riot\" as a politically useful word in its own right, that entails rejecting the white establishment's efforts to depoliticize such protests, which involve black people damaging property, confronting cops, and sometimes looting. When then-Prime Pinister David Cameron called the 2011 London riots \"criminality, pure and simple,\" it was a useful lie for a politician keen to brush away the racist devastation of his government's austerity regime, like the many middle-class Britons who went into the street with brooms to clean up after the riots' aftermath. Rioting is not senseless destruction; on the contrary, it is often a deeply political challenge to property and white supremacy-two concepts intractably entwined. MB: You discuss the ways the US legal system has dangerously narrowed what counts as peaceful protest in recent years. But you also suggest that social movements shoot themselves in the foot when they accept the state's authority to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of protest, period. When should activists fight for the right to protest, and when is this a losing battle? NL: The Trump administration has made it clear that little from the left can count as permissible protest. I bring this issue up when writing about the mass arrest of protesters during the J20 inauguration protests. All the charges from this unjustified arrest were eventually dropped, but the government still hit people with felony charges for being part of a protest where property damage took place-a clear violation of First Amendment protections. We should take this as a goad to abolish the old good protester/bad protester canard altogether. On a practical level, though, we often can't help but accept the state's authority to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of protest, because the state will enact its authority regardless. When you're forced to work within the state's logic-say, in court-you'd be foolish not to speak the state's language, which means appealing to your rights! The J20 defendants were absolutely correct to do so. But I argue that when we focus too much on our rights to speak and assemble, our fight becomes atomized over the fact of assembly, rather than the reason for protest. And as we've seen, that leaves a lot of room for white-supremacist speech to gain purchase in a liberal defense of free speech rights, with scant regard for racial justice. MB: As recently as the Occupy movement, you write, activists were deeply shaken by revelations about the portals to state surveillance that open every time we take out our smartphones at a protest. Today, you note, we take it for granted that we are perpetually being tracked by our phones. Do we need to resist the normalization of surveillance? NL: It's sad that it almost feels quaint to ask whether we can resist the normalization of surveillance. Too late! And it seems like a long time since Edward Snowden's revelations produced shock. The essay in my book that deals with this question asks whether and how to talk about our complicity with this state of totalized surveillance, given that it informs so much of how we live today. I'm interested in stepping away from narratives of resistance to surveillance that focus exclusively on privacy protections or transparency from tech leviathans. These interventions are reformist at best and do little to challenge the gargantuan power asymmetries undergirding contemporary mass surveillance. So I think more important questions involve democratizing technological life, like Ben Tarnoff's calls to nationalize or communize data . Issues of privacy matter hugely; protection from corporate-government surveillance is a matter of life and death for some people. Amazon works with ICE in its violent deportation machine. No amount of best privacy practices or transparency rules will suffice; these companies need to be dismantled! As always, if we're interesting in fighting capitalism, we have to think about property. Who owns our data? And who owns the means of the production that produce us as data? What could seizing this even look like? MB: Your most personal essays in the collection, about ghosts and suicide, are also among the most philosophical, drawing on thinkers from David Hume to Ludwig Wittgenstein. How has your background in philosophy informed the way you approach political questions? NL: My background was in pretty dry analytic philosophy, which was both an education in rigor and exposed me to the risk of hermetically sealed logical universes. I'm pleased to have seen the risks of pretending Enlightenment reason is free of ideology-a belief that haunts liberal discourse. I almost snorted wine through my nose when I saw the New York Times \"Truth\" ad campaign, which insisted, \"Truth cannot be manufactured.\" Some of the most violent social and political hierarchies operate by treatment of what philosophers call ontological questions-what kind of persons get to be, and how do they get to be that way? So it takes philosophical work and political action together to undo violent hierarchies and the ideologies by which they are maintained and defended.\n\nIn her new book, On Being Numerous: Essays on Non-Fascist Life , the essayist Natasha Lennard considers the meaning and the fearful reception of anti-fascist organizing today.

These interventions are reformist at best and do little to challenge the gargantuan power asymmetries undergirding contemporary mass surveillance. So I think more important questions involve democratizing technological life, like Ben Tarnoff's calls to nationalize or communize data . Issues of privacy matter hugely; protection from corporate-government surveillance is a matter of life and death for some people. Amazon works with ICE in its violent deportation machine. No amount of best privacy practices or transparency rules will suffice; these companies need to be dismantled! As always, if we're interesting in fighting capitalism, we have to think about property. Who owns our data? And who owns the means of the production that produce us as data? What could seizing this even look like? MB: Your most personal essays in the collection, about ghosts and suicide, are also among the most philosophical, drawing on thinkers from David Hume to Ludwig Wittgenstein. How has your background in philosophy informed the way you approach political questions? NL: My background was in pretty dry analytic philosophy, which was both an education in rigor and exposed me to the risk of hermetically sealed logical universes. I'm pleased to have seen the risks of pretending Enlightenment reason is free of ideology-a belief that haunts liberal discourse. I almost snorted wine through my nose when I saw the New York Times \"Truth\" ad campaign, which insisted, \"Truth cannot be manufactured.\" Some of the most violent social and political hierarchies operate by treatment of what philosophers call ontological questions-what kind of persons get to be, and how do they get to be that way? So it takes philosophical work and political action together to undo violent hierarchies and the ideologies by which they are maintained and defended.\n\nMarissa Brostoff: The press often treats anti-fascist organizing merely as a spectacle-the image of white men in black blocs circulates, but neither the meaning of those tactics nor a broader vision of anti-fascist movements seems to register. What is anti-fascism, and how has it been misunderstood? Natasha Lennard: \"Anti-fascist\" is a troublesome term. To state one's political position as anti-fascist after 1945 is, in a sense, close to meaningless: Most everyone claims to be anti-fascist, so long as they agree that Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco were baddies. A better conception of fascism, which sees its expression not only in historic state regimes but in aspects of daily life under capitalism, entails a more nuanced understanding of anti-fascism, too. I'm more interested in talking about anti-fascist tactics or practices, since as an identity \"anti-fascist\" is somewhat impossible. In the simplest, most popular sense, anti-fascist organizing-often known as antifa-is a militant, no-tolerance approach to far-right, racist nationalism. As a practice taken up by the far left, socialist and anarchist alike, antifa is an illiberal intervention that does not rely on the state, the justice system, or any liberal institution to resist fascism. It finds organization online, in the streets, on campuses-wherever fascism is to be found. Much antifa work today involves exposing white supremacists online and taking action to shut down spaces where fascistic desires get fostered, fueled, and legitimized. Sometimes this involves physical, confrontational tactics. What the media tends to get wrong is what undergirds these tactics and why they're necessary and effective. The mainstream press often calls for \"civility\" and reasoned debate. The problem is, fascism is not a position that is reasoned into; it is a set of perverted desires and tendencies that cannot be broken with reason alone. So anti-fascist interventions instead must make the entertainment and maintenance of fascist organizing intolerable. The use of anti-fascist violence is thus far from foolish thuggery: its goal is to create consequences for fascist organizing. For the most part it's based on a better philosophical understanding of how fascism proliferates than is held by most liberal centrists demanding civil debate.

Current Issue View our current issue NL: To be clear from the outset, while I do use this idea to defend, say, riotous protest against racist police killings or the punching of neo-Nazis, my point is not to deny the importance and historic success of movements who have used strategic and principled nonviolent protest. Rather, my point is that there is never, in any of these situations, really such a thing as nonviolence. The question is, where do we locate the violence in narratives about events like antifa activists fighting white supremacists in Charlottesville or Ferguson residents rising up after Mike Brown's execution? A categorical error is made in any media narrative resting on the idea that protests \"turn\" violent, or counterprotesters instigate violence in these circumstances. The error exists in the tacit suggestion that there was a situation of nonviolence, or peace, from which to turn. Any circumstance in which cops take black life with impunity, any context in which it is still necessary to state that Black Lives Matter, any situation where neo-Nazis march and murder, is a background state of constant violence. Yet the media consistently attributes the act of turning to violence to people who literally cannot turn from it, whose lives and deaths are organized by it. In the book, I cite the late philosopher Bernard Williams who wrote, \"To say peace where there is no peace is to say nothing.\" MB: One essay in Being Numerous has the provocative title \"Riots for Black Life.\" Is rioting a kind of anti-fascist action? How is anti-fascism racialized? More by Natasha Lennard This Is Not a Time for Civility Natasha Lennard The Term 'Terrorism' Is a State Weapon Natasha Lennard Why 1 Anarchist Is Choosing Jail Over Grand-Jury Testimony Natasha Lennard NL: The writer Raven Rakia made the point that the term \"riot\" is deeply racialized-white people get to protest, black protest is called \"riot\" to denigrate it as senseless and depoliticized. For this reason, I very much understand why some people refer to the riotous protests in Ferguson and Baltimore as uprisings, which they were. If we also want to hold on to the term \"riot\" as a politically useful word in its own right, that entails rejecting the white establishment's efforts to depoliticize such protests, which involve black people damaging property, confronting cops, and sometimes looting. When then-Prime Pinister David Cameron called the 2011 London riots \"criminality, pure and simple,\" it was a useful lie for a politician keen to brush away the racist devastation of his government's austerity regime, like the many middle-class Britons who went into the street with brooms to clean up after the riots' aftermath. Rioting is not senseless destruction; on the contrary, it is often a deeply political challenge to property and white supremacy-two concepts intractably entwined. MB: You discuss the ways the US legal system has dangerously narrowed what counts as peaceful protest in recent years. But you also suggest that social movements shoot themselves in the foot when they accept the state's authority to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of protest, period. When should activists fight for the right to protest, and when is this a losing battle? NL: The Trump administration has made it clear that little from the left can count as permissible protest. I bring this issue up when writing about the mass arrest of protesters during the J20 inauguration protests. All the charges from this unjustified arrest were eventually dropped, but the government still hit people with felony charges for being part of a protest where property damage took place-a clear violation of First Amendment protections. We should take this as a goad to abolish the old good protester/bad protester canard altogether. On a practical level, though, we often can't help but accept the state's authority to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of protest, because the state will enact its authority regardless. When you're forced to work within the state's logic-say, in court-you'd be foolish not to speak the state's language, which means appealing to your rights! The J20 defendants were absolutely correct to do so. But I argue that when we focus too much on our rights to speak and assemble, our fight becomes atomized over the fact of assembly, rather than the reason for protest. And as we've seen, that leaves a lot of room for white-supremacist speech to gain purchase in a liberal defense of free speech rights, with scant regard for racial justice. MB: As recently as the Occupy movement, you write, activists were deeply shaken by revelations about the portals to state surveillance that open every time we take out our smartphones at a protest. Today, you note, we take it for granted that we are perpetually being tracked by our phones. Do we need to resist the normalization of surveillance? NL: It's sad that it almost feels quaint to ask whether we can resist the normalization of surveillance. Too late! And it seems like a long time since Edward Snowden's revelations produced shock.

More by Natasha Lennard This Is Not a Time for Civility Natasha Lennard The Term 'Terrorism' Is a State Weapon Natasha Lennard Why 1 Anarchist Is Choosing Jail Over Grand-Jury Testimony Natasha Lennard NL: The writer Raven Rakia made the point that the term \"riot\" is deeply racialized-white people get to protest, black protest is called \"riot\" to denigrate it as senseless and depoliticized. For this reason, I very much understand why some people refer to the riotous protests in Ferguson and Baltimore as uprisings, which they were. If we also want to hold on to the term \"riot\" as a politically useful word in its own right, that entails rejecting the white establishment's efforts to depoliticize such protests, which involve black people damaging property, confronting cops, and sometimes looting. When then-Prime Pinister David Cameron called the 2011 London riots \"criminality, pure and simple,\" it was a useful lie for a politician keen to brush away the racist devastation of his government's austerity regime, like the many middle-class Britons who went into the street with brooms to clean up after the riots' aftermath. Rioting is not senseless destruction; on the contrary, it is often a deeply political challenge to property and white supremacy-two concepts intractably entwined. MB: You discuss the ways the US legal system has dangerously narrowed what counts as peaceful protest in recent years. But you also suggest that social movements shoot themselves in the foot when they accept the state's authority to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of protest, period. When should activists fight for the right to protest, and when is this a losing battle? NL: The Trump administration has made it clear that little from the left can count as permissible protest. I bring this issue up when writing about the mass arrest of protesters during the J20 inauguration protests. All the charges from this unjustified arrest were eventually dropped, but the government still hit people with felony charges for being part of a protest where property damage took place-a clear violation of First Amendment protections. We should take this as a goad to abolish the old good protester/bad protester canard altogether. On a practical level, though, we often can't help but accept the state's authority to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of protest, because the state will enact its authority regardless. When you're forced to work within the state's logic-say, in court-you'd be foolish not to speak the state's language, which means appealing to your rights! The J20 defendants were absolutely correct to do so. But I argue that when we focus too much on our rights to speak and assemble, our fight becomes atomized over the fact of assembly, rather than the reason for protest. And as we've seen, that leaves a lot of room for white-supremacist speech to gain purchase in a liberal defense of free speech rights, with scant regard for racial justice. MB: As recently as the Occupy movement, you write, activists were deeply shaken by revelations about the portals to state surveillance that open every time we take out our smartphones at a protest. Today, you note, we take it for granted that we are perpetually being tracked by our phones. Do we need to resist the normalization of surveillance? NL: It's sad that it almost feels quaint to ask whether we can resist the normalization of surveillance. Too late! And it seems like a long time since Edward Snowden's revelations produced shock. The essay in my book that deals with this question asks whether and how to talk about our complicity with this state of totalized surveillance, given that it informs so much of how we live today. I'm interested in stepping away from narratives of resistance to surveillance that focus exclusively on privacy protections or transparency from tech leviathans. These interventions are reformist at best and do little to challenge the gargantuan power asymmetries undergirding contemporary mass surveillance. So I think more important questions involve democratizing technological life, like Ben Tarnoff's calls to nationalize or communize data . Issues of privacy matter hugely; protection from corporate-government surveillance is a matter of life and death for some people. Amazon works with ICE in its violent deportation machine. No amount of best privacy practices or transparency rules will suffice; these companies need to be dismantled! As always, if we're interesting in fighting capitalism, we have to think about property. Who owns our data? And who owns the means of the production that produce us as data? What could seizing this even look like? MB: Your most personal essays in the collection, about ghosts and suicide, are also among the most philosophical, drawing on thinkers from David Hume to Ludwig Wittgenstein. How has your background in philosophy informed the way you approach political questions? NL: My background was in pretty dry analytic philosophy, which was both an education in rigor and exposed me to the risk of hermetically sealed logical universes. I'm pleased to have seen the risks of pretending Enlightenment reason is free of ideology-a belief that haunts liberal discourse. I almost snorted wine through my nose when I saw the New York Times \"Truth\" ad campaign, which insisted, \"Truth cannot be manufactured.\" Some of the most violent social and political hierarchies operate by treatment of what philosophers call ontological questions-what kind of persons get to be, and how do they get to be that way? So it takes philosophical work and political action together to undo violent hierarchies and the ideologies by which they are maintained and defended.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nElie Mystal\n\nMB: A lot of your work in this book and elsewhere is about violence. \"The problem we face,\" you write, \"is not so much that of necessary violence as it is one of impossible nonviolence.\" What does that mean? Current Issue View our current issue NL: To be clear from the outset, while I do use this idea to defend, say, riotous protest against racist police killings or the punching of neo-Nazis, my point is not to deny the importance and historic success of movements who have used strategic and principled nonviolent protest. Rather, my point is that there is never, in any of these situations, really such a thing as nonviolence. The question is, where do we locate the violence in narratives about events like antifa activists fighting white supremacists in Charlottesville or Ferguson residents rising up after Mike Brown's execution? A categorical error is made in any media narrative resting on the idea that protests \"turn\" violent, or counterprotesters instigate violence in these circumstances. The error exists in the tacit suggestion that there was a situation of nonviolence, or peace, from which to turn. Any circumstance in which cops take black life with impunity, any context in which it is still necessary to state that Black Lives Matter, any situation where neo-Nazis march and murder, is a background state of constant violence. Yet the media consistently attributes the act of turning to violence to people who literally cannot turn from it, whose lives and deaths are organized by it.

How has your background in philosophy informed the way you approach political questions? NL: My background was in pretty dry analytic philosophy, which was both an education in rigor and exposed me to the risk of hermetically sealed logical universes. I'm pleased to have seen the risks of pretending Enlightenment reason is free of ideology-a belief that haunts liberal discourse. I almost snorted wine through my nose when I saw the New York Times \"Truth\" ad campaign, which insisted, \"Truth cannot be manufactured.\" Some of the most violent social and political hierarchies operate by treatment of what philosophers call ontological questions-what kind of persons get to be, and how do they get to be that way? So it takes philosophical work and political action together to undo violent hierarchies and the ideologies by which they are maintained and defended.\n\nWhen then-Prime Pinister David Cameron called the 2011 London riots \"criminality, pure and simple,\" it was a useful lie for a politician keen to brush away the racist devastation of his government's austerity regime, like the many middle-class Britons who went into the street with brooms to clean up after the riots' aftermath. Rioting is not senseless destruction; on the contrary, it is often a deeply political challenge to property and white supremacy-two concepts intractably entwined. MB: You discuss the ways the US legal system has dangerously narrowed what counts as peaceful protest in recent years. But you also suggest that social movements shoot themselves in the foot when they accept the state's authority to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of protest, period. When should activists fight for the right to protest, and when is this a losing battle? NL: The Trump administration has made it clear that little from the left can count as permissible protest. I bring this issue up when writing about the mass arrest of protesters during the J20 inauguration protests. All the charges from this unjustified arrest were eventually dropped, but the government still hit people with felony charges for being part of a protest where property damage took place-a clear violation of First Amendment protections. We should take this as a goad to abolish the old good protester/bad protester canard altogether. On a practical level, though, we often can't help but accept the state's authority to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of protest, because the state will enact its authority regardless. When you're forced to work within the state's logic-say, in court-you'd be foolish not to speak the state's language, which means appealing to your rights! The J20 defendants were absolutely correct to do so. But I argue that when we focus too much on our rights to speak and assemble, our fight becomes atomized over the fact of assembly, rather than the reason for protest. And as we've seen, that leaves a lot of room for white-supremacist speech to gain purchase in a liberal defense of free speech rights, with scant regard for racial justice. MB: As recently as the Occupy movement, you write, activists were deeply shaken by revelations about the portals to state surveillance that open every time we take out our smartphones at a protest. Today, you note, we take it for granted that we are perpetually being tracked by our phones. Do we need to resist the normalization of surveillance? NL: It's sad that it almost feels quaint to ask whether we can resist the normalization of surveillance. Too late! And it seems like a long time since Edward Snowden's revelations produced shock. The essay in my book that deals with this question asks whether and how to talk about our complicity with this state of totalized surveillance, given that it informs so much of how we live today. I'm interested in stepping away from narratives of resistance to surveillance that focus exclusively on privacy protections or transparency from tech leviathans. These interventions are reformist at best and do little to challenge the gargantuan power asymmetries undergirding contemporary mass surveillance. So I think more important questions involve democratizing technological life, like Ben Tarnoff's calls to nationalize or communize data . Issues of privacy matter hugely; protection from corporate-government surveillance is a matter of life and death for some people. Amazon works with ICE in its violent deportation machine. No amount of best privacy practices or transparency rules will suffice; these companies need to be dismantled! As always, if we're interesting in fighting capitalism, we have to think about property.

(Photo by Matthew J. Lee / The Boston Globe via Getty Images)\n\nThe FBI's Washington Field Office \"has no intelligence indicating Antifa involvement/presence\" in the violence that occurred on May 31 during the D.C.-area protests over the murder of George Floyd, according to an internal FBI situation report obtained exclusively by The Nation . That same day, President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that he would designate \"Antifa\" a terrorist organization, even though the government has no existing authority to declare a domestic group a terrorist organization, and antifa is not an organized group. Following the president's tweet, Attorney General William Barr said in a statement, \"The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\" Related Article The Border Patrol Praises Stonewall While Deploying Officers to Suppress Protests Ken Klippenstein The FBI report, however, states that \"based on CHS [Confidential Human Source] canvassing, open source/social media partner engagement, and liaison, FBI WFO has no intelligence indicating Antifa involvement/presence.\" The statement followed a list of violent acts like throwing bricks at police and the discovery of a backpack containing explosive materials, which were flagged by the FBI under a \"Key Updates\" section of the report. The FBI has been issuing such reports daily since the weekend, according to a Bureau source, who added that none of these documents contained any evidence of antifa violence. Antifa, short for \"anti-fascist,\" is a type of militant anti-racist, anti-nationalist organizing that does not rely on the justice system to confront the far right. Groups associated with antifa have destroyed property and committed violence in the past, but the fact that the FBI's situation reports cannot find any evidence of such involvement now suggests that fears about such groups may be exaggerated. The report did warn that individuals from a far-right social media group had \"called for far-right provocateurs to attack federal agents, use automatic weapons against protesters.\" ( The Nation is withholding the name of the group in order to not disrupt any potential law enforcement investigations.) Last year, FBI documents obtained by this reporter showed that the Bureau has listed \"Racially Motivated Violent Extremists\" among its top counterterrorism priorities. While those priorities did include white supremacist groups, they also included what the FBI called \"Black Identity Extremists.\" The documents reveal that the Bureau linked \"retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement\" to the \"shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri,\" from which the Black Lives Matter movement originated. The report, marked \"For official use only\" (FOUO), was provided to The Nation by an FBI official on condition of anonymity. The report is titled, \"Civil Unrest in Washington AOR [Area of Responsibility] Following Death of George Floyd.\" The report's reference to \"CHS\" suggests that the Bureau possesses secret informants participating in the protests. Asked about the report and why they've been unable to substantiate antifa involvement in the violence, the FBI's Washington Field Office declined to comment.\n\nKen Klippenstein\n\nThe FBI report, however, states that \"based on CHS [Confidential Human Source] canvassing, open source/social media partner engagement, and liaison, FBI WFO has no intelligence indicating Antifa involvement/presence.\" The statement followed a list of violent acts like throwing bricks at police and the discovery of a backpack containing explosive materials, which were flagged by the FBI under a \"Key Updates\" section of the report.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

While there is no shortage of videos of police brutality during the current uprising, one of the most shocking appeared on Saturday, showing two police officers in Buffalo shoving Martin Gugino, an elderly man, to the ground. As police continued to walk past his body, Gugino lay there with blood draining from his ears. He's currently in the hospital recovering. Two Buffalo police officers have been suspended without pay after a widely shared video showed them shoving an elderly man to the ground, causing him a serious head injury (warning: distressing) pic.twitter.com/uc1GAxNSgY - NowThis (@nowthisnews) June 6, 2020 On Tuesday, Trump tweeted : \"Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment. @OANN I watched, he fell harder than was pushed.

April 18, 2025 Needless to say, Trump's tweet was total nonsense. Far from being an antifa provocateur, Gugino is a longtime pacifist who belongs to the Catholic Workers Movement. Although known for direct action, the Catholic Workers are not provocateurs. Antifa is a frequent bogeyman Trump likes to conjure up, but it also doesn't fit the model of agitation Trump is describing. Antifa is not a cohesive, organized group but an informal ideological network of activists engaged in anti-fascist protests. While antifa activists have on occasion scuffled with police, there's no evidence that they are major players in the nationwide protests. Trump has repeatedly promised to have antifa designated as a terrorist group. As The New York Times notes , Trump is having trouble achieving this goal because \"the federal government can only designate foreign-based groups as terrorist entities, and anti-fascism is a political idea, like pacifism or communism, not an organization.\" Current Issue View our current issue Trump's tweet is part of a larger push by his administration to revive the classic trope of the outside agitator in order to discredit the uprising against police violence. On May 31, Attorney General Bill Barr alleged that \"groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement Feature / Vincent Bevins Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement Feature / Vincent Bevins Like Trump's claims about antifa, Barr's statement is rhetorical bullshit hiding a lack of evidence. Protests are taking place all over America on a scale not seen since the 1960s. They have also inspired similar movements on every continent save Antarctica. It's undoubtedly the case that the protests have drawn people with a range of motives. This includes white supremacists motivated by the desire to infiltrate and discredit. But there's no reason to believe that \"radicals and agitators\" are the main cause of violence. NPR observed that \"U.S. Attorney General William Barr has repeatedly blamed anti-fascist activists for the violence that has erupted during demonstrations over George Floyd's death, but federal court records show no sign of so-called antifa links so far in cases brought by the Justice Department.\" As my colleague Ken Klippenstein reported , the FBI's Washington Field Office was also quick to pour cold water on Barr's charges, stating that the agency has \"no intelligence indicating Antifa involvement/presence.\" But the Trump administration isn't the only one trying to revive the trope of the outside agitator. Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, a Democrat, also invoked the trope in a press conference last week. Similar language blaming outside groups for local political violence has been used by Democratic mayors in many cities. When the uprising first started, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey claimed , again without credible evidence, that protesters \"are coming in largely from outside of the city, from outside of the region, to prey on everything we have built over the last several decades.\" It's strange to hear this language, so steeped in reactionary mythology, taken up by Democrats like Brown and Frey. The trope of the outside agitator goes back to the earliest days of slave rebellions and enjoyed a resurgence during the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and '60s. As University of Chicago historian Thomas C. Holt told The New York Times , \"The notion-or rather fiction-of the 'outside agitator' was a persistent trope, especially during the early years of the civil rights movement.\" Holt added, \"Part of the motivations for the charge was to sustain the myth that the locals were satisfied with things as they were, and if you could just crack down on the outsiders, the protests would cease. As the movement grew and spread, that myth became more difficult to sustain.\" The fact that Democratic mayors are so quick to resort to the outside agitator trope is evidence of how conservative their politics are. Squeezed between protesters who want change and powerful police unions seeking to preserve the status quo, mayors like Brown and Frey are conjuring up mythical agitators as a scapegoat. It is also a way of deflecting attention from the intensity of local anger. Antifa The FBI Finds 'No Intel Indicating Antifa Involvement' in Sunday's Violence Ken Klippenstein Nor are violent protesters the only imaginary scapegoat. Responding to Trump comments about Martin Gugino, Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, tweeted , \"The story Trump is referencing was written by a Russian working for the Kremlin's propaganda agency. Get ready-this is the next five months. Russia and the Trump campaign openly collaborating to spread lies and manipulate the election.\" If we were generous, we could say there is a bare modicum of truth to Murphy's claims. Trump's tweet was based on a report on the right-wing OANN network that was made by Kristian Brunovich Rouz, a Russian national who immigrated to the United States in 2015. Rouz does occasionally write, as a freelancer, for the Russian journal Sputnik . But there is really no reason to think that this is proof that the Trump campaign is \"openly collaborating\" with Russia. For one thing, Rouz was relying on conspiracy theories that appeared in the blog The Conservative Treehouse. Fantasies about antifa are common in the right-wing media, including on Fox News. Rouz may have been elevating these fantasies, but he didn't create them. Conspiracy mongering in America is not something Vladimir Putin invented. Nor are right-wingers the only ones who believe lurid and absurd claims about antifa. On June 1, Jonathan Chait, a liberal journalist who works for New York magazine, tweeted , \"One sign that liberals shouldn't be defending antifa is that it's literally impossible to distinguish them from white supremacist militias right now.\" Like Trump and Barr, Chait's claim is factually dubious. There is actual evidence of white supremacist violence in the protests, including a self-described member of the Ku Klux Klan driving into protesters . The antifa threat is, based on all credible evidence to date, imaginary. Not all liberals are hawking the outside agitator threat. But to the extent they are, it is for the same reason that the Trump administration is. The uprising has made visible a massive social crisis in America. To solve this problem, sweeping change is needed. The rising chorus of \"defund the police\" acknowledges the depth of the problem. Those who are uncomfortable with radical reforms fall back on blaming outside agitators as a way to stalling needed change. Accepting reality is the beginning of any solution. America needs to admit that its problems are not caused by antifa or Putin but by a deeply racist criminal justice system.

Rouz may have been elevating these fantasies, but he didn't create them. Conspiracy mongering in America is not something Vladimir Putin invented.

There is actual evidence of white supremacist violence in the protests, including a self-described member of the Ku Klux Klan driving into protesters . The antifa threat is, based on all credible evidence to date, imaginary. Not all liberals are hawking the outside agitator threat. But to the extent they are, it is for the same reason that the Trump administration is. The uprising has made visible a massive social crisis in America. To solve this problem, sweeping change is needed. The rising chorus of \"defund the police\" acknowledges the depth of the problem. Those who are uncomfortable with radical reforms fall back on blaming outside agitators as a way to stalling needed change. Accepting reality is the beginning of any solution. America needs to admit that its problems are not caused by antifa or Putin but by a deeply racist criminal justice system. Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown had described activist Martin Gugino as an \"agitator.\" This story has been updated.\n\nTrump has repeatedly promised to have antifa designated as a terrorist group. As The New York Times notes , Trump is having trouble achieving this goal because \"the federal government can only designate foreign-based groups as terrorist entities, and anti-fascism is a political idea, like pacifism or communism, not an organization.\" Current Issue View our current issue Trump's tweet is part of a larger push by his administration to revive the classic trope of the outside agitator in order to discredit the uprising against police violence.

Protests are taking place all over America on a scale not seen since the 1960s. They have also inspired similar movements on every continent save Antarctica. It's undoubtedly the case that the protests have drawn people with a range of motives. This includes white supremacists motivated by the desire to infiltrate and discredit. But there's no reason to believe that \"radicals and agitators\" are the main cause of violence. NPR observed that \"U.S. Attorney General William Barr has repeatedly blamed anti-fascist activists for the violence that has erupted during demonstrations over George Floyd's death, but federal court records show no sign of so-called antifa links so far in cases brought by the Justice Department.\" As my colleague Ken Klippenstein reported , the FBI's Washington Field Office was also quick to pour cold water on Barr's charges, stating that the agency has \"no intelligence indicating Antifa involvement/presence.\" But the Trump administration isn't the only one trying to revive the trope of the outside agitator. Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, a Democrat, also invoked the trope in a press conference last week. Similar language blaming outside groups for local political violence has been used by Democratic mayors in many cities. When the uprising first started, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey claimed , again without credible evidence, that protesters \"are coming in largely from outside of the city, from outside of the region, to prey on everything we have built over the last several decades.\" It's strange to hear this language, so steeped in reactionary mythology, taken up by Democrats like Brown and Frey. The trope of the outside agitator goes back to the earliest days of slave rebellions and enjoyed a resurgence during the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and '60s. As University of Chicago historian Thomas C. Holt told The New York Times , \"The notion-or rather fiction-of the 'outside agitator' was a persistent trope, especially during the early years of the civil rights movement.\" Holt added, \"Part of the motivations for the charge was to sustain the myth that the locals were satisfied with things as they were, and if you could just crack down on the outsiders, the protests would cease. As the movement grew and spread, that myth became more difficult to sustain.\" The fact that Democratic mayors are so quick to resort to the outside agitator trope is evidence of how conservative their politics are. Squeezed between protesters who want change and powerful police unions seeking to preserve the status quo, mayors like Brown and Frey are conjuring up mythical agitators as a scapegoat. It is also a way of deflecting attention from the intensity of local anger. Antifa The FBI Finds 'No Intel Indicating Antifa Involvement' in Sunday's Violence Ken Klippenstein Nor are violent protesters the only imaginary scapegoat.

Squeezed between protesters who want change and powerful police unions seeking to preserve the status quo, mayors like Brown and Frey are conjuring up mythical agitators as a scapegoat.

      "text": "An Intimate History of Antifa\n\nOn October 4, 1936, tens of thousands of Zionists, Socialists, Irish\ndockworkers, Communists, anarchists, and various outraged residents of\nLondon's East End gathered to prevent Oswald Mosley and his British\nUnion of Fascists from marching through their neighborhood. This clash\nwould eventually be known as the Battle of Cable Street: protesters\nformed a blockade and beat back some three thousand Fascist Black Shirts\nand six thousand police officers. To stop the march, the protesters\nexploded homemade bombs, threw marbles at the feet of police horses, and\nturned over a burning lorry. They rained down a fusillade of projectiles\non the marchers and the police attempting to protect them: rocks,\nbrickbats, shaken-up lemonade bottles, and the contents of chamber pots.\nMosley and his men were forced to retreat.\n\nIn \" Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook ,\" published last week by Melville House, the historian Mark Bray presents the Battle of Cable Street as a\npotent symbol of how to stop Fascism: a strong, unified coalition\noutnumbered and humiliated Fascists to such an extent that their\nmovement fizzled. For many members of contemporary anti-Fascist groups,\nthe incident remains central to their mythology, a kind of North Star in\nthe fight against Fascism and white supremacy across Europe and,\nincreasingly, the United States. According to Bray, Antifa (pronounced\nan- tee -fah) \"can variously be described as a kind of ideology, an\nidentity, a tendency or milieu, or an activity of self-defense.\" It's a\nleaderless, horizontal movement whose roots lie in various leftist\ncauses-Communism, anarchism, Socialism, anti-racism. The movement's\nprofile has surged since Antifa activists engaged in a wave of property\ndestruction during Donald Trump's Inauguration -when one masked figure\nfamously punched the white supremacist Richard Spencer in the face-and\nahead of a planned appearance, in February, by Milo Yiannopoulos at the University of California, Berkeley , which was cancelled. At the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville , Virginia, a number of Antifa activists, carrying sticks, blocked entrances to Emancipation Park,\nwhere white supremacists planned to gather. Fights broke out; some Antifa activists reportedly sprayed chemicals and threw paint-filled balloons .\nMultiple clergy members credited activists with saving their lives .\nFox News reported that a White House petition urging that Antifa be\nlabelled a terrorist organization had received more than a hundred thousand signatures .\n\nBray's book is many things: the first English-language transnational\nhistory of Antifa, a how-to for would-be activists, and a record of\nadvice from anti-Fascist organizers past and present-a project that he\ncalls \"history, politics, and theory on the run.\" Antifa activists don't\noften speak to the media, but Bray is a former Occupy Wall Street\norganizer and an avowed leftist; he has intimate access to his subjects,\nif not much critical distance from them. Especially in later chapters of\nthe book, that access helps him to provide an unusually informed account\nof how Antifa members conceptualize their disruptive and sometimes\nviolent methods.\n\nMany liberals who are broadly sympathetic to the goals of Antifa\ncriticize the movement for its illiberal tactics. In the latest issue of The Atlantic , Peter Beinart, citing a series of incidents in Portland,\nOregon, writes, \"The people preventing Republicans from safely\nassembling on the streets of Portland may consider themselves fierce\nopponents of the authoritarianism growing on the American right. In\ntruth, however, they are its unlikeliest allies.\" (Beinart's piece is\nheadlined \" The Rise of the Violent Left .\")\nAccording to Bray, though, Antifa activists believe that Fascists\nforfeit their rights to speak and assemble when they deny those same\nrights to others through violence and intimidation. For instance, last\nweek, the North Dakota newspaper The Forum published a letter from\nPearce Tefft in which he recalled a chilling exchange about free speech with his son, Peter, shortly before Peter headed to the rally in\nCharlottesville. \"The thing about us fascists is, it's not that we don't\nbelieve in freedom of speech,\" the younger Tefft reportedly said to his\nfather. \"You can say whatever you want. We'll just throw you in an\noven.\"\n\nFor Bray and his subjects, the horror of this history and the threat of\nits return demands that citizens, in the absence of state suppression of\nFascism, take action themselves. Bray notes that state-based protections\nfailed in Italy and Germany, where Fascists were able to take over\ngovernments through legal rather than revolutionary means-much as the\nalt-right frames its activities as a defense of free speech, Fascists\nwere able to spread their ideology under the aegis of liberal tolerance.\nAntifa does not abide by John Milton's dictum that, \"in a free and open\nencounter,\" truthful ideas will prevail. \"After Auschwitz and\nTreblinka,\" Bray writes, \"anti-fascists committed themselves to fighting\nto the death the ability of organized Nazis to say anything.\"\n\nPart of Antifa's mission is to establish, as Bray puts it, \"the\nhistorical continuity between different eras of far-right violence and\nthe many forms of collective self-defense that it has necessitated\nacross the globe over the past century.\" To this end, the first half of\nhis book is a somewhat rushed history of anti-Fascist groups. The\nprogenitors of Antifa, in this account, were the German and Italian\nleftists who, following the First World War, banded together to fight\nproto-Fascist gangs. In Italy, these leftists gathered under the banner\nof Arditi del Popolo (\"the People's Daring Ones\"), while in Weimar\nGermany, groups like Antifaschistische Aktion, from which Antifa takes\nits name, evolved from paramilitary factions of existing political\nparties. Bray moves swiftly to the failure of anti-Fascists in the\nSpanish Civil War, then races through the second half of the twentieth\ncentury. In the late seventies, the punk and hardcore scenes became the\nprimary sites of open conflict between leftists and neo-Nazis; that\nmilieu prefigures much of the style and strategy now associated with the\nanti-Fascist movement. In the Netherlands and Germany, a group of\nleftist squatters known as Autonomen pioneered the Black Bloc approach:\nwearing all-black outfits and masks to help participants evade\nprosecution and retaliation. Bray reaches the present with his\ndescription of \"Pinstripe Fascists,\" such as Geert Wilders , and the rise of new far-right parties and groups in both Europe and America. The book\nflits between countries and across decades; analysis is sparse. The\nmessage is that Antifa will fight Fascists wherever they appear, and by\nany means necessary.\n\nThe book's later chapters, such as \"Five Historical Lessons for\nAnti-Fascists\" and \" 'So Much for the Tolerant Left!': 'No Platform' and\nFree Speech,\" which are adapted from essays published elsewhere, are\nmore focussed and persuasive. Here Bray explicitly deals with the\nphilosophical and practical problems of Antifa: violence versus\nnonviolence; mass movements versus militancy; choosing targets and\nchanging tactics. Bray concedes that the practice of disrupting Fascist\nrallies and events could be construed as a violation of the right to free speech and assembly -but he contends that such protections are meant\nto prevent the government from arresting citizens, not to prevent\ncitizens from disrupting one another's speech. Speech is already\ncurtailed in the U.S. by laws related to \"obscenity, incitement to\nviolence, copyright infringement, press censorship during wartime,\" and\n\"restrictions for the incarcerated,\" Bray points out. Why not add one\nmore restriction-curtailing hate speech-as many European democracies do?\nAs for the slippery-slopists, afraid that Antifa will begin with\nFascists and eventually attack anybody who opposes them, Bray maintains\nthat the historical record does not support this fear: anti-Fascists who\nhave shut down local hate groups, as in Denmark, usually go dark\nthemselves, or turn their attention to other political projects, rather\nthan finding new enemies to fight. (In his Atlantic piece, Beinart\nnotes, \"When fascism withered after World War II, antifa did too.\")\n\nViolence, Bray insists, is not the preferred method for past or present Antifa-but it is definitely on the table. He quotes a Baltimore-based\nactivist who goes by the name Murray to explain the movement's outlook:\n\nYou fight them by writing letters and making phone calls so you don't\nhave to fight them with fists. You fight them with fists so you don't\nhave to fight them with knives. You fight them with knives so you\ndon't have to fight them with guns. You fight them with guns so you\ndon't have to fight them with tanks.\n\nThere is a moral logic to this notion of anticipatory self-defense, but\nthe progression, from writing letters to fighting with guns, is\nworrisome nonetheless. Right-wing militiamen in Charlottesville made a\npoint of displaying force , and this was reportedly \"unnerving to law\nenforcement officials on the scene.\" Should anti-Fascists start toting\nAR-15s, like the right-wing Oathkeepers? The idea can seem naïve in an\nAmerican context, where, practically speaking, only white people can\ncarry guns openly without fear of police interference . Bray mentions a few pro-gun Antifa groups, including the Huey P. Newton\nGun Club, and a collective with the punning moniker Trigger Warning; he\nquibbles with liberal scholars, including Erica Chenoweth and Maria J.\nStephan, who dismiss violent protest as an ineffective tool for\ngarnering public support. But it is unclear from the book whether he\nthinks that brandishing guns is an ethical concern as well as a tactical\none, or whether he worries about an escalation of violence. Postwar Antifa, as Bray details in earlier chapters, has largely been a European\nproject, in which opposing sides sometimes beat each other senseless and\nstabbed one another to death. They didn't have assault rifles. The\nBattle of Cable Street was fought with rocks and paving stones.\n\nWhat were the effects of Cable Street, exactly? Scholars continue to\ndebate the showdown's consequences. After the battle, Mosley, like\npresent-day Fascists, was able to cast himself in the role of a\nlaw-abiding victim assaulted by immigrant hordes. In the months\nfollowing, Fascist youth attacked London's Jewish residents and\nbusinesses in what became known as the Mile End Pogrom , and the British Union of Fascists did better at the polls in 1937 than they had in years prior. Bray argues that such results do not\nundermine the legacy of the incident, because it radicalized and\ngalvanized a community, which continued to fight Fascists in Britain\nthrough the buildup to the war and beyond, and whose efforts were\nlargely successful.\n\nIn the British press, at least, Cable Street has been referenced repeatedly in coverage of the protests and the terrorism in Charlottesville , an event that has forced a discussion of what to do when far-right extremists come to your town. Bray, for his part, believes that one can\npractice \"everyday anti-fascism\" by confronting bigots in nonviolent\nways, \"from calling them out, to boycotting their business, to shaming\nthem for their oppressive beliefs, to ending a friendship unless someone\nshapes up.\" The point, as he sees it, is to shut down Fascists not just\nin the street but in every interaction. \"An anti-fascist outlook has no\ntolerance for 'intolerance.' \" he writes. \"It will not 'agree to\ndisagree.' \"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "In the Streets with Antifa\n\nShortly after noon on September 26th, about fifteen hundred antifascists gathered on the lawn of Peninsula Park, in Portland, Oregon. Some wore black bloc-the monochromatic clothing that renders militant activists anonymous to law enforcement-but the event was family-friendly, and most attendees had dressed accordingly. Booths set up in a leafy grove offered herbal teas and tinctures, arts and crafts, condoms and morning-after pills, radical zines, organic vegetables. Above a stage, a banner read \" EVERYDAY ANTIFASCIST / COME FOR THE ANARCHY / STAY FOR THE SOUP .\" In July, President Donald Trump had claimed, without evidence, that anarchists were throwing soup cans at police during demonstrations for racial justice. When the anarchists were arrested, he explained, \"they say, 'No, this is soup for my family.' \" Inevitably, \"soup for my family\" became a tongue-in-cheek slogan at Portland protests.\n\nOther Presidential statements have been harder to make light of. Throughout the nationwide upheaval set in motion by the police killing of George Floyd , in Minneapolis, on May 25th, Trump has vilified demonstrators as nefarious insurrectionists. Much as adversaries of the civil-rights movement once contended that it had been infiltrated by Communists, he invokes antifascists, or Antifa, to delegitimatize Black Lives Matter . A week after Floyd's death, as popular uprisings spread from Minneapolis to other cities, the President declared, \"Our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, Antifa, and others.\" As the election nears, he has portrayed Antifa as a grave security threat that the Democrats and their Presidential nominee, Joe Biden , will let destroy the country. During the first debate, after Biden noted that Trump's F.B.I. director, Chris Wray, had described Antifa as \"more of an ideology or a movement than an organization,\" Trump scoffed, \"You gotta be kidding me.\" He told Biden, \"They'll overthrow you in two seconds.\"\n\nSuch dire warnings are wildly disconnected from reality. Most Americans who identify as antifascists don't belong to any particular group, and there is no national Antifa hierarchy or leadership. To date, one American has been killed by someone professing an antifascist agenda; right-wing extremists, by comparison, have been responsible for more than three hundred and twenty deaths in the past quarter century. The only known plot to \"overthrow\" the government in recent months was hatched by right-wing militia members, who, according to the F.B.I., planned to kidnap Michigan's Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer . In June, I stood next to the alleged ringleader, Adam Fox, during a rally at Michigan's capitol , while a speaker yelled, \"We are here demanding peace as these terrorist organizations want to burn down our cities!\" Fox carried an assault rifle and wore an ammo vest with a patch that said, \" Si vis pacem, para bellum \": \"If you want peace, prepare for war.\"\n\nIt is true that, in response to such right-wing events, some leftists have mobilized under the name Antifa, following a tradition with specific principles, among them a willingness to engage in violence. The first speaker at Peninsula Park, a Black activist and hip-hop artist named Mic Crenshaw, was one of the progenitors of this tradition. At fifty years old, he had at least a couple of decades on most people in the crowd. Wearing sunglasses, a backward baseball cap, and a bulletproof vest over a plaid flannel shirt, Crenshaw said, \"I used to tell people our motto was 'We go where they go.' And there's a lot of courageous people out here doing the same thing today.\" He patted his flak jacket. \"I never thought, thirty years ago, I'd be standing up here with one of these things on.\"\n\nCrenshaw grew up in Minneapolis, where, as a teen-ager, he became fascinated by the city's nascent hardcore-punk scene. \"I would ride through uptown and see the kids with their cool haircuts and studded jackets,\" he recalled when I visited him at his home, in Portland, a few weeks before the Peninsula Park event. In 1986, as a high-school junior, Crenshaw joined with six peers-five of them white and one Native American-to start a skinhead crew called the Baldies. They shaved their heads, found flight jackets at an Army-surplus store, and ordered Doc Martens from catalogues. The British skinheads whom the Baldies emulated were influenced by Jamaican-immigrant culture, and believed in multiethnic solidarity. \"We were trying to become the Minneapolis version,\" Crenshaw said.\n\nBut punk music also appealed to neo-Nazis. Soon after the Baldies formed, a gang called the White Knights began harassing people of color in Minneapolis. Crenshaw threw a piece of concrete through the window of a White Knight leader's house. \"That was the jump-off,\" he told me. The act precipitated a \"protracted period of street violence\": weekly brawls with bats, chains, pipes, knives, brass knuckles, and pepper spray. \"Luckily, no one died,\" Crenshaw said. \"People were definitely going to the hospital, though.\"\n\nThe Baldies made pacts with militant leftists and gravitated toward anarchist tenets of mutual aid and community defense. Crenshaw was drawn to Communism. He said of the Baldies, \"Our politics emerged from our survival-based organizing.\" Another former Baldie told me, \"Although many of us were interested in reading theory, what was driving our action wasn't adherence to a particular ideology-it was meeting the threat as it needed to be met. It was very practical .\" For Crenshaw, it was existential: \"As a Black kid, I was fighting against people who wanted to kill me.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nOne hub for young radicals in Minneapolis was Backroom Anarchist Books, which sold revolutionary European newspapers like Class War . From these periodicals, the Baldies learned about Anti-Fascist Action, a British organization dedicated to physically confronting racists and anti-Semites. Anti-Fascist Action had revived a legacy in England stretching back to the thirties, when Londoners prevented Oswald Mosley and his British Union of Fascists from publicly assembling. The Baldies effectively chased the White Knights out of Minneapolis, and then resolved to expand their crusade against white supremacy beyond the skinhead subculture. In 1987, they established Anti-Racist Action, or A.R.A., and began recruiting skaters, college students, and Black and Latino gang members. Explaining A.R.A.'s decision to tweak the British name, Crenshaw told me, \"To us, the word 'fascist' sounded too academic. But everybody knew what a racist was.\"\n\nAfter high school, Crenshaw and his friends followed punk tours around the country, setting up A.R.A. chapters. In 1991, the group convened its first national conference, in Portland. The city had been a center of white-supremacist organizing since the seventies, when Posse Comitatus-a virulently racist and anti-Semitic paramilitary movement-was launched there. The Aryan Nations, a hate group in neighboring Idaho, sponsored neo-Nazis in Oregon who talked of turning the region into an all-white ethno-state. Before the A.R.A. conference, an Ethiopian immigrant in Portland was beaten to death by three acolytes of a group called White Aryan Resistance, or WAR . \"Portland was in the national spotlight as a hotbed of racism,\" Crenshaw said. \"We wanted to let our presence be felt, and say, 'We're not gonna stand for that.' \"\n\nWAR and the Aryan Nations were eventually crippled by civil lawsuits, and, as other avowed white-supremacist outfits also receded, A.R.A. membership dwindled. When Crenshaw moved to Portland, a year after the conference, he stepped away as well, focussing instead on music and teaching. Both A.R.A. and the Baldies consisted largely of white people fighting white racism in white spaces, and, he told me, \"I couldn't do that anymore.\"\n\nIn 2007, neo-Nazis attempting to reinvigorate the vestiges of WAR planned to hold a white-power music festival near Portland. Former A.R.A. members helped local residents pressure the host venue to pull out. Half a dozen of these activists, sensing a need for renewed vigilance, created Rose City Antifa-the first official antifascist organization in America. For Crenshaw, the evolution of A.R.A. into Rose City Antifa, combined with Portland's centrality in the national protest movement that began in Minneapolis this May, shows that \"the two cities are linked in a continuum of antifascist consciousness.\"\n\nIn mid-September, I met with two current members of Rose City Antifa, Sophie and Morgan, in another Portland park. (Asking for anonymity, they used pseudonyms.) Sophie, who is transgender, explained that \"some of the A.R.A. groups were pretty strongly in a world of toxic masculinity,\" but Rose City Antifa has always had \"a strong feminist and queer component.\" A number of its founders were women. Morgan, who identifies as a butch lesbian, said that Rose City Antifa adopted a more nuanced approach: \"A.R.A. was street-level confrontation with white-supremacist gangs. We wanted to broaden the scope to encompass more activities that we saw as fascist threats.\"\n\nSuch threats proliferated during the next eight years. The election of President Barack Obama galvanized the so-called Patriot Movement, composed of hundreds of far-right groups and armed militias hostile to Muslims, immigrants, and the L.G.B.T.Q. community. Though the Patriot Movement was seldom explicitly racist or anti-Semitic, it depicted the federal government as corrupted by un-American forces inimical to white Christians-a resurrection of the Posse Comitatus world view. Despite this troubling ferment, antifascism remained a backwater of leftist activism throughout the Obama Administration, as progressives focussed on the rise of the Patriot Movement's political analogue: the Tea Party.\n\nThen came Donald Trump, buoyed by a wave of white nationalism calling itself the alt-right. In 2017, many Americans were stunned when throngs of white supremacists carried torches and Nazi flags through Charlottesville , Virginia, chanting \"Blood and soil!\" and \"Jews will not replace us!\" Antifascists, however, were prepared. Hundreds of them travelled to Charlottesville, in fidelity to the \"We go where they go\" credo. Clashes culminated in a neo-Nazi plowing his car through a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a woman. The former K.K.K. Grand Wizard David Duke told a reporter, \"We are determined to take our country back. We're going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump.\" Later, Trump said that there had been \"very fine people on both sides\" in Charlottesville. Duke praised his \"honesty\" and \"courage.\"\n\nAt Peninsula Park, Mic Crenshaw told his audience that \"across-the-board collusion\" between the U.S. government and white supremacists was nothing new. In the past, however, \"they used to try to lie and cover shit up.\" Under Trump, the alliance was on display with \"unprecedented transparency.\" Now, Crenshaw said, \"the question is, How are we going to protect ourselves?\"\n\nIn 2016, Rose City Antifa joined the Torch Antifa Network, which included former A.R.A. chapters from Illinois, California, and Texas. There are now ten Torch affiliates, which share a commitment to disrupting far-right organizing. According to Rose City Antifa, although affiliates occasionally exchange information and advice, there is little practical collaboration.\n\nThe network focusses much of its energy on Internet activism: doing research online, identifying proponents of bigotry, and then publicly exposing-or \"doxing\"-them. Rose City Antifa spent part of its early years doxing people involved with Volksfront, an international racist gang headquartered in Portland. Whereas A.R.A. would have hunted Volksfront members in the streets, Rose City Antifa publicized their activities to employers, neighbors, and relatives. In 2012, Volksfront's U.S. chapters disbanded.\n\nRose City Antifa doesn't disclose how many members it has, but Sophie estimated that doxing investigations take up about a hundred hours per week. Reports on individuals, Sophie said, must meet rigorous standards: \"We do what we can to make it an undeniable fact that the people we are doxing are tied explicitly to violent rhetoric or acts of violence. As muddied as the lines are right now, we don't want to go after someone for wearing a MAGA hat.\"\n\nWhenever people deemed worthy of doxing hold gatherings in public spaces, antifascists undertake to shut them down. \"Research and action go hand in hand,\" Morgan said. In \" Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook \" (2017), the scholar and activist Mark Bray writes that, after the Second World War, Jewish veterans created the 43 Group, which stormed fascist assemblies with the aim of knocking over the speakers' platform. Though conservatives and liberals alike now criticize \"no-platforming\" as a violation of free speech, antifascists take the 43 Group's view that incipient fascism tends to metastasize if left unchecked; given that fascist movements ultimately aspire to mass oppression, or even genocide, they must be stifled early.\n\nIn the U.S., no-platforming campaigns have roiled college campuses. Three years ago, when the right-wing polemicist and Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos was invited to address Republican students at the University of California, Berkeley, antifascists besieged the venue, breaking windows and lighting fires. The speech was cancelled. Shane Burley, a Portland native and the author of \" Fascism Today: What It Is and How to End It \" (2017), told me that many Americans recoil from such modern incarnations of no-platforming because \"it has been extended to people who aren't consensus Nazis-people who not everybody agrees deserve to be hit.\" But Burley argues that antifascists are hardly to blame for this: \"It's the Trump effect. Nazi rallies have merged with the Republican base, and now they're in the same space together.\"\n\nSuch merging is particularly common, Burley and other antifascists say, in the Pacific Northwest. During the lead-up to the 2016 election, Joey Gibson, a thirty-six-year-old house-flipper in Vancouver, Washington, founded the Christian pro-Trump movement Patriot Prayer. A former high-school football coach, Gibson has an athletic build often accentuated by T-shirts that display his many tattoos, including one of a Spartan helmet and the words \" WARRIORS FOR FREEDOM .\" In a recent phone interview, he told me that he started Patriot Prayer because he felt that his political values had become taboo. He wanted to venture into \"the hardest cities to voice your opinion in as a conservative\": places like Berkeley, San Francisco, and-just across the Columbia River from Vancouver-Portland. Gibson carefully avoids endorsing violence or espousing racism; his mother is Japanese, and Patriot Prayer has attracted some people of color. But it has also attracted white supremacists and members of known hate groups. According to Rose City Antifa, which has identified dozens of these individuals at Patriot Prayer events, and published evidence of their allegiances online-from screenshots of racist Facebook screeds to photographs of swastika patches-Gibson offers neo-Nazis cover and provides them with a fertile recruiting ground. Another member of Rose City Antifa, who goes by Ace, said, \"The umbrella is broad enough to encompass a huge portion of the reactionary radical right, up to and including neo-Nazis, and that's why these rallies become such incredible spaces for radicalization.\" (Gibson has stressed that Patriot Prayer is a movement without members, and denies that it condones violence or white supremacy.)\n\nAround the time that Gibson launched Patriot Prayer, Gavin McInnes, a co-founder of Vice Media, created the Proud Boys, in New York. McInnes has called the Proud Boys a \"gang\" of \"Western chauvinists\"; the F.B.I. classifies it as an \"extremist group with ties to white nationalism.\" A former Proud Boy organized the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville-and called the woman who was killed there \"a fat, disgusting Communist.\" The Proud Boys have been banned from Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, but their account on Parler-a social network catering to conservatives-has nearly seventy thousand followers. Unlike Gibson, McInnes has openly celebrated violence against the left. In 2016, when a handful of Patriot Prayer supporters formed a Vancouver chapter of the Proud Boys, they became the muscle at Gibson's events.\n\nDuring a Patriot Prayer rally held in Portland in April, 2017-billed by Gibson as the March for Free Speech-a thirty-five-year-old man named Jeremy Christian was filmed barking racial slurs and wielding a bat. (He was subsequently ejected from the march.) Four weeks later, Christian boarded a train in Portland and accosted two Black teen-age girls, one of whom was Muslim and wore a hijab. When three men intervened, Christian fatally stabbed two of them. He was later arrested, and at his arraignment he screamed, \"Get out if you don't like free speech!,\" and \"You call it terrorism, I call it patriotism!\" The murders took place amid a historic national surge in anti-Muslim hate crimes, which Trump's critics linked to his pattern of Islamophobic rhetoric (such as when he called for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\"). Nine days after the killings, Gibson led a Trump Free Speech Rally in Portland, which was heavily attended by Patriot Movement militias. Although Gibson disavowed Christian and presided over a moment of silence for his victims, he then introduced a speaker who recounted-to raucous applause-having recently \"cracked the skulls of some Commies.\"\n\nPatriot Prayer and the Proud Boys began regularly descending on Portland, where altercations with Rose City Antifa counter-protesters were virtually guaranteed. Chaotic fistfights became recurrent events downtown. The purported reasons for Gibson's rallies varied-\"Him Too,\" \"Gibson for Senate\"-but Morgan, the Rose City Antifa member, said, \"What they're really coming for is a fight. They're coming with weapons, hyped up and ready to throw down with whoever confronts them.\"\n\nAntifascist doctrine does not allow for avoiding such confrontations: \"They will not pass\" is another precept, deriving from the Spanish Civil War. But, in the summer of 2018, several activists in Portland created a new organization-PopMob, short for Popular Mobilization-which aimed to enlist a more diverse, and less militant, league of protesters to counter Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys. Whereas Rose City Antifa has strict vetting protocols for new members, Effie Baum, a co-founder of PopMob, told me, \"Everybody is welcome under our tent, except cops and fascists.\" PopMob promotes what Baum calls \"everyday antifascism,\" not as an alternative but as a complement to front-line combatants in black bloc. \"If you're gonna punch a Nazi, punch a Nazi,\" Baum said. \"If you're gonna stand in the back with a sign that says 'Love Trumps Hate,' there's room for both of us.\"\n\nThe feud reached a head this summer, on August 29th, when hundreds of Trump supporters met in the parking lot of a suburban shopping mall, then drove into Portland together. The route was announced just before the caravan's departure, to stymie protesters. That afternoon, I interviewed Shane Burley at a bar on the east side of town; after leaving the bar, I pulled onto a road full of honking cars and trucks bedecked with huge American flags and \"Trump 2020\" banners. I followed the caravan out of the city, not realizing that dozens of drivers had broken off and headed downtown, where local residents shouted obscenities at them and threw water bottles. Some of the Trump supporters fired paintball guns and pepper spray from their vehicles; others got out and assaulted protesters.\n\nIt was dark when I arrived downtown. As I parked on a wide avenue in the shopping district, several people in black bloc sprinted by. Turning a corner, I came upon a small crowd facing a police cordon. Behind the officers, a dead body lay in a pool of light.\n\nThe victim was Aaron Danielson, a thirty-nine-year-old supporter of Patriot Prayer. He'd been shot by Michael Reinoehl, a forty-eight-year-old white man who-though unaffiliated with Rose City Antifa or PopMob-once wrote on Instagram, \"I am 100% ANTIFA all the way!\" Reinoehl later claimed that he had fired in self-defense, and a cannister of bear spray and a telescopic truncheon were found on Danielson. At the time, however, nobody in the crowd knew what had happened or who was involved.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" I heard someone say. A man in black bloc, his face concealed behind a balaclava and ski goggles, was addressing a man with a trimmed beard, wraparound sunglasses, and a baseball hat emblazoned with the name Loren Culp-the Republican gubernatorial candidate for Washington. He also wore a hooded sweatshirt that said \"Patriot Prayer.\"\n\n\"It's Joey Gibson!\" someone said.\n\nGibson later told me that he and Danielson had driven into Portland in the same truck. After following the pro-Trump caravan back to the shopping mall, they received messages about the skirmishes downtown, and, separately, they returned to the city. Gibson had happened on the crime scene accidentally, and he had no idea that the corpse thirty feet away was Danielson's.\n\nAnother man in black bloc told Gibson that he'd heard the victim had been murdered by a Proud Boy. This seemed to be the crowd's prevailing assumption, though neither Antifa nor the Proud Boys had killed anybody before. Affecting a casual posture, Gibson waved dismissively and said, \"That's what they always be yelling and screaming about-'Some white supremacist killed someone tonight.' They say that shit all the time.\"\n\n\"Because you bring white supremacists to town all the time,\" someone said.\n\nLink copied\n\n\"I'm brown,\" Gibson responded. He rolled up his sleeve and showed his skin tone.\n\nPeople pressed around Gibson, shouting at him to leave. When he asked, \"Why don't you guys stop acting like Nazis?,\" a man in a Young Turks sweatshirt spit in his face.\n\n\"Can we stop with the hate?\" Gibson said, making no move to wipe off the saliva.\n\nProtesters continued to arrive, and, as the volume and ferocity of their insults escalated, Gibson turned to a blond woman who'd been standing at his side and said, \"Let's go.\" A mob of at least fifty young people pursued them. Gibson kept up a show of equanimity until his hat and glasses were snatched away. Soon, drinks were emptied on him, objects were hurled at him, eggs were smashed on him, and he was punched and pepper-sprayed. With the blond woman's help, he stumbled forward while someone rang a cowbell in his ears and others strobed flashlights in his eyes.\n\n\"Kill the Nazi!\" someone screamed.\n\nThe mob grew. As far as I could tell, all of Gibson's assailants were white. At some point, several people pushed their way to Gibson and escorted him down the street, keeping at bay the most belligerent aggressors. A short Asian man in a bicycle helmet yelled, \"Let him leave, goddammit! Everyone back the fuck off!\"\n\nAfter several blocks, Gibson and the woman ducked into a gas station, and an employee locked the door behind them. The man in the bicycle helmet blocked the entrance, but people smashed the windows and kicked open a side door. Another protester raised his gas mask and pleaded, \"He's a fucking Nazi, but are you going to lynch him?\"\n\nThe police arrived, and the protesters fled. Gibson vomited in the bathroom, washed the pepper spray from his eyes, and called a friend to pick him up. A reporter looking to identify the shooting victim texted Gibson a photograph of medics treating Danielson. \"I recognized him right away,\" he said.\n\nAfter the crowd dispersed, I found the man in the bicycle helmet at a nearby 7-Eleven. His name was Rico De Vera, and he was a twenty-seven-year-old Filipino-American who studied engineering at Portland Community College. Earlier that day, a Trump supporter had shot him in the face with a paintball gun; the flesh around his left eye was stained neon pink. De Vera had been regularly participating in Black Lives Matter protests since May. Although he remained enthusiastic about the movement, he worried that in Portland it had been subsumed by the city's militant antifascist culture, which he saw as violent and white. \"It pisses me off,\" he said. \"People are going to use tonight to say that Black Lives Matter is a bunch of thugs.\"\n\nWe walked a few blocks to a park outside the Multnomah County Justice Center, where people had congregated by a perimeter of concrete barriers and metal fencing. This was where most of the Patriot Prayer rallies and Antifa counter-protests had taken place; more recently, it had become a locus for Black Lives Matter demonstrations. In June, huge crowds had lobbed fireworks, bottles, and other projectiles at the Justice Center, a fortresslike monolith that contains the Portland police headquarters and the county jail. On June 26th, Trump called for the deployment of federal agents to protect government property throughout the country from \"left-wing extremists.\" The Justice Center stands beside a U.S. District courthouse, and in July more than a hundred employees of the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Marshals Service arrived in Portland, ostensibly to protect the federal building. A U.S. marshal shot a twenty-six-year-old protester in the head with an impact munition, fracturing his skull; the protester had merely been holding up a boom box with both hands. Such excessive force drew larger and larger crowds to the courthouse until Chad Wolf, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security, began to relinquish responsibility to the Oregon State Police, in late July.\n\nNow a young woman with a megaphone told the people at the Justice Center that she had an announcement. \"I just got word that the person who died was a Patriot Prayer person,\" she said. \"He was a fucking Nazi. Our community held its own and took out the trash. . . . I am not sad that a fucking fascist died tonight.\"\n\nEveryone cheered.\n\nAlthough years of antifascist activism in Portland have likely contributed to the extraordinary staying power of its Black Lives Matter movement, white antifascists insist that they've played no role in organizing racial-justice protests. Sophie, of Rose City Antifa, said, \"We don't feel like, as a group, we should be taking away space from people who have dedicated their lives to this.\" However, Sophie added, \"we are fully supportive, and many of us attend as individuals.\" Effie Baum, the PopMob co-founder, similarly told me, \"We've been really intentional about not taking the lead on stuff that's been happening since George Floyd was murdered.\" One reason for this, Baum explained, was that \"we're a mostly white organization.\"\n\nPortland, whose population is six per cent Black, is the whitest big city in America. The historian Walidah Imarisha traces the origin of these demographics to the founding of Oregon, which settlers envisaged as a \"white utopia.\" When Oregon joined the union, in 1859, it became the only state with an outright ban on Black people. Later, redlining policies and urban-renewal projects displaced many African-Americans, a process reprised by more recent waves of gentrification.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Portland are resolutely non-hierarchical; as a rule, however, white protesters defer to their Black and brown peers, who are usually the only people to use megaphones, deliver speeches, and lead marches. Since the federal withdrawal from the Justice Center, the protests have targeted the Portland police with nightly \"direct actions.\" Every day, a message circulates on social media announcing a rendezvous point (usually a park); from there, protesters depart to a nearby destination (usually a precinct house). A diffuse, anonymous network, communicating on encrypted messaging apps, chooses these locations. Although Fox News and the Trump Administration characterize Portland as an apocalyptic war zone, some direct actions attract fewer than a hundred people, and even on well-attended nights their impact is undetectable beyond a few square blocks.\n\nStill, property destruction does occur, and, because the vast majority of protesters are white, this has been a source of tension with some residents of color. In June, after rioting damaged several businesses along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, in a traditionally African-American neighborhood in North Portland, a consortium of Black community leaders held a press conference to condemn the vandalism. J. W. Matt Hennessee, the pastor of Vancouver Avenue First Baptist Church, told white protesters, \"Get your knee off our neck. That is what you are doing when you do stuff like this.\" Ron Herndon, who led civil-rights campaigns in Portland during the eighties, called the vandals \"demented\" and said, \"Go back to whatever hole you came from. You are not helping us.\" On the weekend of Columbus Day, which Portland recognizes as Indigenous Peoples Day, protesters toppled a statue of Abraham Lincoln, shot through the windows of a restaurant owned by a Black veteran, and broke into the Oregon Historical Society, where they inexplicably stole a celebrated quilt commemorating African-American heritage, stitched by fifteen Black women in the nineteen-seventies. (Police found the quilt lying in the rain a few blocks away, slightly damaged.) The leaders of thirty Native American groups released a statement comparing the conduct to \"the brutish ways of our colonizers.\"\n\nTwo days after Aaron Danielson was killed, I joined a few hundred protesters outside a luxury building where Ted Wheeler, Portland's Democratic mayor, owns an apartment. In Portland, the mayor serves as the commissioner of the police bureau, which protesters are determined to see defunded. As a picnic table from a restaurant was dragged into the street and set on fire, I spotted Najee Gow, a twenty-three-year-old Black nurse, leading chants of \"Fuck Ted Wheeler!\" I'd met Gow the previous week, when several young women had staged a sit-in in Wheeler's lobby. Gow, who wore a peacoat over a red-white-and-blue tank top, had been incensed that no African-Americans were included in the demonstration. \"It's what they've always done,\" he'd said. \"Hijack Black people's movements. This is disgusting.\"\n\nAs I spoke with Gow near the burning table, we were interrupted by shattering glass. A young white man in black bloc was swinging a baseball bat into the window of a dentist's office on the ground floor of Wheeler's building. \"That makes me want to beat them up,\" Gow said. Like Rico De Vera, he felt that such behavior benefitted only those who wanted to malign Black Lives Matter, and he also worried that it bred general animosity toward Black people: \"They're putting Black lives at risk. African-Americans are constantly out here telling them to stop, but they won't. So, at the end of the day, it's, like, 'Are you racist?' \"\n\nA white man with a hammer joined the guy with the bat, and together they breached the office. People entered. A loud explosion echoed from inside, followed by smoke and flames. Gow went over to challenge them. While they argued, a blond woman in a hoodie ran up and spray-painted an arrow on the wall, pointing to the broken window. She then scrawled, \"This is the language of the unheard.\"\n\nIn \"Fascism Today,\" Shane Burley writes that antifascism is often practiced \"as part of a larger revolutionary struggle.\" Many of the white protesters in Portland subscribe to a radical political agenda. At one direct action, I met half a dozen antifascists in their early twenties who called themselves the Comrade Collective. They all had on black bloc, and several carried small rubber pigs that squealed when squeezed. Each had adopted a nickname. Firefly, a self-described Marxist-Leninist, told me, \"It's more than just Black Lives Matter. We believe that racism is built into capitalism, and we want to destroy the system of oppression.\"\n\nSpinch, whose mouth was covered with a blue bandanna, said, \"It often gets boiled down to 'Capitalism is the problem.' Which, like, yes. But also colonialism.\" Spinch had been protesting since May, and the experience had been formative: \"I'm objectively very young, and haven't been an autonomous adult for very long, so this is my first real foray into dedicated activism. I got tear-gassed my first night out here. If that doesn't radicalize you, I don't know what will.\"\n\nA comrade named Brat added that the pandemic had revealed the alarming depth of the government's ineptitude. \"Before COVID , I was trying to get more involved in local politics,\" Brat said. \"Now I sort of feel like that's a dead end.\"\n\n\"I was gonna run for City Council!\" Spinch said. \"But there's no point. The system is fucked.\"\n\nI asked what the alternative was.\n\n\"Anarchism.\"\n\n\"And one simple way to get us closer to that is defunding the police,\" Brat said.\n\nLink copied\n\nThe animating conviction that America's economic, governmental, and judicial institutions are irremediable distinguishes Portland protesters from others around the country. Many of them view inequality not as a failure of the system but as the status quo that the system was designed to preserve; accordingly, the only solution is to dismantle it entirely and build something new.\n\nIn Minneapolis, marchers chanted, \"No justice, no peace!\" In Portland, they cry, \"No cops! No prisons! Total abolition!\" Occasionally you hear \"Death to America!\" The night after Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, I accompanied a march to the Gus J. Solomon U.S. Courthouse, where protesters smashed the glass doors and cut down a flag that had been lowered to half-mast. The flag was brought to the police headquarters, doused with hand sanitizer, and set ablaze. On a boarded-up window, a white man in black bloc spray-painted, \" THE ONLY WAR IS CLASS WAR .\"\n\nPopular chants at the protests include \"A.C.A.B.-All Cops Are Bastards!\" and \"No good cops in a racist system!\" (The A.C.A.B. acronym was popularized by British punks in the eighties; when the Baldies emerged, in Minneapolis, they used it as a code word.) Polls indicate that a large majority of Americans of all races oppose abolishing police departments, and the absolutism of some activists has frustrated many advocates of police reform, including members of Black communities with high rates of violent crime. In Portland, however, months of bitter spats with authorities have bolstered abolitionists while sidelining-or converting-more moderate voices. Because the Portland Police Bureau relies largely on a specialized rapid-response team for crowd control, the same sixty-odd officers are invariably tasked with breaking up demonstrations. Team members no longer display their nametags-\"to reduce the risk of being doxed,\" according to a police spokesperson-but the protesters know who several of them are, and the animus on both sides feels deeply personal.\n\nThe rapid-response team was deployed at most of the direct actions I attended during four weeks in Portland. Nearly every time, an incident commander announced over a loudspeaker that the gathering had been declared a \"riot\" or an \"unlawful assembly.\" Certain nights, this came after vandalism or arson; other nights, protesters had simply impeded traffic. The rapid-response team then attempted to disperse the crowd with some combination of arrests, tear gas, stun grenades, and \"less lethal\" munitions-either solid-foam pellets or plastic capsules that burst on impact, releasing paint or a chemical irritant. A camper that had been converted into a makeshift ambulance supported a troop of medics embedded with the protesters. Although medics marked themselves with red tape, many had been injured, including one who was hit in the head with a tear-gas cannister, resulting in a traumatic brain injury.\n\nArrests by the rapid-response team often looked vindictive and gratuitously violent. I saw many officers tackle peaceful protesters and jab them with batons. They kneeled on necks and backs, stepped on faces, and sprayed mace into the eyes of compliant or restrained people. One night, I watched an officer chase an apparently random man, throw him down, straddle his chest, and repeatedly punch him in the face. Oregon Public Broadcasting later reported that the man, Tyler Cox, was a volunteer medic; after he was arrested, for \"assaulting an officer,\" Cox was admitted to the hospital where he works as a nurse. The incident is under investigation.\n\nProtesters equipped with cell phones and microphones scrupulously recorded abuse and posted footage of it on social media-and after a while this seemed to have become the primary objective. When I asked people to explain the purpose of the direct actions, a common response was that they forced officers to enact on camera behavior that they otherwise denied or concealed. Graphic evidence of police brutality, it was hoped, would win sympathy for the abolitionist cause. The focus on documentation might explain why people sometimes seemed intent on provoking the officers. Before the rapid-response team dispersed a demonstration, its members typically stood in tight formation, surveilling the crowd. Protesters, their voices raw with anger, would unleash a withering deluge of verbal harassment: \"Fuck you, piggies!\" \"Did you beat your wife last night?\" \"Stick it in your mouth and pull the trigger!\"\n\nOnce, a young white woman in a red tank top walked up and down a line of officers, pointing at each of them and shouting, \"Bitch!\" The officers-some of their riot gear colorfully splattered from previous volleys of paint-filled water balloons-gazed silently through their face shields. In July, a Black member of the rapid-response team, Jakhary Jackson, spoke out about his experience of the demonstrations. In a video released by the Portland Police Bureau, he claimed that white protesters had taunted him with racially charged insults, including \"You have the biggest nose I've ever seen!\" Jackson, who majored in history at Portland State University, said that it was galling to be attacked by protesters \"who have never experienced racism-who don't even know that the tactics they are using are the same tactics that were used against my people.\"\n\nOne mainstay at the demonstrations was a seventy-seven-year-old African-American man named Kent Ford. Easily identifiable in his backward flatcap and red suspenders, he always had an oil painting of Breonna Taylor with him. Holding the painting high above his head, he would march with long, determined strides. One rainy night, Ford wrapped the canvas in plastic bags; the next time I saw him, it was encased in Plexiglas. In 1969, Ford had opened a Portland chapter of the Black Panthers , and he likened the current direct actions to the multiracial Rainbow Coalition forged by Fred Hampton, the Panther leader.\n\n\"They're trying to get this back in the box,\" he told me. \"But it's not going back in the box, not this time.\"\n\n\"Where is it going?\" I asked.\n\n\"I can't tell you where. All I know is that the longer we stay out here the better off we are.\"\n\nThere is no other city in America where a Black man can march on behalf of victims of police violence seven nights a week and be surrounded by devoted allies. After half a century as an organizer, Ford appreciated the immense difficulty of movement-building. Logistical obstacles and internal discord inevitably sapped momentum. When Ford planned demonstrations for the Panthers, so much effort went into preparations that people were exhausted by the time they gathered. The resilience of the Portland protests was rare, and, in his view, isolated moments of ugliness hardly mattered. The direct actions brought leftists together, reinforcing their solidarity; for Ford and others, that was reason enough not to stop. The few times I mentioned detractors, Ford replied, \"The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on.\"\n\nThroughout history, disparate factions have become allies in the name of antifascism, and, in America, white radicals and Black liberation movements have often found common cause. Fifty years ago, Ford travelled to Oakland, California, to work security at the United Front Against Fascism, a conference organized by the Black Panthers and attended by thousands of Communists, feminists, labor organizers, and other militant leftists-the majority of them white. Mic Crenshaw, the former Baldie, is also a vocal advocate of \"broad coalition work, to create a critical mass of people who can fight together.\" The Black experience of oppression is unique, but Crenshaw believes that it should be understood as symptomatic of a system that hurts other groups as well, including the white working class. \"There has to be self-interest,\" he said, speaking about white allies.\n\nAs the sun set on September 5th, more than a thousand demonstrators gathered on the gently sloping greens of Ventura Park, in East Portland, to mark the hundredth consecutive day of protests. Lines formed at tents and tables where middle-aged supporters distributed free first-aid supplies, helmets, respirators, goggles, and earplugs. There were umbrellas for blocking less lethal munitions and traffic cones for snuffing tear-gas cannisters-tricks learned from Hong Kong activists . Two women pulled a wagon loaded with tall shields constructed from fifty-five-gallon plastic drums.\n\nAn African-American man with a keffiyeh draped over his head stepped onto a small stage. Mac Smiff, a thirty-nine-year-old hip-hop journalist with an instinct for rhetorical propulsion, was a frequent and favorite speaker at the protests. \"I don't care if you're Proud Boy or Patriot Prayer, and I sure don't give a fuck if you're a cop or a fed-you're all the same people,\" he told the crowd. \"They have different jobs and different roles in their revolution.\"\n\nWhen I met with him later, Smiff told me that, before 2020, he'd never participated in antifascist counter-protests in Portland. \"I watched them on the news,\" he said. \"It had nothing to do with us. At the time, we were, like, 'That's the racist white people fighting against the not-racist white people-sounds like a good fight to be had.' \" Then, on August 22nd, more than a hundred Trump supporters, including Proud Boys, assembled outside the Justice Center for their first major rally in Portland since George Floyd's death. The theme: \"Back the Blue.\" Rose City Antifa and PopMob organized a counter-protest. Smiff and his wife, Ri, joined the antifascists. The two sides furiously attacked each other with fists, bats, and bear repellent. Ri, a nurse and volunteer medic, treated more than two dozen people for injuries. The rapid-response team stood by until the Trump supporters retreated. Then an unlawful assembly was declared, and the antifascists were driven from the area with batons and impact munitions.\n\n\"It was jarring,\" Smiff said of the police intervention. \"They were openly taking the side of a hate group.\"\n\nRose City Antifa and PopMob allege that the Portland Police Bureau, which is eighty per cent white, has long tolerated crimes by far-right groups while cracking down on leftist demonstrators. (The police spokesperson denied this, saying that all lawbreakers, \"no matter their political alignments,\" were subject to arrest.)\n\nAt Joey Gibson's Trump Free Speech Rally, in 2017, a militia member helped officers handcuff and detain an antifascist counter-protester. At a rally the following year, officers discovered four Patriot Prayer supporters on a roof with rifles, but made no arrests. In 2019, the Portland Police Bureau falsely tweeted that antifascists had thrown \"milkshakes\" filled with quick-drying cement at Patriot Prayer marchers. The story became a viral right-wing meme used to impugn antifascists. Sophie, of Rose City Antifa, said that this apparent track record of bias helped catalyze Portland's movement to defund the police when Floyd was killed: \"There was already a lot of resentment toward the police because of the very clear way that they treated left-wing protesters as the enemy and right-wing protesters as their friends.\"\n\nAt the same time, activists do not necessarily decry the Portland Police Bureau as an egregious outlier: in their view, it is simply executing the core function of American law enforcement by aligning with white supremacists. For many protesters, the deployment of militarized federal agents to Portland confirmed this. In September, The Nation reported that agents had used classified cell-phone-cloning technology to spy on protester communications, and the Attorney General, William Barr, has since encouraged prosecutors to consider charging violent protesters with sedition.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has vowed to designate Antifa as a terrorist organization. The only right-wing group for which he has made a similar pledge is the K.K.K. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, during the Trump Administration right-wing terrorists have carried out about a hundred and forty attacks, left-wing terrorists a dozen. An assessment released by the Department of Homeland Security on October 6th predicted that, in the foreseeable future, white supremacists \"will remain the most persistent and lethal threat\" to the U.S. Nevertheless, in the first Presidential debate, Trump said, \"Almost everything I see is from the left wing.\" Technically, this may have been true. A former head of intelligence for the Department of Homeland Security (and a Republican) recently filed a whistle-blower complaint alleging that he faced pressure to downplay the danger of white supremacists and to emphasize that of leftists.\n\nFive days after Michael Reinoehl killed Aaron Danielson, in Portland, he appeared on Vice News , from an undisclosed location, and admitted responsibility, claiming self-defense. Trump tweeted, \"Everybody knows who this thug is,\" and exhorted law enforcement to \"do your job, and do it fast.\" That afternoon, near Olympia, Washington, a fugitive task force led by U.S. marshals opened fire on Reinoehl while he sat in a parked car, and then again as he stumbled into the street. Roughly thirty rounds were fired. A gun was found in Reinoehl's pocket. Multiple witnesses have said that the officers neither identified themselves nor attempted to detain Reinoehl. (At a recent campaign rally, Trump said, \"They didn't want to arrest him.\") After Reinoehl died, Attorney General Barr declared, \"The streets of our cities are safer with this violent agitator removed.\" Trump added, \"That's the way it has to be. There has to be retribution.\"\n\nOn August 25th, armed citizens travelled to Kenosha, Wisconsin , where rioting had erupted after a white police officer shot a Black man seven times in the back. During altercations, Kyle Rittenhouse, a seventeen-year-old who'd come to Kenosha from Illinois, killed two people with an assault rifle. He then carried his rifle past police officers while someone yelled, \"That dude just shot them!\" Though Rittenhouse was later charged with homicide, Trump has defended his actions, and NBC News has reported that Department of Homeland Security officials were directed to make public comments sympathetic to Rittenhouse. (Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, his lawyer says.)\n\nFor antifascists, the Reinoehl case is an example of state-sanctioned murder, and the Rittenhouse case shows how extrajudicial killing can be outsourced to civilians. Morgan, the Rose City Antifa member, said, \"That's what to me is uniquely terrifying about this moment. It feels like these far-right groups have basically been given the go-ahead to step in and commit this extralegal violence where the police cannot, but want to.\"\n\nSome leftists compare the President's demonization of dissent to the anti-Communist fervor of the mid-twentieth century. Certainly, the right-wing culture of paranoia that he tirelessly fosters can look like mass delusion. In an August interview with Fox News, Trump spoke of an airplane \"almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that,\" which he linked to \"people that are in the dark shadows\" who \"control\" Joe Biden. The baseless claim echoed the baroque anti-Semitic conspiracy theories of the cult group QAnon , which has gained surprising traction among Republicans, in part thanks to Trump's tacit approval of it. A week after the President's plane remarks, wildfires rampaged across Oregon, forcing more than forty thousand people to evacuate and killing nine. Smoke filled Portland's skies, and activists suspended demonstrations, turning to relief efforts. While some protesters set up a donation point outside a shopping mall, and others delivered supplies to rural shelters, QAnon promoted a false rumor that antifascists had started the fires.\n\nAcross Oregon, 911 calls inquiring about Antifa arsonists flooded dispatch services, and checkpoints manned by armed citizens slowed evacuation efforts. During a public Zoom conference, a captain in the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office related accounts of \"suspected Antifa\" members felling telephone poles \"in the hopes of starting further fires.\" The sheriff soon repudiated these reports, but not before a Clackamas County deputy was captured on video telling a local resident, \"Antifa motherfuckers are out causing hell.\" In a separate video, the deputy warned people that if they killed miscreants they could be charged with murder; however, he advised, if \"you throw a fucking knife in their hand after you shoot them, that's on you.\" (The deputy was placed on leave and is under investigation.) Several law-enforcement agencies, including the F.B.I., beseeched citizens to stop spreading the false Antifa stories. But at a rally Trump insisted, \"They have to pay a price for the damage and the horror that they've caused.\" Some critics noted that, in 2018, Trump pardoned Dwight and Steven Hammond-Oregon ranchers who had been convicted of igniting fires on federally managed land.\n\nLink copied\n\nOne day, at the protester-run donation point, I met Gary Floyd, a longtime activist who had just returned from Mill City, an hour south of Portland. Floyd is in the process of registering an official Black Lives Matter chapter in Oregon, and he had filled his trunk with food and water, intending to help evacuees and thereby show them that the organization was nothing to be feared. Outside Mill City, he parked and opened his trunk. Although Floyd has been involved in activism since the Rodney King riots , in 1992, the hate that he encountered took him aback. \"I was told to get the fuck out of town and called the N-word four or five times,\" he told me. \"People were passing by and yelling out their windows at me.\"\n\nAfter Mac Smiff, the hip-hop journalist, finished his speech at the Ventura Park rally on September 5th, an African-American woman took the stage. Protesters would be marching to the Portland Police Bureau's East Precinct house, she announced. In an arch tone, she reminded the crowd, \"We celebrate a diversity of tactics.\"\n\nI'd heard variations of the phrase repeatedly in Portland. The maxim was first codified by demonstrators at the 2008 Republican National Convention, in St. Paul, Minnesota: to maintain cohesion among sometimes fractious activists, they urged acceptance of all styles of protest. Effie Baum, the PopMob co-founder, told me, \"One of the tools of the state is getting us to create that dichotomy between 'good protesters' and 'bad protesters.' \" Another popular chant at direct actions was \"No bad protesters in a revolution.\" The vandalism that I witnessed in Portland was perpetrated by a very small minority, but even fewer people attempted to intervene, and those who did were often disparaged as \"peace police.\" The result was that the most extreme acts generally set the tone of the demonstrations-a tangible marker of the movement's ideological drift.\n\nThe rapid-response team blocked the road to the precinct house. Near the front of the march, I found Rico De Vera, the engineering student, live-streaming with his cell phone. As we greeted each other, a Molotov cocktail was hurled from the rear and exploded a few feet away, just shy of the officers. Flames splashed protesters, and a man's leg caught on fire. While medics tended to him, two more Molotov cocktails exploded between us and the officers, who discharged tear gas, stun grenades, and impact munitions, scattering the march. A helicopter hovered overhead. People stumbled into side streets, coughing and retching.\n\nI lost De Vera in the melee but caught up with him a few hours later, on a commercial boulevard. He and another man, a thirty-five-year-old African-American named Jay Knight, were arguing with a white protester in black bloc. De Vera and Knight were angry about the Molotov cocktails; the white protester defended their use.\n\n\"If you guys keep playing war games, there's gonna be an actual war,\" De Vera said. \"They're looking for a reason. No one here is prepared for what real war is like. Everyone here will be fucked, and people of color will be especially fucked.\"\n\nKnight added, \"Molotov cocktails make this side look worse than the cops. It makes people who were on the fence dismiss all of this as criminality.\"\n\nThe white man muttered something inaudible and walked off. Knight shook his head. \"They all use the same argument-'Oh, a Black person called for a diversity of tactics.' \" Later, Knight told me, \"This needs to stop. It's become a mockery. When you have Trump using this to be reëlected, it's, like, 'O.K., guys, wake up.' But they don't care.\"\n\nRespect for a diversity of tactics was always intended to strengthen militant activists, not sway moderates. The liberal position that violence and vandalism are undemocratic rings hollow to radical leftists for the same reason that appeals to free speech do: from their perspective, we don't live in a real democracy, and our speech isn't truly free. In \"Antifa,\" Mark Bray points out that millions of incarcerated Americans have been silenced and disenfranchised, and that prison abolitionists want to eliminate \"this black hole of rightlessness.\" Anarchists, furthermore, \"aim to construct a classless, post-capitalist society that would eradicate significant discrepancies in our ability to make our speech meaningful.\" However fanciful this may sound, it's what many antifascists are fighting for, which informs how they fight.\n\nAfter leaving Knight and De Vera, I followed another group into a neighborhood where a man and a woman peered out from their second-story bedroom window.\n\n\"Get away from our cars!\" the woman snapped.\n\nProtesters loitered in their driveway. Insults were exchanged. \"We're Democrats , you fucking jerks!\" the woman said.\n\nThe protesters laughed and moved on.\n\nThat afternoon, Joey Gibson and hundreds of Patriot Prayer supporters had held a memorial service for Aaron Danielson in a Vancouver park. Speakers remembered Danielson as a \"unifier\" with \"a huge heart\"-\"the first guy to buy you a drink if you were having a bad day.\" I met a friend of Danielson's there: a middle-aged man in a Patriot Prayer T-shirt, carrying a longboard and a sidearm. An online-meme creator and \"info warrior,\" he told me that Antifa answered to George Soros, who collaborated with China, which controlled the United Nations, which had created COVID -19 to lead Americans \"lockstep into a one-world global-medical tyranny.\" He said of Danielson's death, \"We're a hornet's nest, and we've been kicked. We need to be feared. A central message that we've portrayed over and over again is: They must respect us.\"\n\nNonetheless, when Gibson took the stage, he implored the audience not to seek revenge: \"I don't want to see one person going to Portland and committing acts of violence.\" The press had shown up, and Gibson seemed eager to cast himself and Patriot Prayer as irreproachably virtuous. He spoke passionately about resisting hate and about the importance of forgiveness. Though he didn't mention the abuse he had endured the night that Danielson was killed, he pointedly extolled the courageous faith of Jesus, who had \"walked straight into death.\" Describing Patriot Prayer supporters as embattled victims in a society antagonistic to their existence, Gibson expressed a paradoxical sentiment common among heavily armed Christians: \"I'm sick and tired of living a life of fear.\"\n\nLater, Rose City Antifa published a photograph , taken at the memorial, showing Gibson with his arm around Chester Doles, a former Imperial Wizard in the K.K.K. Doles went to prison in 1993 for assaulting a Black man, and was arrested again in 2016 for his involvement in a bar fight in Georgia between skinheads and an interracial couple. He recently started a pro-Trump group called American Patriots USA, which, according to Ace, the Rose City Antifa member, \"appears to use Patriot Prayer as a template for organizing in Georgia with a similar base.\" Ace added that white supremacists like Doles have learned \"how to project an image of quote-unquote patriotism while pedalling an extremely hateful ideology.\" (In an e-mail, Gibson said of the photograph, \"I took pictures with over 50 people that day. I have no idea who he is.\")\n\nAfter the service ended, a few dozen Proud Boys lingered on the edge of the park, most of them wearing the organization's signature black-and-yellow Fred Perry polo shirts. (Fred Perry recently denounced the Proud Boys and discontinued production of the polos in North America.) When I approached the group, I was greeted by a man with long graying hair and a thick white goatee, who held the hand of a woman about half his height. \" PROUD BOY \" was tattooed on his forearm, and he wore a gun on his hip.\n\nHis name was David Machado, and he was a sixty-one-year-old Air Force veteran, a retired flight engineer, and one of the first members of the Vancouver Proud Boys. He wanted me to know that he and his wife, Carie, were children of Mexican immigrants. Machado had become involved with Patriot Prayer in 2016 because, like Gibson, he'd felt persecuted for his political and religious beliefs. \"If you're for Trump now, you're a white supremacist,\" he said, incredulous. \"We have Mexican kids, Mexican families. It's just not right.\"\n\n\"My husband shouldn't have to tell me that if he's not with me I can't wear my Trump gear,\" Carie said.\n\nMachado had served as Gibson's personal security detail at Portland rallies. He'd been hospitalized twice for injuries sustained from antifascists. Activists had posted photographs of him around his neighborhood, on posters that called him a Nazi. Now he never left his house unarmed. \"I'm on their hit list,\" he said.\n\nWhile Machado and I spoke, the other Proud Boys left and headed to a nearby bar. Machado nervously scanned the park. \"I don't wanna be out here all by myself,\" he told me. It was broad daylight. A couple pushed a stroller across the grass.\n\nBut Machado's concern later proved reasonable. At the bar, a man began filming Machado and his friends with his cell phone. \"He was trying to dox us,\" Machado said. After a bouncer made him leave, the man ran over a Proud Boy in the parking lot, fracturing his skull and rupturing his eardrum. The man was eventually arrested and charged with a felony hit-and-run. Although he wasn't a member of Rose City Antifa, he had shared a social-media post advocating violence against racists.\n\nA GoFundMe page was set up to cover the victim's medical expenses. Gavin McInnes, the Proud Boys founder, who has since distanced himself from the group, contributed a thousand dollars. In the comments section, he wrote, \"War.\"\n\nThe night after Gary Floyd, the Black Lives Matter activist, was shouted at by racists near Mill City, he discussed the impending election with protesters outside a juvenile-detention center in Portland. \"It's going to go one way or the other,\" Floyd told them. \"Trump gets reëlected, and we are all terrorists-or he don't get reëlected, and we have ourselves a race war.\"\n\nTrump has been openly laying the groundwork to contest the results of the election, and there is widespread concern that he will call upon his supporters to reject them, too. \"The only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged,\" he has said. \"We can't let that happen.\" During the first debate , Trump wouldn't commit to discouraging his supporters from engaging in violence while mail-in ballots are counted. When Chris Wallace, the moderator, pressed him to ask white supremacists, specifically, to \"stand down,\" Trump responded, \"What do you want to call them? Give me a name.\" Biden brought up the Proud Boys, and Trump answered, \"The Proud Boys? Stand back and stand by. But I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what. Somebody's gotta do something about Antifa and the left.\"\n\nThe Proud Boys were ecstatic. One prominent leader wrote on Parler, \"Trump basically said to go fuck them up! This makes me so happy.\" Within hours, \"Standing By\" had become a new Proud Boys mantra, and T-shirts with the phrase were available online.\n\nOn September 26th, the Proud Boys came to Portland for a rally against \"domestic terrorism,\" planned after Aaron Danielson's death. Organizers expected thousands of attendees from across the country. Governor Kate Brown declared a state of emergency, and a U.S. marshal federally deputized members of the rapid-response team, meaning that, in some circumstances, people accused of attacking them could face enhanced penalties.\n\nThe rally turned out to be lacklustre, with a couple of hundred Proud Boys drinking beer in a muddy field. After chants of \"Fuck Antifa,\" most of the men kneeled while a minister entreated God to \"reveal your purpose to the Proud Boys-use us to lift up this city!\" Following the prayer, the crowd emitted a communal grunt of \"Uhuru!,\" the Swahili word for \"freedom,\" which Proud Boys have co-opted as a satirical battle cry. Speakers blared an electric-guitar solo of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" and a number of Proud Boys, instead of placing their hands over their hearts, held up the \"O.K.\" sign-a white-power signal. (Some people claim to use the gesture ironically, to inflame liberal sensitivities.) \"America, bitch!\" someone bellowed. A few Proud Boys sported patches that said \"RWDS\"-Right Wing Death Squad-and one man wore a T-shirt that featured a portrait of Kyle Rittenhouse framed by the words \" THE TREE OF LIBERTY MUST BE REPLENISHED FROM TIME TO TIME WITH THE BLOOD OF COMMIES .\"\n\nA welder named Shane, with a bushy red beard and a holstered Beretta, told me that he had driven down from Spokane, Washington, the previous night. Each front pocket of his blue jeans contained a loaded magazine, and in his rear pocket was a copy of the Constitution. Shane had taken part in the August 22nd brawl, when Mac and Ri Smiff joined the militants from Rose City Antifa. \"When you have an ideology that is completely antithetical to Western culture and our traditions, we can't let that go on,\" he explained. \"It's a cancer eating away at the soul of America.\"\n\nThough Trump's exaggeration of the threat posed by Antifa is likely a cynical ploy to scare up votes, Proud Boys like Shane and David Machado seem sincerely and deeply worried about Antifa. I asked Shane if he thought that the protesters in Portland represented a significant danger.\n\n\"Hundred per cent,\" he said. \"They fundamentally want to change everything about America.\"\n\nIt occurred to me that most of the antifascists I met in Portland would readily agree with Shane's assessment.\n\nAfter this conversation, I went to Peninsula Park, where hundreds of the people Shane feared listened to Mic Crenshaw compare their fight to his own, three decades earlier, in Minneapolis. Later that night, many of the protesters headed to the Justice Center. The Proud Boys had left Portland without coming downtown, and there was a sense of triumph and relief. Black activists delivered speeches to a peaceful audience; I saw no vandalism. Yet, at some point, the rapid-response team, freshly deputized as federal marshals, arrived with a large contingent of state troopers in riot gear. They stormed the park, assaulting and arresting people. Half a dozen officers dog-piled on a woman, wrenching her arms behind her back. A seventy-three-year-old photographer was thrown to the ground; a journalist was shoved into a tree. Someone was maced at point-blank range. The show of force felt more intense than anything I'd seen in the past month. On this hundred-and-twenty-first day, it could have been a form of desperation-or of vengeance. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Antifa Protests Are Helping Donald Trump\n\nDuring this first tumultuous summer of the Trump Presidency, it has been\nalmost possible to mistake events in America's cities for a constant\nloop of scenes from Spike Lee's 1989 movie, \"Do the Right Thing.\" The\nchaotic and deadly events in Charlottesville were followed, a week later, by a largely peaceful anti-racism march in Boston , which both\ndwarfed a pathetic concurrent gathering of white supremacists and\ninspired hope that we might make it through the month without more\nviolence in the streets. That hope proved sustainable through a shaky\ndétente in Phoenix , where Trump spoke in defense of the former sheriff and convicted racial profiler Joe Arpaio . It endured through last\nSaturday, when a planned right-wing demonstration in San Francisco was\ncancelled, and survived most of Sunday, when roughly four thousand\nanti-racism protesters conducted a peaceful demonstration across the\nbay, in Berkeley's Martin Luther King, Jr., Civic Center Park. But it\nfractured the moment that contingents identified as anarchists and Antifa radicals slipped into the crowd and began attacking right-wing\nprotesters who had assembled there under the banner of free speech. (Six\nmonths ago, the University of California campus at Berkeley, the nucleus\nof the Free Speech Movement of the nineteen-sixties, was thrust into the\nheadlines when a group of protesters smashed windows and set fires in\norder to prevent the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos from\nspeaking there.)\n\nFollowing Donald Trump's first, inept remarks on the tragedy in\nCharlottesville, his false even-handedness regarding the violence there\nhas proven politically disastrous. Republicans who have acceded to\nTrump's numerable previous violations of ethics and protocols felt the\nneed to make their strongest, albeit still fairly mild, criticisms of\nthe Administration. Trump's own Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, noted\non Sunday, in a striking interview with Chris Wallace, on Fox News, that\non issues of values Trump \"speaks for himself.\" For those who are\nconcerned that the moral elasticity of conservatives will continue to\nabet Trump's behavior, this was an encouraging sign. But the images out\nof Berkeley-outnumbered right-wing protesters being pepper-sprayed by\ncounter-demonstrators, one person lying on the ground while a black-clad\ngroup punched his face and torso-will be held up by many on the right as\nevidence that Trump was correct about the blame falling on \"many sides.\"\nWhere, they will ask, is the equivalent portion of outrage from the\nmedia, from the left, from anyone who claims to respect the First\nAmendment?\n\nThese are not equal pursuits. The Antifa demonstrators, unlike the\nwhite-supremacist factions that gathered in Virginia, do not represent a\ntradition of murderous violence in this country; they are not heirs to\nthe most embittered segments of the wrong side of a conflict that ripped\nthe country at its seams during the Civil War, or to groups that\norchestrated the lynching of four thousand black people in the decades\nafter that side's defeat. Nevertheless, there is no escaping the fact\nthat the elements that lashed out in Berkeley were both morally wrong\nand politically vacuous. And their timing could not have been worse. As\nJosh Marshall points out, at Talking Points Memo, these situations tend\nto work to the benefit of reactionaries , not progressives:\n\nFirst is that these groups have historically used the presence of\ncivil violence to justify \"law and order\" crackdowns which usually\nempower and propagate authoritarian politics. You can already see\nthis, tendentiously, in those hideous NRA video hate screeds.\n\nThis isn't simply a problem of disparate right-wing groups being able to\nrationalize their existence more easily. We are in the midst of a\nPresidency that will manipulate such situations. On Monday, the Attorney\nGeneral, Jeff Sessions, in keeping with Trump's primary political\nobjective-the eradication of Barack Obama's Presidential legacy-formally\nannounced a reversal of restrictions that, following the violence in\nFerguson, Missouri, in 2014, the Obama Administration placed on the\npolicy of transferring military-surplus grenade launchers, .50-calibre\nguns, bayonets, and even armed aircraft to local police departments.\nThis reversal would almost certainly have happened irrespective of the\nevents in Berkeley; just a month ago, Trump, speaking to an audience of\nlaw-enforcement officers on Long Island, encouraged them to employ the\nkinds of tactics that have led to unrest in successive American cities\nduring the past three years. (\" Please don't be too nice ,\" the President\nsaid.) But, in a healthy democracy, or one struggling to remain so,\npublic perception matters. Having ginned up public fear about law and\norder from his first statements as a candidate, repeatedly citing\nphantom crime statistics both during the campaign and while in the White\nHouse, Trump has been the beneficiary of skewed perceptions.\n\nTrump exudes a malign charisma, and witnessing its appeal and the\nlicense that it grants him has been destabilizing for a wide swath of\nthe left. Some of Trump's opponents have said that they are waiting for\na Reichstag fire-a false crisis that will be used to justify the\nAdministration's worst instincts. We have not yet encountered such a\nmoment, but the clear dictate of common sense is that no one should be\nin the business of providing this President with matches.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "When Reporting Becomes a Defense for Rioting\n\nJohn Sullivan, also known as Jayden X, calls himself an activist, a reporter, or an entrepreneur, depending on who's asking. When I first reached him by phone, he told me that he was \"a video journalist, or maybe a documentarian, or whatever you would say-going out there and just live-streaming the events that are transpiring, so that people can see it on the Internet.\" He lives near Salt Lake City, but, until recently, he spent most of his time on the road, looking for the next riot: Portland, Seattle, New York. He has tried to associate himself with the Black Lives Matter movement, but many organizers have disavowed him; others have gone further, accusing him of being an \"agent provocateur,\" a \"con artist,\" or a \"thrill-seeking instigator.\" \"Riots are meant to bring change, so purge the world with fire,\" he tweeted in December. But he has not always been clear about what kind of change he has in mind. \"I'm not Antifa,\" he told me recently, although he went out of his way to mention that he often wears all black to protests, as many antifascists do. \"And I'm not with the Trump supporters,\" he continued, although he was among the Trump supporters when a mob of them assaulted the Capitol , on January 6th. Using a Samsung phone mounted on a gimbal, he captured about ninety minutes of raw video-a chilling, near-comprehensive record of the siege. (Reviewing some of the footage, in Artforum , the film critic J. Hoberman called it \"cinema as forensic evidence.\") Sullivan has since uploaded his footage to YouTube and provided it to law enforcement; he has also repeatedly tried, and largely failed, to explain what he was doing there in the first place.\n\nSullivan is twenty-six, lean and sharp-featured, and he moves with the lithe precision of a former athlete. He has three younger brothers: James, Peter, and Matthew. \"We're all Black, adopted, and our parents are white,\" John told me. \"We were raised in a sheltered household and taught to view the world as colorless. Then you grow up and suddenly realize, No, actually, I'm Black, and a lot of the people I grew up around were racist as fuck.\" He told me that his father, John Sullivan, Sr., is a retired Army lieutenant colonel who now works in the freight-shipping industry, and that his mother, Lisa, is a homemaker. They are conservative-\"more conservative than Trump,\" Peter told me-and are devout Mormons, although their three eldest sons no longer practice the religion. Growing up, John, Jr., was a nationally ranked speed skater, but he quit in 2018. (On one of his Web sites, he claims that he \"competed in the 2018 Olympic Games\"; in fact, he only got as far as the Olympic trials.) In 2016, he starred in a slickly produced Uber ad, the conceit of which was that athletes who train at odd hours might want to work part time in the gig economy. A director's cut ends with a shot of Sullivan skating to an abrupt stop, followed by the tagline \"Find your hustle.\"\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Sullivan said, he thought about joining the Army Reserve, and applied to be a police officer in a Salt Lake City suburb. He ended up working in corporate sales instead. Last year, feeling isolated and restless during the pandemic, he decided to start his own business. George Floyd had just been killed, and Sullivan's social-media feeds filled with rousing images from street protests against police brutality. He went to a local Black Lives Matter protest, wearing a GoPro on his motorcycle helmet, and uploaded his footage to YouTube. After that, he established an L.L.C., called Insurgence USA. Later, on the Web site ActivistJohn.com, he posted a photo of himself raising a clenched fist, with the National Mall in the background, next to the words \"John Sullivan is bringing the revolution.\" He solicited donations on Patreon and PayPal, offered his services as a motivational speaker, and sold merchandise: black tactical gloves; protective goggles; red baseball caps that looked like Make America Great Again hats, but actually read \"Made Ya Look / Black Lives Matter.\" He started filling his YouTube channel with footage from street clashes, employing a gonzo-guerrilla aesthetic: balaclavas, billowing clouds of tear gas. \"I put my body on the line to bring people the best documentation of history,\" Sullivan said. \"That's my thing: When shit's going down, you follow me and I show you exactly what it's like.\"\n\nRonan Farrow on a Pennsylvania mother's path to insurrection .\n\nLast June, early in his new career as an activism entrepreneur, Sullivan attended a protest near a police station in Provo, Utah. A pro-police group had organized a \"Back the Blue\" rally; another group planned an anti-police-brutality demonstration around the same time. (Sullivan's Insurgence USA organization reportedly promoted the latter event on social media.) The vast majority of Black Lives Matter protests last summer were peaceful-more than ninety-five per cent, by some estimates-but, at this one, clashes broke out. According to criminal affidavits later filed in state court, one of Sullivan's fellow-protesters shot a man who was driving near the protest, and Sullivan kicked a woman's car and threatened to beat her up. (Sullivan claimed that his confrontation started because the woman was trying to run over the protesters.) Sullivan was charged with criminal mischief and \"riot,\" which was defined, in part, as assembling \"with the purpose of engaging . . . in tumultuous or violent conduct.\" Sullivan argued that he had simply attended the event as a journalist-not a credentialled and impartial journalist, perhaps, but a journalist nonetheless.\n\nMore than once, his brother Peter, who describes himself as \"politically moderate,\" asked John why he was drawn to potentially violent street actions. \"He would talk about his business, how he wanted to be the best video journalist, and that meant taking risks,\" Peter recalled. \"He would also tell me, 'You don't understand, it's such a surreal experience.' In addition to the journalism element, I think that rush is something that he really craves.\"\n\nJohn Sullivan made a habit of blurring the lines between activism, advocacy journalism, and opposition research. He tried to stay abreast of where the next big protest or riot was likely to break out, monitoring activist group chats on Signal and Telegram. \"I was able to collaborate with the left in their community to gather information,\" Sullivan wrote in an unpublished draft of a memoir. \"But I also can connect with the right and successfully be in their presence without them being combative towards me.\" When he was surrounded by left-wing activists or right-wing activists, he sometimes gave the impression of being one of them; at other times, he implied that he was working undercover to expose one side or the other. In his recent conversations with me, he emphasized his neutrality. \"I want to make sure my First Amendment rights as a journalist are not being forgotten,\" he told me.\n\nThe First Amendment enshrines, separately, \"the freedom of speech\" and \"of the press.\" \"If the Speech Clause is the Court's favorite child, the Press Clause has been the neglected one,\" Sonja West, a legal scholar at the University of Georgia, wrote in the Harvard Law Review , in 2014. As a result, West told me, \"this remains a fuzzy area of the law.\" Can an undercover reporter misrepresent herself in order to get a story? Should a journalist in pursuit of publicly useful information be allowed to do certain things-push past a police barricade, say-that a normal citizen may not? \"The Court has indicated that journalists have a special role that deserves protection,\" West said. \"But it has been very reluctant to say what those protections are.\" If a professional reporter follows a crowd of protesters onto private property, the police may refrain from arresting her. If a whistle-blower leaks classified information to a journalist, prosecutors can treat this differently than if the information were leaked to a spy. In West's Harvard Law Review article, she advocates what she calls \"press exceptionalism,\" suggesting a kind of checklist-eight \"distinct qualities,\" including \"attention to professional standards\" and \"a proven ability to reach a broad audience\"-that might distinguish the press from \"press-like\" members of the public. Sullivan checks about half of these boxes, depending on how generously you apply the criteria.\n\nThere has never been a clean way to delineate professional journalists from everyone else, and the boundary has only grown blurrier in the selfie-stick era. Defining the press too narrowly risks excluding freelancers and correspondents from nontraditional outlets; defining it too broadly could mean including anyone with a cell phone and a YouTube account. \"If everyone has equal claim to being a reporter, regardless of intent or track record, what it means in practice is that law enforcement won't be able to tell the difference,\" Lucy Dalglish, the dean of the University of Maryland's journalism school, told me. \"Suddenly, you have a situation where anyone can do any crazy thing-like break into the Capitol building, for instance-and then, when the cops show up, they can just take out their phone and say, 'Hands off, I'm a documentarian.' \" One of the people who invaded the Capitol on January 6th was Nick Ochs, a Proud Boy from Hawaii, who was later arrested for unlawful entry. \"We came here to stop the steal,\" Ochs said on a live stream the day of the siege. That night, however, Ochs told CNN that he had entered the Capitol as a professional journalist. He was associated with a far-right new-media collective comprising audio and video talk shows, published on YouTube and other platforms. The name of the collective was Murder the Media.\n\nIn July, Sullivan returned to the Provo police station for another demonstration. Standing on a small promontory and holding a megaphone, he gave a short speech. Then, spotting members of the Proud Boys and other far-right groups in the crowd, he improvised a kind of olive-branch gesture. \"I want to understand you,\" he said. \"That's what we're about here. Getting to know people . . . because then you love them just like your family.\" The megaphone was passed to several far-right activists, including a burly Proud Boy in a camouflage vest. The following month, Sullivan, wearing body armor and carrying a long gun, led a few dozen Second Amendment enthusiasts, including both left-wing activists and members of the Utah Constitutional Militia, on an armed march to the state capitol.\n\nThe more prominence he gained in local newspapers and TV-news segments, the more vocally left-wing organizers denounced him. (Lex Scott, a founder of Black Lives Matter Utah, told me, \"He's a thorn in our side. We learned to stay away from him long ago.\") Some wondered whether he was a police informant, or a spy for a far-right militia. Among their reasons for suspicion was Sullivan's brother James, a right-wing activist in Utah who had ties to the Proud Boys. (When asked if he had ever collaborated with James, John said, \"I have barely spoken to that man in years.\") James currently runs a right-wing Facebook page called Civilized Awakening, which, in addition to the usual links about Trump and voter fraud, seems to specialize in anti-John Sullivan content-for example, a crudely Photoshopped image of John receiving a creepy neck massage from Joe Biden. Recently, on Facebook, James wrote, \"I got into activism for one reason, and that was to take down my brother.\" An activist from Portland floated a simpler explanation for John Sullivan's antics: \"He came off as someone that was a bit lost and looking for a family/following anywhere he could find it.\"\n\nAccording to left-wing activists, John Sullivan promoted his work online using a fluctuating assortment of handles: @ActivistX, @BlackFistNews, @FascistFighter, @WatchRiotPorn. Sometimes, he appeared to log in to multiple accounts simultaneously, using one to corroborate another. During one group chat on Signal, an organizer warned, \"Activist X is not to be trusted.\" Sullivan, who was in the chat, brushed it off. \"Lol the fuck?\" he wrote, using the display name Activist X. \"I've know Activist X,\" the next comment read. \"Sounds like a lot of bullshit to me.\" This was supposed to appear under the display name Tiger Wolf, but other activists claimed that they could see that it was actually posted by Sullivan, from another one of his phone numbers. \"Why did you respond to yourself?\" one asked. Another wrote, \"I'm burning this chat lol.\" (Sullivan denied using the handle Tiger Wolf and others, saying, \"People are trying to hack my accounts and misrepresent me.\")\n\nDuring the fall and winter, as Black Lives Matter protests fizzled and pro-Trump protests grew, Sullivan followed the momentum, live-streaming from far-right events in Washington, D.C., and at the Oregon state capitol. On Election Day, he witnessed a group of Proud Boys, normally implacable supporters of law enforcement, chanting \"Fuck the police.\" \"That was shocking,\" he wrote in a draft of his memoir; in his view, the far right's turn against the police marked \"a paradigm shift.\" In December, he started to notice chatter on Parler and Telegram indicating that Trump supporters planned to descend on the Capitol. He booked a trip to D.C. In the memoir draft, he recalled thinking that Trump supporters who were angry about the outcome of the election, especially those who \"overcame this barrier of supporting the police,\" might \"unite with Black Lives Matter. . . . I felt that perhaps they would come and fight together against the government.\"\n\nIn the first shot of Sullivan's main video from the Capitol, he is standing outside, underneath a set of bleachers erected for Joe Biden's Inauguration. He angles his camera to take in the crowd behind him: red MAGA hats, yellow Gadsden flags, a man in a fur pelt. Suddenly, the crowd surges up a flight of stairs and toward a line of police barricades. The officers, most of whom do not have helmets or shields, are vastly outnumbered; they hold the line for a few seconds, but they're quickly overtaken. \"This shit's ours!\" Sullivan shouts, as the invaders swarm onto a terrace. \"We accomplished this shit. We did this shit together! Fuck, yeah!\"\n\nLooking over a balustrade to the lawn below, he sees a roiling crowd of thousands of people. He lets out several wonder-struck cheers, his voice cracking with exertion and emotion. \"That's beautiful shit!\" he shouts. \"Let's go!\" People are climbing up the walls, and he offers one of them a hand up. \"Holy shit, dude, that was awesome,\" he says. \"Let's burn this shit down.\" A few seconds later, Sullivan rests his camera on a ledge and turns to a woman next to him, who is also filming. \"I'm just gonna rely on you for footage from now on, is that chill?\" he says. \"Or should I just keep recording?\" But then he presses forward, still taping, following the group through a broken window.\n\nInside the Capitol, Sullivan wanders from room to room more or less at random, as if playing a first-person video game with no clear objective. He marvels at the palatial digs (\"This is surreal\"; \"I'm shook at this!\"; \"What is life?\") and fantasizes about their destruction. \"We've gotta burn this,\" he says. \"We've gotta get this shit burnt.\" When he is surrounded by Trump supporters, he provides encouragement or advice. When confronted by police officers who ask him to leave, he says, \"I'm just filming,\" or \"No freedom of the press now?\" A few times, he tries to persuade police officers to abandon their posts. \"We want you to go home,\" he tells an officer. \"I don't want to see you get hurt.\"\n\nIn the Rotunda, he stops to admire the domed ceiling, watching the afternoon light stream in from above. \"Damn,\" he says, relishing the moment. Then, gesturing toward the fresco on the ceiling, he asks the man next to him, \"What is this painting?\"\n\n\"I don't even know, but I know we in this motherfucker,\" the man responds.\n\n\"Gang shit, bro,\" Sullivan says.\n\n\"Make sure you follow me on Instagram,\" the man says.\n\nSullivan continues past Corinthian columns and ruffled red-velvet curtains, into a marble hallway packed with insurrectionists, where the mood turns dark. A woman with a gray ponytail stands inches away from a police officer, vibrating with rage. \"Tell fucking Pelosi we're coming for her!\" she shouts. \"We're coming for all of you!\" She stops and stares the officer down, as if preparing for battle. \"You ready?\" she asks.\n\n\"I'm ready, bro,\" Sullivan says, perhaps to himself. \"I've been to so many riots.\"\n\nSuddenly, the mob pushes past the police and into a small inner corridor. One of the insurrectionists grabs a megaphone and turns to face the others. \"We need to remain calm now,\" he says. \"We've made our point. Let's be peaceful.\"\n\n\"Fuck that shit,\" Sullivan says. \"Push!\" Several times throughout the video, he can be heard saying, \"I got a knife.\" (He now claims that he didn't actually have a knife: \"I used that to navigate myself to the front of the crowd.\")\n\nSome of the insurrectionists break away and find another small hallway, leading to a set of wood-and-glass doors. On the other side is a lobby leading to the House chamber. (The mob doesn't know it, but several members of Congress, staffers, and journalists are still in the process of being evacuated from the chamber.) The insurrectionists use helmets and wooden flag poles to start beating down the door, smashing the glass and splintering the wood frame. One woman, an Air Force veteran named Ashli Babbitt, starts to approach the door. A plainclothes police officer stands on the other side, wearing a mask and pointing a pistol in the group's direction. \"There's a gun!\" Sullivan says, but Babbitt doesn't seem to hear. She starts to climb through an opening in the doorway. The officer shoots once and Babbitt falls to the ground, bleeding, eyes open. \"She's dead,\" Sullivan says to the man next to him, who identifies himself as a correspondent from the far-right conspiracist network Infowars . \"I saw, the light goes out in her eyes.\"\n\n\"I need that footage, man,\" the Infowars correspondent says. \"It's gonna go out to the world.\"\n\n\"Dude, this shit's gonna go viral,\" Sullivan says.\n\nFrom his hotel room, Sullivan uploaded his video footage to YouTube. He licensed parts of it to the Washington Post and NBC, and Anderson Cooper interviewed him on CNN. Right away, far-right conspiracy theorists started to use Sullivan for their propaganda efforts. Some tried to suggest that Sullivan was a left-wing plant who had somehow orchestrated the entire insurrection. Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's lawyer, tweeted a screenshot of what appeared to be a text conversation between himself and James Sullivan, who claimed, baselessly, that there were \"226 members of antifa that instigated the Capitol 'riot,' \" and added, \"I'm currently working with the FBI to expose and place total blame on John.\"\n\nJohn Sullivan uploaded videos in which he spoke directly to the camera, attempting to justify some of the more incongruous parts of his Capitol footage. \"I have emotions, and those moments are crazy,\" Sullivan said. In another video, he added, \"I was not there to be a participant. I was there to record. But I also have to blend my fucking Black ass into that crowd.\" Many of his followers didn't seem to buy it. When he tweeted, \"#TrumpSupporters are making a hit list to take me out,\" someone responded, \"Stop acting like the victim. . . . You were obviously more involved then what you are playing out.\"\n\n\"I mean, the FBI doesn't think so,\" Sullivan responded.\n\nA week after the insurrection, James Sullivan says, he sent the F.B.I. tips about his brother. On January 14th, according to John, agents came to his apartment and seized two computers, two cell phones, and his camera equipment. Federal prosecutors announced that Sullivan was being charged with one count of knowingly entering a restricted building, one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct, and one count of interfering with law enforcement. \"People are understandably angry and upset, but I'm hoping we don't respond to mob violence with mob justice,\" Mary Corporon, one of Sullivan's defense attorneys, told me. \"It's going to take a lot of discipline to look at each individual case separately, to give each person a chance to be presumed innocent, but that's what the Constitution requires.\"\n\nA central function of the press is to reveal significant information, including images that the public otherwise would not have seen. \"People can say what they want, but nobody else got the footage I got,\" Sullivan told me. \"That shit was history, and I captured it.\" The events leading to Ashli Babbitt's death are of undeniable import, and we would understand them less well if Sullivan hadn't documented them. In a dissenting Supreme Court opinion from 1972, Justice Potter Stewart argued that, in order to protect \"the full flow of information to the public,\" there \"must be the right to gather news.\" Sullivan and his lawyers may end up arguing that some of his actions on January 6th-shouting support for the mob, for example-were acts of newsgathering, necessary for Sullivan to get as far as he did. This theory would be less helpful, presumably, in explaining away some of Sullivan's other actions, such as encouraging the invaders to push forward or claiming to have a knife. In Brandenburg v. Ohio, from 1969, the Supreme Court ruled that speech is not protected by the First Amendment if it is \"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\" This is a high bar, but it's possible that Sullivan's speech would clear it.\n\nSullivan spent the night of January 14th in jail. The next day, he was brought before a judge, who released him on the condition that he wear an ankle monitor and stay in his house except for pre-approved activities. Near the end of the hearing, the prosecutor asked that Sullivan be barred from using the Internet. The defense argued, \"It is nearly impossible to find employment in the twenty-first century without some form of Internet access.\" In the end, the judge ordered the prosecution and the defense to agree on \"a list of social-media sites that you feel would be dangerous for Mr. Sullivan to use.\"\n\nAgainst his lawyers' advice, Sullivan has called me nearly every day since his release, giving me a Zoom tour of his apartment and sending me a Google Drive of protest footage, snippets from his childhood vlog, and cell-phone recordings from his family's Thanksgiving. I wondered whether these were acts of defiance or of self-sabotage, but it seemed more likely that he was trying to alleviate his boredom. He showed me his video-editing setup, which includes a ring light, a key light, and a professional microphone with a pop filter-but not his computers, which had been confiscated by the F.B.I. His rhetoric about his trip to D.C. was triumphant-\"I think I really accomplished something\"-but his body language seemed deflated. He told me that, when he closed his eyes, he still saw images of Babbitt's shooting. \"Even after all the wild stuff I've witnessed,\" he said, \"that was the first time I ever saw anyone die.\" Internet sleuths continued to argue about whether he was a far-right plant or an Antifa double agent, but he sounded more like a confused kid who was in over his head.\n\nDuring one of our conversations, he told me that he hadn't yet received the list of social-media sites that he would be prohibited from using, but that he had been told to expect a far-ranging ban. \"Maybe I'll be allowed to use LinkedIn , maybe not even that,\" he told me. \"I'm just watching TV and meditating and trying to steer clear of all of it.\" This may have been his goal, but he did spend at least some time lurking on Twitter. I know this because, on January 16th, he followed me. He used one of his old handles, @ActivistJayden. I clicked on the account's profile and scrolled through its history. It was one of Sullivan's lesser-used accounts; at the time, it consisted only of a few retweets. There was a live stream of a protest outside a federal prison and a video of a protester playing a violin while tear gas spread around him. On New Year's Eve, @ActivistJayden had retweeted a tweet that read, \"Let's make 2021 the year of political upheaval.\" Replying to the tweet from a different account, Sullivan had written, \"I'm fucking ready.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "How to Both-Sides a \"Civil War\"\n\nYears ago, when I was a freelance journalist desperate for work, I went to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on a press junket for a big-budget disaster movie. The movie was \"2012,\" and it was directed by Roland Emmerich, the German box-office savant known as the Master of Disaster. During one event, I sat in a cushy conference room at the Four Seasons with other journalists, eating comped elk chili and sliders, while some New Age-adjacent writers and other self-appointed experts-\"2012-ologists,\" they were called-briefed us on the coming apocalypse. They were there to put a pseudo-academic sheen on the movie's cosmic premise, presumably, although no one-not the journalists, not Emmerich, not even the 2012-ologists-seemed to take what they were saying either seriously or literally. Their (erroneous) story was that the ancient Mayan calendar ended abruptly with the year 2012, which was said to be an omen portending-well, no one could say exactly what, but presumably something very big and very bad.\n\nThis was a thin premise for a film-little more than an excuse for Emmerich to do what he did best, which was conjuring world-famous landmarks onscreen and then, with campy extravagance, blowing them up. (In \"Independence Day,\" he destroyed the White House with an alien death ray; in \"2012,\" he would smash it again, this time with a mega-tsunami.) In the movie, the cosmic conspiracy theorists are proved right: the year 2012 ends not with a whimper but with a bang, or really a sequence of cataclysmic bangs all over the globe. We were in Jackson Hole because one of the V.F.X. money shots in \"2012\" is the eruption of a supervolcano lurking beneath the surface of Yellowstone Park. There really is a Yellowstone supervolcano . Like the other spectacular plagues in \"2012,\" including unprecedented solar flares and continent-splitting earthquakes , an eruption that buries much of the Mountain West is something that could happen in real life. On a long enough time line, it very well might. But of the day and hour knoweth no man, least of all Roland Emmerich. In any case, at the Four Seasons, Emmerich did little to conceal the fact that what had drawn him to the subject was not Mayan prophecy but what has come to be known as \" pre-awareness .\" \"2012 is this date, you know, which there's a lot of ideas about,\" he said. \"And we chose the destructive one.\" It was, in other words, the popular freakout of the moment, repurposed as a form of buzzy I.P.\n\nPress junkets aren't what they used to be. Last week, I saw \" Civil War ,\" the new film by the British writer and director Alex Garland, in a plain ground-floor screening room on Sixth Avenue. (No elk chili this time. Not even popcorn. And no experts providing historical context.) \"Civil War\" is not a campy disaster movie. It's taut, carefully paced, colorful but not overstuffed. As a war movie, it's closer to \"The Hurt Locker\" than \"Glory\"; as a road movie, it's more \"Badlands\" than \"The Road.\" Aesthetically speaking, the film is finely crafted, full of lovely and harrowing images (the wildflowers next to a sniper's trench; the chassis of a crashed helicopter in an abandoned JCPenney parking lot). As prophecy, however, it's not so illuminating. Like an erupting supervolcano or a catastrophic solar flare, a second American Civil War is something that really could happen-an unlikely prospect but, still, terrifying enough to be worth worrying about. Yet wars are not random acts of nature. Instead of just hoping for the best, we can try to prevent the worst, if we're willing to face some hard questions.\n\nThe film takes place in what appears to be a very near future, if not an alternate present. (The phones, which don't work, and the weapons, which very much do, look like today's models.) The dramatic setup is that of every Pixar movie: unlikely fellow-travellers set off on a high-stakes quest. Here, our heroes are four American journalists, led by a war photographer named Lee (an exhausted-looking Kirsten Dunst ), who has racked up accolades and traumas abroad and is now covering a grisly conflict at home. According to a map put out by the film's U.S. distributor, when the action of \"Civil War\" begins, nineteen states have seceded. A tyrannical President in his third term (Nick Offerman, who doesn't go out of his way to act like Donald Trump, but also doesn't go out of his way not to) is clinging to power, and Lee and her companions, two other weathered veterans and a wide-eyed newbie, want to approach him for an interview. To get to him, they need to travel from New York to Washington, D.C., which will require not a three-hour Acela ride but a death-defying odyssey in a beat-up Ford Excursion.\n\nWe follow them as they head south: building-to-building combat by day, ropes of orange rocket fire at night. One day, they fall in with guerrillas in street clothes; the next, they're following troops in fatigues. It's often unclear who the good guys are, or whether we're supposed to care. \"West Coast forces, fucking Portland Maoists-it's all the same,\" one of the reporters says. Later, when the newbie expresses concern about whether two prisoners of war are going to survive, Lee chastises her: \"Once you start asking yourself those questions, you can't stop. So we don't ask. We record so other people ask.\" At first, I wondered whether this was meant to be Lee's P.T.S.D. talking. Is the audience supposed to admire her stout dispassion, or suspect that her moral compass has spun out of control? Then I listened to a few interviews with Garland, in which he made it clear that his protagonist's opinions were basically his own. \"The film is trying to act like the reporters it admires,\" he told WNYC (a member station of NPR, which, depending on your position in our current culture war, either is a source of objective information or comprises state-sponsored advocacy journalism ). Garland had imagined the mechanics of an American Civil War 2.0 in minute detail, but he had left its causes deliberately obscure, he said, because \"at a certain point, the specifics stop mattering. . . . It stops being, in a way, issue-driven, and it just becomes anger.\"\n\nBut anger doesn't emerge out of nowhere, in drama or in history. In the real world, journalists are supposed to pay attention to the root causes of Americans' anguish: racism , runaway inequality , inadequate health care , job insecurity , and so much else. In the world of \"Civil War,\" we get no hint about what has pushed the country beyond the breaking point, or what makes conditions in the secessionist states different from those in the loyalist states. At the film's première, during South by Southwest, an interviewer asked Garland about the ubiquity of firearms in the U.S.; Garland, apparently deeming the question too issue-driven, demurred, pointing out that some civil wars had been carried out with machetes rather than guns.\n\nGarland has said that his goal was to make an \"emphatically antiwar\" movie. Yet \"Civil War\" remains resolutely incurious about what might cause a contemporary civil war in America-and thus how one might be prevented. (To oppose a hypothetical conflict without confronting the conditions that could ignite it is a bit like claiming to oppose mass incarceration while deliberately avoiding questions about crime, policing, poverty, psychology, judges, and laws.) One of the battles we hear about in the movie is \"the Antifa Massacre.\" Antifa stands for antifascism, and fascism seems like the sort of issue on which many people-even jaded reporters-might feel obliged to pick a side. Yet Lee tries to hold herself apart, and, by extension, so does the film. \"I think civil war is just an extension of a situation,\" Garland recently told the Times . \"That situation is polarization.\" He seems to be trying to have it both ways, using our dire politics as topical I.P. while tap-dancing around frank conversations that might get him in trouble with portions of his potential audience. It's hard to stay above the fray, though, while also banking on the fray for relevance. Garland's paeans to objectivity sound noble in theory, but the photojournalist's lens has never been entirely neutral. Besides, it's hard to say anything meaningful about a country on the brink of collapse without addressing what brought it there.\n\nYou can't make a movie called \"Civil War\" without being haunted by a few ghosts, but Garland's film seems determined to avoid looking at them. In a moment of sweaty exposition, we are told that Lee's name is an allusion to Lee Miller , the celebrated war photographer for Vogue . (Miller arrived in France a month after D Day, which one could also call an Antifa Massacre.) But it's impossible to hear the main character's name without also thinking of Robert E. Lee, especially as the journalists approach the front line, in Charlottesville, Virginia. It surely reveals something about the narrow scope of Garland's project that he could have named his protagonist Grant or Lincoln, without changing any other details, and it probably wouldn't have made much difference. There is more exposition throughout the film, much of it amounting to \"War is Hell.\" It's hard to argue with that, but it's also hard to invest too much emotional energy in any text that's hard to argue with.\n\nThe secessionist forces include, most notably, California and Texas; the loyalist states include New York, South Carolina, Kansas, and Arizona. As many viewers have pointed out, this makes no sense. It's certainly a brazen narrative choice, so eager to avoid provocation that it risks becoming a distraction; it shifts the movie into a different register, if not a different genre, as if Garland had built a fictional world that resembled the real world in every respect except that, for some unexplained reason, there was no gravity . (Emmerich was being indulgent when he blew a hole through Wyoming in \"2012,\" but at least he put the fault lines in the right place.) In 2022, Barbara F. Walter, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, published a best-selling book called \" How Civil Wars Start .\" Walter warned that \"the U.S. has the risk factors that we know tend to lead to civil war,\" but she was also careful not to engage in \"fearmongering.\" In the London Review of Books , James Meek criticized Walter , in part, for being too careful. \"Her text struggles to contain the tension between the view that civil war is an absolute evil, and the possibility that in some civil wars one side is right and the other is wrong,\" Meek wrote. (One of his examples was the African National Congress's struggle against South African apartheid, a struggle that is sometimes misremembered as having been entirely nonviolent.) \"It is as if cherished liberal causes-democracy, equal rights, tolerance-should not be associated with the grubbiness of inter-communal violence; as if the fact that the partial victory of these causes in certain countries had to be fought for, in the literal sense of the word, is a dangerous secret.\"\n\nGarland has mentioned \"Apocalypse Now\" as an influence, and, indeed, as helicopters swoop toward the capital you can almost imagine \" The Ride of the Valkyries \" thrumming in the background. And yet \"Apocalypse Now\" was not merely an antiwar movie; it was also a critique of American imperialism. (Imagine if Marlon Brando's character had been named for Marlow, the central narrator of \" Heart of Darkness ,\" rather than Kurtz.) \" Dr. Strangelove \" was not a satire about the madness of all violence everywhere; it was a satire about the madness of American nuclear-weapons policy, and for that reason it caused plenty of controversy. Without being willing to commit to a substantive analysis, \"Civil War\" is stuck at the level of surface iconography. We get glimpses of Thomas Jefferson and the Lincoln Memorial, but little guidance about what these references might amount to. (No spoilers, but if you thought that all the landmarks of the American Republic were going to emerge from this movie unscathed, then you haven't been studying your Emmerich.) The movie ends on a tableau of soldiers at the climax of a battle scene. Are they supposed to remind us of Iwo Jima? SEAL Team Six? Harpers Ferry? Abu Ghraib? If the answer is \"all of the above,\" then where does that leave us?\n\nOne of the boldest books I've read in recent years is \" Break It Up: Secession, Division, and the Secret History of America's Imperfect Union ,\" by the writer Richard Kreitner. The book, which was published in the summer of 2020, is a startlingly revisionist account of American civil wars-the one that was, and the many that might have been. Its narrative starts in 1620 and ends in 2019, and on nearly every page there's someone trying to lead a revolt against the Union: abolitionists from Massachusetts, Populists from South Carolina, a demagogue in North Dakota, twentieth-century militias in Montana. (Texas and California both threaten to secede many times, but never ultimately on the same side.) Kreitner is a journalist, but, unlike Lee, he's not afraid to ask tough questions; the book is attentive to the horrors of war, but at no point do the specifics stop mattering. \"We cannot keep trying to bludgeon one another into submission or indulge fantasies of the sudden evaporation, wholesale extermination, or unconditional surrender of the other side,\" Kreitner writes. \"We will have to find a way to truly and thoroughly unite-not again , but for the very first time.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Revisiting Portland's \"Summer of Rage\"\n\nThe demonstrations that took place in Portland, Oregon , in the course of 2020 might constitute the most thoroughly documented social movement in American history. At least when I was there-in August and September of that year, on the tail end of more than a hundred consecutive nights of marches and rallies that often involved violent clashes with law enforcement-there sometimes appeared to be as many people recording the events as participating in them. One reason for this was likely self-interest. Identifying yourself as an observer afforded you a degree of protection against arrest and police brutality. Midway through Rian Dundon's new photography book, \" Protest City: Portland's Summer of Rage ,\" we encounter a quintessential example of such vocational appropriation: a young man wearing a gas mask and tactical gear, with a GoPro device mounted on his helmet and a digital camera holstered on his hip. In his right hand, he holds a selfie-stick tripod attached to a phone; in his left, a homemade shield marked \"PRESS.\"\n\nWhether intentionally or not, Dundon's book offers a welcome counterpoint to the so-called protest photographer, and a powerful defense of photography as a craft rather than a weapon or a tool for political activism. Dundon was a mainstay on the front lines of the demonstrations, and got as close as anyone did to the tear gas, rubber bullets, and batons. Yet the only equipment that he carried was a Fujifilm XF10-an unassuming point-and-shoot that's compact enough to slip in a pocket. Aside from its inconspicuousness, the advantage of this camera, Dundon told me, is that it \"slows things down.\" Compared with a single-lens reflex or an iPhone, the XF10 generally takes more time to operate, forcing you to be more deliberate, and favoring moments of stillness over action. Dundon, in other words, is the antithesis of the live streamer, that increasingly ubiquitous chronicler of American unrest who captures whatever he encounters indiscriminately, with a premium on action. The results, in \"Protest City,\" are curated portraits and scenes of unusual intimacy.\n\nNearly all of the images in the book were taken at night. In many of them, the XF10's built-in flash brilliantly illuminates the immediate foreground while shrouding the rest of the frame in darkness. In recent years, more and more photojournalists have begun employing creative flash techniques for dramatic effect, and sometimes such hyper-stylized visual language can come off as overwrought, distorting reality or rendering it grotesque. Dundon's approach, however, seems well suited to the subject at hand. The spotlighted isolation of the figures recalls actors on a stage, underscoring the theatrical aspect of the demonstrations. One protester wears a medieval-knight costume, another a hula skirt, a third nothing at all. Despite the showmanship, everyone in the book is gripped by genuine emotion-real indignation, fear, anxiety, conviction. Protests are performances, especially in Portland, but they aren't only that. Dundon manages to convey this knotty tangle of artifice and authenticity.\n\nAn obvious challenge of protest photography, like war photography , is its absence of context, the severing of action from motivation and belief. In \"Protest City,\" we see broken windows, toppled statues, looted stores: we see, graphically, what the protesters have done. But why did they do it? In Portland, more than in Minneapolis or in other cities convulsed by the historic uprising for racial justice in 2020, the answer is complicated. The subtitle of Dundon's book-\"Portland's Summer of Rage\"-somewhat elides this complexity. The period covered begins on May 30, 2020, five days after the murder of George Floyd , but it continues until August, 2021. During those fifteen months, the rage that Dundon references was directed at a variety of targets: federal agents, the city's Democratic mayor, the Portland Police Bureau, local foreclosure and eviction policies, juvenile detention, the Supreme Court, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Proud Boys and other Trump supporters who held their own provocative rallies downtown, annexation of Indigenous lands, the Presidential Inauguration of Joe Biden , capitalism, colonialism-the whole \"system of oppression,\" as one protester put it to me.\n\nOf course, it would be unfair to expect a photography book to detail such a litany of grievances-and, by presenting his subjects outside of the ideological framework behind their activism, Dundon accomplishes something different. Without loaded classifications like \"Black Lives Matter\" or \"Antifa,\" the protesters become less novel and exotic, more mundane and recognizable. The diluted tones, high contrasts, and red-pupilled figures in \"Protest City\" combine to create a throwback aesthetic that also feels familiar. Dundon was initiated into photography as a high schooler, in the nineteen-nineties, by taking pictures of his friends skateboarding. Many people who grew up around that time will notice, in his work, the influence of skate magazines like Thrasher or Big Brother . This shows in Dundon's raw, unflattering style of composition but also in his specific preoccupations: wanton vandalism, cheap tattoos, explicit graffiti-abrasions and abandon. This is not just the world of far-left activism. It is the world of wild, angry-and mostly white-urban and suburban youth.\n\nIn revealing this analogue between subcultures, \"Protest City\" rises from a visual record to a work of art. Dundon provides both a glimpse of a unique historical moment in American politics and an exploration of an American cultural phenomenon that might be more pervasive and longer-lasting.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWhat the militant left-wing movement actually believes - and why President Trump's scapegoating of them during the George Floyd protests is dangerous.\n\nby Zack Beauchamp\n\nPresident Donald Trump seems convinced that there is a scary conspiracy lurking in the protests for racial justice sweeping the nation: that antifa, a militant left-wing anarchist movement, is taking advantage of the demonstrations to burn the country down.\n\nOver the past week, he has blamed looting on antifa in tweets , fundraising emails, and public appearances. He has used them to cast the protest movement as a fundamentally violent affair, claiming in a Monday address that \"our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, looters, criminals, antifa and others.\" He has repeatedly vowed to officially label antifa a terrorist group, putting it on a federal list alongside al-Qaeda and ISIS.\n\nBut antifa (pronounced ahn-TEE-fah or anty-fah) is nothing like those terrorist groups. It is not a unified organization, but rather a loose ideological label for a subset of left-wing radicals who believe in using street-level force to prevent the rise of what they see as fascist movements. It is a kind of anarchist alternative to the police that originally took root in America's punk scene, without any kind of national command and control structure.\n\nThese young brawlers - often scary-looking, wearing all-black clothes, when caught on camera - serve as a perfect foil for a president and a conservative movement looking to cast the overwhelmingly peaceful participants in protests over George Floyd's killing and police brutality as a group of violent thugs.\n\nWhile there is undoubtedly an antifa presence at some of the recent protests, there is no reason to believe that antifa is responsible for their (occasional) turns toward violence. Internal FBI assessments and protest-related court documents tell a consistent story: Antifa members are not responsible for the unrest.\n\nThe real antifa is quite complex. Tracing their ideas back to interwar anti-fascists in Europe, the movement rocketed to public prominence as a left-wing foil to the alt-right - playing a notable role in the protests against Trump's inauguration and in counterprotests against the white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Virginia. Their activity, both violent and nonviolent, arguably helped curtail the spread of the alt-right; there are also clear examples of them crossing the line, including indefensible physical assaults on journalists.\n\nBut the \"antifa\" discussed in the president's tweets and on Fox News bears little resemblance to this morally gray reality. They are a trumped-up boogeyman for the conservative movement, a totem used to justify their violent \"law and order\" approach to legitimate demonstrations demanding racial justice.\n\nAntifa's origin story begins in the 1930s, in two European countries: Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1932, the Communist Party of Germany founded an organization dedicated to opposing the rise of fascism called Antifaschistische Aktion - abbreviated, at times, as antifa. The group engaged in a series of direct actions to challenge the Nazis, including street brawls, but were forcibly dissolved after Hitler's rise to power.\n\nThe British experience was quite different. In 1936, the British Union of Fascists - a political movement with real electoral support, but not nearly as powerful as the 1932 Nazis - attempted to lead a march through London's heavily Jewish East End. Thousands of Jews and left-wing activists attacked the fascists and their police escorts, raining homemade bombs and rocks down on the parade. The BUF forces retreated; the leftists celebrated victory in what's now remembered as \"the Battle of Cable Street.\"\n\nWhile Antifaschistische Aktion was too late to stop the Nazis with force, modern antifa sees the Battle of Cable Street as proof that fascist movements can be defeated before they gain popularity if they're forcibly blocked from appearing in public. They call this \"preemptive\" or \"anticipatory\" self-defense: Since fascists want to use force against you eventually, you're justified in using it first.\n\nThis interpretation could be true, but it's certainly debatable. One could argue that street brawling helped the Nazis more than it hurt them ; some evidence suggests that Cable Street led to anti-Semitic reprisals and made the British public more sympathetic to the BUF.\n\nRegardless, this \"violence works\" historical narrative is at the core of antifa's ideology today. They deeply believe that the different paths of Germany and Britain in the interwar period proved the need to confront fascism with force.\n\n\"Self-defense, which often entails violence, is an indispensable part of [antifa] politics,\" says Mark Bray, a historian of antifa at Rutgers University. \"They believe, and I think rightly so, that fascism and proximate far-right politics are inherently aggressive - and that, if you're not ready to defend yourself in advance, it may be too late when the time comes.\"\n\nIt's probably not a coincidence that the modern incarnation of antifa also has its roots in the UK and Germany. This time, the crucial period is the 1980s .\n\nBack then, West Germany was dealing with a resurgence in neo-Nazi sentiment and activity. The punk rock scene in Britain, an aggressive subculture with anarchist political leanings, was similarly becoming a recruiting space for white nationalists tapping into anger and disaffection common among British punks. In both countries, activists took matters into their own hands - fighting neo-Nazis on the ground in order to prevent what they worried could be a replay of the 1930s.\n\nOne UK-based group, called Anti-Fascist Action in a direct nod to the 1930s German group, became the inspiration for a similar organization in American spaces. Called Anti-Racist Action, on the theory that this language makes more sense in an American political context, it became an organizing banner for punks (at first) who wanted to boot neo-Nazi skinheads from their own scene. In the 2000s and 2010s, the label Anti-Racist Action gave away to the now-popular antifa.\n\nStanislav Vysotsky, a sociologist at the University of Wisconsin Whitewater who has done extensive interviews with antifa members, describes them patrolling neighborhoods and guarding the doors at punk shows to prevent Nazis from entering. When these tactics fail, they resort to violence.\n\n\"Fascists are first aggressively confronted about their presence and ordered to leave by large group of people (in many cases, the entirety of the venue),\" he writes in a 2015 paper . \"If fascists do not leave when confronted, force is often used to eject them from the space, either in the form of physical removal or through a violent clash between them and anti-fascists.\"\n\nVysotsky sees this as a kind of \"anarchist policing.\" In the punk subculture, people don't like or trust the police: Armed agents of the state are as un-punk as you can get. But neo-Nazi skinheads won't leave concerts politely when told; some kind of counter-force is required to keep punk shows safe for people of color and Jews who want to attend. Hence, the need for loose groups of anti-fascists brawlers willing to kick them out.\n\nAntifa might have remained little more than a facet of America's marginal punk scene, unknown to the vast majority of Americans, if it weren't for the rise of Donald Trump and the alt-right in 2015.\n\nTrump's victory was accompanied by the growth of a kind of more electorally minded white nationalist politics, an organized effort to win power and influence by riding the soon-to-be president's coattails. This \"alt-right,\" personified by the supposedly \"dapper\" white nationalist Richard Spencer, organized online and staged increasingly public real-world demonstrations.\n\nThis is not something antifa could abide. Taking lessons from the forebears in the 1930s and 1980s, they started organizing to stop the modern far-right before it could really get started.\n\n\"As fascist and far-right movements and personalities publicly supported Trump's campaign and presidency, antifascist opposition mobilized against them,\" Vysotsky tells me. \"These mobilizations became more commonplace after his inauguration as fascists organized rallies under the guise of support for Donald Trump and his agenda which were met with strong, sometimes violent opposition.\"\n\nAs the alt-right became more prominent, so did their more radical left-wing opponents - a degree of notoriety that these \"anarchist police\" simply were not prepared for.\n\nAntifa does a lot more than merely brawl with far-right activists. Members of antifa groups do more conventional activism, flyer campaigns, and community organizing, on behalf of anti-racist and anti-white nationalist causes. This type of work, according to Bray, makes up the \"vast majority\" of antifa activity.\n\nIt's also a bit imprecise to describe \"antifa\" as doing anything uniformly. Because of its origins in punk scenes, the movement is highly decentralized and localized. Some of it takes place through specific local organizations, like Portland's Rose City Antifa, but there's no national umbrella leadership. Some of what we call \"antifa\" activity is really just random kids with no formal affiliation with their local antifa group; they call themselves \"antifa\" because they think fascism is bad and it's cool to fight against it.\n\nBut three incidents in the Trump years led to antifa's more violent activities becoming the defining element of the movement in the public imagination: the protests during Trump's inauguration, the white nationalist march in Charlottesville, and the attack on a conservative journalist in Portland. They turned antifa into a hero for part of the left - and a powerful villain for the right.\n\nDuring Trump's inauguration, a video of Richard Spencer getting punched in the face by a black-clad activist (who may or may not have been a formal antifa activist) went mega-viral. Remixes of the video set to songs like \" My Heart Will Go On\" got thousands of shares and retweets, becoming an iconic early image of resistance to the new regime among certain segments of left-wing social media.\n\nThe inauguration demonstrations and Spencer incident led to a surge in interest in antifa: In January 2017, NYC Antifa's Twitter following increased by roughly a factor of four . But it also associated the group with the broader rioting and property destruction that marked the inauguration demonstrations, leading to what Vysotsky describes as \"a conflation of black bloc tactics [like property destruction], anarchist activism, and antifascism, especially within conservative and far-right discourse.\"\n\nThere's a large universe of radical left-wing groups in the United States, and antifa is by no means the only one to engage in street-level violence. That can make it very tricky to identify whether any individual example of violence, even violence directed at far-right activists, can be linked to antifa per se.\n\nBut during the Trump era, where fears of an authoritarian turn in the United States have risen to dramatic levels on the left, antifa has come to occupy the most prominent place. The 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville is probably the biggest reason why.\n\nA major white nationalist rally, replete with terrifying imagery and chants of \"Jews will not replace us,\" is exactly the kind of open far-right organizing that antifa believes needs to be stopped in order to prevent fascism from rising any further. Antifa groups had a significant presence at the rally, often interposing themselves between armed right-wingers and counterprotesters; Princeton professor Cornel West , who was on the ground with a band of clergy members, claims that \"they [antifa] saved our lives.\"\n\nIn the months following Charlottesville, antifa groups hounded white nationalists, regularly appearing at and disrupting their events. In March 2018, Richard Spencer canceled the remaining stops on his college speaking tour, releasing a tearful video in which he declared that \"antifa is winning.\"\n\nSome saw this as evidence that violence worked to suppress the alt-right ; others wondered if the movement's less violent activities , like publicly identifying white nationalist activists, may have played a bigger role. Regardless, the alt-right has undeniably declined in influence since then - though other, more nakedly violent far-right movements have risen in its wake .\n\nThe confrontation with the alt-right, a white nationalist movement that sought to gain power through electoral means, was tailor-made for antifa's approach. The alt-right directly aped the strategy of 1930s fascist movements that antifa members believe their tactics are uniquely equipped to defeat. Antifa had an opportunity to put their theory of preemptive self-defense to work; Spencer's tour cancellation is evidence that it worked.\n\nBut even if you buy this interpretation, there's an obvious problem with antifa's approach: It's not clear who, exactly, counts as a \"fascist.\"\n\nIndividual antifa organizations and even activists take it upon themselves to identify the fascists and attack them accordingly; there's no system of national accountability, nor any \"Antifa Central\" that can disavow the actions of specific activists as ones of rogue actors. The closest thing is the Torch Antifa network, a national umbrella group for the movement that facilitates coordination between local groups but lacks command-and-control powers.\n\nAs a result, what any antifa group or member does can be spun as indicative of the group as a whole, and there's no antifa PR agency to dispute it or reshape the narrative. This is essentially how antifa became public enemy No. 1 in the second half of Trump's term in office.\n\nIn late June 2019, the far-right Proud Boys street fighting group held a rally in Portland, Oregon. Left-wing groups, including Portland's Rose City Antifa, put together a counterprotest - whose attendees clashed with the Proud Boys . The most notable instance of violence had nothing to do with the Proud Boys: It was an attack by counterprotesters on the conservative journalist Andy Ngo that sent him to the hospital.\n\nIn footage captured by Portland-based reporter Jim Ryan , crowd members douse Ngo in milkshake, punch him, and yell at him. It looked a lot like an unprovoked, unjustified, reprehensible assault on a journalist by antifa.\n\nNgo is a conservative provocateur sympathizer who has worked with militant right-wing groups ; he seems to delight in antagonizing antifa members and broadcasting the results. As reprehensible as this behavior is, it does not turn him into a legitimate target; whatever his ideology, he's still a journalist. The footage of the attack spread widely, turning antifa into a major villain in the Republican Party and conservative media. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy condemned the group, as did Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nAbout a month after the attack on Ngo, Trump tweeted about antifa for the very first time - threatening, as he has recently, to label them a terrorist group:\n\nWarning of dangerous far-left activism is a common staple of Republican and conservative political rhetoric; Fox News stoked panic about the New Black Panthers, a black nationalist group, early in Barack Obama's first presidential term.\n\nBut antifa assumed a particularly outsize role in right-wing political discourse after Ngo, coming up again and again in complaints about the radical left. It was only natural that they ended up playing a starring role in the conservative narrative about the George Floyd protests.\n\nAfter some of the George Floyd protests turned violent, the White House wasted no time in pinning the unrest on antifa.\n\nAppearing on CNN's State of the Nation , National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien flatly declared that \"this is being driven by antifa.\" Warning of \"antifa radical militants who are using military tactics to kill and hurt and maim our police officers,\" O'Brien announced that \"we're going to get to the bottom\" of this nefarious antifa plot.\n\nO'Brien offered no evidence for these inflammatory charges, and it doesn't seem that very much exists.\n\nWhile there's some kind of antifa presence at some of the major protests, it's very hard to attribute all of the violence to the movement. Not every person wearing all black and breaking windows is a member of their local antifa organization. And there's very little evidence that antifa is responsible for a significant proportion of the looting.\n\n\"My conversations with law enforcement and intelligence officials in multiple US cities suggest that antifa played a minor role in violence,\" Seth Jones, an expert on terrorism at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, writes . \"The vast majority of looting appeared to come from local opportunists with no affiliation and no political objectives. Most were common criminals.\"\n\nA May 31 memo from the FBI's Washington field office reported \"no intelligence indicating Antifa involvement/presence\" in violent activities in the nation's capital. Not a single one of the first 22 protest-related indictments nationwide indicated that antifa played a role in looting or property destruction. An Associated Press review of 217 arrests in Minneapolis and DC found that \"of those charged with such offenses as curfew violations, rioting and failure to obey law enforcement, only a handful appeared to have any affiliation with organized groups.\"\n\nThe dearth of antifa-linked violence reflects the fact that the protests are generally quite peaceful - and that the number of actual antifa activists nationwide is quite small.\n\n\"Northern California and Oregon are two of the most active places for antifa in the US. At their biggest events they have, like, 200 people,\" Bray, the Rutgers scholar says, says. \"Yet you're seeing things being burnt down in Arizona and Salt Lake City. That gives you a sense that this is much bigger than [antifa].\"\n\nThis is not to excuse any acts of vandalism or violence by antifa members that are eventually uncovered. Even Bray, who's generally sympathetic to antifa, thinks it's \"plausible\" that some of the movement's members are responsible for some of the property destruction or other disruptive activities during the demonstration.\n\nBut it's one thing to say some members are doing this stuff - a \"faction of a faction,\" as Bray puts it - and another to argue, as O'Brien does, that antifa is behind the overall tumult. The former is a reasonable suspicion based on antifa's track record, the latter a political move designed exclusively to provide moral justification for a police crackdown on peaceful protesters.\n\nThe Trump administration's attacks on antifa do not actually reflect the reality on the ground or the minuscule \"threat\" from the group. Instead, they serve primarily to stigmatize the protests themselves - and justify harsh police responses.\n\nTake, for example, Trump's repeated vows to label antifa a terrorist organization. He cannot do this legally: The federal government maintains a list of foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs); while there are antifa activists outside the US, the domestic groups do not have any meaningful organizational linkages with them. There is no such thing as a domestic terrorism designation, and it would require an act by Congress to create one. The president's proposal is, legally speaking, impossible.\n\nBut while Trump's threat to label antifa a terrorist group may be toothless, it serves an important ideological function. It helps fuel the argument that violent radicals are the driving force behind the current wave of protests - that they are at heart a kind of subversive force, rather than an expression of legitimate grievance, and can be put down as such. It is less an actual policy proposal than a rhetorical device aimed at giving the police and federal security services ideological cover.\n\nWe can then distinguish between antifa, the actual movement, and \"antifa,\" the thing that Trump has positioned as his enemy.\n\nThe actual antifa movement is very small and, by all accounts, ancillary to the main story of the current wave of protests. What we're actually seeing right now is that a large portion of the country is fed up with the way police are treating black people. Protesters have taken to the streets in overwhelmingly, but not entirely, peaceful protests - and been attacked by police in response. There's looting and burning, perhaps even some by antifa members, but virtually no real evidence reason to suggest that antifa violence is a significant problem.\n\nBut when Trump says \"antifa,\" he doesn't really mean the actual local movements - which are far too small and marginal to pull off anything he's accusing them of. The term has become a stand-in, a catchall for demonstrators the government doesn't like. Invocations of antifa are not references to anything that any individual antifa organization is doing, but rather a way of conjuring up a specter of violent leftism in order to justify a heavily militarized response.\n\nAntifa exists, and is responsible for some acts of violence in recent years. \"Antifa\" as Trump imagines it only exists in the conservative mind - but could end up serving as justification for much more significant state violence down the line.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

On Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, the message board TheDonald, and Parler, a \"free speech social network\" created in opposition to Twitter, some users blamed antifa for the attack while others claimed credit for it. Meanwhile, others were angry at the president for posting a video Thursday acknowledging a \"new administration\" would take over.\n\nEven as the online right is divided about how to react to the events of this week, loyalty to President Donald Trump is still strong. Many online supporters refer to him as \"GEOTUS,\" or God Emperor of the United States, and have called fellow members to stand by him.\n\nBut there is fracturing within the movement: Some are confused about why they were asked to come to the January 6 rally if not to take extreme action, others are angry at Trump's concession video posted on Twitter Thursday night where he described Wednesday's events as a \"heinous attack,\" and others still are developing new conspiracy theories.\n\n\"It's like a hall of mirrors,\" said Jessica Stern, a Boston University global studies professor and expert on terrorism. People on these platforms want to communicate with one another and strategize, but at the same time they're using these platforms to boast, make niche jokes, and taunt law enforcement, she told Vox.\n\nIt's hard to know how seriously to take any individual threat or comment made by members of these forums. Distinguishing between legitimate threats and trolling is difficult - and that reality is mirrored by the president himself. Trump will make \"jokes\" that target groups or individuals and undermine democratic norms . His supporters casually dismissed criticisms of these comments, or chastised observers for taking the president literally.\n\nWith five people dead, the time for parsing such distinctions has to be over.\n\nIn the hours following the storming of the Capitol on January 6, Vox reported on the baseless yet quickly proliferating rumor that antifa activists were behind the violence in Washington. Within hours, a theory that started in Twitter replies and message boards was being repeated publicly by Republican Reps. Paul Gosar, Mo Brooks, and Matt Gaetz. The latter went so far as to cite a now-retracted article from the Washington Times which falsely alleged that a facial recognition company had identified members of antifa. In reality, the company, XRVision, had found \"two members of neo-Nazi organizations and a QAnon supporter among the pro-Trump mob,\" according to BuzzFeed News .\n\nOthers on these forums began calling out what they perceived as hypocritical treatment from the police and the media compared to Black Lives Matter (BLM) and antifa. \"I watched cops kneel to BLM and antifa,\" one commenter wrote. Another angrily pointed out that his social media friends were \"perfectly fine with BLM shooting people up months ago\" - insinuating that they should be fine with the violence at the Capitol, though it's not clear what he's referencing, as Black Lives Matter protesters have not \"shot up\" anyone.\n\nA perception that law enforcement is more lenient on the left is almost certainly false - Vox's Fabiola Cineas reported on new research finding that law enforcement is harsher on left-wing protests than ones conducted by right-wing groups. Researchers wrote: \"When authorities engage demonstrations associated with the right-wing, they use force nearly one-third or 34% of the time. Meanwhile, authorities use force in demonstrations associated with the left-wing over half or 51% of the time.\"\n\nBut mostly, people were angry that \"RINOs\" - Republicans in name only, a pejorative term for Republicans deemed insufficiently conservative or loyal to Trump - were attempting to give credit to antifa for something they were proud to have done.\n\n\"WE TOOK THE FUCKING CAPITOL WITHOUT A SHOT. And very minor damage was sustained in the process. NO APOLOGIES. WE'LL FUCKING DO IT AGAIN,\" reads one comment on a popular post on TheDonald. One very popular commenter told his fellow agitators to \"own it\" and stop getting \"cold feet\" about what they had done and blaming it on antifa:\n\n\"They deserve every broken window they got. And I laughed at the photos of them cowering in fear under their chairs. The government should fear the people, never the other way around. I support every action of every patriot against this illegal occupation. We need to support every move our side makes.\"\n\nBut some are less forgiving of what they view as betrayal from their commander-in-chief.\n\nThere's real anger and betrayal being levied at the president from some people. Many have expressed confusion as to why Trump told them to come to DC, if not to act. One popular comment on TheDonald read: \"To be honest, I feel betrayed by GEOTUS who asked us to be there, that'd he'd have 'new evidence' to prove what really happened. Except he didn't release one damned thing. Makes me wonder about a lot of things at this point...\"\n\nIn reply, another commenter writes: \"I'm confused about what the purpose of telling people to come to DC if was just for the same canned speech, no new info ... thousands of pissed off people who feel the election was stolen what did anyone expect would happen?\"\n\nAfter Trump released his concession video, some grew angry at the president referring to the events as a \"heinous attack\" and not standing by them after, in their view, they were just doing what he asked.\n\nBut these are not the norm - a very popular post on TheDonald two days after the riots simply read \"I remain 100% in support of Donald J. Trump, last legally elected President of the United States and 100% in support of MAGA.\" On Facebook, under a Newsmax article headlined \"Trump Spokeswoman Says President Emphatically Condemns Riot at Capitol,\" all of the top comments were in support of White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and loyal to Trump.\n\nTrump is the unifying figure for a lot of this diverse group of people - it's unlikely that they'll turn on him en masse, and there are some indications that even though the president has conceded, his followers still intend to fight to stop President-elect Joe Biden from being sworn in.\n\nOn Parler, one account - in a message that has made its way through screenshots to Twitter and Instagram - wrote that \"many of us will return on January 19, 2021, carrying our weapons ... We will come in numbers that no standing army or police agency can match.\"\n\nThis is just one of several posts in which individuals are planning and strategizing for future anti-government actions. But the sheer volume and diversity of these messages makes it difficult to discern which are direct threats.\n\nMany of these posters could be minors or pranksters trolling online, with no intent or means of traveling to foment an armed insurrection. But that's exactly what makes this movement so dangerous.\n\n\"One of the challenges is that there's so much chatter, there's so much noise, what constitutes a genuine threat [is difficult to parse] - in my view, this is exactly their strategy,\" Georgetown University's Bruce Hoffman, a professor specializing in terrorism studies, told Vox. This ecosystem consists, he said, of \"endless feedback loops of calls to violence... where the people posting it may not pose any kind of direct threat but they're hoping that someone sitting in their basement ... is going to read that, get angry enough, feel that there's community support for the violence and then go out and do something.\"\n\nBoth Hoffman and Stern pointed to the internet and social media as being a necessary component to the right-wing movement growing nationally. Previously, these extremist groups were discrete entities that had to be searched out. Now, they are adjacent to and intermingled with mainstream political ideas and leaders, and people can exist as a part of the movement without formally identifying as a member of an extremist group.\n\nAll it takes is an internet connection and a vague belief that the election was stolen, and all of a sudden people are a part of Facebook groups where posts allege gross fraud and illegal activity undermining democracy. Many people may not even know that the same talking points they post on their social media accounts originated from white supremacists in shady corners of the internet.\n\nSocial media and tech companies have scrambled in the past few days to act, as pressure mounts. Apple threatened to remove Parler from its App Store, and Google Play did remove the app shortly thereafter. Twitter has removed Trump entirely from their platform, even going so far as to ban other accounts that he attempted to use following his ban.\n\nWhile the effort to remove extremism from mainstream social media companies could help curb the spread of extreme ideas to casual users of the internet, the ever-evolving web of right-wing social media and messaging boards will likely defy the control of these tech giants. Just take a look at TheDonald, formerly a part of Reddit; once banned there, it managed to migrate to its own outpost on the internet.\n\n\"This was always the dream of white supremacists who first began organizing on a nationwide coordinated basis in the early 1980s ... to bring together the disparate strands of the extremist movement: anti-federalists, people opposed to taxes, people opposed to governance above the local level, racists, anti-Semites, xenophobes. Lacking the communicative power of social media they can only go so far,\" Hoffman explained.\n\nWell, they have it now.\n\nCorrection, January 11 : A previous version of this article misstated the meaning of GEOTUS.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe left-wing group is back in the news. An expert explains where they come from and what they want.\n\nby Sean Illing\n\nAs protests against the killing of George Floyd rage across the country, the left-wing group \"antifa\" (short for anti-fascist) is back in the news. Although antifa's role remains unclear, President Trump (and others ) are blaming them for helping to incite violence. Antifa became a national story back in 2017 when it collided with neo-Nazis in Charlottesville . Shortly after that incident, I reached out to Mark Bray , a historian at Dartmouth College and author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook . We discussed the group's origins, aims, and tactics. You can read our full exchange, which feels newly relevant, below.\n\nWhen Donald Trump used the phrase \"alt-left\" to describe the anti-neo-Nazi protesters in Charlottesville last year, most people had no idea what he meant. I'm actually not sure he knew what he meant.\n\n\"What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the 'alt-right'? Do they have any assemblage of guilt?\" Trump said during a rambling press conference .\n\nIf the alt-left exists, it's probably best represented by \"antifa\" (short for \"anti-fascist\") - a loose network of left-wing activists who physically resist people they consider fascists. These are often the scruffy, bandana-clad people who show up at alt-right rallies or speaking events in order to shut them down before they happen, and they openly embrace violence as a justifiable means to that end.\n\nAntifa is not a monolithic organization, nor does it have anything like a hierarchical leadership structure. It's an umbrella group that shares a number of causes, the most important of which is resisting white nationalist movements. Adherents are mostly socialists, anarchists, and communists who, according to Mark Bray , a historian at Dartmouth College and author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook , \"reject turning to the police or the state to halt the advance of white supremacy. Instead they advocate popular opposition to fascism as we witnessed in Charlottesville.\"\n\nI reached out to Bray to discuss the group and its burgeoning impact on American politics. He's sympathetic to antifa's cause and makes no effort to hide that. He describes the book as \"an unabashedly partisan call to arms that aims to equip a new generation of anti-fascists with the history and theory necessary to defeat the resurgent far right.\"\n\nIn this interview, we talk about the ethics of \"militant anti-fascism,\" why groups like antifa don't care if they hurt the Democratic Party, and why resisting fascism in a liberal democracy poses a unique challenge to conventional political norms.\n\nOur conversation, lightly edited for clarity, follows.\n\nWhat is \"antifa\"? Where did it come from?\n\nAnti-fascism originated in response to early European fascism, and when Mussolini's Blackshirts and Hitler's Brownshirts were ascendant in Europe, various socialist, communist, and anarchist parties and groups emerged to confront them. When I talk about anti-fascism in the book and when we talk about it today, it's really a matter of tracing the sort of historical lineage of revolutionary anti-fascist movements that came from below, from the people, and not from the state.\n\nThe sort of militant anti-fascism that antifa represents reemerged in postwar Europe in Britain, where fascists had broad rights to organize and demonstrate. You started to see these groups spring up in the 1940s and '50s and '60s and '70s. You saw similar movements in Germany in the '80s around the time the Berlin Wall falls, when a wave of neo-Nazism rolled across the country targeting immigrants. There, as elsewhere, leftist groups emerged as tools of self-defense. The whole point was to stare down these fascist groups in the street and stop them by force if necessary.\n\nThese groups in the '80s adopted the name antifa, and it eventually spread to the United States in the late '80s and into the '90s. Originally, it was known as the Anti-Racist Action Network. That kind of faded in the mid-2000s; the recent wave we're seeing in the US developed out of it, but has taken on more of the name and the kind of aesthetics of the European movement.\n\nAnd this is largely a response to Trump?\n\nI think so. The basic principle of antifa is \"no platform for fascism.\" If you ask them, they'll tell you that they believe you have to deny any and all platforms to fascism, no matter how big or small the threat. The original fascist groups that later seized power in Europe started out very small. You cannot, they argue, treat these groups lightly. You need to take them with the utmost seriousness, and the way to prevent them from growing is to prevent them from having even the first step toward becoming normalized in society.\n\n\"The basic principle of antifa is 'no platform for fascism'\"\n\nWhat's their strategic logic? Why do they think physical violence, as opposed to nonviolent resistance, is both justifiable and effective?\n\nThat's a very good question. Much of what they do does not involve physical confrontation. They also focus on using public opinion to expose white supremacists and raise the social and professional costs of their participation in these groups. They want to see these people fired from their jobs, denounced by their families, marginalized by their communities.\n\nBut yes, part of what they do is physical confrontation. They view self-defense as necessary in terms of defending communities against white supremacists. They also see this as a preventative action. They look at the history of fascism in Europe and say, \"we have to eradicate this problem before it gets any bigger, before it's too late.\" Sometimes that involves physical confrontation or blocking their marches or whatever the case may be.\n\nIt's also important to remember that these are self-described revolutionaries. They're anarchists and communists who are way outside the traditional conservative-liberal spectrum. They're not interested in and don't feel constrained by conventional norms.\n\nYou say one of the principles of antifa is \"no platform for fascism.\" How do they define fascism? Where's the threshold?\n\nGood question. The other thing that's worth clarifying is that anti-fascist groups don't only organize against textbook fascists. There is, first of all, a lot of debate about what constitutes fascism. And it's a legitimate question to ask - where does one draw the line, and how does one see this kind of organizing?\n\nOf course, there is no central command for a group like antifa. There is no antifa board of directors telling people where that line is, and so of course different groups will assess different threats as they see fit. But I suppose the question you're raising has to do with the slippery-slope argument, which is that if you start calling everyone a fascist and depriving them of a platform, where does it end?\n\nOne of the arguments I make in the book is that while analytically that's a conversation worth having, I don't know of any empirical examples of anti-fascists successfully stopping a neo-Nazi group and then moving on to other groups that are not racist but merely to the right. What tends to happen is they disband once they've successfully marginalized or eliminated the local right-wing extremist threat, and then return to what they normally do - organizing unions, doing environmental activism, etc.\n\n\"They have no allegiance to liberal democracy, which they believe has failed the marginalized communities they're defending\"\n\nYou're a historian. You've looked at the data. Is there evidence that the tactics adopted by antifa work? Are there cases of these sorts of groups successfully undercutting fascist movements?\n\nAnother good question. Whenever we look at the question of causation in history, you can never isolate one variable and make grand or definitive conclusions. So I don't want to overstate any of the causal claims being made here. But Norway is an interesting example. In the '90s, they had a pretty violent neo-Nazi skinhead movement, and the street-level anti-fascist groups there seemed to play a significant role in marginalizing the threat. By the end of '90s it was pretty much defunct, and subsequently there hasn't been a serious fascist [movement] in Norway.\n\nAnother example you can look at is popular responses to the National Front [a far-right political party formed in Britain in 1967] in the late '70s in Britain. The National Front was pretty huge, and the Anti-Nazi League, through both a combination of militant anti-fascist tactics and also some more popular organizing and electoral strategies, managed to successfully deflate the National Front momentum.\n\nOne of the most famous moments of that era was the Battle of Lewisham in 1977 where the members of this largely immigrant community physically blocked a big National Front march and that sort of stopped their aggressive efforts to target that community.\n\nSo antifa's logic is that fascism is a rejection of liberal democratic norms, and therefore it can't be defeated with what we'd consider conventional liberal democratic tactics?\n\nWell, certainly the latter is correct. They argue a couple of things. First, they argue that in Europe you can see that parliamentary democracy did not always stop the advance of fascism and Nazism - and in the cases of both Germany and Italy, Hitler and Mussolini were appointed and gained their power largely through democratic means. When Hitler took his final control through the [1933] Enabling Act , it was approved by parliament.\n\nThey also say that rational discourse is insufficient on its own because a lot of good arguments were made and a lot of debates were had but ultimately that was insufficient during that period, and so the view that good ideas always prevail over bad ideas isn't very convincing.\n\nThey other key point, which probably isn't made enough, is that these are revolutionary leftists. They're not concerned about the fact that fascism targets liberalism. These are self-described revolutionaries. They have no allegiance to liberal democracy, which they believe has failed the marginalized communities they're defending. They're anarchists and communists who are way outside the traditional conservative-liberal spectrum.\n\nScholars of nonviolence will say the worldwide abolition of slavery was achieved almost entirely with nonviolent means (our Civil War being an obvious exception), that great strides in women's rights were made, that nonviolent revolutions in Eastern Europe, South Africa, Chile, Egypt, the Philippines, and elsewhere were all accomplished without the use of force. What's different about antifa's mission? Why do they believe violence is more effective in this context?\n\nAs I said earlier, no single factor in history can explain an outcome. It's always more complicated than that. Certainly that's true in terms of the abolition of slavery. In Latin America, for example, a lot of the abolition of slavery happened through gradual emancipation laws, and a lot of those laws were enacted in explicit response to the Haitian Revolution and out of fear that if they didn't start to adjust, they'd have an uprising on their hands.\n\nThis is also true of the civil rights movement, where the threat of race riots and Black Panthers and so forth made a lot of white America more sympathetic to the kinds of things that Martin Luther King and his allies were saying than they might have otherwise been.\n\nThe case of Nazism is obviously one of those intractable historical problems for advocates of pacifism. Even the school of strategic nonviolence that puts aside the ethical questions in favor of the strategic questions still fails, in my view, to show how nonviolence might have worked in that situation.\n\nBut look, anti-fascists will concede that most of the time nonviolence is certainly the way to go. Most antifa members believe it's far easier to use nonviolent methods than it is to show up and use direct action methods. But they argue that history shows that it's dangerous to take violence and self-defense off the table.\n\n\"They're not interested in and don't feel constrained by conventional norms\"\n\nHere's my problem. I think the people who showed up in Charlottesville to square off against self-identified neo-Nazis did the world a service, and I applaud them. But when I see antifa showing up at places like UC Berkeley and setting fire to cars and throwing rocks through windows in order to prevent someone like Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking, I think they've gone way too far. Milo isn't a Nazi, and he isn't an actual threat. He's a traveling clown looking to offend social justice warriors.\n\nI think that reasonable people can disagree about this. I can't speak for the individuals who committed these political actions, but the general defense is that the rationale for shutting down someone like Milo has to do with the fact that his kind of commentary emboldens actual fascists. The Berkeley administrators issued a statement in advance that they feared he was going to out undocumented students on campus, and previously he had targeted a transgender student at the University of Milwaukee Wisconsin. Antifa regards this as an instigation to violence, and so they feel justified in shutting it down.\n\nAgain, though, this is much easier to understand when you remember that antifa isn't concerned with free speech or other liberal democratic values.\n\n\"These are self-described revolutionaries. They're anarchists and communists who are way outside the traditional conservative-liberal spectrum.\"\n\nAntifa defines itself in purely negative terms, in terms of what they're against. But what do they want? Do they have any concrete political goals?\n\nThat's a great question, and one that often gets overlooked. For the most part, these are pan-leftist groups composed of leftists of different stripes. They all seem to have different views of what they think the ideal social order looks like. Some of them are Marxists, some are Leninists, some are social democrats or anarchists. But they cohere around a response to what they perceive as a common threat.\n\nDo you think people are right to be concerned that this type of illiberalism will only occasion more illiberalism in response to it, and that the result will be a spiral of competing illiberalisms?\n\nAs I said before, anti-fascists don't have any allegiance to liberalism, so that's not the question that they are focused on. The question is also how much of a threat do we think white supremacists or neo-Nazis pose, both in a literal or immediate sense but also in terms of their ability to influence broader discourses or even the Trump administration.\n\nI believe that for people who are feeling the worst repercussions of this, they are already experiencing a kind of illiberalism in terms of their lack of access to the kinds of freedoms that liberalism promotes and tries to aspire to; and so for me, that's more of a focus, in terms of trying to mitigate those kinds of problems, than the fears of people who, prior to Trump, thought that everything was fine in the US.\n\nDo you anticipate antifa becoming larger and more active? And if so, what does that mean for American politics moving forward?\n\nThe first thing to point out is that being part of one of these groups is a huge time commitment, and the vetting process that these groups have for bringing in new people is very strenuous. You have to really commit - it's basically like a second job. This limits the number of people that are going to be willing to put their time into it. I don't think the antifa movement is going to explode as much as some do.\n\nBut I do think that antifa can influence where leftist politics in America is going. They are aggressive, loud, and fiercely committed. They're having a wider influence on the radical left in this country, particularly on campuses and with other groups like Black Lives Matter. But I don't want to overstate antifa's role in these shifts.\n\nWell, that dovetails with my final question, which is: Do you think the influence antifa is having on the American left will ultimately hurt the Democratic Party - and by extension help the Republicans?\n\nNot to be repetitive here, but they don't care about the Democratic Party. But it's still an interesting question to consider. Given the disaster that is the Trump presidency, I just think it would be a colossal failure of the Democratic Party not to win the next presidential election and gain a majority in Congress. If they can't do that given this craziness, then they need to really rethink what they're doing.\n\nWill a lot of people see antifa and their methods as a poor reflection of the left? Absolutely. But I also think that these are not people who were going to vote Democrat anyway. If you read the news or pay attention to what's happening, you know that Nancy Pelosi has nothing to do with antifa. This group loathes the Democratic Party, and they don't hide that.\n\nSo anyone who blames the Democrats for antifa is likely already disposed to vote Republican anyway.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\nA star-studded film explains the hope and hype behind regenerative agriculture.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Paul Gosar of Arizona was already spreading a baseless conspiracy theory that antifa had provoked the chaos.\n\nBy that evening, two more congressional Republicans had joined him. First, Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks, who told Lou Dobbs that while there could have been \"some\" Trump supporters, it also \"could be any other number of groups, anarchists or what have you.\"\n\nThen, to audible boos on the floor of the House of Representatives, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz said he had \"some pretty compelling evidence from a facial recognition company showing that some of the people that breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and in fact were members of the violent terrorist group, antifa.\"\n\nBuzzFeed News reported that XRVision (the facial recognition company Gaetz is citing) calls this argument \"completely false,\" saying that they in fact had \"identified two members of neo-Nazi organizations and a QAnon supporter among the pro-Trump mob - not Antifa members.\"\n\nEarlier Wednesday, thousands of participants of a \"Save America\" rally marched from the park near the White House to the Capitol steps and forced their way past police into the building. Animated by the false belief that the election had been stolen from President Donald Trump and encouraged by the man himself - as well as a host of Republicans, including Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, who were leading the effort to oppose the Electoral College count meant to have gone on Wednesday - the Trump supporters entered the building.\n\nThey broke windows, attacked police officers, and ultimately stalled the business of the day: acknowledging the reality of President-elect Joe Biden's victory.\n\nConspiracies about the whole exhibition being a false-flag operation - an act committed with the intent to disguise the perpetrator and cast blame on someone else - run by antifa spread quickly on Twitter and Reddit . But Gosar was the first federally elected official to amplify the baseless conspiracy, and it took only three hours for him to get there.\n\nA lot is still unknown about the insurrection. But at present, there is no evidence that there are members of antifa who were a part of this crowd. However, there is ample evidence that prominent Trump supporters and members of QAnon were present during the illegal takeover of the building.\n\nRick Saccone, a Republican former member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives who was defeated by Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb in 2018, posted a photo of himself on Facebook with the caption, \"We are storming the capitol. Our vanguard has broken thru the barricades. We will save this nation. Are u with me?\" Additionally, the Arizona Republic reported that Jake Angeli, a prominent local supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory who has been \"a fixture at Arizona right-wing political rallies,\" was pictured prominently among the violent mob.\n\nMoreover, as BuzzFeed News reported , Trump supporters had been \"openly planning for weeks on both mainstream social media and the pro-Trump internet\" to riot in DC. One message, which BuzzFeed reports was upvoted more than 500 times, simply read \"Storm the Capitol.\"\n\nThis attempt to scapegoat antifa is, on one hand, absurd. The entire sordid affair was livestreamed, photographed, and televised; the rioters themselves tweeted and posted online about it. On the other hand, it's a page right out of the Trump playbook.\n\nAs Vox's Zack Beauchamp has reported , antifa is a \"loose ideological label for a subset of left-wing radicals who believe in using street-level force to prevent the rise of what they see as fascist movements.\" Trump has elevated them as a foil to right-wing violent actors like the Proud Boys, repeatedly claiming that there are bad actors on \"both sides\" of conflicts or using them to deflect blame when criticism falls on the most extreme members of his base.\n\nJust yesterday, Trump tweeted that \"Antifa is a Terrorist Organization, stay out of Washington. Law enforcement is watching you closely,\" even as reports indicated that the pro-Trump mob could become violent.\n\nWhen pro-Trump drivers attempted to run a Biden campaign bus off the road on November 1, Trump tweeted \"in my opinion these patriots did nothing wrong\" and instructed the FBI and the Justice Department to investigate antifa instead.\n\nDuring the first presidential debate against Biden, Fox News moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump to condemn white supremacists. Instead of doing so, he named the far-right hate group the Proud Boys, telling them to \"stand back and stand by,\" and then quickly pivoted to saying, \"But I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing.\"\n\nIt's impossible to disprove a false-flag operation, and it's the simplest way to give your supporters an excuse to continue supporting you. If the violent acts are committed by impostors, then you don't have to feel bad about supporting your team. In fact, it could even be used to justify radical actions by your own team if they're responding to radical behavior by the opposing side.\n\nThis must be another level of cognitive dissonance for Trump's supporters: Prominent Republicans and right-wingers are photographed and recorded in broad daylight among the mob just minutes after Trump was onstage telling the soon-to-turn-violent crowd that the election had been stolen from them. But Trump has perfected this strategy, and, like a charm, this conspiracy theory is gaining serious traction.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe problem with labeling your least-favorite protest group as \"terrorists.\"\n\nby Daniel Byman\n\nWhen I write about the threat of white supremacist terrorism , I often receive complaints from readers that I am focusing on the wrong problem and that my articles are ill-informed and misleading (I'm putting the complaints politely). Instead of focusing on white supremacists, they argue, I should instead write about the \"real\" terrorists like antifa and Black Lives Matter.\n\nTheir opinions are backed up by statements from the police and Trump administration officials and images of burning cities. The terrorism label, for them, is a way of distinguishing who is in the wrong. Brian Jenkins, a leading scholar of terrorism, observed in 1981: \"Terrorism is what the bad guys do.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Black Lives Matter, there's no credible case for labeling it a terrorist organization. One analysis of the Black Lives Matter protests found that 93 percent were peaceful, and some of the violent incidents at the rallies were simply opportunistic vandalism .\n\nMost of the protest leaders have tried to stop looting and other violence, recognizing this is counterproductive as well as wrong. Moreover, Black Lives Matter is an open movement with a host of organizations participating along with self-proclaimed supporters rather than a tight group with a defined membership. Thus, labeling the movement as a whole as violent is false.\n\nBut not all violence is terrorism, either. In many instances, even those who do actively promote and use violence don't merit the label \"terrorist.\"\n\nSo what about individuals and groups that have been credibly linked to violence in Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, and other cities? Where does antifa fit in? Or right-wing militia-type groups like Patriot Prayer? How about individuals such as the shooter at the Kenosha, Wisconsin, protests ? Should we call all of these people terrorists?\n\nThe answer is not as straightforward as you might think.\n\nIt's easy to dodge this question and conclude that there is no real agreement on the definition of terrorism. One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter , as the old saying goes - an argument one still hears walking the halls of the United Nations. As my colleague Chris Meserole and I have pointed out , even close US allies don't agree with the United States - or even with one another - as to which groups are terrorists.\n\nHowever, serious analysts such as Bruce Hoffman and Boaz Ganor , as well as US statutes and various government agencies have all tried to define terrorism. Important for all these efforts is an attempt to put aside the question of the justness of the cause - whether someone is the \"bad guy\" - and focus on the goals and actions of the perpetrator. So one can favor a cause (national liberation, say) but still label the violence used to achieve it as terrorism. Conversely, one can oppose a cause without considering those advocating for it to be terrorists.\n\nSerious terrorism definitions have several factors in common, most of which are self-evident, but a few require a bit more explanation.\n\nFirst, terrorism involves violence or the threat of it: Marches, protests, and similar peaceful activities do not meet the criteria. Stone-throwing or other low-level forms of violence, including street brawls and physical assaults, could technically be counted, but it's best to maintain a high bar when using the terrorism label. Otherwise, major terror attacks like the 2018 shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - in which a gunman killed 11 people in the deadliest attack on Jews on American soil - get diluted by numerous non-lethal events.\n\nSecond, terrorism is inherently political. The target and motivation need to be linked to a broader cause or ideology. It need not be a wholly rational or achievable cause. But having such a cause is what distinguishes terrorism from crime, personal passion, or other common reasons for violence.\n\nThird, terrorism is perpetrated by non-state actors. That's a political science term that basically means anyone who's not acting as the agent of a recognized government. Soldiers and police officers, for instance, are state actors. Members of paramilitary groups, militias, private corporations, and non-governmental organizations are all non-state actors.\n\nTo be clear: There is no moral difference between a state agent such as a soldier planting a bomb in a marketplace and killing dozens of civilians versus this same action being done by a non-state actor, but it is important for our definitions.\n\nThe United States also tries to carve out \" clandestine agents \" of the state - such as when Libyan intelligence officers bombed Pan Am 103 in 1988, killing 270 people - as part of its terrorism definition, which further muddies the waters.\n\nA fourth criterion - and one that is highly relevant to this discussion - is that terrorism is \"designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target,\" in Bruce Hoffman's words . The purpose of the violence, accordingly, is not just (or even primarily) to hurt, kill, or destroy the immediate target, but rather to convey a message.\n\nIt is this psychological effect that gives terrorism its power, inspiring fear in individuals far from the blast zone, fomenting civil wars, reshaping foreign policy by producing an over-reaction, and otherwise having far more impact than the death toll and destruction of the initial attack itself.\n\nPart of the psychological effect is also a high degree of intentionality. Shootings at an anti-racism rally may scare others in another city, but for it to count as terrorism the shootings needed to be intended to have a broader effect - the purpose of violence at the rally, in other words, is to shape opinion far outside the city in question. It's not enough for the violence to inadvertently scare (\"terrorize\") people far away from it. Rather, such fear must be the goal.\n\nThere's another commonly used criterion that involves who is being targeted by the violence: Many terrorism definitions require that the targets be civilians or noncombatants. If an attack targets military forces on the battlefield in the middle of a war, for instance, it might not be considered terrorism, but rather a regular military or guerrilla operation.\n\nBut this gets complicated really quickly: What if it's an attack on military forces, but it takes place far outside a war zone? What if there's no war at all, and the soldiers are just stationed at a military base somewhere?\n\nTake, for example, al-Qaeda's suicide bombing of USS Cole, a US Navy guided-missile destroyer, while the ship was refueling off the coast of Yemen. The attack killed 17 sailors, but did so outside a designated war zone. Whether that incident counts as a terrorist attack could vary depending on how this criterion is applied.\n\nAnd what about police officers? They're not soldiers, but nor are they pure civilians like shoppers at a Walmart, for example. This adds to the fuzziness.\n\nTerrorism definitions are muddy, and there is legitimate disagreement as to which deeds qualify. However, some factors, especially the intentional psychological effect, are important when considering how to categorize recent unrest and violence in the US.\n\nLet's apply these definitional criteria to the individuals and groups in question here.\n\nThe marches, counter-marches, and most of the violence surrounding them in Portland and other cities are certainly political (with the exception of some of the opportunistic looting and property destruction), and involve non-state actors: two boxes checked. After that, however, things get more fraught.\n\nAs mentioned above, there is no evidence Black Lives Matter either advocates for or engages in violence. So right there, it's disqualified for the terrorism label.\n\nThe violent label better fits some supporters of antifa , which is short for \"anti-fascist\" and is not a group but rather a loose network of like-minded individuals. Some self-proclaimed members, often anarchists, vandalize property, and many go to rallies to fight with (they would say defend against) white supremacists and others they label as fascists.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League notes that a lot of antifa activity occurs online, often in the form of harassing right-wing extremists and white supremacists and doxxing them - outing them to their employers and communities.\n\nBut the League also says: \"While some antifa use their fists, other violent tactics include throwing projectiles, including bricks, crowbars, homemade slingshots, metal chains, water bottles, and balloons filled with urine and feces.\" Because of this violence, they deserve to be rejected and condemned (and, when they use violence, arrested).\n\nHowever, this threat is blown way out of proportion. Claims that antifa is devilishly cunning or crazily violent are common, leading to many conspiracy theories - President Trump claims, for example, that they have weaponized soup cans . It's gotten so outlandish that jokingly comparing antifa's dastardly antics with those used by the Roadrunner to trick Wile E. Coyote in the Looney Tunes cartoons has become a meme on Twitter.\n\nBut antifa in the United States was not linked to deadly violence until August 29, when self-proclaimed antifa member Michael Reinoehl allegedly shot a right-wing activist who was a member of Patriot Prayer. (In 2018, an antifa supporter attacked an ICE facility armed with a rifle and was shot to death.)\n\nHowever, even when they use violence, antifa's targets are local - they do not seem to be intentionally trying to cause a broader psychological effect.\n\nReinoehl, for example, claimed he was simply providing \"security\" at Black Lives Matter protests (on his own initiative, it seems) and said that he shot the Patriot Prayer member in self-defense, believing he and a friend were about to be stabbed. In an interview with Vice before he was killed by police seeking to arrest him, Reinoehl claimed, \"I could have sat there and watched them kill a friend of mine of color. But I wasn't going to do that.\" The ICE facility attacker may have been suicidal , and reports so far suggest his focus was just on that particular facility. In neither case were they seeking a broader psychological effect.\n\nElevating this violence to terrorism, as President Trump has called for , exaggerates its scope and scale. As Colin Clarke and Michael Kenney argue, \"Though sucker-punching someone in the face is certainly violent, it's not terrorism.\" If antifa transitions and Reinoehl-type shooters become more regular or are embraced by more within the network, then the terrorism question should be reconsidered. This is especially so if future violence is intended to have a far-reaching psychological effect.\n\nHowever, the amorphous nature of the movement makes any designation difficult in practice as it is not clear where antifa begins and ends and who, if anyone, is responsible for its violent activities beyond the individuals in question.\n\nPatriot Prayer is a group with a political cause - it's pro-Trump and anti-left - and it engages in violence. Patriot Prayer has connections to law enforcement and white supremacists and to the hate group Proud Boys but insists it rejects racism. Its members often go to rallies, armed, seeking conflict with members of antifa .\n\nSo far, though, these clashes have not been lethal, a supporter of the group has threatened opponents with \"bullets put into your head.\" Although terrorism includes the threat of violence as well as violence itself, given the level of vitriol on the internet today, such threats don't justify calling the entire group a terrorist group.\n\nLike with antifa, when Patriot Prayer members are violent, their goals and targets do not seem intended to create a broad psychological effect. On Facebook, Patriot Prayer describes itself as \"encouraging the country to fight for freedom at a local level using faith in God to guide us in the right direction.\" Its focus is local and its members are largely about fighting the other side in the streets. So for Patriot Prayer, the terrorism label similarly doesn't work.\n\nFinally, there's Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old charged with murder in the fatal shooting of at least two people during a night of protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in late August.\n\nRittenhouse was at least loosely tied to a political cause, casting himself as a defender of law and order against violence associated with marches protesting the Kenosha police shooting of Jacob Blake, who was shot in the back seven times by a police officer. Rittenhouse in his social media posts described himself as pro-police and claimed to a Daily Caller reporter that he traveled to Kenosha to protect businesses and help anyone who was hurt.\n\nAvailable evidence suggests no intentionality on Rittenhouse's part to cause a broader psychological effect. He seems to simply have seen himself as doing his part to help out law enforcement - even though he was armed with a powerful assault-style weapon and not a trained law enforcement official.\n\nPart of it is simply a question of demonization. Taking away the \"terrorism\" label forces us to think more clearly and critically about why the groups or individuals are acting as they are.\n\nMore important, though, it affects which agencies and government authorities are invoked to deal with these groups and individuals. Protests, even violent ones, are traditionally a matter for the police and, if they need backup, the National Guard. Terrorism, in contrast, involves the FBI and other national security agencies.\n\nIn a post-9/11 world, terrorism is considered a grave threat that must be crushed. When President Trump uses the term terrorism as a label for largely peaceful protesters, he is abusing the word and making an overreaction more likely.\n\nThe cities affected by the protests and the nation as a whole should condemn and try to stop any violence while encouraging peaceful demonstrations. However, using the terrorism label obscures more than it clarifies, creating a misleading impression of the demonstrations and the proper response.\n\nDaniel Byman is a professor in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and a senior fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nTrump did not address members of the alt-right gathering for a Portland rally, but he did say he's considering designating antifa an \"organization of terror.\"\n\nby Zeeshan Aleem\n\nPresident Trump issued a stark warning to antifa, the collective of militant anti-fascist leftist groups, ahead of a rally on Saturday in Portland, Oregon, where antifa activists were widely expected to confront far-right activists.\n\n\"Major consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an 'ORGANIZATION OF TERROR,'\" Trump tweeted . \"Portland is being watched very closely. Hopefully the Mayor will be able to properly do his job!\"\n\nNotably, the president did not warn or criticize the controversial right-wing group organizing the rally that antifa was planning to protest against. Organizers Joe Biggs and Enrique Tarrio, who did not receive a permit for the rally , are members of the Proud Boys, a group of self-proclaimed \"Western chauvinists\" with links to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and a history of violence against left-wing activists. The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated them as a hate group.\n\nPortland Mayor Ted Wheeler told the Oregonian he believed self-described members of the alt-right like Biggs and Tarrio come to Portland hoping to foment violence, well aware that it is home to a large antifa contingent, Rose City Antifa. \"I think they come to Portland because it gives them a platform,\" Wheeler said. \"They know that if they come here conflict is almost guaranteed.\"\n\nOf Trump's tweet, Wheeler said , \"Frankly, it is not helpful.\"\n\nTrump's disinterest in criticizing the Proud Boys is part of a longer trend in which he's remained completely silent or, at most, has been mildly critical of the threat posed by white nationalist and white supremacist organizations, many of whom view his presidency as a boon for their cause and whose language echoes that of the president.\n\nTrump often undercuts his criticism of hate with statements that run counter to the point he seems to be making, and with political talking points. As Vox's Aaron Rupar writes, following a mass shooting that killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue , \"Trump responded by reading a speech in which he denounced the 'evil anti-Semitic attack.' But during unscripted comments later that same day, he lamented that there wasn't an armed guard inside the synagogue.\"\n\nAnd following the recent shooting in El Paso - in which the shooter left writings that made it clear he hoped to target members of the Latinx community - Trump said \"one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy,\" but also blamed mental illness and video games for the violence.\n\nThe president also, infamously, responded to the death of Heather Heyer amid the violence in Charlottesville by saying there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of a protest that included neo-Nazis and members of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nTrump has been repeatedly critical of antifa, however, and has threatened in the past to label the association a terrorist organization. GOP lawmakers have already made symbolic gestures to the same effect: In July, Republican Sens. Ted Cruz (TX) and Bill Cassidy (LA) introduced a nonbinding resolution that would label antifa activists as terrorists.\n\n\"Antifa are terrorists, violent masked bullies who 'fight fascism' with actual fascism, protected by Liberal privilege,\" Cassidy said in a statement . \"Bullies get their way until someone says no. Elected officials must have courage, not cowardice, to prevent terror.\"\n\nPart of what would make Cassidy and Cruz's effort difficult (beyond the fact that antifa has not yet committed any terror acts) is that antifa is not a centrally organized organization. Its members mostly participate in actions anonymously, making it difficult to pin down a clearly stated ideology or code of ethics toward violence.\n\n\"The group of typically black-clad activists are radicals who believe the best way to deal with the rise of white supremacy and hate groups in the Trump era is by confronting them on the street,\" Vox's Zack Beauchamp has explained . \"Sometimes, this means organizing demonstrations against them; other times, it means brawling in the streets.\"\n\nPortland has seen a striking number of brawls between antifa and far-right groups in recent years. The Proud Boys themselves have a known record of violence against their political adversaries. Two members of Proud Boys are currently on trial in New York and are charged with, among other things, attempted gang assault.\n\nIn anticipation of a standoff between antifa and the members of the alt-right who gathered in the city Saturday, Mayor Wheeler and Portland Police Chief Danielle Outlaw ordered that no police officers would have the day off , and more than two dozen other agencies, including the FBI, were involved in preparation. Fortunately, despite some altercations, the protests remained largely peaceful and the bulk of the alt-right demonstrators were escorted out of the area police had cordoned off for them following a brief event.\n\nBoth antifa and alt-right representatives called the event a success; Trump, however, did not tweet what he took away from his close watch of the situation.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe self-appointed spokesperson of antifa talks to Vox\n\nby Sean Illing\n\n\"I want to force them out of the shadows.\"\n\nThat's what Daryle Jenkins, a longtime activist and antifa member, told me in a recent interview. Antifa is a loose network of left-wing activists who physically confront and publicize the personal information of people they consider fascists.\n\nThese are the black-clad folks who show up at alt-right rallies or conferences in order to shut them down before they happen. Since the events in Charlottesville a few weeks ago, Jenkins has emerged as an unofficial spokesperson for antifa.\n\nJenkins is perhaps not what you'd expect the public face of antifa to look like. He's 49 years old, an African American, and an Air Force veteran. He lives in Philadelphia but spends a lot of his time traveling around the country in pursuit of white supremacists.\n\nHe attends their conferences. He shows up at their rallies. He films them, takes their pictures, and exposes them publicly. This is what he's done since 2000, when he co-founded One People's Project, a watchdog group that tracks right-wing hate groups and maintains a database of their membership.\n\nUnhappy with the media coverage of antifa, Jenkins has embraced the spotlight, hoping to dispel some of the myths around the group. In this interview, he responds to some of my objections to antifa. We also talk about his tactic of doxxing white supremacists (meaning he outs them to their employers and communities).\n\n\"My view is that you have to be aggressive. You have to expose these people,\" Jenkins told me. \"White supremacists are more afraid of us than we are of them. They know we can cause more damage to them than they can cause to us.\"\n\nOur full conversation, lightly edited for clarity, follows.\n\nBefore we get into antifa, tell me about your personal politics.\n\nFor the last couple of years, I've increasingly come to think of myself as an anarchist, but for many years I simply identified as a leftist. These labels are slippery, as you know, so it's never that simple. But generally speaking, I'm of the left.\n\nThose are very different things, right? An anarchist wants no government, a leftist wants more government, or at least better government.\n\nThe way I think of anarchism is that it refuses to recognize an authority that doesn't deserve to be recognized. So I'm still comfortable supporting government so long as that government is just and upholds righteous principles.\n\n\"White supremacists needed to know that they aren't a majority, that this is not the country they want it to be - not today, not ever\"\n\nLet's talk about antifa , the militant left-wing group that has received a lot of attention since Charlottesville. You've emerged as one of the faces of this group. Do you own that label?\n\nAbsolutely. I proudly stand with antifa, and I've always been antifa, even before people knew what that meant. People keep talking about antifa like it's a comprehensive belief system, but it's not. antifa, as a group, simply stands against fascists - and we fight them wherever they emerge. Once upon a time, anti-fascists were just called civil rights activists or anti-racist activists. So this isn't exactly new or unusual.\n\nYou know a lot of people would shudder at that comparison, right? The majority of the civil rights activists were nonviolent and engaged in organized acts of strategic civil disobedience. That's not exactly what antifa is up to.\n\nI agree with that. There's definitely a tactical difference between antifa and Martin Luther King's movement.\n\nAntifa endorses violence as a justifiable means, and I assume you do as well. Why?\n\nI'm glad you brought this up, because I've noticed a lot of attention has been placed on antifa's use of violence. But it's not as though we're running around like the nihilists in A Clockwork Orange looking for a nasty fight. Violence is not a central component of what we do and it's definitely not the only thing we do. It's not preferred or even the first option.\n\nAnd you, personally, how do you think about violence in defense of your political goals?\n\nLook, I was a police officer in the Air Force. I was trained to deescalate situations. That's how I approach things. I try as much as I can to deescalate, and if I can't, I'm prepared to do what I have to do to protect myself and anyone around me.\n\nI take that to mean you're usually armed at events like Charlottesville?\n\nYes.\n\nDo you think your emphasis on deescalation is shared by most of the people in antifa?\n\nWhile we do have some people who go on the offensive, that's not what I do. I try to encourage folks to not put themselves in bad positions. I tell them to not make themselves the aggressor or the bad guy when you're not. But what's happened over the last couple of years is that the frustration levels have gone way up. People are lashing out now. There's a desperation setting in and people don't know what to do.\n\n\"If I can help turn any of these people around, great. If not, I'll see them in the streets.\"\n\nIs this about Trump?\n\nOf course it is. Everything really started to ratchet up during these Trump rallies. People were getting attacked by his supporters and he was encouraging it, celebrating it. We were asking, \"How is he getting away with this?\" These were peaceful protesters, and a candidate for president of the United States was cracking jokes about protesters leaving on \"stretchers.\" So we decided that this couldn't go unanswered any longer; we had to fight back.\n\nDo you see the events in Charlottesville as a turning point? Because my sense is that things are going to get worse before they get better.\n\nI don't know. I think after Charlottesville, cooler heads can prevail. But I think the neo-Nazis who went to Charlottesville had to be reminded that we won't stand for this, that we won't allow them to be normalized. White supremacists needed to know that they aren't a majority, that this is not the country they want it to be - not today, not ever.\n\nYou've made a name for yourself traveling around the country and pestering white supremacist groups. You show up at their conferences and rallies. You film them, take their pictures, and then expose them online. Why?\n\nMy view is that you have to be aggressive. You have to expose these people. My vocation is journalism. I'm looking to gather information and bring it to light. This is the age of show us or it didn't happen. So I show who these people are, what they do, and what they believe. I want to force them out of the shadows.\n\nWhen you say expose them, you mean dox them, right?\n\nExactly. Our belief is that we research and report on these groups and encourage communities to be proactive in dealing with them. This diminishes their ability to hide and function. This is why we expose them.\n\nSo you take their pictures, find out their names, and share that information with their communities, their friends, their employers?\n\nYes, all of that. We share it with communities and employers in particular. We contact anybody that may be receptive to this particular information. Most importantly, we make sure it's on our website. We write new stories, and we also write mini-bios of various individuals as well. And that exposes them. They don't like that.\n\nHow successful have you been in getting people fired or marginalized in their communities?\n\nFairly successful. We've ended campaigns, we've shut down conferences before they could happen, we've caused people to lose their jobs, and we've exposed a lot of people's criminal records.\n\n\"If you think what antifa is doing is wrong, then you stand up and do what's right\"\n\nI imagine you've made a lot of enemies. Any close calls?\n\nThe other sides know who I am. I've been threatened. The FBI once called me to let me know there was a credible threat to blow up my parent's house. But look, white supremacists are more afraid of us than we are of them. They know we can cause more damage to them than they can cause to us.\n\nThe truth is that I try not to dwell on the risks. I take precautions. I do what I can. I make sure that I'm safe and that my family is safe. What else can I do?\n\nWhy take on these risks? Why expose yourself in this way?\n\nIt has to be done. It's really that simple. I'm not blind. I understand that there are real risks here. But there are also real risks for society. We can't let these movements go unchallenged. And I have no problem putting myself on the front line.\n\nYou're also known for trying to engage with these people. What are you trying to understand? Something I've struggled with is trying to understand how some people, especially young people, get sucked into this world. There are obviously committed racists, people who've always been racists, but there are also some people whose lives are so empty, so marked by failure, that they get drawn into a movement that makes them feel important or meaningful. Are these the ones you try to reach?\n\nYou have to recognize that these people are still human, and a lot of them have all kinds of baggage. Take the guy who killed Heather Heyer at the Charlottesville rally. This is a guy who just failed at life. He was a guy who couldn't hack it in the military, who beat up his own mother, and I'm sure becoming a white nationalist made his life more purposeful.\n\nThe point isn't to sympathize with these people or to excuse what they do. I try to reach out when I can. I try to keep the door open as long as I can. But at the end of the day, these people are trying to hurt others and that comes first. That's what we have to deal with, that's what we have to stop, no matter what it takes. If I can help turn any of these people around, great. If not, I'll see them in the streets.\n\nI'm fine with the doxxing and the other nonviolent tactics, but I think antifa's street tactics undermine their cause. I'm not a pacifist and I accept the utility of violence, but antifa isn't merely squaring off against self-identified neo-Nazis. They also shut down obnoxious political entrepreneurs like Ann Coulter or professional trolls like Milo Yiannopoulos. Now these people may be assholes, but they're not violent fascists. What cause is served by censoring their speech or violently disrupting their events?\n\nI want folks to keep their heads about themselves whenever things start to go downhill, and I don't want to see people just lashing out in anger. Now I realize some people won't like what antifa does or what the Black Bloc does at these protest events, but you have to remember that people like Milo or Ann have serious problems and their speech is very destructive in its own way.\n\nBut the question is, does shutting down the speech of people like Milo or Ann, who aren't violent fascists, advance the anti-fascist cause? Using violence to stamp out speech is itself a kind of fascism.\n\nI think this has to be taken on a case-by-case basis. Personally, I want to hear from conservative voices. I want to hear what they believe and why they believe it. I think we need dialogue.\n\nBut when you have someone like a Pam Geller [who founded the group Stop the Islamization of America ] who shows up on campuses not to engage in dialogue but to insult liberals and Muslims and to incite violence, we're not merely talking about free speech here. Or when someone like Milo goes on stage and starts outing transgender students, I don't think we can treat that as simply a free speech issue.\n\nFree speech doesn't necessarily mean dialogue, right? It means we have the right to say offensive things, to be an asshole in public. Now I get that antifa doesn't believe neo-Nazis have a right assembly or free speech, but a guy like Milo is in a different category, no?\n\nHe has the right to be an asshole. But we also have a right to deny him the forum to be an asshole if he's going to endanger other people or otherwise do harm. Like I said, I want to hear voices of conservatism. But this isn't about conservatism anymore. People have a right to stand up and say, \"You can't come to our campus and insult us in this way and then deny us the right to respond.\" I don't endorse using violence in this context, but I stand by the people who say, \"No, not here, not on our campus.\"\n\nHow do you see all this racial tension playing out? The alt-right is ascendant, the militant left is rising up in response to it. Are we falling into spiral of action, reaction, and escalation?\n\nI'm going to keep doing what I'm doing.

But this weekend, members attacked cops and journalists.\n\nby Jennifer Williams\n\nSunday's counterprotests against the white nationalist \"Unite the Right 2\" rally in Washington, DC, were largely peaceful. Thousands of people held multiple rallies across the city to celebrate diversity and push back against the hateful views the white nationalists espouse.\n\nBut a few left-wing \" antifa \" (short for \"anti-fascist\") counterprotesters did engage in violence, throwing eggs and water bottles and shooting fireworks at police officers and some journalists who were covering the demonstrations.\n\nNPR reporter Tim Mak captured video of the scene:\n\nMak also narrowly missed getting hit with an egg himself:\n\nDemonstrators also clashed with journalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday, during an event marking the one-year anniversary of the killing of Heather Heyer by a Unite the Right participant at the first rally.\n\nNBC News's Cal Perry posted video of protesters shoving their hands into his camera, trying to cover the lens and asking him to stop filming:\n\nA bit later, Perry posted another video of a protester shouting, \"Fuck you, snitch-ass news bitch! Fuck you!\" and aggressively swatting away Perry's camera:\n\nThis is not the first time antifa protesters have been violent. In August 2017, about 100 anarchists and antifa members assaulted far-right demonstrators who were marching peacefully in Berkeley, California, with pepper spray, water bottles, and direct physical assault.\n\nAs Vox's German Lopez wrote at the time, \"The argument for antifa activists is that the current crop of right-wing protesters - which are partly but not entirely made up of neo-Nazis, KKK members, and other white supremacists and nationalists - are so extreme that they must be stopped swiftly and even violently.\"\n\nLopez continued:\n\nAntifa supporters worry that if these groups' views aren't completely robbed of any kind of platform, they could gain legitimacy - and take advantage of democratic ideals like free speech to, ironically, promote their undemocratic messages. Violence is one way to get them off the stage.\n\nWhat this view misses is the backlash that may come from political violence: that such violence can reinforce right-wing views about the left. As Michael Kazin, a history professor at Georgetown University and editor of Dissent magazine, told me earlier this year, \"[N]on-leftists often see [the left] as a disruptive, lawless force. Violence tends to confirm that view.\"\n\nThis weekend in Charlottesville and DC, though, it wasn't neo-Nazis and white supremacists the antifa attacked. It was police who were there to help keep the peace among all the demonstrators and journalists who were there to cover the events.\n\nHow that factors into antifa's ideology is anyone's guess.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nGiven the Court's Republican supermajority, this case is unlikely to end well for trans people.\n\nLearn about saving, spending, investing, and more in a monthly personal finance advice column written by Nicole Dieker.\n\nThe latest news, analysis, and explainers coming out of the GOP Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe economy's stacked against us.\n\nA Texas judge issued a national ruling against medication abortion.

Fox News panics about the menace of \"leftist antifa thugs,\" local news networks worry about the prospect of anarchist invaders, and think piece after think piece warns that antifa's tactics are going too far.\n\nBut so far, antifa have made up a small part of the protests they showed up at. They may look scary, but much of the hype around them is a product of sensationalized media coverage.\n\nThat's because news cameras are incentivized to focus on the most extreme and badly behaved members of any protest. Whether it's Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, or the 1999 WTO protests in Seattle, media coverage is often drawn to sensational images of violence and property damage, even if those images only reflect the actions of a small percentage of protesters. That type of coverage creates an outlier bias, where small groups of radical protesters end up dominating coverage of protest movements as a whole.\n\nThe result is that protest movements are put in a kind of unwinnable situation: Viewers at home end up thinking most protesters are violent or dangerous, and protest leaders are forced into endless debates about tactics, rather than the issue they were protesting in the first place.\n\nYou can find this video and all of Vox's videos on YouTube .

Is it a group or an idea, and what do supporters want?\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  March 29, 2021 / 12:15 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nAntifa has seen a steady increase in media attention ever since former President Donald Trump took office in January 2017. Republicans often portray antifa as a highly organized group of \"terrorists\" worthy of national watch lists. Some conspiracy theorists falsely blamed antifa for the January 6 Capitol riots that led to five deaths .\n\nRight-wing media blames antifa members for rioting and looting. Democrats have also condemned such violence, but many on the left say the rhetoric about antifa is greatly exaggerated, and that it's less of an organized movement than just something of \"an idea.\"\n\nBut much of what politicians say about antifa isn't quite true. Here's what antifa is, what it isn't, and what you need to know.\n\nAntifa is not a highly organized movement, nor is it merely an idea. Antifa is a loose affiliation of local activists scattered across the United States and a few other countries.\n\nThe term \"antifa\" is short for anti-fascist; it's used both by its adherents and its foes.\n\nIn general, people who identify as antifa are known not for what they support , but what they oppose : Fascism, nationalism, far-right ideologies, white supremacy, authoritarianism, racism, homophobia and xenophobia. Some antifa activists also denounce capitalism and the government overall.\n\nMostly, people aligned with antifa are on the left of the political spectrum. Antifa is not, however, affiliated with President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party or its leaders. Mr. Biden has condemned antifa and called violence \"unacceptable.\"\n\nAntifa actions have included everything from tracking and publicly identifying members of alt-right groups to physically attacking adversaries.\n\nIn \" Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook ,\" author Mark Bray, an organizer for the Occupy Wall Street movement, lays out antifa's methods this way:\n\n\"Despite the media portrayal of a deranged, bloodthirsty antifa... the vast majority of anti-fascist tactics involve no physical violence whatsoever. Anti-fascists conduct research on the far right online, in person, and sometimes through infiltrations; they dox them, push central milieux to disown them, pressure bosses to fire them...\n\n\"But it's also true that some of them punch Nazis in the face and don't apologize for it.\"\n\nDuring public demonstrations, antifa activists often wear top-to-toe black; even before the coronavirus pandemic, they were also known for wearing face coverings at public gatherings.\n\nAntifa has no official national leadership, though followers have organized themselves into small, local cells that sometimes coordinate with other movements, such as Black Lives Matter. Some self-described antifa adherents have organized to confront Patriot Prayer , the Proud Boys , and other far-right groups during public demonstrations. Some of those rallies have devolved into violence.\n\nSome antifa adherents keep a very low profile, while other local groups venture to give themselves a more public profile with a name and a website . One of the oldest such groups appears to be Rose City Antifa, which says it was founded in Portland, Oregon , in 2007. According to its website, its main focus is \"any work that prevents fascist organizing, and when that is not possible, provides consequences to fascist organizers. This is supported by researching and tracking fascist organizations.\"\n\nOver Mr. Trump's years in office, coverage of \"antifa\" skyrocketed in the mainstream press. That coverage started on the day of his inauguration, when dozens of people took to the streets of the nation's capital in a protest that would soon grow violent. Authorities would later arrest several dozen of them, many of whom later identified themselves as antifa, and accuse them of starting fires and riots. Charges were eventually dropped for the bulk of the defendants, while others were acquitted by juries.\n\nMr. Trump pointed a finger at what he called the \"alt-left\" following the infamous \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017. After a white supremacist deliberately plowed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a woman named Heather Heyer , Mr. Trump sparked more outrage when he suggested an equivalency between the white supremacists and the protesters on the other side, who despite his claims were mostly peaceful.\n\n\"What about the alt-left that came charging at, what you say, the alt-right?\" Mr. Trump wondered aloud . \"Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they're charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs, do they have any problem? I think they do.\"\n\nIn the years since then, media coverage has identified antifa as participants, and sometimes agitators, in clashes at numerous rallies and protests around the country. That includes a 2017 anti-hate rally in Berkeley, California, and a Patriot Prayer \" freedom rally \" in Portland, Oregon, in 2018.\n\nIn at least one instance, a person self-identifying as an antifa supporter has been linked to a deadly attack at a protest. Michael Forest Reinoehl, 48, was considered a prime suspect in the August 2020 killing of 39-year-old Aaron \"Jay\" Danielson, a right-wing activist who was shot during heated demonstrations in Portland. Reinoehl was later shot to death by federal authorities as they moved to arrest him.\n\nReinoehl had described himself in a social media post as \"100% ANTIFA.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Bill Cassidy introduced a resolution calling for antifa to be labeled as a domestic terror organization. President Trump voiced his support on Twitter.\n\nMajor consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an \"ORGANIZATION OF TERROR.\" Portland is being watched very closely. Hopefully the Mayor will be able to properly do his job!\n\nBut at the time, the Trump administration's own Department of Homeland Security and FBI didn't appear to view antifa as a leading threat . A DHS draft document from September 2020 reportedly named white supremacist groups as the biggest terror threat to America. That same document doesn't mention antifa at all.\n\nThe FBI also considers far-right groups the \"top of the priority list.\" FBI director Christopher Wray said in February 2020 that the FBI places the risk of violence from racially-motivated extremist groups \"on the same footing\" as the threat posed by foreign terrorist organizations such as ISIS and its sympathizers.\n\nThat's not to say the FBI hasn't also taken aim at antifa. After arson and looting broke out amid the protests in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd, Wray said: \"We're seeing people who are exploiting this situation to pursue violent, extremist agendas - anarchists like ANTIFA, and other agitators. These individuals have set out to sow discord and upheaval, rather than join in the righteous pursuit of equality and justice.\"\n\nBut the idea of designating antifa a terror group worries some civil rights advocates.\n\n\"The designation would grant federal law enforcement broad powers, under the federal terrorism code, to surveil and investigate anyone labeled as antifa,\" the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a statement. \"It could also allow federal law enforcement to broadly target anyone involved in protests viewed unfavorably by the Trump administration, even retroactively.\"\n\nThe center added, \"President Trump's announcement is rooted in politics, not the present realities of the terror threat in the U.S.\"\n\nAntifa has earned its reputation for sporadic violence. But many other rumors about antifa have been spun from whole cloth, sometimes by people later identified as right-wing extremists. In June 2020, Twitter shut down multiple fake antifa accounts that were inciting violence against white suburbs; subsequent investigations tracked the accounts to Identity Evropa, a white supremacist organization.\n\nRight-wing figures and other commentators on social media also have falsely accused unspecified antifa members of starting wildfires on the West Coast, prompting police and fire officials to appeal to the public to stop spreading what one agency called \"an UNTRUE rumor.\"\n\nAnother common conspiracy theory has alleged, without evidence , that billionaire philanthropist George Soros is funding antifa.\n\nAfter the January 6 Capitol riots that left five dead, including a Capitol police officer , false rumors claimed antifa was behind the attacks. In fact, among the hundreds of criminal complaints filed so far, dozens involve suspects affiliated with right-wing organizations including Oath Keepers , Proud Boys , Three Percenters, and pro-Trump followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nOne alleged rioter reportedly told friends that he planned to pose as antifa to fool law enforcement.\n\n\"When we looked at the data around the insurrection, we saw literally millions of pro-Trump [internet] posts that repeated the phrase 'antifa,'\" said CBSN tech reporter Dan Patterson. \"[But] when we look at the data, this boogeyman is nonexistent.\"\n\n© 2020 CBS Interactive Inc.

The account's removal was first reported by NBC News .\n\n\"This account violated our platform manipulation and spam policy , specifically the creation of fake accounts. We took action after the account sent a Tweet inciting violence and broke the Twitter Rules\" the company said.\n\nTwitter said it has also targeted other fake accounts run by Identity Evropa, but did not provide examples. The company said the accounts posted hateful tweets targeting race, religion and sexual orientation.\n\nAn Identity Evropa account purported to be associated with Antifa, a collection of loosely connected groups that organize against fascism . On Sunday, Attorney General William Barr said Antifa was associated with violence at recent protests. Officials have yet to show evidence to support this claim.\n\nWithout identifying any particular group, a May 31 Department of Homeland Security note warned that well-coordinated groups had \"potentially compromised\" law enforcement radio communications in Portland, Oregon over the weekend. The note warned that those seeking to incite violence in other locations could be \"monitoring local law enforcement communications to identify vulnerabilities in their operational security posture.\"\n\nDemocratic officials, including Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have said without evidence that white supremacist groups have been involved in violence.\n\nOn Friday, Denver police seized assault rifles from at least two people associated with a group called the  \"Boogaloo Bois\" near the site of a protest.\n\nIn a report Monday, the Anti-Defamation League described the \"Boogaloo Bois\" as \"right-wing anti-government extremists have also reacted to the protests and violence following the killing of George Floyd.\"\n\n\"ADL's Center on Extremism has been closely monitoring the protests nationwide, and it is our initial assessment that while a number of extremists - including anti-government agitators, anarchists and a handful of white supremacists - are taking an active role, these protests should not be categorized as \"extremist\" events at this point,\" the organization said in its report.\n\nThe nonprofit said that although there are white supremacists among the \"boogaloo\" followers, the group's focus is not explicitly race.\n\n\"Some white supremacists have also adopted the boogaloo concept, but most boogalooers are not white supremacist.  Rather, their orientation is anti-government and vehemently anti-police, a fact that has largely shaped their reactions to the protests against George Floyd's killing,\" the ADL said.\n\nAdditional reporting contributed by Dan Patterson.\n\nGraham Kates is an investigative reporter covering criminal justice, privacy issues and information security for CBS News Digital.

      "text": "House GOP leader says Trump both sought to blame antifa for Capitol violence and admitted he's partly responsible\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  January 12, 2021 / 10:02 AM EST / CBS News\n\nPresident Trump and close ally House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy spoke about the Capitol riots Monday, and during their heated conversation, the president kept repeating a conspiracy theory that antifa was responsible for the violence.\n\nMcCarthy confronted Mr. Trump on this, telling him that it wasn't antifa and that Trump supporters were entirely to blame for the rioting, according to a person with direct knowledge of the call.\n\nAxios first reported on Mr. Trump's attempts to blame Antifa during the call with McCarthy.\n\nBut the president also admitted to McCarthy that he is at least partially to blame for what transpired at the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday, the GOP leader recounted to fellow House Republicans during a conference call Monday. Multiple Republicans familiar with the discussion with the GOP conference confirmed the details to CBS News.\n\nThe call between the president and the top House Republican came on the same day Mr. Trump met face-to-face in the Oval Office with Vice President Pence for the first time since the deadly siege, during which protesters were heard chanting, \"Hang Mike Pence!\" During his call with Mr. Trump, McCarthy also urged him to call President-elect Joe Biden, the source with direct knowledge of the call said.\n\nHowever, any fraction of responsibility the president may have taken in that call with McCarthy appeared to have evaporated Tuesday. Twice, upon his departure for a trip to Alamo, Texas (not that Alamo), Mr. Trump called his address to supporters last Wednesday \"totally appropriate.\"\n\n\"If you read my speech - and many people have done itm and I've seen it both in the papers and in the media, on television - it's been analyzed, and people thought what I said was totally appropriate,\" the president said. And he tried to suggest that elements responsible for \"horrible riots in Portland and Seattle and various other places...was a real problem.\"\n\nMcCarthy's outreach to senior Republicans comes as the House is set to vote Tuesday on a resolution calling on Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment with Cabinet secretaries to remove the president from office. If Pence and the Cabinet do not do so, the House is expected to vote Wednesday on an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump, holding him responsible for inciting the mob that assaulted the Capitol, leaving five people dead .\n\nWhile many congressional Republicans have voiced opposition to impeaching Mr. Trump for a second time, including McCarthy, a handful of Republican senators have signaled they are open to impeachment charges or have called on the president to resign before his term expires on January 20.\n\nMcCarthy's struggle with the president over culpability for the storming of the Capitol comes as Republicans are trying to shore up financial support from some of the party's most reliable donors: top corporations. Since the violence last week, several Fortune 500 companies and other entities that regularly give to GOP candidates or campaign committees say they now either plan to withhold donations from the 147 House and Senate Republicans who voted against affirming the Electoral College results or at least temporarily suspend donations to Republican candidates. Some companies are suspending all political donations.\n\nWhile the decision has less of an impact on rank-and-file Republicans from reliably conservative districts, the freeze on corporate giving could adversely affect McCarthy's ability to continue raising money for his colleagues - a key element in maintaining a firm grip on his leadership post.\n\nIn a letter sent to House Republicans and obtained by CBS News, McCarthy wrote that he remains opposed to impeachment, writing it would \"have the opposite effect of bringing our country together when we need to get America back on a path towards unity and civility.\"\n\nHe said members across the conference had recommended other avenues to address the riots in the Capitol on Wednesday, including creating a bipartisan commission to study the attack , reforming the Electoral Count Act of 1887 and crafting legislation to \"promote voter confidence in future federal elections.\"\n\nThe other option McCarthy mentioned was a resolution of censure, though he did not say who would be censured. The letter did not mention Mr. Trump by name.\n\nMcCarthy also reiterated to fellow House Republicans that he too believes the president bears some responsibility for the mob and assault on the Capitol.\n\nThe House leader was among many senior Republicans who spoke with the president during the assault on Wednesday and pleaded with him to call off his supporters and send military assistance to quell the disturbance.\n\nKimberly Brown contributed reporting.\n\nMajor Garrett is CBS News' chief Washington correspondent.

      "text": "Trump said he intends to declare antifa as a terrorist organization. Here's what we know about the decades-old, leaderless group.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday announced plans to designate a left-wing group known as antifa as a \"terrorist organization,\" blaming the group and other unidentified \"radical left-wing\" organizations for ongoing civil unrest following the death of 46-year-old George Floyd.\n\nFloyd, a black man, died while in police custody on May 25. Video of the incident showed that a white police officer held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes , even after Floyd lost consciousness.  That officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter .\n\nThree other Minneapolis police officers present have been fired but have not been charged with a crime.\n\nFloyd's death has sparked protest - many peaceful but some violent -  in Minneapolis and other major cities throughout the US, including New York, DC, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Atlanta. Over the past week, some protests have resulted in the looting of business, destruction of property, and death.\n\n\"I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters, but in recent days our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, antifa, and others,\" Trump said at a June 1 press briefing.\n\nOther Republican leaders joined Trump in claiming that protests are the result of antifa, a leaderless, non-hierarchial organization that has existed for decades.\n\nArkansas Sen. Tom Cotton called ongoing protests the work of \"antifa terrorists\" in a June 1 tweet, echoing the president's rhetoric. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz similarly equated antifa with terrorists and said the members should be \"hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East.\"\n\nThe group has represented a boogeyman of sorts for Trump, who in July 2019 similarly threatened to classify the group as a terrorist organization after a clash between members of antifa and far-right group the Proud Boys in Portland led to the assault of a conservative journalist.\n\nWhile the group has existed for decades, its name seems to have entered mainstream vernacular after a white supremacist rally and counterprotests clashed in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017.  Trump was most likely referring to antifa activists when he blamed \"many sides\" for the violence in his initial statement on the Charlottesville violence. At a press conference later that week, Trump criticized what he called the \"alt-left \" for \"charging with clubs.\"\n\nIn and around Portland, Oregon, activists with the organization smashed windows and hurled smoke bombs during a series of riots following Trump's election. In August last year, 13 people were arrested in a clash between members of antifa and far-right groups.\n\nIt's not exactly clear how many demonstrators at ongoing protests are members of antifa.\n\n\"The radical left is much bigger than antifa, much, much bigger, and the number of people who are participating in the property destruction are much, much bigger than the radical left,\" Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University who authored \"Antifa: The Anti-Facist Handbook,\" told the Associated Press.\n\nAntifa, short for \"anti-fascist,\" describes a decentralized, leaderless movement dedicated to combatting right-wing authoritarianism and white supremacy. It has existed for decades but gained prominence after the election of President Donald Trump in 2016, and has continued to be associated with clashes and protests since.\n\nIts members include a mixture of anarchists, socialists, communists, and other far-left activists. It's unclear how many people count themselves as members, but local, autonomous chapters or cells exist in major cities across the US, in many cases accompanied by sizable online followings.\n\nThe movement's adherents reject the notion that white supremacy can be quashed by any government apparatus and believe it instead must be eradicated through direct action .\n\nBray said the group lacks hierarchical structure or universal set of tactics that would make it recognizable. Its members often to espouse revolutionary and anti-authoritarian views, he said.\n\nSometimes their action consists of traditional community-organizing efforts like peacefully protesting or fundraising. In other cases, Antifa activists have staged doxxing campaigns to expose suspected white supremacists to their employer or landlord and have sometimes used violence to clash with those they view as fascist.\n\nAntifa activists believe that legislative efforts or action from law enforcement are not only insufficient in expunging racist or fascist viewpoints but perpetuate them.\n\nThese beliefs were put on full display during the Charlottesville, Virginia, rally, when counterprotesters complained that the police had neglected to protect them from violence. It was antifa, instead, that had physically defended vulnerable counterprotesters and prevented further bloodshed, they argue.\n\n\"The police didn't do anything in terms of protecting the people of the community, the clergy,\" Cornel West, a prominent academic and activist, told The Washington Post . \"If it hadn't been for the anti-fascists protecting us from the neo-fascists, we would have been crushed like cockroaches.\"\n\nAntifa's origins are sometimes attributed to European movements in the 1930s against Nazis in Germany and Blackshirts in Italy, though a more direct and contemporary ancestor of the movement would be the far-left activists who opposed British neo-Nazis in the 1970s and 1980s during the height of the punk-rock subculture's popularity.\n\nIn the US and Canada, the Anti-Racist Action Network sprang up around the same time in the 1980s in a similarly loose and decentralized state that Antifa exists in today.\n\nAmerica's oldest antifa group that still operates is Rose City Antifa, which formed in 2007 in Portland, Oregon, according to Bray.\n\nBray previously wrote in The Washington Post that these early Antifa adherents typically faced outright animosity from the mainstream left for their attention to what was then seen as fringe, racist groups instead of tackling \"more large-scale, systemic injustices.\"\n\n\"Years before the alt-right even had a name, antifascists were spending thankless hours scouring seedy message boards and researching clandestine neo-Nazi gatherings,\" Bray wrote. \"They were tracking those who planted the seeds of the death that we all witnessed in Charlottesville.\"\n\nAntifa members don't hesitate to describe their movement as one that uses any means necessary to oppose fascism.\n\nA 2017 manual for organizing local antifa groups published on It's Going Down, an Antifa-supporting journal, advises prospective members to stay anonymous, track and document \"white nationalist, Far Right, and fascist activity,\" and organize demonstrations to counter events held by white nationalists or members of the so-called alt-right.\n\nThe manual warns against accepting \"people who just want to fight,\" adding that \"physically confronting and defending against fascists is a necessary part of anti-fascist work, but is not the only or even necessarily the most important part.\"\n\n\"No, I did not behave peacefully when I saw a thousand Nazis occupy a sizable American city,\" one activist wrote in a letter published on It's Going Down. \"I fought them with the most persuasive instruments at hand, the way both my grandfathers did. I was maced, punched, kicked, and beaten with sticks, but I gave as good as I got, and usually better. Donald Trump says that 'there was violence on both sides.' Of course there was.\"\n\nThe necessity of violence in the face of what they perceive as a growing fascist threat is a sentiment expressed by many antifa adherents, who emphasize that white nationalists often cannot be reasoned with or otherwise opposed.\n\n\"You need violence in order to protect nonviolence,\" Emily Rose Nauert, an antifa member best known for being punched in the face by a white nationalist during a clash at Berkeley in April 2017, told The New York Times . \"That's what's very obviously necessary right now. It's full-on war, basically.\"\n\nRight-wing critics of antifa have long expressed concerns about the chilling effect the group has on their First Amendment rights. Conservatives have also decried the groups sometimes violent and confrontational tactics.\n\nConservatives have long complained of censorship and infringement on their freedom of speech - particularly on college campuses, where predominantly left-wing student bodies and faculties have often succeeded at shutting or shouting down controversial right-wing speakers and events.\n\nAmong the most prominent of such instances was Berkeley's cancellation of Ann Coulter's campus speech in 2017 out of fear that far-left activists and antifa members would respond with violence. The American Civil Liberties Union denounced the cancellation as a \"heckler's veto,\" a legal term in which the government suppresses speech out of fear it will prompt a violent reaction.\n\nIn 2019, clashes between antifa members and far-right groups turned violent, leading to 13 arrests in August. In July, conservatives targeted the group after right-wing blogger Andy Ngo said he had been attacked by antifa members .\n\nThe GOP's yearslong calls for antifa to be labeled a terrorist organization have been amplified amid the ongoing protests surround Floyd's death and police brutality.\n\nIn statements about protests over Floyd's death , Attorney General William Barr described \"antifa-like tactics\" by out-of-state agitators and said antifa was instigating violence and engaging in \"domestic terrorism.\"\n\nThe right-wing media has also fixated on the antifa movement, portraying it as an example of violence inherent in left-wing ideology. Fox News' Jesse Watters even attempted to confront a purported antifa member on the air - a stint that backfired when it emerged that the purported antifa member was really an 18-year-old YouTuber apparently pulling a prank.\n\nTrump and his supporters have reacted to antifa violence with zeal, drawing parallels between the movement and the neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members who antifa oppose.\n\nTrump was possibly referring to antifa when he gave his now-infamous press conference at Trump Tower, during which he slammed what he called the alt-left - a term created by white nationalists that no actual left-wing group self-identifies under - as being equally to blame for violence in Charlottesville.\n\n\"What about the 'alt-left' that came charging at the, as you say, the 'alt-right'?\" Trump said in 2017. \"You had, you had a group on one side that was bad. And you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now.\"\n\nLiberals have generally been slow to acknowledge antifa. While some have lamented the violence at recent protests, others have reacted with amusement at certain antifa antics.\n\n\"Their presence at a protest is intended to intimidate and dissuade racists, but the use of violent measures by some antifa against their adversaries can create a vicious, self-defeating cycle of attacks, counter-attacks and blame,\" the Anti-Defamation League said of antifa . \"This is why most established civil rights organizations criticize antifa tactics as dangerous and counterproductive.\"\n\nOne of the most-witnessed instances of antifa violence came on Trump's January 2017 Inauguration Day, when an activist punched avowed white nationalist Richard Spencer in the face as he was giving an interview. A video clip of the encounter immediately went viral, to the cheers of prominent mainstream liberals .\n\nThe incident and its viral response prompted a debate over whether it's moral to \"punch a Nazi\" and whether broad acceptance of that behavior could increase ambiguity over which people can be accurately described as Nazis and who has the right to decide.\n\n\"No, it's not OK to punch a Nazi,\" Brian Levin, the directer of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University at San Bernardino, told CNN . \"If white nationalists are sophisticated at anything, it's the ability to try to grasp some kind of moral high ground when they have no other opportunity, and that's provided when they appear to be violently victimized.\"\n\nLevin continued: \"That's the only moral thread that they can hang their hats on. And we're stupid if we give them that opportunity.\"\n\nJump to"

The Washington Times posted an article after the rioting claiming that the company, XRVision, \"used its software to do facial recognition of protesters and matched two Philadelphia Antifa members to two men inside the Senate.\"\n\nBut the company, as BuzzFeed News first reported , said that wasn't true - and that the Washington Times \"never attempted to contact XRVision to verify their false claim prior publication.\" The Washington Times is a conservative outlet that does not adhere to \"several basic journalistic standards,\" according to NewsGuard, a media watchdog.\n\nIn the past, XRVision has reportedly sought to authenticate right-wing rumors about Hunter Biden using its supposed facial-recognition software, according to posts on CTO Yaacov Apelbaum's blog. But the company \"does not seem to have any relationship to the facial recognition industry or academia,\" as Dave Gershgorn, a senior writer for OneZero, reported , and it remains unclear what kind of facial-recognition software it uses.\n\nIn a statement provided to Insider, the company said it asked the news outlet to \"retract the current claims\" and \"publish an apology.\" BuzzFeed News first reported the statement, which was also shared on Apelbaum's blog. The Washington Times has since removed the story.\n\nBut before it was taken down, Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz cited the article on the House floor . Gaetz said that \"some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters. They were masquerading as Trump supporters and in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,\" The Washington Post reported.\n\nThose claims were echoed throughout conservative social-media circles on Thursday, where believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory and other far-right extremist figures baselessly alleged that the rioters were not actually Trump supporters. Some Trump supporters are even calling Ashli Babbitt , who died during the riots, a \"false flag\" without providing any verifiable evidence, as NBC News reported .\n\nUpdate: This article has been updated with a statement from XRVision.\n\nJump to"

He's been hosting a marathon 72-hour conference, dubbed a cyber symposium, from Tuesday to Thursday in an attempt to prove his conspiracy theories involving the 2020 US election .\n\n\"They'd stick, it's called some poison pill, in so that everybody's stuff would have been ruined so they take your computers or whatever it is,\" Lindell said in video from the event. \"I didn't even understand it all. I go, 'What?' Is that antifa things or people that have infiltrated, they're telling me this morning.\"\n\nOne of the conference's attendees, retired Army Col. Phil Waldron, also took to the stage and warned of a \"credible threat\" at the symposium.\n\n\"We detected disruptors inside, trying to get people ejected, really radical folks outside trying to penetrate,\" Waldron said. \"We've got folks exchanging badges in the parking lot, press badges specifically. We've identified those agitators and provocateurs by photo imagery.\"\n\n\"They're obviously trying to subdue the message that Mike's trying to get out,\" Waldron added. \"So this is a typical insurrection-type activities. This is part of the color revolution.\"\n\nThe Salon reporter Zachary Petrizzo, however, posted a video he filmed in the parking lot outside the South Dakota event hall on Thursday morning. The video showed neither a crowd nor protesters - only three people dancing and singing hymns.\n\nLindell also said on Thursday morning that he had been attacked outside his hotel on Wednesday night.\n\n\"I'm OK,\" he said. \"It hurts a little bit. I just want everyone to know all the evil that's out there.\"\n\nThe AP spoke with the Sioux Falls Police Department spokesman Sam Clemens, who told the news outlet that his officers had taken a report about an assault at a hotel near the conference. Clemens said the incident happened at 11:30 p.m. Wednesday but did not identify Lindell as being involved in the incident.\n\nLindell did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.\n\nIn July, Lindell offered $5 million to anyone who attended the conference who could disprove his conspiracy theory that China stole last year's election for Joe Biden. He later rescinded the offer of the money.\n\nClaims by Lindell involving the election-technology company Dominion Voting Systems prompted a $1.3 billion defamation suit against the MyPillow CEO. Lindell was seen rushing off the event stage Wednesday at about the same time when news broke that a judge allowed the suit to go ahead.\n\nLindell attempted to have the defamation lawsuit dismissed during a hearing in June . The federal judge also ruled Wednesday that lawsuits by Dominion against the pro-Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani could proceed.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "President Trump says he is designating Antifa as a domestic terror organization following widespread protests. There are no legal consequences to that designation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon that the United States would be designating the left-wing political movement Antifa a domestic terrorist organization.\n\nThe news comes after five nights of protests across America protesting the police killing of George Floyd. Saturday saw the highest tension yet, with police shooting tear gas and less-lethal projectiles at protestors, some of who responded by throwing bricks and bottles and, in some cities, lighting police vehicles on fire and looting stores.\n\nOn Saturday, the President blamed Antifa, short for anti-fascist, and other left-wing groups for the riots and looting.\n\n\"The memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists. The violence and vandalism is being led by Antifa and other radical left-wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting business and burning down buildings. The main victims of this horrible, horrible situation are the citizens who live in these once lovely communities,\" the president said.\n\nThe State Department can designate foreign organizations as terrorist organizations, but there is no law governing domestic organizations. At the moment, it is unclear what President Trump's tweet refers to in concrete legal steps. The Patriot Act defines domestic terrorism, but there are no federal crimes tied to domestic terror.\n\nTrump said in July of 2019 that he was considering declaring Antifa an \"Organization of Terror.\"\n\nAnother challenge is the nature of Antifa, which is less of an organization, with structure and leaders, than a decentralized movement. Antifa is a global movement largely made up of anarchists, socialists, and other left-wing groups that oppose right-wing authoritarianism and white supremacy, sometimes violently . Unlike other radical groups, there is no controlling organizational structure, choosing instead to operate semi-autonomously and without leaders.\n\nAntifa is known for its black-bloc protest tactics, where protestors wear all black and cover up their face so that they can't be identified by police or right-wing opponents.\n\nAntifa's name comes from the pre-World War 2 German group Antifaschistische Aktion, which resisted the Nazi German state, and birthed the design of Antifa's now infamous flag.\n\nAntifa gained much more public attention under the Trump presidency, as the movement disrupted events with far-right speakers across the country, such as Vice and Proud Boy founder Gavin McInnis's speech at the Metroplitan Republican Club . Most notably, the organization faced off against the white nationalist Unite the Right rally.\n\nNoted black clergyman and left-wing activist Cornel West told Democracy Now that Antifa protected him and other clergy from the worst of the white nationalist violence.\n\n\"We would have been crushed like cockroaches were it not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,\" he told Democracy Now. \"You had police holding back and just allowing fellow citizens to go at each other.\"\n\nTrump, in his response to the Charlottesville protest, said that he blamed Antifa and the \"alt-left\" for violence as well.\n\n\"What about the alt-left who came charging at the alt-right?\" Trump said at a press conference .\n\nAttorney General William Barr also blamed \"anarchist and far-left extremist\" groups for the violence on Saturday. On Sunday, the Attorney General's office released guidance that said that the his office is working with the 56 regional FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces to \"identify criminal organizers and instigators.\"\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">AG Barr: &quot;To identify criminal organizers and instigators, and to coordinate federal resources with our state and local partners, federal law enforcement is using our existing network of 56 regional FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF). &quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/mueuIo8LSa\">pic.twitter.com/mueuIo8LSa</a></p>&mdash; Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/1267145904223592448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nIt is unclear what other avenues the federal government may use to pursue enforcement actions against Antifa, but the FBI Agents Association has been lobbying for the creation of a domestic terrorism law.\n\nJump to"

That's when, according to the Clallam County Sheriff's Office , \"seven or eight carloads of people\" accosted them in the parking lot, many of them carrying semi-automatic rifles.\n\nThe group asked the family if they were antifa protesters. When the family told them they had no connection to the anti-fascist movement, the locals continued to harass them.\n\nThe family had to drive their bus around the assembled cars to leave the parking lot safely, according to police.\n\nAs they drove away, four vehicles followed them onto a logging spur road.\n\nThe family said they pitched their tent for the night but decided to leave when they heard the sounds of chainsaws and gunshots, FOX 13 reported .\n\nWhen they went to drive back out the logging road, they discovered it had been blocked by fallen trees and called the police for assistance.\n\nFour high school students volunteered to cut apart the trees with a chainsaw and clear the road so that the family could leave.\n\nDeputies escorted the family to a police station and interviewed them regarding the incident.\n\nAfter leaving the station under police escort, the family's bus broke down and officers helped them repair it so they could continue heading home.\n\nThe sheriff's office said it is conducting a criminal investigation into the incident.\n\nPrior to the group's arrival in Forks, a gun shop owner in nearby Sequim posted numerous videos about an impending antifa invasion in Clallam County.\n\nIn a now-deleted Facebook video viewed by Insider, Seth Larson said he had \"intelligence\" that a group of more than 100 people dressed in black was massing in Sequim for violent protests.\n\nIn the video, Larson is wearing what appears to be a patch associated with the 3%er movement, a paramilitary group linked to acts of domestic terrorism.\n\nIn the comment thread, Larson posted a photo of the downed trees and the school bus.\n\nLarson did not respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has blamed antifa for looting and violence during the protests following the police-related death of George Floyd.\n\nEarlier in the week, a Twitter post from @antifa_US  stated armed groups would be moving into \"residential areas.\"\n\nThe posting was shared widely, including by Donald Trump Jr, who referred to antifa as a \"terrorist organization,\" ABC News reported, and was cited by law enforcement as an example of leftist groups inciting violence during protests.\n\nThe account was traced back to the white supremacist group Identity Europa and was subsequently deleted by Twitter.\n\nIn addition to the incident in Forks, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported civilians mobilizing to rebuff antifa invasions in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Toms River, New Jersey, and other towns.\n\nJump to"

Bok Academy South in Lake Wales, Florida. The school is a part of the Lake Wales Charter Schools (LWCS) system.\n\nAccording to the Daily Dot , the video was taken by a student and the person addressing the students in it is a retired teacher who had returned to the school as a substitute.\n\nDr. Julio Acevedo, the director of human resources and transportation at LWCS, confirmed to Insider that the teacher who appeared in the viral video is \"no longer with\" the school or charter system.\n\nReports on TMZ and YourTango suggest the teacher was fired.\n\n\"We understand there's a video released and shared on social media of an incident on our campus. Our administration is aware.

At the time of writing, the two Reddit posts sharing the video had over 50,000 upvotes and more than 3,500 comments.\n\nThe two-minute video starts in the middle of the unnamed teacher speaking, and she can be heard saying that \"supporters arrived and suddenly there was violence. Already, three of those had been identified as 'Antifa' members that were in the building.\"\n\n\"They were paid to be there, they were paid to be violent so that the Trump supporters look bad,\" she can be heard saying, repeating baseless, debunked misinformation that blamed last week's violent siege at the Capitol Building in Washington, DC, by Trump supporters on \"Antifa\" members.\n\nIn the clip, a student can be heard pushing back against the teacher's claims, saying: \"Didn't Proud Boys and Trump supporters, weren't they the ones breaking into the Capitol?\"\n\nThe teacher can be seen shaking her head and replying, \"No. In fact, there's a video showing Trump supporters trying to stop the people from breaking windows.\"\n\nIt's unclear which video the teacher was referring to.\n\n\"Anybody can wear MAGA hats,\" she added.\n\nA post shared by Remember (@knowyourracists)\n\nThousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6 in a violent riot while votes were being certified inside the federal building solidifying President-elect Joe Biden's 2020 election win.\n\nAbout 100 pro-Trump rioters have been charged with crimes so far .\n\nThe teacher seen in the video embedded above may have been referring to the viral, false Washington Times article that claimed a software company ID'd \"Antifa\" members in the crowd storming the Capitol.\n\nThe facial recognition company, XRVision, told BuzzFeed News that the claims made in the story were false, and that the conservative news website \"never attempted to contact XRVision to verify their false claim prior to publication.\"\n\nThe Washington Times later took down the story, but not before Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz cited it on the House floor.\n\nAn article in the conservative Washington Times falsely claimed that 'Antifa' members were ID'd at the Capitol riots via facial-recognition, according to a software company\n\nA pro-Trump rioter who bragged about storming the US Capitol and is wanted as a person of interest by the DC police now wants to apologize\n\nOnly about 100 pro-Trump rioters have been charged in the Capitol insurrection so far.

The Arizona man known for attending rallies in the state as the \"Q Shaman\" to support QAnon and its associated belief system, became a fixture of Wednesday's coup attempt after photos of him wearing a horned helmet and red, white, and blue face paint went viral.\n\nOn Saturday, the Justice Department announced that Jake Angeli , whose real name is Jacob Chansley, was arrested on charges that he \"knowingly\" entered or stayed in a restricted building without lawful authority, and charged with \"violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\"\n\nThe far-right activist was photographed on the Senate dais and used a megaphone to communicate with the influx of Trump supporters who descended on the Capitol. But before his arrest, he emerged at the center of a new unfounded conspiracy theory alleging that he was only an actor in disguise, as Insider's Charles Davis previously reported .\n\nTrump supporters, including congressional Republicans and Fox News anchors , have falsely claimed that the riot in the Capitol on Wednesday, which killed at least three people , featured \"Antifa\" protesters pretending to be Trump supporters. There is no evidence to support the claim, which was largely popularized by a now-retracted story on the right-wing Washington Times news website .\n\nAs Mashable's Matt Binder reported , a misinformation campaign has even falsely alleged that Angeli is connected to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nLin Wood , the Trump-supporting attorney who was permanently banned from Twitter on Thursday after weeks of spreading false voter-fraud claims and encouraging Wednesday's incident in DC, accused Angeli of being a phony. Wood tweeted a photo of Angeli, writing, \"Indisputable photographic evidence that antifa violently broke into Congress today,\" according to the Huron Daily Tribune . Wood's tweets are no longer available due to his ban.\n\nA Twitter account that appears to belong to Angeli, who is also referred to as \"Yellowstone Wolf\" in the QAnon community, replied to Wood's tweet Wednesday evening, writing, \"I am not antifa or blm. I'm a Qanon & digital soldier. My name is Jake & I marched with the police & fought against BLM & ANTIFA in PHX.\" Angeli has been seen attending Black Lives Matter protests as a QAnon-supportive counter-protester.\n\nThe tweet also suggested that Wood look up footage from One America News Network, a pro-Trump propaganda news outlet, showing him at a July 4 protest in Phoenix. Some Twitter users replied to the tweet by tagging the FBI's Twitter account, after the agency was criticized for seeking public assistance in identifying rioters.\n\nThe account's profile picture is an image of Angeli. Newsweek has also reported that the account, called @USAwolfpack, belonged to Angeli. The account has previously been promoted by other QAnon-supporting users.\n\nIn recent weeks, the account, which was created in 2018, shared articles and tweets spreading conspiracy theories about the September 11 attacks, the severity of COVID-19, and the existence of the Illuminati, a fictional group of world leaders that some conspiracy theorists claim controls the world.\n\nBefore his arrest, Insider sent emails to addresses associated with the man but the messages were returned to sender. Insider replied to a tweet from Angeli requesting comment.\n\nUpdate: This article has been updated to reflect the arrest of Jacob Chansley.\n\nJump to"

He has previously claimed that floods in Canada were caused by God's unhappiness about homosexuality and has called police who enforce COVID-19 safety rules \"Nazis.\"\n\nThe Portland Tribune reported that around 50 people attended Pawlowski's event and that members of the Proud Boys appeared to be acting as event security.\n\nA video shows black-clad protesters carrying shields, identified as Antifa, disrupting the event by setting off smoke grenades and appearing to grab the group's speakers in an attempt to dismantle the public address system.\n\nProud Boys wearing their signature black and yellow colors and PB insignia then marched to their announced gathering point in response, armed with paintball guns, batons, and other weapons, The Portland Tribune said.\n\nThe two groups can be seen arguing before clashing and exchanging paintball gunfire and pepper spray. The Proud Boys were forced out of the park, the local paper reported.\n\nThe clashes continued on the street around the corner. Police sirens can be heard in the background, but no arrests were made.\n\nRight-wing commentators online framed the event as Antifa attacking a Christian gathering, while left-wing commentators described it as a protest against a political event.\n\nAndy Ngo, a far-right commentator, wrote on Twitter that Antifa had tried to \"attack & shut down a family Christian prayer & worship event on the waterfront.\"\n\nIn response, Reverand Chuck Currie from Portland wrote, \"Christian minister in Portland here.

They then violently shove him to the ground.\n\nHe is shown lying on the ground, bleeding from his ear, as officers then walk past him.\n\nThe footage, which has been widely shared, has turned into another flash point in the tensions over police violence and power after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.\n\nYou can watch the video here. It is a graphic depiction of violence:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday tweeted a conspiracy theory that Gugino is part of antifa - a decades-old, leaderless group whose name stands for \"anti-fascist\" . Trump has accused the group of being behind the protests, though there is also little evidence for this.\n\nTrump's tweet said that Gugino \"could be an ANTIFA provocateur\" and that he had appeared to try and interfere with police scanning equipment. The president added: \"Could be a set up?\"\n\nBut Gugino's friends describe him as a devout Catholic who was passionate about social justice, human rights, and addressing inequality. They said he has been protesting for decades on issues including climate change, police brutality, and nuclear weapons.\n\nOne friend, Keith Giles, told BuzzFeed News that Trump's post was \"just ridiculous.\"\n\n\"We know the president will never back down and will never apologize for this,\" Giles, the program director for Peace Catalyst International, a Jesuit group in Texas, said.\n\nGiles told CNN that he was \"horrified\" by Trump's tweet.\n\nKathy Kelly, 67, who has known Gugino since meeting at while fasting at a 2010 rally to close the Guantánamo Bay detention facility, described him to BuzzFeed News as \"someone who listened very patiently and always had a benevolent attitude towards people.\"\n\nShe said she was not surprised to see him walk toward \"a group of armed people\" in the video.\n\n\"It didn't surprise me anymore than Gandhi walking towards armed British soldiers,\" she said. \"It was something he would do, believing that he was approaching another human being.\"\n\nShe also laughed as she dismissed the idea that Gugino could be a part of antifa.\n\nAnd she also dismissed the idea that he could have staged a fall.\n\n\"Would he stage something in a crafty way to accomplish a photo op? I greatly doubt that,\"she said.\n\n\"That blood...forming a pool on the pavement represented a great deal of wisdom accrued by one individual who earnestly studied ways to create a better world.\"\n\nMark Colville, who has known Gugino for years and who runs a Catholic center that offers meals and prayer in New Haven, Connecticut, told The Washington Post : \"Martin has a passion for social justice.\"\n\n\"When he sees wrong he wants to be involved in making it right.\"\n\nHe said that Gugino, a retired computer scientist, made multiple six-and-a-half hour trips from near Buffalo to New Haven to help prepare and serve the center's meals.\n\nColville told the Post that Gugino was a private person who lived alone and did not want attention for what he did.\n\nGugino cared for his mother until her death, and his sister also recently died, the Post reported.\n\nColville took Gugino's place at the protest, on the same street where he was shoved, after he was denied entry to visit him in the hospital.\n\nGugino also worked with Witness Against Torture, a group that protests how detainees in Guantanamo Bay are treated, the Post reported, as well as active in the affordable housing movement.\n\nOther friends told both BuzzFeed News and the Post that they know Gugino to be passionate and peaceful.\n\nJ±udy Metzger, 85, who lives near Gugino in Amherst, a Buffalo suburb, told The New York Times : \"Martin is a very gentle, a very pleasant person.\"\n\nGugino has also long been active with the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nHe protested after the death of  Tamir Rice, a Black 12-year-old that was shot dead by a police officer in 2014.\n\nThe Post reported that he travelled to Cleveland, Ohio, where he met Rice's parents, and he joined protesters in front of Justice Department who called for the officer who shot Rice to face murder charges.\n\nAnd Kelly Zarcone, Gugino's attorney, said told Buzzfeed News he had been moved from intensive care to his own room, while remaining in serious condition.\n\nZarcone told CNN that he is being moved to the hospital's rehabilitation floor, that his condition is improving, and and that \"we hope he will be released within the next 2 weeks.\"\n\nZarcone called Trump's suggestions \"absolutely ridiculous.\"\n\nShe said that Gugino \"totally denies\" that he is part of antifa and said that law enforcement has not suggested anything else.\n\n\"We are at a loss to understand why the President of the United States would make such dark, dangerous, and untrue accusations against him,\" Zarcone said.\n\n\"All these things that people are making up are not helpful.\"\n\nShe said he was \"just trying to recover and he's even too tired to form words most of the time.\"\n\nTwo officers were suspended with pay over the incident.\n\nFifty-seven Buffalo police officers then resigned en masse on Friday in protest at the suspension .\n\nJump to"

      "text": "The Rise of Antifa\n\nPhotos and text by M. Scott Mahaskey Dec. 26, 2017\n\nAs newly emboldened white nationalists rallied in American cities and college towns in 2017, an underground leftist movement emerged to confront them, using some of the same aggressive and sometimes violent tactics.\n\nThe photo essay | Read the full story\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe inauguration of President Donald Trump kicked off a wave of political protests across the country, many escalating into violence. Charlottesville, Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Portland, Oregon; Berkeley, California, and scores of other American cities reverberated with the sounds of angry protesters and explosive dispersants.\n\nWhile most opponents of white nationalists are part of progressive movements that contrast their peacefulness and inclusiveness with the racism of neo-Nazis and other extremists, the anti-fascist militia known as Antifa adopts some of the same styles and attitudes of extreme far-right movements. Its aim, according to Dartmouth professor Mark Ray, who has studied it, is to forcibly repress all forms of hate speech, denying a platform to white nationalist groups. But its own belligerence alarms the FBI and other law enforcement officials. At two separate rallies in Berkeley, Antifa members engaged in violence while seeking to counter \"free speech\" rallies organized by far-right groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFew among the anti-fascist movement give open interviews to media organizations. Journalists themselves have been attacked amid chaotic scenes of violent outbursts. When the cameras face anti-fascists, the typical response is a crude gesture or suggested shout to photograph the police instead.\n\nIn one harrowing encounter, Antifa protesters struck an elderly Trump supporter with signs labeled \"No Hate.\" Al Letson, the host of the investigative radio program and podcast Reveal, who was also there to record the actions of the far right, leapt to the Trump supporter's defense, shielding him with his body and pleading with Antifa protesters to stop beating the man. They complied and allowed the man to get to his feet and leave the area. \"I just put my body down on top of his, in the hopes that they would not hit me,\" Letson would later tell NPR. The man who was beaten, Keith Campbell, told reporters that Letson \"saved my life.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs police stepped up enforcement of park rules, a protester named Yesenia Mendez was detained after allegedly throwing an object toward police, according to the East Bay Times. Her screams drew a crowd. Meanwhile, officers struggled to muzzle and detain Mendez's service dog, while Mendez refused to relinquish the leash. POLITICO confirmed with local police that the animal was not injured during the arrest.\n\nSupporters of the alt-right agenda are already planning more events for 2018. Law enforcement officials and campus administrators fear that more incidents of mass violence are likely to result, as Antifa fulfills its vow to show up at all such rallies. The fear is even greater in states with laws allowing the open carry of guns, such as Arizona. At a Trump rally in Phoenix last August, protesters and supporters of Trump alike could be seen carrying military-style long rifles."

      "text": "Americana\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nThe first thing you see are the masks â the N-95s, the surgical masks, the patterned cloth masks, the bandanas â which largely vanished from American life over the last two years but are a defining feature of Americaâs swelling left-wing protest culture.\n\nFaculty members at New York University link arms to protect a âGaza solidarity encampment,â most of them wearing face masks. Activists block travel across the Golden Gate Bridge, all of them in masks. Members of the March on DNC 2024 coalition show up to their Chicago press conference in face masks, removing them only when itâs their turn to speak.\n\nNearly one year after the official end of the federal COVID-19 emergency declaration, the regular use of face masks for non-immunocompromised people has faded from American life. Outdoor masking, mandated in many states during the peak of the pandemic, became even rarer after a 2022 CDC advisory scaled it back.\n\nBut that gradual return to barefaced life never reached left-leaning protests, where face masks are widely used and encouraged.\n\nPart of the reason, say organizers, remains an attempt to make a point about exposure to COVID-19 and other health risks, which some in the left-wing protest movements believe remain dire. And part is the threat of a different kind of exposure â from being captured by facial recognition technology or becoming doxxed (their personal information being shared online) by counter-protesters.\n\nâTo us, the optics are communicating that we deny the Biden administrationâs narrative about COVID â that itâs no longer a big deal,â said Olan Mijana, a spokesman for the March on DNC 2024 coalition. âItâs about collective safety, and itâs also about connecting this COVID neglect to the very issues that weâre marching on the DNC for.â\n\nKNOW MORE\n\nThe return to masking has confused and irritated critics. âNotice the horde standing behind their masks,â wrote a counter-protester this week, next to footage of his non-masked wife standing walking into a Yale University pro-ceasefire protest.\n\nâNo masks on campus!â said Jonathan Greenblatt, the president of the Anti-Defamation League, in a video posted after he surveyed protests at Columbia University. âThis isnât Fallujah. This is Morningside Heights.â\n\nBefore the pandemic, this level of masking wasnât common â or legal. For more than 150 years, New York prohibited masks in public places; other states adopted similar laws, which made it easier to break up Ku Klux Klan gatherings and aided prosecutors as they built cases.\n\nThirteen years ago, when the NYPD broke up Occupy Wall Street protests, some of the activists there were charged under the anti-mask law. At the start of the Trump presidency, face masks at protests were identified with âblack blocâ tactics that anonymized anarchists; in 2017, some left-wing counter-protesters of the âUnite the Rightâ rally in Charlottesville faced felony charges for violating anti-mask laws.\n\nâYou saw the mentality around masking shift after the street-level clashes around Trumpâs election,â said Sean Summers, a reporter with Unicorn Riot, a nonprofit news organization that tracks the far right. âPeople started to see far right figures coming out with full body armor, and livestreamers working to capture peopleâs identities. In some cases, that translated into people being doxxed.â\n\nAnti-mask laws complicated that response, but many were felled by the pandemic, which also saw millions of Americans become engaged in public protests against police brutality. In May 2020, after New York began mandating face coverings in public places, Attorney Gen. Letitia James convinced the state legislature to repeal it. First Amendment activists took note and began encouraging protesters to use face covering as a defensive measure against unwanted attention, helping to spread the practice beyond the fringes of the left.\n\nâBefore the pandemic, it used to be illegal to protest in masks in many places. You werenât allowed to cover your face,â said RÃ­a Thompson-Washington, a progressive organizer and attorney, in a September 2023 National Lawyers Guild training video . âBeing able to mask is not only a safety consideration, but itâs a consideration to protect your anonymity.â\n\nDAVIDâS VIEW\n\nA college student whoâs spending part of finals week at a Gaza Solidarity camp has never known a world without social media. A senior, who arrived on campus in the fall of 2020, was mandated to wear a mask; the 150-year regime of anti-mask laws died before they got there.\n\nThe anonymity of these protests, and of other pro-Gaza protests around the country, grew out of that reality â and out of the worry that being identified could ruin their lives. Those fears were exacerbated last year after a top law firm rescinded job offers to Ivy League students who signed onto a statement holding Israel âentirely responsibleâ for the 10/7 attack, while other business leaders pledged to do the same.\n\nFear of reprisal has colored the protests, and made them cautious about identifying themselves. Reporters from national news outlets, even friendly ones, have recorded their annoyance at how hard itâs been to get the name and full story of someone participating in direct action. (Students whoâve participated in news stories , like Rep. Ilhan Omarâs daughter, Barnard student Isra Hrisi, are rare and usually have the full support of family members.)\n\nAs these students graduate and become active in politics and government, you can already see the same expectations and norms filtering upward. White House and Capitol Hill staffers organizing against the war have not only worn masks at their protests, but signed onto anonymous letters in support of their cause, annoying older political veterans who argue they should either keep complaints in-house or resign in protest. The semiotics that used to be associated with anarchists, whose masks stood out at rallies, are now popular with activists participating in non-violent civil disobedience.\n\nTHE VIEW FROM REPUBLICANS\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, some Republican legislators introduced state and federal legislation to increase penalties on masked protesters. It largely failed, and there is no effort to bring it back yet, but the sentiment is still there.\n\nâMasked protestors undermine their accountability,â Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, a co-sponsor of the federal Unmask Antifa Act, told Semafor in a statement. When protesters wear masks, he added, it âenables them to commit acts of vandalism, assault and destruction of property without fear of identification or consequences for their illegal and violent behavior.â\n\nNOTABLE\n\nPennsylvania. Itâs primary day, with a few competitive races for House seats and statewide offices.\n\nAt the top of the ballot, Democratic voters will nominate a successor to Attorney Gen. Michelle Henry, who was appointed by Gov. Josh Shapiro and isnât running for a full term, and pick their nominees for auditor general and treasurer â two offices they narrowly lost in 2020. The first race has the most competition, with every Democrat wrestling over how theyâd handle Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner. Republicans created a new special prosecutorâs office to take cases away from the progressive Krasner, and while Henry never filled it, most candidates to replace her, including former state Auditor Eugene DePasquale, say they will.\n\nIn the Pittsburgh-based 12th Congressional District, Rep. Summer Lee is facing her first primary challenger as an incumbent: Bhavini Patel, a local municipal official whoâs attacked Lee for not siding more with President Biden, and aligning with protest voters who disagree with Bidenâs support for Israel. In the Bucks County-based 1st Congressional District, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick has run ads to fend off Mark Houck , an anti-abortion activist challenging him from the right. (Fitzpatrick is the only Pennsylvania Republican in a Biden-won district.)\n\nIn Harrisburgâs 10th Congressional District, six Democrats are competing to face GOP Rep. Scott Perry, a perennial target. In the Lehigh Valley, one of three Republicans will face Rep. Susan Wild, a Democrat whoâs won three close races against weak opponents. State Rep. Ryan Mackenzie got the support of Americans for Prosperity Action, after its pivot from the GOP presidential primary; Vivek Ramaswamy campaigned for local university trustee Maria Montero. Polls close across the state at 8 p.m. eastern time.\n\nWashington. Republicans endorsed veteran and recalled ex-school board member Semi Bird for governor, after ex-Rep. Dave Reichert pulled out of the endorsement process. âIt was a broken system and a deceitful system,â Reichert told the Seattle Times, after the convention disqualified, then re-qualified, Bird as a candidate for their support. âI have no patience for that kind of crap.â Conservatives down the ballot rolled up endorsements at the Saturday convention, but Reichert has polled close to Attorney Gen. Bob Ferguson, the Democratic frontrunner. In Washingtonâs all-party primary system, every candidate will compete in June for two lines on the November ballot.\n\nCampaign for Democracy, âFugitive.â Term-limited in 2026, California Gov. Gavin Newsom keeps buying ads outside California to warn red states of what their Republican governors are doing. This one, for Alabamians, dramatizes an escape from the state thatâs foiled by a traffic cop, holding a pregnancy test, ready to prove that two women are leaving to get an illegal abortion. To help stop âTrump Republicans,â viewers can go to the PACâs website and sign up to help Newsom.\n\nProtect Freedom PAC, âBob Good.â Rand Paul isnât on a ballot again until 2028, and his super PAC is spending its resources to help like-minded conservatives. Paul himself narrates this endorsement of Good, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, vulnerable in a June primary because he endorsed Ron DeSantis for president over Donald Trump. Paulâs mission: Explain just how conservative Good really is, and how Virginians can trust him to âstop sending our taxpayer dollars overseas.â\n\nOne Nation, âPromising.â This is the first immigration-focused attack ad against a Democratic senator since his party dismissed impeachment charges against Homeland Security Sec. Alejandro Mayorkas. That drama doesnât make it in. More powerful, according to this Mitch McConnell-aligned super PAC; footage of migrants pushing through a line of CBP officers, images of border wall construction, and pictures of Montana Sen. Jon Tester smiling next to President Biden as he votes for âamnesty for 11 million illegals, even criminals.â Those were votes for bipartisan immigration packages that combined border security money with citizenship reforms â once popular, now fodder for attacks.\n\nThe Liberal Patriot teamed up with Bluepoint for a lengthy poll, shared exclusively with Semafor, with questions on dozens of possible policy shifts that either Joe Biden or Donald Trump could pull off. Their conclusion: There was plenty that Biden could talk about to convince voters that he could be trusted to treat their economic woes. He either wasnât doing it enough, or he was being drowned out by other news. âThe only way you can really break through with a consistent set of issues is to talk about it incessantly,â said Ruy Teixeira, the newsletterâs co-founder. âItâs not clear to me that the Biden campaign has focused on the ideas that could give him an advantage over Trump.â\n\nThe presidentâs slight recovery in post-State of the Union polls continues here, with an assist from Kennedy. The Trump campaign hasnât criticized Kennedy apart from a few statements and Truth Social posts; the Biden campaign has gone after Kennedy as a Trump cut-out, arguing he is on the ballot to help Republicans win. That may be paying off now. When given more candidates to pick between, 15% of Trump voters peel off and support Kennedy, and 2% support either West or Stein. Just 7% of Biden voters go for Kennedy, while 4% support Stein and 1% support West.\n\nIn the six weeks since North Carolinaâs primaries, Democrats have unloaded on GOP gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson, and he hasnât responded with paid media. Itâs been costly. Robinson, who was already less popular than Donald Trump with independents, hasnât made gains; Stein has, picking up support as non-Republicans learn who he is.\n\nHouse. Texas Rep. Tony Gonzales is getting a visit and some fundraising help from House Speaker Mike Johnson this week, infuriating conservatives and House Freedom Caucus members upset with Gonzales over his gun safety and Ukraine funding votes. Gonzales hit back at them in a Sunday CNN interview, calling Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz one of the âreal scumbagsâ he has to serve with; Gaetz campaigned with Gonzalesâs GOP primary opponent, Brandon Herrera, last month.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Behind the mask: Why the new US campus protestors cover their faces\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe first thing you see are the masks âÂ the N-95s, the surgical masks, the patterned cloth masks, the bandanas âÂ which largely vanished from American life over the last two years but are a defining feature of Americaâs swelling left-wing protest culture.\n\nFaculty members at New York University link arms to protect a âGaza solidarity encampment,â most of them wearing face masks. Activists block travel across the Golden Gate Bridge, all of them in masks. Members of the March on DNC 2024 coalition show up to their Chicago press conference in face masks, removing them only when itâs their turn to speak.\n\nNearly one year after the official end of the federal COVID-19 emergency declaration, the regular use of face masks for non-immunocompromised people has faded from American life. Outdoor masking, mandated in many states during the peak of the pandemic, became even rarer after a 2022 CDC advisory scaled it back.\n\nBut that gradual return to barefaced life never reached left-leaning protests, where face masks are widely used and encouraged.\n\nPart of the reason, say organizers, remains an attempt to make a point about exposure to COVID-19 and other health risks, which some in the left-wing protest movements believe remain dire. And part is the threat of a different kind of exposure â from being captured by facial recognition technology or becoming doxxed (their personal information being shared online) by counter-protesters.\n\nâTo us, the optics are communicating that we deny the Biden administrationâs narrative about COVID â that itâs no longer a big deal,â said Olan Mijana, a spokesman for the March on DNC 2024 coalition. âItâs about collective safety, and itâs also about connecting this COVID neglect to the very issues that weâre marching on the DNC for.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe return to masking has confused and irritated critics. âNotice the horde standing behind their masks,â wrote a counter-protester this week, next to footage of his non-masked wife standing walking into a Yale University pro-ceasefire protest.\n\nâNo masks on campus!â said Jonathan Greenblatt, the president of the Anti-Defamation League, in a video posted after he surveyed protests at Columbia University. âThis isnât Fallujah. This is Morningside Heights.â\n\nBefore the pandemic, this level of masking wasnât common â or legal. For more than 150 years, New York prohibited masks in public places; other states adopted similar laws, which made it easier to break up Ku Klux Klan gatherings and aided prosecutors as they built cases.\n\nThirteen years ago, when the NYPD broke up Occupy Wall Street protests, some of the activists there were charged under the anti-mask law. At the start of the Trump presidency, face masks at protests were identified with âblack blocâ tactics that anonymized anarchists; in 2017, some left-wing counter-protesters of the âUnite the Rightâ rally in Charlottesville faced felony charges for violating anti-mask laws.\n\nâYou saw the mentality around masking shift after the street-level clashes around Trumpâs election,â said Sean Summers, a reporter with Unicorn Riot, a nonprofit news organization that tracks the far right. âPeople started to see far right figures coming out with full body armor, and livestreamers working to capture peopleâs identities. In some cases, that translated into people being doxxed.â\n\nAnti-mask laws complicated that response, but many were felled by the pandemic, which also saw millions of Americans become engaged in public protests against police brutality. In May 2020, after New York began mandating face coverings in public places, Attorney Gen. Letitia James convinced the state legislature to repeal it. First Amendment activists took note and began encouraging protesters to use face covering as a defensive measure against unwanted attention, helping to spread the practice beyond the fringes of the left.\n\nâBefore the pandemic, it used to be illegal to protest in masks in many places. You werenât allowed to cover your face,â said RÃ­a Thompson-Washington, a progressive organizer and attorney, in a September 2023 National Lawyers Guild training video . âBeing able to mask is not only a safety consideration, but itâs a consideration to protect your anonymity.â\n\nA college student whoâs spending part of finals week at a Gaza Solidarity camp has never known a world without social media. A senior, who arrived on campus in the fall of 2020, was mandated to wear a mask; the 150-year regime of anti-mask laws died before they got there.\n\nThe anonymity of these protests, and of other pro-Gaza protests around the country, grew out of that reality âÂ and out of the worry that being identified could ruin their lives. Those fears were exacerbated last year after a top law firm rescinded job offers to Ivy League students who signed onto a statement holding Israel âentirely responsibleâ for the 10/7 attack, while other business leaders pledged to do the same.\n\nFear of reprisal has colored the protests, and made them cautious about identifying themselves. Reporters from national news outlets, even friendly ones, have recorded their annoyance at how hard itâs been to get the name and full story of someone participating in direct action. (Students whoâve participated in news stories , like Rep. Ilhan Omarâs daughter, Barnard student Isra Hrisi, are rare and usually have the full support of family members.)\n\nAs these students graduate and become active in politics and government, you can already see the same expectations and norms filtering upward. White House and Capitol Hill staffers organizing against the war have not only worn masks at their protests, but signed onto anonymous letters in support of their cause, annoying older political veterans who argue they should either keep complaints in-house or resign in protest. The semiotics that used to be associated with anarchists, whose masks stood out at rallies, are now popular with activists participating in non-violent civil disobedience.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, some Republican legislators introduced state and federal legislation to increase penalties on masked protesters. It largely failed, and there is no effort to bring it back yet, but the sentiment is still there.\n\nâMasked protestors undermine their accountability,â Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, a co-sponsor of the federal Unmask Antifa Act, told Semafor in a statement. When protesters wear masks, he added, it âenables them to commit acts of vandalism, assault and destruction of property without fear of identification or consequences for their illegal and violent behavior.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

The Senate is considering a response to recent revelations about Justice Clarence Thomasâ financial relationship with a GOP megadonor, but as Morgan Chalfant reports, legislation on a judicial ethics code looks unlikely to pass. And could an overhaul of permitting rules around energy find a ride on a debt ceiling bill?\n\nâ Benjy Sarlin\n\nWas this email forwarded to you?

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. is âhopefulâ she can return to Washington next week, according to notes that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer brought to a news conference yesterday that a photographer captured. A spokesperson for Feinstein, who is recovering from shingles, said she is making progress but that her team doesnât âhave a timeline yet for her return to Washington which is dependent on her medical team saying it is safe to travel.â\n\nâ House: Republicans unveiled the text of H.R. 2, a sweeping border security and immigration bill that theyâre expected to bring to the floor after the current recess. Semafor reported on some of the late hang ups around an E-Verify component of the bill.\n\nThe Biden administration is sending 1,500 active-duty military personnel to the southern border to help with an expected influx of migrants when Title 42 lifts later this month. Some Democrats criticized the move on Tuesday, with New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez accusing the White House of militarizing the border and catering âto the Republican Partyâs xenophobic attacks on our asylum system.â The White House emphasized that the troops would only provide the Border Patrol with logistics support, and would not act as law enforcement or interact with migrants.\n\nA friend of E. Jean Carroll testified about a phone call she received from the writer minutes after Donald Trump allegedly raped her in the mid 1990s. âI want the world to know that she is telling the truth,â the friend, Lisa Birnbach, told the jury Tuesday in the civil rape and defamation trial against the former president.

The lengthy message, in which Carlson describes his feelings while watching a video of Trump supporters beating up an âAntifa kid,â was produced in discovery in the Dominion Voting lawsuit.\n\nDespite some renewed rockiness in the banking sector, the Federal Reserve is expected to announce one last interest rate hike today before pausing for a bit, potentially capping off one of the quickest efforts to tighten monetary policy in its history.\n\nâ Morgan Chalfant and Jordan Weissmann\n\nPunchbowl News: Senate Republicans are united in support of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnellâs decision to keep his distance from debt limit talks. McConnell has insisted that McCarthy and Biden need to drive the conversation. Punchbowl also reports that Schumer talked about his desire to move bipartisan legislation involving a wide-range of issues around China during the Senate lunch yesterday.\n\nPlaybook: Republicans think that Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W. Va. and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz. might be able to force Democrats to the negotiating table on the debt limit.\n\nAxios: Bidenâs reelection campaign is off to a slower start compared to President Obamaâs 2012 reelection effort. Axios reports that Bidenâs campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez, who is currently serving in a senior role in the White House, wonât start on the job for two weeks .\n\nTHE NEWS\n\nWith the debt ceiling deadline potentially looming less than a month away and President Biden preparing to meet with Congressional leaders, Democrats spent Tuesday rushing to prep backdoor options that could be used to address the borrowing limit in an emergency.\n\nHereâs a rundown.\n\nDISCHARGE PETITION\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced in a âdear colleagueâ letter that Democrats were setting up a so-called discharge petition that could potentially be used to address the borrowing limit if just a handful of Republicans choose to go along. The tactic would allow a majority of House members to force a vote on a clean debt hike, end-running GOP leaders if they refuse to bring it to the floor.\n\nLegislation has to sit in committee for at least 30 days before a discharge petition can move it to a vote. But Democrats revealed that they had quietly introduced a shell bill in January that could be used as a vehicle for the debt ceiling hike. In his letter on Tuesday, Jeffries said Democrats had filed a special rule that would bring the legislation to the floor once they gather 218 signatures, which they can start collecting on May 16.\n\nâDemocrats were prepared and began laying the procedural groundwork for this months ago â this is a responsible step that will keep all of our legislative options open,â a senior Democratic aide told Semafor.\n\nBut there are caveats. First, Democrats would still need five Republicans to go along. Second, procedurally, itâs unclear that the discharge petition could be used to hike the debt ceiling before a June 1 deadline when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned the U.S. could face default.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce released an analysis suggesting the procedure could force a vote in the House to pass a borrowing limit increase by June 8. Republicans on the House Rules Committee could also use certain procedural tactics to delay a vote until June 12 at the earliest, GOP and Democratic aides confirmed to Semafor.\n\nA SENATE FAST TRACK\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer kickstarted steps to consider a fast-track process for the upper chamber to approve a two-year suspension of the debt limit with no strings attached. The bill would be allowed to skip the committee process and reach the floor without any hearings. But it would, of course, still need 60 votes.\n\nTHE 14TH AMENDMENT\n\nWhite House aides have studied the option of simply declaring the borrowing limit unconstitutional under the 14th amendment, which says the governmentâs debt âshall not be questioned,â and continue paying the nationâs bills, two people familiar with the internal discussions confirmed (the story was first reported Tuesday by the New York Times). The White House didnât respond to a request for comment.\n\nThough somewhat less discussed than the trillion-dollar coin, the idea has been floated for years. During another high-stakes fiscal showdown in 2011, former president Bill Clinton said heâd unilaterally invoke the 14th amendment to override the debt limit if it meant avoiding a calamitous default. At the time he said heâd do it âwithout hesitation, and force the courts to stop me.â\n\nThere are also concerns about the idea. One of the sources who spoke with Semafor said it would almost certainly spark a lawsuit, leaving the fate of the US economy in the hands of a conservative Supreme Court. Investors could also demand much higher interest rates in exchange for buying Treasury bonds that are considered legally dubious.\n\nJOSEPH AND KADIAâS VIEW\n\nThereâs reason to be skeptical of all the Democratsâ escape hatches, which are either time-consuming or legally perilous for Democrats to consider. Both routes through Congress would also require a number of moderate Republicans to cross GOP leadership, which so far theyâve had shown zero appetite for doing.\n\nROOM FOR DISAGREEMENT\n\nStill, Democratic leaders donât appear ready to concede anything publicly.\n\nâWe have to stand firm,â Schumer said Tuesday at the weekly press conference. He insisted Republicans must raise the debt ceiling or risk economic chaos. The New York Democrat also refused to speculate on the possibility of a short-term debt limit increase that would leave more room for negotiations. âWe should not kick the can down the road. I believe we should go with the full two-year extension,â he said.\n\nDemocrats are hoping they can pressure Republicans in swing districts by highlighting the effects of across-the-board discretionary spending cuts. âIt would dismantle essential investments that middle class families depend upon, imposing an extreme 22 percent cut in just one year, locking in deep and growing cuts for ten years,â says a new strategy memo from the Center for American Progress Action Fund. Democrats have highlighted cuts to spending on veterans , in particular, which Republicans have said is unfair, as they havenât specified where the reductions would come from.\n\nSenate Democrats are running into a wall of Republican opposition in their effort to impose ethics rules on the Supreme Court, but theyâre still planning to press forward with legislative efforts on multiple fronts.\n\nThe partisan divide was clear during a Judiciary Committee hearing yesterday, as Democrats tried to make the case for imposing ethics rules on the justices in the wake of revelations about undisclosed trips and real estate deals involving Justice Clarence Thomas and a major GOP donor. Democrats want to require the justices adhere to ethics rules like those that apply to federal judges. Among the options being discussed is tying the requirements to appropriations legislation.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, accused their Democratic colleagues of trying to undermine the conservative-tilted courtâs credibility for partisan gain â even as they conceded the justices could do more to address concerns raised by the disclosures.\n\nâI think the court needs to up their game,â the committeeâs top Republican, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Semafor. âWhen you compare the Supreme Court to other branches of government â¦ their rules can be improved upon.â\n\nBut new rules through legislation? No chance. âThese bills really, I think, are too clever by half and I donât see any legislation passing micromanaging the way the court deals with these ethical compliance requirements,â he said.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. also said during the hearing that the court âcould update, refresh, and address the concernsâ without need for any congressional action.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are still settling on their approach. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill. signaled during the hearing that he plans to press forward with legislation â âThe status quo must change,â he said â but an aide declined to offer a timeline. The committee is unlikely to be able to advance anything until Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. returns to Washington after recovering from shingles given the partisan breakdown in the committee.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who has his own bill requiring the court to adopt and follow an ethics code, said the committee would need to hear from more witnesses before moving forward with any legislation.\n\nâI think itâs premature to expect a vote on a bill or a markup on a bill in the very near future. It just isnât that phase in the work yet,â he told Semafor.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, is working on a separate proposal that would tie funding to an ethics code requirement for justices.\n\nâAll of us, or most of us, believe strongly that the Supreme Court should have to comply with the same ethics rules as the lower courts,â he told Semafor. âAnd so weâre exploring different ways through the appropriations process to do that. So, weâre actively exploring it. We donât have any set proposal yet.â\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska may well be the only Republican who has an appetite for ethics reform legislation. Murkowski has a bill with Sen. Angus King, I-Maine that would require the Supreme Court to create its own code of conduct. With 60 votes needed to break a legislative filibuster, though, that would leave Democrats well short of passing anything.\n\nâ Morgan Chalfant\n\nJosh Freed leads the climate and energy program at Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank.\n\nStories that are being largely ignored by either left-leaning or right-leaning outlets, according to data from our partners at Ground News.\n\nWHAT THE LEFT ISNâT READING: A new bill introduced by Senate Republicans would increase maximum prison time for people who try to influence a judgeâs decision, citing demonstrations outside the homes of Supreme Court justices last year following the leaked Dobbs opinion.\n\nWHAT THE RIGHT ISNâT READING: NPR says that Elon Musk is threatening to reassign the news organizationâs Twitter account to another organization or person after they stopped posting on the site in response to Muskâs policy changes.\n\nIf youâre liking Semafor Principals, consider sharing with your family, friends and colleagues.

      "text": "Far-left Antifa activists waiting to see Trump actions. How will anti-fascists respond?\n\nIn Philadelphia, anti-fascists are preparing for the day the leader of the local Proud Boys chapter gets out of prison, jailed for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Local Antifa are sure he will receive a presidential pardon, only to return to the City of Brotherly Love to relaunch his career of spreading hate and picking fights.\n\nIn Miami, self-professed members of Antifa, a political movement of far-left militants who oppose neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events, say they are bracing for a coming immigration crackdown. They're hoping President-elect Donald Trump's harshest campaign promises don't come to fruition. But they're ready in case they see civil rights being violated and decide they have to act.\n\nIn Ohio, a hardened Antifa coalition also waits to see what happens. Anti-fascist organizers and volunteers say they're gearing up in case America witnesses another \"George Floyd moment\" that galvanizes the far left and its black-clad militant wing into protests and action.\n\nAnd it's the same in California, where disparate groups of anti-fascists across the state are waiting and watching to see how a second Trump term pans out, and whether they need to don their signature all-black clothing and hit the streets.\n\n\"'If sh-- gets bad enough' - that's the operating phrase right there - there's always going to be a response,\" said Daryle Lamont Jenkins, a self-proclaimed anti-fascist and executive director of the One People's Project . \"As we say in the Black community: 'Don't start nothing, won't be nothing.'\"\n\nAntifa is always a wild card.\n\nVery few experts on domestic extremism truly understand the movement, which adherents call a political philosophy but opponents decry as everything from a thuggish menace to an evil army bent on destroying America.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, Antifa rose to new prominence fighting street brawls with far-right extremist groups emboldened by Trump's election and rhetoric. Even after Trump lost in 2020, Antifa continued its growth, buttressing the Black Lives Matter movement and resorting to civil disobedience and property damage to protest law enforcement's treatment of people of color.\n\nNow, as Trump enters a second term, anti-fascist activists find themselves facing down a new paradigm, in which they say a leader they already opposed has shifted ever-further toward the far right.\n\nTo understand what anti-fascists have planned for the coming months and years under Trump, USA TODAY interviewed more than a dozen self-proclaimed Antifa activists from across the country, in addition to experts and academics who study the movement.\n\nWhat emerged was a picture of active resistance, simmering anger and readiness for battle, if and when the time comes. Anti-fascists universally despise Trump as a full-blown fascist, worrying he will enact draconian and authoritarian policies that trample on the rule of law and civil rights. If he does, they say, they're ready to take action - whether with civil disobedience, protests, even violence.\n\nAnti-fascists across America worry the Trump administration will almost immediately begin to implement policies targeting three groups: immigrants, the transgender community and women.\n\nTrump communications director Steven Cheung cast scorn on antifascist activists who are criticizing the president-elect.\n\n\"These disturbed individuals clearly suffer from a debilitating and serious case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted their brains to the core, forcing them to live in an alternate reality devoid of truth or common sense,\" Cheung said. \"President Trump won a historic election with a massive mandate because the American people clearly support his America First policies that will unite the country after the four years of disastrous and failed leadership from Democrats.\"\n\nAnti-fascists and experts on extremism also foresee a new rise in America's far-right extremist groups under Trump.\n\nBuoyed by promised pardons of their brethren for their Jan. 6 crimes and by Trump's embrace of popular extremist far-right figures, those groups will likely see a resurgence after January, experts said. Anti-fascists say if that happens they will protect their neighborhoods from their sworn enemies, fighting on the streets again if necessary.\n\nWhat distinguishes the extreme far left from the far right, however, is an abhorrence for meaningless violence, death and terrorism - at least against people, anti-fascists and experts on the movement told USA TODAY.\n\nThe Antifa activists who spoke with USA TODAY all said they decry acts of terror like mass shootings or targeted attacks like the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last month. Acts of mass violence are the province of neo-Nazis, misogynists, incels and other far-right extremists, the activists said - not Antifa.\n\nBut several anti-fascists did not rule out acts of future violence by disenfranchised, politically disgruntled self-proclaimed Antifa acting as \"lone wolves.\"\n\n\"If Trump really aspires to the kind of authoritarianism that many people fear he would like to, historically, dictatorship and authoritarianism can push people into violent action,\" said Mark Bray, a lecturer in history at Rutgers University and author of \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.\" \"That has happened in the past, and we are potentially moving into uncharted waters.\"\n\nJaved Ali, senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council in 2017 and 2018 during the first Trump administration, said he's also concerned about a possible rise in terrorism and violence from disgruntled actors on the far left. Antifa activists may claim to be nonviolent, but in times of political stress the movement has not shied away from violence, he said.\n\n\"I think we we're going to have to wait and see how it plays out - if these immigration enforcement operations truly are terrible and start to look like the Japanese internment camps of the 1940s,\" Ali said. \"Will that provide the spark to someone who then springs into action? Maybe.\"\n\nAnti-fascists in America see themselves, and their allies, as under attack from Trump and his Make America Great Again movement.\n\nFrom the looming specter of Project 2025 - a policy blueprint drafted in part by white supremacists that Antifa believe threatens vulnerable communities across the country - to Trump's open embrace of conspiracy theories like the Great Replacement, anti-fascists said they're desperately worried about where the country is headed.\n\nBut that doesn't mean Antifa is about to storm the streets.\n\nA recent article on the anti-fascist website It's Going Down sums up what anti-fascists told USA TODAY in interviews: \"Don't Panic, Organize: Meeting the Moment of Trump's Second Term,\" reads like a blueprint for Antifa organizing in the first months of the new Trump term.\n\n\"Bring the energy from the streets back home by getting organized and building power in everyday institutions of social life,\" it reads. \"This might mean organizing a union at work, a tenant union at your apartment complex, an assembly in your neighborhood, or a student organization at school.\"\n\nThough many people's stereotype of Antifa is defined by violent black-clad protesters breaking windows and setting fire to police cruisers, the reality of the anti-fascist movement is far more mundane, said Stanislav Vysotsky, a professor of criminology and author of the book \"American Antifa.\"\n\nAntifa activists typically spend most of their time organizing, raising money and researching and exposing white supremacists and other far-right actors in their local area, Vysotsky said.\n\n\"The thing I'm hearing primarily from anarchist and anti-fascist voices is about working with communities, providing communities with support, building mutual-aid networks that they've been establishing for a while now, trying to use those as a base to weather the coming storm,\" he said.\n\nThis sort of organizing and resistance goes only so far, however.\n\nAnti-fascists told USA TODAY they are willing to stay in their corner, helping the people around them, unless and until their friends and communities start to feel the federal government is directly targeting them.\n\nBuilding resistant communities and networks to support them is one aspect of anti-fascism. But another key element of the movement is not ignoring attacks on those communities.\n\nWhat action Antifa takes when those policies go into place isn't clear. Most of the Antifa activists interviewed for this story talked in terms of \"lines being crossed\" or gauntlets being thrown that could lead to protests and more. But those lines, and those gauntlets, differ depending on whom is asked.\n\nHistory offers some guidance, however.\n\nAnti-fascist activism is typically reactive, said Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. Rather than organizing large-scale protests against Trump - something Pitcavage said he doubts Antifa has the numbers to do - anti-fascists will likely hunker down unless they are provoked into action, he said.\n\n\"It's certainly possible that you can have pro-Trump groups of various kinds, holding events, holding public actions at colleges or other places, that Antifa would want to respond to and react and show up for,\" Pitcavage said. \"If there are aggressive pro-Trump groups militarily holding parades or rallies or things like that, you could see Antifa easily responding to that.\"\n\nThe Black Lives Matter protests, launched after the murder of George Floyd, marked a rising up of the country's far left that was unparalleled in modern times, Vysotsky and others said. Though the vast majority of those protesters weren't active anti-fascists, the crowds were strengthened by Antifa organizers, cells and foot soldiers, he said.\n\nAn incident like Floyd's murder could galvanize the far left into action again, Vysotsky said, but the ignition could also come from elsewhere.\n\n\"It's hard to predict - it's hard to be aware of what the outrage might be, in terms of what might spark mass demonstrations around the country,\" Vysotsky said. \"Probably my best prediction would be a coordinated attempt at mass deportation - because that's going to mobilize people, both to protest and to some form of direct-action attempts to try to stop the deportations.\"\n\nAnti-fascists agreed.\n\nA highly visible campaign of deportations - particularly one that makes proactive incursions into communities that have given refuge to migrants lacking permanent legal status - could spark mass protests and more, Jenkins and other Antifa activists told USA TODAY.\n\n\"There is only so much that people will take - they're not going to have their lives uprooted in the name of politics,\" Jenkins said. \"It's the kids in cages talk - we all know that phrase 'Putting kids in cages,' but when it's your kid they're coming for and they're coming into your neighborhood, that's when things change.\"\n\nTrump has said on numerous occasions that he believes Antifa is a terrorist organization and should be designated as such.\n\nLegally, that's tricky.\n\nThe United States doesn't have a domestic terrorism law under which Antifa could be designated. But anti-fascists are aware of the president-elect's animosity toward them, and they are concerned Trump will try to use the full power of federal law enforcement agencies against them.\n\n\"Laws will have to be adhered to, and if they're not adhered to, then we're just going to have to figure out what to do after that,\" Jenkins said. \"Because if they aren't adhered to, then that means we have just entered into another chapter in this country's life - in this country's history.\"\n\nAntifa has also come under significant fire from state prosecutors in recent years. A groundbreaking case in San Diego last year saw two defendants found guilty of charges of conspiracy to riot stemming from their activities as part of an anti-fascist coalition that squared off against Trump supporters at a 2021 rally.\n\nAnti-fascists across the country told USA TODAY they're concerned federal and state prosecutors will target the movement. That means they have to be careful about organizing, engaging in what Antifa calls \"OpSec,\" or operations security.\n\nBut experts in domestic terrorism, and anti-fascists themselves, are less worried about the threat from organized Antifa than they are about loose cannons or \"lone wolves\" within their own ranks.\n\nSince 1990, the biggest threat to American lives from domestic terrorism has come from the far right, according to a study last year by the National Institutes of Justice.\n\nWhite supremacists and neo-Nazis have killed dozens of people in mass shootings, bombings and assassinations. But as the national political power structure shifts sharply to the right, experts in terrorism have begun to worry about a new threat: disgruntled anti-fascists who decide to take matters into their own hands.\n\n\"I do think there is a strong possibility of a resurgence,\" said Ali, the former Trump administration counterterrorism official. \"It wouldn't surprise me that there are people that are going to be angry at Trump, that are going to be angry at the policies, and beyond being angry - a smaller set may go out actually trying to engage in violent action.\"\n\nAnti-fascists stressed that random, or even targeted, acts of violence - especially mass violence - simply aren't in the tactics used by their movement. Mass shootings and bombings are the province of the far right, several Antifa activists told USA TODAY, and they don't foresee leftist terrorists committing such acts.\n\n\"The violence from the radical left has been, you know, punches to the face for the most part,\" Bray said. \"So I don't really see it happening.\""

      "text": "What is antifa and what does the movement want?\n\nSince the killing of George Floyd sparked protests across the U.S., the term \"antifa\" has been thrust back into the national conversation after multiple officials, including President Donald Trump , have blamed the groups for rioting and looting.\n\nAntifa - short for \"anti-fascist\" - is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning, anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast.\n\nSome of the groups, such as the 13-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, Oregon, the oldest in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook , while its members are individually anonymous.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted a message on Twitter , saying: \"The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization .\" That came one day after  he said \"the violence and vandalism is being led by antifa and other radical left-wing groups.\"\n\nAttorney General William Barr on Sunday also blamed antifa and other similar groups over violent protests - which erupted after Floyd, 46, died on Memorial Day when a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes - calling the acts \"domestic terrorism.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, however, says Trump did not have the power to label domestic terror groups .\n\n\"Terrorism is an inherently political label, easily abused and misused,\" the organization said in a tweet. \"Let's be clear: There is no legal authority for designating a domestic group. Any such designation would raise significant due process and First Amendment concerns.\"\n\nTwitter suspended the account @ANTIFA_US after it said the account violated the company's platform manipulation and spam policy for a tweet posted Sunday that tried to incite violence, according to NBC . Twitter later said the account had been linked to the white nationalist group Identity Evropa.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. posted a screenshot of the tweet to his verified Instagram page to share it with his 2.9 million followers. Trump Jr. has since deleted the post after Twitter suspended the account.\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump has set his focus on antifa. In August 2017, after violence blew up at protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, the president singled out the groups as part of what he called the alt-left in his initial claim that \"many sides\" were to blame for the violence, not just neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists.\n\n\"AN-tifa\" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like \"on\" in English than \"an.\"\n\nAnti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action.\n\nThe primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist.\n\nMark Bray, a lecturer at Dartmouth and author of the new book \"Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook,\" says the groups \"organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary.\"\n\nA main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counterprotesters at such events.\n\nIn addition, antifa is particularly active in \"doxxing,\" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks.\n\nMembers pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in \"self-defense,\" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views.\n\n\"We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,\" Rose City Antifa's Facebook page reads . \"Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.\"\n\nPolitical activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program \"Democracy Now\" about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the \"neofascists\" move against his group of protesters. \"We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,\" he said.\n\nBray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. \"We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,\" he says.\n\nAntifa forces, whose members often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley. Protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires , forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in 2017.\n\nIn June of that year, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to The Oregonian ."

      "text": "As crucial legal test for Antifa ideology heads to trial, right-wing media also scrutinized\n\nA criminal conspiracy case against a group of activists in San Diego is headed toward a trial that could prove crucial in defining the much-misunderstood political movement known as Antifa.\n\nSix members of the \"San Diego 11\" have negotiated plea deals with the San Diego District Attorney. But the five remaining defendants have vowed to take the case to trial, aided by defense attorneys known for taking on high-stakes political cases in California.\n\nThe defendants are charged with felonies, including conspiracy to riot, stemming from a day of unrest in Pacific Beach on Jan 9, 2021. As a USA TODAY investigation found in 2022, groups of anti-fascists clashed with white supremacists and supporters of former President Donald Trump throughout a day of protests and counterprotests, but only the self-professed anti-fascists were ever charged with crimes, despite video evidence showing white supremacists attacking people.\n\nExperts say the San Diego case could inspire prosecutors around the country to take similar aim at anti-fascists , treating adherents as if they're members of a gang or criminal enterprise rather than a political movement. While the argument may sound conceptual, the legal impact is significant: Gang-style conspiracy charges could also effectively double any prison sentences.\n\nSo the San Diego case has become a bellwether during a time when leftist protests are flaring up across the country.\n\nThis month alone, dozens of protesters who opposed an Atlanta police training facility were arrested in Atlanta and charged with domestic terrorism under a new Georgia state law, and in Ohio, two people were arrested during a faceoff between neo-Nazis and leftist supporters over a drag storytelling performance in a city park.\n\nThe stakes grow higher as the country moves into a new election cycle, said Stanislav Vysotsky,  a professor of criminology and author of the book \"American Antifa.\" A successful prosecution in San Diego could become a model for conservative prosecutors around the country, he said.\n\n\"It would give a really powerful tool of repression that could be used against not just anti-fascist activists but really any left-wing counterprotesters or left-wing protesters because you could just sort of slap them with a broad 'Antifa' label,\" Vysotsky said. \"It actually creates an 'Antifa' entity that doesn't exist to begin with.\"\n\nBut as trial draws closer, the case will also test the influence and conduct of right-wing media interests - some of the same elements  that have helped drive clashes between right- and left-wing activists.\n\nAn attorney for one Antifa defendant has asked the court to deny a  local journalist media privileges in the courtroom, alleging that she obtained her media credentials by filing documents with the court under an assumed name - something the attorney argues is a felony under California law - and that her reporting was used for a right-wing harassment campaign against the defendants.\n\nThe journalist in question has published stories for years under the false name and recently co-wrote a series of stories about the San Diego case with a far-right provocateur.\n\nThe same defense attorney says he will also soon file another motion asking the judge to dismiss the case that takes aim at the prosecution's key expert witness. The motion claims the witness - who, as USA TODAY reported last year, has a history of writing for far-right websites -  holds \"speculative and biased\" opinions that are not based on facts.\n\nUSA TODAY examined the case of the San Diego 11 in an in-depth investigation last September. At the time, a grand jury had recently indicted the defendants on a combined 29 felony charges, including conspiracy to riot.\n\nThe case is extraordinary not just because prosecutors chose only to charge one side involved in the day's violence but also because it seeks to define Antifa as a criminal enterprise that \"uses force, fear, and violence to further their interests and suppress the interests of others,\" according to the district attorney's office.\n\nIn recent years, Antifa has been portrayed by far-right-wing media, commentators and conspiracy theorists as a shadowy bogeyman intent on destroying America. Experts told USA TODAY that, if successful, the San Diego case could create a powerful precedent for prosecutors across the country - especially prosecutors looking to make a name for themselves with conservatives aligned with Trump.\n\nThe defense attorneys pledging to take the San Diego Antifa case to trial said it represents a watershed moment not just for anti-fascism but for freedom of speech in America.\n\n\"This is the criminalization of an ideology,\" said Curtis Briggs, defense attorney for Jeremy White, one of the remaining Antifa defendants. \"Really it's McCarthyism, and the United States went through this already.\"\n\nBriggs, who recently successfully defended Black Lives Matter protester Tianna Arata, who was charged with multiple crimes for participating in a protest that blocked a California freeway, said he decided to take on the San Diego case after reading about it in USA TODAY.\n\n\"This was a political case from the start, and it required a specific type of lawyering,\" Briggs said.\n\nVysotsky said experts across the country who study the anti-fascist movement are closely watching the San Diego case. A successful prosecution defining Antifa as an organization, rather than a political movement, could have serious repercussions, he said.\n\n\"There's definitely something about this case that makes it unique in terms of the precedent it is going to set,\" Vysotsky said. \"If this is successful, this will be a prosecutorial strategy that will be picked up by other prosecutors.\"\n\nThe five remaining defendants are due to stand trial in November.\n\nThe San Diego Antifa case also took a bizarre turn last month when one of the defense attorneys filed a motion accusing a local journalist of committing numerous felonies.\n\nAccording to the motion, filed by attorney John Hamasaki, journalist Catherine Cranston has, for years, used the false name \"Eva Knott\" to write for the San Diego Reader, a local free magazine. The Reader's editor and publisher did not respond to a request for comment but has confirmed to USA TODAY that Eva Knott is a pseudonym.\n\nUnder the Knott byline, Cranston recently co-wrote several stories about the San Diego case with Andy Ngo, who has made a name for himself as an antagonist of anti-fascists across the country. He is the editor-at-large of the Canadian conservative website the Post Millennial, for which he regularly writes stories that are highly critical of Antifa. Ngo and Knott's stories about the San Diego case, similarly, are critical of the defendants.\n\nHamasaki's motion notes that Cranston filed paperwork with the San Diego court seeking permission to record and take photographs in hearings for the case. She filled out multiple court documents in the false name of \"Eva Knott,\" Hamasaki claims, which the court filing asserts is a felony under California state law.\n\nCranston then shared the photographs she took in court with Ngo, who published them on social media and on his website, the motion claims. As a result of this publicity, the \"defendants were subject to a campaign of harassment by right-wing extremists,\" the motion says.\n\nJohn Donohue, a professor at Stanford Law School, said it's doubtful Cranston's actions fell afoul of the law cited by Hamasaki. Cranston would have to be filing the documents with \"improper intent,\" Donohue said.\n\n\"If she regularly writes using that pen name, one imagines that she could make an argument that she was using an official name,\" Donohue said. \"In the same way that maybe a movie star might have a name that they're using in their movie performances.\"\n\nCranston did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Ngo wrote:\n\n\"The San Diego Antifa conspiracy case you contacted me about involves suspects who have already pleaded guilty to planning and carrying out extreme acts of violence on the public, something they'd likely wish on my colleague and me for reporting about their crimes.\"\n\n(As USA TODAY reported last year, the victims attacked by the anti-fascist activists include people identified by activists as white supremacist agitators notorious for spurring fights in neighborhoods where they're not welcome. At least one has a criminal record and has long been involved with neo-Nazi groups.)\n\nA USA TODAY reporter asked Cranston about the name outside a court hearing for the case last year. Asked if Eva was her real name, Cranston stated \"Yes, didn't you see my press pass?\"\n\n\"My name is Eva Knott,\" she continued.\n\nKnott's press pass was revoked by the San Diego Police Department in October. (While a press pass is not required in California to attend court hearings, it can be helpful to access areas from which the public have been prohibited.)\n\nThe San Diego Sheriff's Department, which has jurisdiction over crimes committed in San Diego Superior Court, did not respond to a request for comment asking whether Cranston is being investigated for her alleged misrepresentations.\n\nIn a recent hearing for the Antifa case, Cranston was asked by the bailiff to leave the front row of the court, where media usually sits. It is unclear whether she will be allowed to continue to attend the hearings.\n\nHamasaki said he will move to have  the case against his client dismissed because, he says, it is based upon inaccurate and misleading testimony from the prosecution's main expert witness, who testified during the grand jury that indicted the San Diego 11 last year.\n\nDawn Perlmutter, who bills herself as an expert in investigating religious terrorism and symbology, as USA TODAY reported last year, has a history of writing screeds against Antifa and Black Lives Matter protesters in right wing publications.\n\nHamasaki said he will argue Perlmutter provided the grand jury with \"incompetent and irrelevant evidence\" that \"tainted the grand jury proceedings to such an extent that the Indictment was obtained in violation\" of his client's constitutional rights.\n\nAn argument against the main witness will be, in essence, a microcosm of the case itself.\n\nHamasaki's argument is that Perlmutter's definition of Antifa, as described to the grand jury, is inaccurate, biased and not borne out by facts. Her description of the movement was so far out of sync with the reality of what Antifa is, Hamasaki argues, that it unfairly tainted the grand jury's decision to indict his client.\n\nIn a separate case, a Pennsylvania court issued an injunction against Perlmutter for claims that had already led her to be dubbed a \"vexatious litigant.\"  The injunction stems from  civil lawsuits that Perlmutter filed, unsuccessfully, \"for more than a decade, in seven different lawsuits filed in federal and state courts,\" according to court records.\n\nPerlmutter did not respond to a call for comment."

      "text": "Is Antifa a gang? Trial in street brawl at pro-Trump rally opens a landmark legal test\n\nThe trial of two men, charged in a 3-year-old street brawl in a California beach town, could soon reshape the image of one of the most debated political movements in America: Antifa.\n\nOpening arguments Tuesday laid out conflicting views about the roles Brian Lightfoot and Jeremy White played in a heated protest in the San Diego neighborhood of Pacific Beach on Jan. 9, 2021, three days after the Capitol insurrection.\n\nThat day, far-right protesters ended up in a string of violent brawls with anti-fascist counterprotesters. Prosecutors, however, focused solely on Antifa, charging 11 defendants with dozens of felonies.\n\nThe prosecution's case rests not just on proving that Lightfoot and White engaged in the acts they're accused of - hardly in dispute, as they're caught on camera from multiple angles - but that they did so as part of a broader conspiracy to commit violence. That conspiracy, Harvey and her team have argued, was organized under and inspired by the banner of Antifa, a political movement of far-left militants who oppose neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events.\n\nBut defense attorneys argued the case opens the door for conspiracy allegations against anyone who protests against fascism, or even dresses in black. \"It has a chilling effect on political expression,\" said attorney John Hamasaki, who is representing Lightfoot.\n\nOf 11 original defendants, nine made deals with prosecutors. White and Lightfoot, represented by activist attorneys, took the case to trial, stressing its importance not just to them, but to protesters against fascism across the country.\n\nA gang-style conspiracy conviction could effectively double any prison sentence. If successful, it could be used as a blueprint for prosecutors across the country, according to legal experts. It could also bolster a right-wing political narrative that has claimed Antifa is not just a political ideology, but a dangerous group.\n\n\"This case opens the door for any prosecutor to approach any protest where people are either anti-fascist or dressed in black and to pursue them under a conspiracy,\" said attorney John Hamasaki, who is representing Lightfoot. \"It has a chilling effect on political expression.\"\n\nBut the prosecution's high-profile approach has been criticized, in part because the two-sided street brawls only led to charges for one side. Video from the day showed fights involving people affiliated with the extremist group the Proud Boys and local white supremacist factions.\n\nYet the office of San Diego District Attorney Summer Stephan chose to prosecute only black-clad anti-fascists. Stephan, a longtime Republican who left the party and ran in the nonpartisan DA election, has a history of supporting conspiracy theories about Antifa.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, prosecutors painted Antifa as a menace to society.\n\nIn her opening statement, Deputy District Attorney Makenzie Harvey played numerous videos of the 11 incidents of violence from Jan. 9 that prosecutors have focused on, some of which only tangentially involved, or didn't at all involve, either of the defendants.\n\nWhite, Lightfoot, and their alleged co-conspirators came to San Diego \"with the intention to shut down the speech and the assembly of a patriot group, for the simple fact that they didn't agree with their beliefs,\" Harvey told the jury. \"You will see that these defendants and their co-conspirators arrived in San Diego dressed and armed and prepared for violence.\"\n\nHarvey said prosecutors will show the jury secret communications between anti-fascists from San Diego and Los Angeles that prove the defendants were always intent on committing violence against peaceful, patriotic protestors.\n\nAttorneys for the two defendants sought to poke holes in the broader conspiracy argument and to distance their clients from the violence.\n\nHamasaki described his client as a wildland firefighter in training, who grew up in poverty in South-Central Los Angeles. Leading up to, and during, the social justice uprisings following the murder of George Floyd, Lightfoot became fascinated by the anti-fascist movement, Hamasaki said. So he bought some equipment and hit the streets to protest against what he believes are malevolent racist and fascist far-right actors.\n\n\"Anti-fascism is an ideology, it's a belief system - It's saying 'I am opposed to fascism,'\" Hamasaki said. \"The prosecution said the net is pretty wide for who they consider fascists - that it's not just white supremacists and neo-Nazis but also Trump supporters - I think you're going to find in this case there's some overlap in that.\"\n\nRepresenting White, San Francisco attorney Curtis Briggs said his client came to Pacific Beach equipped as a medic and ready to help fellow anti-fascists who might be injured during the protests. White attended protests and rallies across the country, Briggs said, even winning a Certificate of Congressional Recognition for his activism on behalf of Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nAs he witnessed fellow protesters increasingly attacked by far-right agitators, White \"put on a suit of armor\" which included a helmet emblazoned with the message \"When the shooting starts, get behind me,\" and stepped into the fray, Briggs said.\n\nAnd Briggs noted that the people listed as victims in the DA's case carried weapons of their own: at least two knives, a replica gun, gloves with kevlar-reinforced knuckles and pepper spray.\n\nAs USA TODAY first reported in 2022, those victims include people identified by activists as white supremacist agitators notorious for spurring fights in neighborhoods where they're not welcome. At least one has a criminal record and has long been involved with neo-Nazi groups.\n\n\"Please pay close attention to whether the people on the stand have vice - whether they're really victims or not - and approach the prosecution's case with healthy skepticism,\" Briggs told the jury.\n\nProsecutors, however, filed a successful, wide-ranging motion in the case a few weeks ago that severely limits how the defense attorneys may describe the pro-Trump protesters from the day of the crimes.\n\nThroughout the opening arguments, the prosecutors objected to every mention by defense attorneys of well-known groups including the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters and local San Diego neo-Nazi organizations. At one point, Judge Daniel Goldstein halted proceedings and dismissed the jury before chastising Hamasaki for using such terms, noting that he had ruled on this matter \"at least seven times.\"\n\nSan Diego community advocate Tasha Williamson, who attended trial in support of White and Lightfoot, said she was upset by what she saw as inequity.\n\n\"Clearly, the district attorney only believes in the First Amendment rights of white supremacists, not the rights of people who look like me,\" Williamson, who is Black, said. \"I heard 'Antifa' so many times, but not 'Proud Boys,' or 'American Guard' or 'Defend East County' or any of these people who have threatened my life, my family's life, who are known white supremacists.\"\n\nShe added: \"You can't even utter those words in that courtroom, and I'm ashamed to have to walk through these doors, where it says justice everywhere. This isn't justice.\"\n\nMembers of the prosecution said they could not comment on the case.\n\nWhile the two face charges with varying sentences, Lightfoot could serve up to 18 years if convicted. The trial is expected to continue through the rest of the month."

      "text": "Fact check: Quote attributed to Joe Biden about antifa is missing context\n\nOf the many quotable statements from the first presidential debate on Tuesday, Sept. 29, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's assertion about the anti-fascist movement antifa was especially memorable.\n\n\"His own FBI director said ... antifa is an idea, not an organization,\" Biden said, referring to President Donald Trump and FBI Director Chris Wray.\n\nThe comment was prompted by debate moderator Chris Wallace's question to Trump about his willingness to condemn white supremacists and militia groups.\n\n\"Who would you like me to condemn?\" Trump asked.\n\n\"The Proud Boys,\" Biden said.\n\nThe Proud Boys have been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center because of its white supremacist and anti-Muslim sentiments.\n\n\"Proud Boys - stand back and stand by,\" Trump said, according to USA TODAY . \"But I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left.\"\n\nBefore the debate ended, Biden's statement about antifa found its way to social media.\n\n\"'A quote from joe biden 'Antifa is an idea not an organization,'\" a Facebook user posted on Sept. 29.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the user for comment.\n\nIn September, Wray testified before Congress about possible foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election, USA TODAY reported . Trump nominated Wray in 2017 after firing former director James Comey.\n\nWray's testimony also touched on incidents of violence amid social justice protests throughout the country.\n\nHe told lawmakers the FBI is investigating violent extremists on both ends of the ideological spectrum -- from antifa on the far left to militia and supremacist groups on the far right, according to USA TODAY.\n\nBut Wray stopped short of labeling antifa an organization.\n\n\"(Antifa is) not a group or an organization. It's a movement or an ideology,\" Wray said, according to the Associated Press .\n\nAntifa, which is short for \"antifascist,\" gained prominence after the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, according to the Anti-Defamation League .\n\nShortly after Wray's testimony, Trump disputed the FBI director's comments about antifa on Twitter.\n\nIn a tweet , the president said the movement is made up of \"well funded anarchists & thugs.\"\n\nIn May, Trump tweeted the U.S. will designate antifa a terrorist organization, and was still promising his administration would do so as of Sept. 25 .\n\nBut according to a June brief by the Center for Strategic & International Studies, the most significant domestic terror threat likely comes from white supremacists. The center found that right-wing extremists perpetuated over 90% of attacks and plots on U.S. soil from Jan. 1 to May 8, 2020.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security assessed that white supremacist extremists pose \"the most persistent and lethal threat\" to the United States, according to a draft report by the agency. Senior Brookings Institute fellow Benjamin Wittes posted scans of the report to his Twitter account on Sept. 4. In a September 2019 report , DHS called \"White supremacist violent extremism ... one of the most potent forces driving domestic terrorism.\"\n\nWe rate this claim MISSING CONTEXT, based on our research. The initial claim attributed a statement characterizing anti-fascist movement antifa as an idea, not a movement, to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Biden appropriately credited the statement to FBI Director Chris Wray, but the claim did not.\n\nContributed: The Associated Press\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

      "text": "Two defendants guilty of conspiracy in groundbreaking Antifa trial in San Diego\n\nA San Diego jury on Friday found two anti-fascists guilty of conspiracy to riot, in a case that became a bellwether for legal action against the political movement.\n\nThe two defendants had faced a raft of various charges related to rioting and assault during a protest in a beach neighborhood in the aftermath of the tumultuous 2020 election. In that protest, on Jan. 9, 2021, members of the Proud Boys and other supporters of then-President Donald Trump had rallied and clashed with anti-fascists .\n\nBut only the anti-fascists had faced charges. Prosecutors set out to convince a jury that the assailants were not simply individual participants, but that they had conspired under the banner of Antifa, essentially acting as a criminal gang.\n\nBrian Lightfoot and Jeremy White were both found guilty of conspiracy to riot at the protest.\n\nBut the decision was split, as many other charges did not lead to conviction. The jury, which deliberated for more than a week, failed to reach a verdict on most of the most serious assault charges against Lightfoot, found him not guilty of one assault, and found White innocent of the one assault he was accused of committing.\n\nFor the individual defendants, the verdicts represented a lighter possible sentence for Lightfoot, but possible prison time for White, who said he was \"heartbroken.\"\n\nAnd attorneys for both defendants said the verdicts represent a huge blow to the anti-fascist movement and to protesters in general, at a time when a new wave of protests has sprung up on college campuses across the country in opposition to the war in Gaza.\n\n\"I think the door is wide open to now hold lawful protesters in violation of conspiracy law,\" said Curtis Briggs, who represented White.\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2021, a group of assorted Trump supporters, Proud Boys and members of the extreme right in San Diego, including people with a history of violence at local protests, marched around Pacific Beach shouting slogans and calling on anti-fascists to fight with them.\n\nSome of the protesters were met by a cadre of several dozen anti-fascists, many dressed head-to-toe in black. Over the afternoon, the anti-fascists approached and violently confronted the protesters, spraying some with pepper spray and assaulting others. In other incidents, the protesters attacked leftists and onlookers.\n\nA year later, the San Diego district attorney announced charges against 11 individuals - all of them antifascists.\n\nThe case drew extra attention for its overt focus on Antifa, which is generally understood as a leaderless ideology, rather than an organization. Far-right commentators and conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson and conservative politicians, all the way up to Trump, have long claimed Antifa is not just a social movement but an organized, shadowy army .\n\nAll of the original defendants were charged with conspiracy to riot, and prosecutors portrayed them as an organized, malicious force that came to San Diego to pick a fight with supporters of former President Donald Trump, just three days after the Capitol insurrection.\n\nThe defense questioned the motivation of Stephan's office and filed a motion seeking to have her dismissed from the case. The top prosecutor, a Republican who left the party to run in the nonpartisan DA election, has a history of supporting conspiracy theories about Antifa.\n\nA former federal prosecutor told USA TODAY the decision to charge only one side of the fracas was \"idiotic.\"\n\n\"It's an insult to the public's intelligence to suggest that that's a legitimate prosecution. It's not. It's selective prosecution,\" said Patrick Cotter, who now works in private practice.\n\nOf the 11 original defendants, nine cut deals with prosecutors that saw some of them agree to multi-year prison sentences. Two, Los Angeles residents Lightfoot and White, decided to argue their cases before a jury. They were represented by civil rights attorneys, who told USA TODAY they took on the cases because of their potential impact on the broader anti-fascist movement.\n\nOf the two defendants, Lightfoot was facing the most charges. He was accused of spraying pepper spray at Trump supporters and of committing assaults likely to commit great bodily injury. During closing arguments of the trial, prosecutors said he came to San Diego ready to commit violence.\n\n\"He wanted to fight,\" said Deputy District Attorney Makenzie Harvey. \"They were here looking to commit violence.\"\n\nOf the 16 counts he faced, Lightfoot was found guilty of six. The jury could not make a decision and \"hung\" on nine of the charges, and found him not guilty of one of the charges of assault.\n\nJohn Hamasaki, Lightfoot's attorney, noted that his client was never offered a plea deal by prosecutors prior to trial. He called Friday's verdict \"a repudiation of the District Attorney's efforts.\"\n\n\"It looked like the jury really did an independent and thorough job looking at the facts and coming to a decision,\" Hamasaki said.\n\n\"I feel pretty good,\" Lightfoot told USA TODAY. \"I was at peace with it.\"\n\nWhite was less upbeat.\n\n\"I was heartbroken - it felt surreal that they could find us guilty of that,\" he told USA TODAY. \"This is a group of prosecutors and cops who have never once prosecuted the violent white supremacists that we were counter-protesting that day.\"\n\nBriggs said the verdict doesn't make sense, since his client was convicted of conspiracy to riot, but acquitted of actually ever committing any crime on the day.\n\n\"It's illogical,\" Briggs said, adding, about White: \"He's devastated. He's a political activist who cares about his community who is now facing jail time.\"\n\nThe San Diego District Attorney's Office sent USA TODAY a statement thanking the jury for their service:\n\n\"This was a complex case with 11 defendants indicted and now all convicted - nine by guilty pleas and two by jury verdict. The DA team worked tirelessly on this case in order to be sure our community remains safe, and that the rule of law is followed.\"\n\nWhite told USA TODAY he is committed to appealing his conviction. He said he is less worried about the impact of the case on his own life, and more concerned about the future of the anti-fascist movement and the broader protest movement.\n\n\"The prosecutors did everything they could to make us look like this criminal gang or terrorist cell,\" he said. \"It has bad implications for protestors out there trying to fight against fascism, against police brutality and state repression.\"\n\nHamasaki agreed.\n\n\"As we're looking at all these protests happening around the country, I think this bodes ill for a lot of people if prosecutors are looking to file felony conspiracy charges against people who are involved in active first amendment behavior,\" Hamasaki said. \"It can have a chilling effect.\""

As the two groups clashed, despite the efforts of dozens of police officers, brawls broke out.

      "text": "Far-left Antifa activists waiting to see Trump actions. How will anti-fascists respond?\n\nManage your account\n\nIn Philadelphia, anti-fascists are preparing for the day the leader of the local Proud Boys chapter gets out of prison, jailed for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Local Antifa are sure he will receive a presidential pardon, only to return to the City of Brotherly Love to relaunch his career of spreading hate and picking fights.\n\nIn Miami, self-professed members of Antifa, a political movement of far-left militants who oppose neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events, say they are bracing for a coming immigration crackdown. They're hoping President-elect Donald Trump's harshest campaign promises don't come to fruition. But they're ready in case they see civil rights being violated and decide they have to act.\n\nIn Ohio, a hardened Antifa coalition also waits to see what happens. Anti-fascist organizers and volunteers say they're gearing up in case America witnesses another \"George Floyd moment\" that galvanizes the far left and its black-clad militant wing into protests and action.\n\nAnd it's the same in California, where disparate groups of anti-fascists across the state are waiting and watching to see how a second Trump term pans out, and whether they need to don their signature all-black clothing and hit the streets.\n\n\"'If sh-- gets bad enough' - that's the operating phrase right there - there's always going to be a response,\" said Daryle Lamont Jenkins, a self-proclaimed anti-fascist and executive director of the One People's Project . \"As we say in the Black community: 'Don't start nothing, won't be nothing.'\"\n\nAntifa is always a wild card.\n\nVery few experts on domestic extremism truly understand the movement, which adherents call a political philosophy but opponents decry as everything from a thuggish menace to an evil army bent on destroying America.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, Antifa rose to new prominence fighting street brawls with far-right extremist groups emboldened by Trump's election and rhetoric. Even after Trump lost in 2020, Antifa continued its growth, buttressing the Black Lives Matter movement and resorting to civil disobedience and property damage to protest law enforcement's treatment of people of color.\n\nNow, as Trump enters a second term, anti-fascist activists find themselves facing down a new paradigm, in which they say a leader they already opposed has shifted ever-further toward the far right.\n\nTo understand what anti-fascists have planned for the coming months and years under Trump, USA TODAY interviewed more than a dozen self-proclaimed Antifa activists from across the country, in addition to experts and academics who study the movement.\n\nWhat emerged was a picture of active resistance, simmering anger and readiness for battle, if and when the time comes. Anti-fascists universally despise Trump as a full-blown fascist, worrying he will enact draconian and authoritarian policies that trample on the rule of law and civil rights. If he does, they say, they're ready to take action - whether with civil disobedience, protests, even violence.\n\nAnti-fascists across America worry the Trump administration will almost immediately begin to implement policies targeting three groups: immigrants, the transgender community and women.\n\nTrump communications director Steven Cheung cast scorn on antifascist activists who are criticizing the president-elect.\n\n\"These disturbed individuals clearly suffer from a debilitating and serious case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted their brains to the core, forcing them to live in an alternate reality devoid of truth or common sense,\" Cheung said. \"President Trump won a historic election with a massive mandate because the American people clearly support his America First policies that will unite the country after the four years of disastrous and failed leadership from Democrats.\"\n\nAnti-fascists and experts on extremism also foresee a new rise in America's far-right extremist groups under Trump.\n\nBuoyed by promised pardons of their brethren for their Jan. 6 crimes and by Trump's embrace of popular extremist far-right figures, those groups will likely see a resurgence after January, experts said. Anti-fascists say if that happens they will protect their neighborhoods from their sworn enemies, fighting on the streets again if necessary.\n\nWhat distinguishes the extreme far left from the far right, however, is an abhorrence for meaningless violence, death and terrorism - at least against people, anti-fascists and experts on the movement told USA TODAY.\n\nThe Antifa activists who spoke with USA TODAY all said they decry acts of terror like mass shootings or targeted attacks like the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last month. Acts of mass violence are the province of neo-Nazis, misogynists, incels and other far-right extremists, the activists said - not Antifa.\n\nBut several anti-fascists did not rule out acts of future violence by disenfranchised, politically disgruntled self-proclaimed Antifa acting as \"lone wolves.\"\n\n\"If Trump really aspires to the kind of authoritarianism that many people fear he would like to, historically, dictatorship and authoritarianism can push people into violent action,\" said Mark Bray, a lecturer in history at Rutgers University and author of \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.\" \"That has happened in the past, and we are potentially moving into uncharted waters.\"\n\nJaved Ali, senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council in 2017 and 2018 during the first Trump administration, said he's also concerned about a possible rise in terrorism and violence from disgruntled actors on the far left. Antifa activists may claim to be nonviolent, but in times of political stress the movement has not shied away from violence, he said.\n\n\"I think we we're going to have to wait and see how it plays out - if these immigration enforcement operations truly are terrible and start to look like the Japanese internment camps of the 1940s,\" Ali said. \"Will that provide the spark to someone who then springs into action? Maybe.\"\n\nAnti-fascists in America see themselves, and their allies, as under attack from Trump and his Make America Great Again movement.\n\nFrom the looming specter of Project 2025 - a policy blueprint drafted in part by white supremacists that Antifa believe threatens vulnerable communities across the country - to Trump's open embrace of conspiracy theories like the Great Replacement, anti-fascists said they're desperately worried about where the country is headed.\n\nBut that doesn't mean Antifa is about to storm the streets.\n\nA recent article on the anti-fascist website It's Going Down sums up what anti-fascists told USA TODAY in interviews: \"Don't Panic, Organize: Meeting the Moment of Trump's Second Term,\" reads like a blueprint for Antifa organizing in the first months of the new Trump term.\n\n\"Bring the energy from the streets back home by getting organized and building power in everyday institutions of social life,\" it reads. \"This might mean organizing a union at work, a tenant union at your apartment complex, an assembly in your neighborhood, or a student organization at school.\"\n\nThough many people's stereotype of Antifa is defined by violent black-clad protesters breaking windows and setting fire to police cruisers, the reality of the anti-fascist movement is far more mundane, said Stanislav Vysotsky, a professor of criminology and author of the book \"American Antifa.\"\n\nAntifa activists typically spend most of their time organizing, raising money and researching and exposing white supremacists and other far-right actors in their local area, Vysotsky said.\n\n\"The thing I'm hearing primarily from anarchist and anti-fascist voices is about working with communities, providing communities with support, building mutual-aid networks that they've been establishing for a while now, trying to use those as a base to weather the coming storm,\" he said.\n\nThis sort of organizing and resistance goes only so far, however.\n\nAnti-fascists told USA TODAY they are willing to stay in their corner, helping the people around them, unless and until their friends and communities start to feel the federal government is directly targeting them.\n\nBuilding resistant communities and networks to support them is one aspect of anti-fascism. But another key element of the movement is not ignoring attacks on those communities.\n\nWhat action Antifa takes when those policies go into place isn't clear. Most of the Antifa activists interviewed for this story talked in terms of \"lines being crossed\" or gauntlets being thrown that could lead to protests and more. But those lines, and those gauntlets, differ depending on whom is asked.\n\nHistory offers some guidance, however.\n\nAnti-fascist activism is typically reactive, said Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. Rather than organizing large-scale protests against Trump - something Pitcavage said he doubts Antifa has the numbers to do - anti-fascists will likely hunker down unless they are provoked into action, he said.\n\n\"It's certainly possible that you can have pro-Trump groups of various kinds, holding events, holding public actions at colleges or other places, that Antifa would want to respond to and react and show up for,\" Pitcavage said. \"If there are aggressive pro-Trump groups militarily holding parades or rallies or things like that, you could see Antifa easily responding to that.\"\n\nThe Black Lives Matter protests, launched after the murder of George Floyd, marked a rising up of the country's far left that was unparalleled in modern times, Vysotsky and others said. Though the vast majority of those protesters weren't active anti-fascists, the crowds were strengthened by Antifa organizers, cells and foot soldiers, he said.\n\nAn incident like Floyd's murder could galvanize the far left into action again, Vysotsky said, but the ignition could also come from elsewhere.\n\n\"It's hard to predict - it's hard to be aware of what the outrage might be, in terms of what might spark mass demonstrations around the country,\" Vysotsky said. \"Probably my best prediction would be a coordinated attempt at mass deportation - because that's going to mobilize people, both to protest and to some form of direct-action attempts to try to stop the deportations.\"\n\nAnti-fascists agreed.\n\nA highly visible campaign of deportations - particularly one that makes proactive incursions into communities that have given refuge to migrants lacking permanent legal status - could spark mass protests and more, Jenkins and other Antifa activists told USA TODAY.\n\n\"There is only so much that people will take - they're not going to have their lives uprooted in the name of politics,\" Jenkins said. \"It's the kids in cages talk - we all know that phrase 'Putting kids in cages,' but when it's your kid they're coming for and they're coming into your neighborhood, that's when things change.\"\n\nTrump has said on numerous occasions that he believes Antifa is a terrorist organization and should be designated as such.\n\nLegally, that's tricky.\n\nThe United States doesn't have a domestic terrorism law under which Antifa could be designated. But anti-fascists are aware of the president-elect's animosity toward them, and they are concerned Trump will try to use the full power of federal law enforcement agencies against them.\n\n\"Laws will have to be adhered to, and if they're not adhered to, then we're just going to have to figure out what to do after that,\" Jenkins said. \"Because if they aren't adhered to, then that means we have just entered into another chapter in this country's life - in this country's history.\"\n\nAntifa has also come under significant fire from state prosecutors in recent years. A groundbreaking case in San Diego last year saw two defendants found guilty of charges of conspiracy to riot stemming from their activities as part of an anti-fascist coalition that squared off against Trump supporters at a 2021 rally.\n\nAnti-fascists across the country told USA TODAY they're concerned federal and state prosecutors will target the movement. That means they have to be careful about organizing, engaging in what Antifa calls \"OpSec,\" or operations security.\n\nBut experts in domestic terrorism, and anti-fascists themselves, are less worried about the threat from organized Antifa than they are about loose cannons or \"lone wolves\" within their own ranks.\n\nSince 1990, the biggest threat to American lives from domestic terrorism has come from the far right, according to a study last year by the National Institutes of Justice.\n\nWhite supremacists and neo-Nazis have killed dozens of people in mass shootings, bombings and assassinations. But as the national political power structure shifts sharply to the right, experts in terrorism have begun to worry about a new threat: disgruntled anti-fascists who decide to take matters into their own hands.\n\n\"I do think there is a strong possibility of a resurgence,\" said Ali, the former Trump administration counterterrorism official. \"It wouldn't surprise me that there are people that are going to be angry at Trump, that are going to be angry at the policies, and beyond being angry - a smaller set may go out actually trying to engage in violent action.\"\n\nAnti-fascists stressed that random, or even targeted, acts of violence - especially mass violence - simply aren't in the tactics used by their movement. Mass shootings and bombings are the province of the far right, several Antifa activists told USA TODAY, and they don't foresee leftist terrorists committing such acts.\n\n\"The violence from the radical left has been, you know, punches to the face for the most part,\" Bray said. \"So I don't really see it happening.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Antifa sees Trump as fascist.

      "text": "Where's Antifa been this year? Anti-fascist groups stepped away from street protests, not activism\n\nManage your account\n\nA year ago, conservative pundits couldn't air enough breathy reports about Antifa. Tucker Carlson, Ben Shapiro and Alex Jones warned of a veritable anarchist army ready to overthrow the U.S. government and impose a communist regime. It didn't.\n\nAfter hordes of supporters of former President Donald Trump invaded the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 , Antifa was nowhere to be seen. Two weeks later, when Joe Biden was inaugurated as president, experts warned far-right activists might descend on Washington again.\n\nFor the rest of the year, apart from a few isolated scuffles, Antifa activists haven't engaged in the street battles or civil unrest that marked the preceding years.\n\nAs 2021 comes to a close, a question looms: What happened to Antifa?\n\nThis lack of highly public engagement by anti-fascists doesn't mean the movement has gone away. Antifa experts and self-proclaimed anti-fascists said activists do what they have always done: quietly research and expose racists, bigots and other people who mean harm to their fellow Americans and work on community projects that support marginalized people.\n\n\"In the broad spectrum of activities that are effective in anti-fascism, most go completely unnoticed compared to street action, which is really just the tip of the spear,\" said Chad Loder, an anti-fascist activist in Southern California. \"That's really just an activity of last resort for Antifa.\"\n\nBecause many people define Antifa only by the actions of a minority of activists, rather than recognizing the entirety of the movement, they miss the whole picture, said Stanislav Vysotsky, a professor of criminology and author of the book \"American Antifa.\"\n\n\"The street demonstrator is such a small portion of what anti-fascist activism entails that it's very much blown out of proportion,\" Vysotsky said. \"Ninety-five percent of anti-fascist activism is nonconfrontational and nonviolent.\"\n\nProud Boys Recruitment: They joined the Wisconsin Proud Boys looking for brotherhood. They found racism, bullying and antisemitism.\n\nAntifa on Jan. 6: Misleading claim about 'antifa member' at Capitol riot\n\nThe stereotypical image of an Antifa activist is a violent one: a young person, all in black, wearing menacing lace-up boots and a face mask and probably holding a weapon of some sort.\n\nThis enduring boogeyman image is by design.\n\nEver since the term Antifa came into common use in 2017, the American far-right, aided by pundits in conservative media, has seized upon it, cast ing it wherever there is civil disobedience or anarchy. Crowds that turned angry, from Black Lives Matter protesters to environmental activists to student protesters, have been labeled Antifa by conservative commentators.\n\nIt's a political tactic, said Mark Bray, a lecturer in history at Rutgers University and author of \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.\"\n\n\"They care about using that specter to associate Antifa with the Democratic Party; in order to portray the Democratic Party as extremist, fanatical, violent and anti-democratic,\" he said. \"That's the real payoff in that rhetoric.\"\n\nThe reality is that most anti-fascist work is more mundane, Bray and other experts said. Most anti-fascists spend more time in front of their keyboards or attending cultural events than they do on the streets confronting the far-right or engaging in civil disobedience.\n\n\"What these groups are doing is a lot more about research into what far-right groups are active, who their members and leaders are, where they're trying to have events,\" Bray said. \"The kinds of public spectacle, confrontation, was always, at most, the tip of the iceberg of what these groups do.\"\n\nThe anti-fascist movement, active in Europe since the dawn of fascism in 1920s Italy, came to the USA in the mid-1980s.\n\nAs the American racist skinhead movement flourished, anti-racist groups began organizing, some coalescing into formal collectives such as Anti-Racist Action in Minneapolis. These groups confronted racist skinheads, sometimes violently, at concerts and demonstrations.\n\nAs the skinhead movement died down in the late-'90s, anti-fascism went largely underground . Since there were fewer overt, organized racist groups on America's streets , anti-fascists resumed their work researching the far-right and naming and shaming people with hateful views, a tactic that became known as \"doxxing.\"\n\nThe election of Donald Trump as president and the ensuing reemergence of the racist far-right in America sent shock waves through the anti-fascist movement.\n\nHere was a president who had started his political career with the trope that former President Barack Obama was not a U.S. citizen. He called Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and was accused of supporting racist causes.\n\nWhite supremacist America saw its opportunity.\n\n\"In the craziness of the 2016 Trump era, I was euphoric,\" said Richard Spencer, the de facto leader of the \"alt-right,\" a political movement that mixes racism, white nationalism, antisemitism and populism. \"It felt like it could just keep going, we could just fly.\"\n\nAs they had in the past, anti-fascists watched as white supremacists became emboldened. Veteran anti-fascist activists were quickly joined by legions of volunteers who wanted to help stem what they called a fascist tide washing across the country.\n\n\"With Trump, there were a lot of people that were concerned about the threat of fascism,\" said Kieran Knutson, a longtime Minnesota activist who was a nonracist skinhead and a founding member of Anti-Racist Action in 1987. \"There was a genuine influx of people who considered themselves anti-fascists and wanted to do something.\"\n\nAt a rally called Unite the Right in August 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia, young white supremacists marched through a university campus bearing torches and chanting, \"Jews will not replace us.\" They were met by scores of counterprotesters, many of whom self-identified as anti-fascists. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed when a man who had espoused neo-Nazi beliefs drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.\n\nCharlottesville introduced many Americans not just to an emergent racist right but also to an invigorated anti-fascist movement whose members were willing to get bloody fighting for a cause they believed in , Vysotsky said. Charlottesville also spawned a mythology about the movement that would, for many Americans, define it for years to come, he said.\n\n\"That particular day is so marked by violence and confrontation, and that was the moment that people were first exposed to Antifa,\" Vysotsky said. \"So they remember it that way.\"\n\nCharlottesville was followed by street clashes in Berkeley , California, Portland , Oregon, and other cities. Trump and his allies focused on the boogeyman of Antifa.\n\nThe image of Antifa as radical anarchists bent on political violence became a rallying cry for the far-right. The Proud Boys and the armed, unauthorized militia the Oath Keepers , extremist groups linked to white supremacists, had a tangible target for their hatred: the black-clad protesters who met them at every turn.\n\nIn the widespread protests after the murder of George Floyd and the killing of Breonna Taylor in 2020, demonstrators adopted tactics that had been used by anti-fascist activists for decades.\n\nBy dressing all in black and using \"black bloc\" formations in which protesters cover their faces and are hostile to anybody taking their photograph, they looked just like the anti-fascists who had been showing up for years. Much of the news media identified them as such, simply attaching the \"Antifa\" label wherever young people showed up wearing black clothes, Bray said.\n\n\"I was saying on repeat during 2020, when President Trump was blaming all of the property destruction during the George Floyd protests on Antifa, that there are not as many groups in this country, nor is their membership nearly numerous enough to have been responsible for all of that,\" he said. \"Antifa is a fraction of the radical left - a small fraction.\"\n\nEven before the Capitol riot Jan. 6 and the hundreds of federal investigations , arrests and indictments that resulted, the far-right in the USA was waning.\n\nIn spring 2018, Spencer told his followers that Antifa was \"winning\" the culture wars. By 2020, far-right rallies were met with such a massive show of force by counterprotesters that they required heavy police protection.\n\nThen came the insurrection Jan. 6 by extremist Trump supporters, the fallout from which may have taken more wind out of the far-right movement. Rallies in 2021 have been embarrassing spectacles for their organizers, and Antifa activists haven't taken the bait, leaving them to fizzle on their own.\n\nAnti-fascists got back to their day jobs, including researching and outing racists and members of hate groups. Instead of street confrontations, anti-fascists post links on social media exposing neo-Nazis and other white supremacists.\n\nThe absence of widespread Antifa activity in public this year has largely been in response to the chastening of the far-right. The far-right haven't held big rallies, so the anti-fascists haven't seen the need to respond.\n\nFar from the radical claims by cable news anchors and far-right pundits, the Antifa movement has not sought a communist takeover of the country. Nor have anti-fascists engaged in widespread civil disobedience or conducted mass shootings or invaded the U.S. Capitol. Antifa spent 2021 doing the work it has always done.\n\n\"That's the thing about anti-fascism,\" Knutson said. \"If there isn't a visible fascist movement, people find other things to do.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Antifa groups stepped away from street protests, not activism in 2021"

I'm willing to do anything. I want to see peace.\"\n\nBiden and Wallace pressed the president to specifically condemn white supremacists and the far-right group the Proud Boys to which Trump said, \"Proud Boys stand back and stand by, but I'll tell you what, somebody's gotta do something about Antifa and the Left because this is not a right-wing problem.\"\n\nThe former vice president countered in saying that Trump's \"own FBI director said the threat comes from white supremacists - Antifa is an idea, not an organization, not militias, that's what his FBI director said.\"\n\nThe Bureau's director Chris Wray told lawmakers earlier this month that Antifa is an ideology or a movement, not an organization, but said that activists were a serious concern and that Antifa is a \"real thing.\"\n\nWray said the FBI had undertaken \"any number of properly predicated investigations into what we would describe as violent anarchist extremists,\" which included individuals who identity with Antifa.\n\nTrump, who has said he would designate Antifa as a terror group, said the FBI director's assessment is wrong and added, \"when a bat hits you over the head that's not an idea. Antifa is bad.\"\n\n\"Antifa is a dangerous radical group and you ought to be careful with them, they'll overthrow you,\" Trump concluded.\n\nBlack-bloc anarchists, many of whom identify as \"anti-fascists,\" rioted in a number of major American cities this summer, vandalizing businesses and homes, setting fires, and clashing with law enforcement.

      "text": "Antifa on trial: How one criminal case could redefine the murky left-wing movement\n\nManage your account\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2021, three days after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, a mob of white supremacists , Proud Boys and other supporters of President Donald Trump descended on the neighborhood of Pacific Beach in San Diego.\n\nWearing body armor and carrying wooden sticks and flagpoles, the group marched through town holding up Nazi salutes, snarling at locals in the beachfront bars, and shouting the same chant that had been used on the streets of the capital days before: \"F--- Antifa!\"\n\nWaiting to meet the mob was a horde of black-clad self-proclaimed anti-fascists or Antifa , who had organized to \"protect\" Pacific Beach from these outside provocateurs. As the two groups clashed, despite the efforts of dozens of police officers, brawls broke out. Supporters on both sides plus bystanders of all stripes had their phones up, ready to record the action on video.\n\nAnti-fascists, dressed head-to-toe in black, pepper sprayed Trump supporters in the face, gleefully shouting \"Proud Boy killa!\" Another group of counterprotesters confronted and attacked a Trump supporter who then drew a knife on them. In an alleyway, away from the main crowd, a group of assorted right-wing extremists surrounded a young man in a George Floyd T-shirt, sucker-punching him and smashing his nose.\n\nIn the months that followed, video was reviewed, warrants were issued and homes were searched. And almost a year later, a criminal case emerged, one that now stands to have an impact far beyond San Diego. Experts say it could be a landmark prosecution that changes how American law enforcement tackles the much-misunderstood movement known as Antifa.\n\nSan Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan announced a raft of felony charges for the activities on Jan. 9, after an investigation of \"multiple allegations of violent criminal conduct,\" \"video evidence analysis\" and searches and arrests across two counties.\n\nAnd every person charged was from the Antifa side. No Trump supporter had been charged, or even arrested.\n\nSince then, prosecutors have added charges against more people identified by prosecutors as Antifa, for a total of 11 defendants.\n\nStephan's office claims the Antifa side was \"overwhelmingly\" responsible for the violence. But experts familiar with the case say it was an extraordinary decision to not charge anyone in the far-right group that actually targeted the community, especially given the videos that exist showing them engaging in violence. The question is less about whether the Antifa charges are warranted and more about whether this is a case of selective prosecution, they said.\n\nOnly prosecuting one side of a melee raises serious questions about Stephan's political motives, said Patrick Cotter, a former Chicago federal prosecutor who has practiced criminal law for 40 years.\n\n\"When you've got a situation where there's two organized groups who both decided to fight each other, and only one side gets charged and the other side gets to walk, it's idiotic,\" Cotter said. \"It's an insult to the public's intelligence to suggest that that's a legitimate prosecution. It's not. It's selective prosecution.\"\n\nA USA TODAY investigation revealed the victims in the DA's case include people identified by activists as white supremacist agitators notorious for spurring fights in neighborhoods where they're not welcome. At least one has a criminal record and has long been involved with neo-Nazi groups.\n\nThe victims also include other Trump supporters, some of whom remain unidentified by the district attorney. Local anti-fascist activists say they have identified several other white supremacists who were present at the rally.\n\nBut the first-of-its kind Antifa prosecution could also have implications far beyond the parties to the case.\n\nInfluential far-right commentators and conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson and conservative politicians all the way up to former President Donald Trump have long claimed Antifa is not just a disparate social movement but an organized, shadowy army hell-bent on destroying America.\n\nThat's a caricature of Antifa that Stephan herself has previously embraced. She sparked controversy during her election campaign in 2018 when she paid for a website strewn with images of black-clad protesters that shared far-right antisemitic extremist conspiracy theories about billionaire philanthropist George Soros.\n\nIf the case against the San Diego 11 succeeds, it could open the doors to conservative prosecutors around the country to target a progressive social movement that has been ill-defined and misunderstood for years, experts said.\n\n\"It could be used as ammunition by people who are opposed to Antifa, or what they think of as Antifa,\" said Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. \"And it might also inspire other conservative prosecutors in different places to try similar prosecutions, thinking 'We might be able to replicate that success.'\"\n\nMore: Extremist Boogaloo Bois back on Facebook since Mar-a-Lago raid as anger toward feds mounts\n\nWhen San Diego Deputy District Attorney William Hopkins set the scene for the 19 grand jurors gathered to hear the Antifa case in a downtown San Diego court building in May, he described the planned Pacific Beach event as \"A conservative demonstration. A flag waving. A patriot march,\" according to court records.\n\nBut Mike Brown, who has lived in the Pacific Beach area for 30 years, said he didn't see much patriotism on display on Jan. 9, 2021.\n\nA history teacher and surfer, Brown said he was riding his bike in Pacific Beach when he was shocked to see the crowds of far-right and far-left protesters in the largely peaceful neighborhood. The pro-Trump group were not your average political crowd, Brown said.\n\n\"These guys weren't just Trump supporters, a lot of them were Proud Boys - you know, wearing the black and the yellow,\" Brown said. Those outfits can be seen in some of the videos. \"I don't know where they were from, but what pissed me off about it all was that they came into our community and disrupted business, took over the streets, created a lot of tension for a whole afternoon and it wasn't even a local grassroots movement.\"\n\nWhat Pacific Beach witnessed that day was a typical incursion into a mostly liberal neighborhood by far-right agitators who wanted to cause trouble, said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.\n\nFar-right extremists have long used the same tactics, Levin said: Arranging a hostile display of force in a neighborhood that they know is likely to oppose them, then stirring up violence from anyone who confronts them.\n\n\"The history of these paramilitary groups on the far-right is really about two things: making a presence and inciting some kind of retaliation, and then using that as an excuse to significantly escalate violence,\" Levin said.\n\nSan Diego Police Department logs from the day describe the same chaos seen in the videos. The logs describe people in \"Antifa gear\" chasing and fighting with others wearing \"Trump gear.\" At 4:31 p.m. the police log reads, \"Protest being hijacked by Proud Boys. Very anti-police and refusing to comply.\"\n\nThe indictment against the Antifa defendants lists 11 incidents in which prosecutors allege they committed crimes ranging from illegal use of pepper spray to punching, kicking and striking their opponents with a baseball bat.\n\nAntifa activists, holding a banner reading \"Antifascist Action\" and chanting \"racists go home\" can also be seen in videos on YouTube attacking people marching on the pro-Trump side. In numerous altercations, black-clad counterprotesters chase people down the street, hit them with flagpoles and skateboards and spray pepper spray in their faces. Antifa activists also faced off against San Diego Police officers, who used less-than-lethal force against them.\n\nBut apparent assaults committed by the other side were also caught on camera.\n\nBrown said he witnessed the attack by far-right extremists on the man and his female companion in an alley. He said a group had broken off from the main protest and assaulted the man, who was wearing a shirt with George Floyd's image on it and the slogan \"No Justice, No Peace,\" on the back. The attack was unprovoked, Brown said.\n\n\"One guy comes up and just totally sucker punches him and takes him to the ground and then they move on,\" he said.\n\nBrown's account is backed up by a video taken by Amie Zamudio, a local homeless activist, who can be heard pleading with the aggressors to leave their victims alone. Zamudio told USA TODAY she was concerned the man might be homeless because he was walking barefoot, and when she approached him, she saw the pro-Trump aggressors attack him without any provocation.\n\nBrown and Zamudio both said they have never been contacted or interviewed by the District Attorney's office or investigators with the San Diego Police Department. The man seen in that attack has not been publicly identified, and it's unclear if anyone has filed a police report about the incident.\n\nIn another incident, a group of black-clad activists chase three men down the street. One of the men turns and advances before them holding a knife in his right hand.\n\nAnd another video shows one of the Trump supporters picking up a smoke canister and throwing it towards the anti-fascists as at least a dozen San Diego police officers look on.\n\nLevin and others familiar with the case said given the wide array of violence from both groups,  it's hard to understand why only one side of the altercation is facing charges.\n\n\"I am not excusing, in any way, possible criminal conduct on the left,\" he said. \"But when we look at the array of antagonists that showed up, and their record of criminality and violence, it causes a particular question in the public's mind: What kind of fair-handed investigation was done by authorities and what evidence was reviewed?\"\n\nCotter, the former federal prosecutor, said there's a simple answer to those questions: politics.\n\n\"This is about votes,\" he said. \"It's about politics. It's about some prosecutor trying to burnish their brand, looking at voters, and saying 'Who can I prosecute that will give me the most votes?' and, \"If I prosecuted these other guys, would that give me votes or cost me votes?\"\n\nThe San Diego District Attorney's Office did not agree to an interview with USA TODAY, but provided a statement including:\n\n\"When evidence and facts support criminal charges, we will file them, as we did in July 2020 with a white supremacy group that attacked Black Lives Matter peaceful protesters and when we charged a white supremacist with murder and a hate crimes allegation for killing an innocent Jewish woman at the Chabad of Poway synagogue in April 2019. We obtained convictions in both cases.\"\n\nMore: FBI agents monitor social media. But who are they watching?\n\nIn an unusual legal twist, the prosecutors of the San Diego case asked the superior court judge overseeing it to grant a protective order forbidding the defense attorneys from copying or sharing any documents that identify the alleged victims of the attacks by Antifa with anyone outside the legal team.\n\nThat means even if they're asked, the defense attorneys can't provide documents identifying who the alleged victims are, even to their clients.\n\nThe move, usually reserved for cases involving organized crime like the mafia or gang cases, is designed to protect witnesses and victims from being further targeted by their aggressors. In this case, the prosecutors argued, the victim's names needed to be kept secret because they might be targeted by Antifa's network of online sleuths, who might \"doxx\" them - a slang term for publishing personal information about someone on the internet, for the purpose of intimidating or encouraging others to target them.\n\nThe timing of the protective order was unusual, too.\n\nThe names of several of the victims have already been shared by Antifa-affiliated social media accounts multiple times. Indeed, in making their case to the judge that the names should be kept secret, prosecutors presented a screenshot of a local anti-fascist Twitter account sharing the names of several people USA TODAY confirmed are among the victims attacked by Antifa. That screenshot remains in publicly available court records.\n\nA USA TODAY investigation found that people named in that tweet have histories of associating with white supremacist organizations and local racist groups in the San Diego area. They include two people  from San Diego who have been identified by activists marching in several pro-Trump rallies wearing shirts emblazoned with the logo of American Guard, which the ADL describes as \"Hard core white supremacists\" and which grew out of two other racist organizations.\n\nAlmost all of the victims referred to in court documents only by their initials have long been well-known to local anti-fascists. Indeed, that's why they were targeted with violence in the first place, three local anti-fascist sources told USA TODAY.\n\nUSA TODAY confirmed the names publicly announced by the Antifa Twitter account @SDAgainstFash with one of the defense attorneys on the case.\n\nPerhaps more than any other extremist group in America, Antifa has been hard for academics and experts to pin down.\n\nUnlike the Ku Klux Klan, which has a defined leadership structure, or the Proud Boys, which has a clear membership process, Antifa typically eschews any sort of organizational architecture. There's no central leadership, no set membership process, and no real prerequisites for being an anti-fascist other than simply acting like one.\n\nPlus, anti-fascist activists constantly engage in a semantic dance, employing the rejoinder \"If you're not anti-fascist, then you're a fascist,\" defying easy answers about whether anyone is a member of the movement.\n\nThis vagueness has led to a concerted effort by far-right-wing commentators, conspiracy theorists and pundits to discredit Antifa whenever possible. In the absence of a clear definition of the group, Antifa is often portrayed, even on mainstream channels like Fox News, as a highly organized, malevolent force with massive numbers and a clearly defined goal: To sow chaos and disorder on America's streets.\n\nAnti-fascists certainly do communicate with each other, said Mark Bray, a lecturer in history at Rutgers University and author of \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.\" Anti-fascists in certain regions occasionally hold meetings, but the movement is still far from the regulated force that has been depicted.\n\n\"As it's become something more well known, it's become a real thing, but it's also become a boogeyman,\" Bray said. \"A very common phrase in right-wing circles is 'BLM-slash-Antifa, which is, I think, essentially, their way of saying violent black leftists and violent white leftists.\"\n\nStephan's 2018 campaign website appeared to endorse this perception of Antifa. The website, which disappeared after negative media attention, claimed that left-wing philanthropist George Soros funded \"anti-law enforcement candidates over experienced prosecutors, trying to tip the balance to the criminals.\"\n\nIn 2020, Stephan again made headlines after her office charged Black Lives Matter activist Denzel Draughn with eight felonies after Draughn pepper-sprayed SDPD officers he said were attacking a fellow protester. Draughn was acquitted of all the charges at trial.\n\nDawn Perlmutter, the main expert witness who will testify about Antifa for prosecutors, also has a history of writing for right-wing websites. Perlmutter is an academic who teaches police departments about symbology and extremist movements, but she is also an adjunct professor of osteopathic medicine.\n\nIn one article, she described the Black Lives Matter racial justice movement as an \"anti-police hate fest.\" She decried pro-BLM protestors as \"self-loathing affluent white middle-aged women attempting to show how woke they are.\" Perlmutter acknowledged to USA TODAY that she wrote the stories.\n\nThe San Diego prosecution aims to prove that the black-clad people who committed violence on Jan. 9, 2021, in Pacific Beach weren't just fired up by a common philosophy or hatred of Trump, or animosity towards authority. By charging the defendants with conspiracy, the prosecutors want to make the case that they acted more like a gang, with a unified goal, common symbols and shared tactics.\n\nFrom a strictly legal perspective, that could have a significant impact on the defendants who are charged with conspiracy, because the charge could effectively double their sentences for other crimes.\n\nBut cases like this aren't just about the individual outcomes for the San Diego 11, said Cotter, the former federal prosecutor. In a country supercharged by political division, animosity and violence, prosecutions like this are often as much about sending a message out into the world as they are about bringing justice to people who may well have committed crimes, he said.\n\n\"If a prosecutor anywhere is successful prosecuting any kind of unusual new kind of case, other prosecutors pay attention,\" Cotter said.\n\nHe compared the Antifa case to the widespread prosecution of American labor organizers in the early 20th Century. Until unionization was protected by Congress, the movement was a soft target for conservative lawmakers obsessed with targeting progressive causes, Cotter said.\n\n\"Prosecutors are politicians looking for ways to build their brand,\" he said. \"If it's politically to their advantage to be seen prosecuting these kinds of cases, whether it's Antifa or Hells Angels, or Mexican drug cartels, then other prosecutors pay attention and say, OK, well maybe there's a blueprint there.\"\n\nOne of the San Diego 11 remains in custody. He and the other 10 defendants face a trial that has been continually delayed but will likely start in the spring.\n\nThe trial will be closely watched not just by anti-fascists across the country, but also by conservative pundits, politicians and prosecutors who will finally see whether their perception of Antifa as America's dark, mysterious underbelly really stands up in court.\n\nFor subscribers: FBI agents monitor social media.

      "text": "What Is Antifa? Anti-Fascist Protesters Draw Attention After Charlottesville\n\nManage your account\n\nThe violent clash on the streets of Charlottesville, Va., that left one woman dead drew attention to white nationalist groups that organized to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. But it also cast a spotlight on groups of counter-protesters who came out to oppose the rally.\n\nWhile many of those who opposed the white nationalists were affiliated with mainstream organizations or there on their own behalf, a small number belonged to the so-called \"antifa\" movement that opposes extreme conservative ideologies.\n\nPresident Trump's much-criticized initial statement that \"hatred, bigotry and violence\" in Charlottesville came from \"many sides\" may have been an allusion to their presence.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the movement.\n\nWhat does \"antifa\" mean?\n\nAntifa is short for anti-fascist. So what is a fascist? A textbook definition would be someone who is aggressively supportive of their nation and who may believe one race is superior to others. In the past, fascist regimes have been led by dictators with \" complete power \" that forced conformity to a particular viewpoint. Though the word comes from a political movement that began in Italy following the First World War, the word fascist has been used more broadly since then to describe intolerant and oppressive behavior. Anti-fascists have been around about as long as fascists have.\n\nWhat do antifa groups oppose these days?\n\nThere's not one set answer. Anti-fascist groups have long protested globalization in Europe. These days in the U.S., antifa protestors are often bound by an opposition to capitalism. Some may also describe themselves as anarchists, people who question authority on principle.\n\nHere is how one self-described antifa activist explained the label to TIME : \"The standard for antifa ideology is anti-capitalism, anti-fascism of course. Those are kind of the two main pillars, but within that, encompassed, it also comes with being anti-racism, anti-sexism, anti-ableism, anti-transphobia, anything like that and just protecting people who are marginalized and oppressed.\" Another said that antifa activists are simply \"going against this idea that a certain group of elite get to have control over everybody else.\"\n\nBeing against oppression doesn't seem extreme. Why are these groups controversial?\n\nIn the name of fighting for those ideals - and putting a stop to \"hate speech\"-some antifa protestors will employ militant tactics or violent means such as vandalism. That happened at President Trump's inauguration, where protesters busted out limousine windows. Later in the spring, antifa protesters in Berkeley, Calif., opposed a speech by right wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos by breaking windows and starting fires, causing more than $100,000 of property damage. Some antifascist activists say that the media has sensationalized them by focusing such instances. And they point out that they have been targets of violence themselves.\n\nIs there an official antifa group?\n\nNo, there's no antifa headquarters. And a person could describe themselves as antifa without being a member of any particular group. The antifa movement is a loose and informal one. But the label is becoming more visible, showing up in graffiti on college campuses and forums for grassroots organizers online. Some groups that identify as anti-fascist say they've seen upticks in interest since the alt-right has gained momentum following the election because people feel that \"you have to pick a side,\" as the national chair of a group called By Any Means Necessary put it .\n\nWhat's with the black clothing?\n\nGroups that identify as antifa may use a technique known as black bloc, which involves wearing black clothing and items like bandanas that shield one's face-outfits that help people stay anonymous in a crowd. There can be philosophical reasons behind this, like a belief that hierarchies are bad and that remaining anonymous helps keep one's ego in check. There are also practical reasons, like hiding one's identity from protestors on the other side (who might dox people they disagree with) or from police and cameras.\n\nWhy are people talking about antifa and free speech?\n\nGroups on the right have used events like the protest in Berkeley to paint antifa protestors as being out of control and acting as enemies of free speech, because they have mobilized in order to \"shut down\" speech that they disagree with. Politicians on the right and left have both criticized such tactics. In turn, antifa activists have argued that certain types of speech are themselves violent or bound to cause violence if they are uttered in the public sphere. They have also said that alt-right groups are using the words \"free speech\" as cover for spreading racist and bigoted ideologies.\n\nTrump condemned such notions on Monday, after days of pressure to speak out more forcefully following the death in Charlottesville. \"Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs,\" Trump said, \"including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups.\""

      "text": "Two defendants guilty of conspiracy in groundbreaking Antifa trial in San Diego\n\nManage your account\n\nA San Diego jury on Friday found two anti-fascists guilty of conspiracy to riot, in a case that became a bellwether for legal action against the political movement.\n\nThe two defendants had faced a raft of various charges related to rioting and assault during a protest in a beach neighborhood in the aftermath of the tumultuous 2020 election. In that protest, on Jan. 9, 2021, members of the Proud Boys and other supporters of then-President Donald Trump had rallied and clashed with anti-fascists .\n\nBut only the anti-fascists had faced charges. Prosecutors set out to convince a jury that the assailants were not simply individual participants, but that they had conspired under the banner of Antifa, essentially acting as a criminal gang.\n\nBrian Lightfoot and Jeremy White were both found guilty of conspiracy to riot at the protest.\n\nBut the decision was split, as many other charges did not lead to conviction. The jury, which deliberated for more than a week, failed to reach a verdict on most of the most serious assault charges against Lightfoot, found him not guilty of one assault, and found White innocent of the one assault he was accused of committing.\n\nFor the individual defendants, the verdicts represented a lighter possible sentence for Lightfoot, but possible prison time for White, who said he was \"heartbroken.\"\n\nAnd attorneys for both defendants said the verdicts represent a huge blow to the anti-fascist movement and to protesters in general, at a time when a new wave of protests has sprung up on college campuses across the country in opposition to the war in Gaza.\n\n\"I think the door is wide open to now hold lawful protesters in violation of conspiracy law,\" said Curtis Briggs, who represented White.\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2021, a group of assorted Trump supporters, Proud Boys and members of the extreme right in San Diego, including people with a history of violence at local protests, marched around Pacific Beach shouting slogans and calling on anti-fascists to fight with them.\n\nSome of the protesters were met by a cadre of several dozen anti-fascists, many dressed head-to-toe in black. Over the afternoon, the anti-fascists approached and violently confronted the protesters, spraying some with pepper spray and assaulting others. In other incidents, the protesters attacked leftists and onlookers.\n\nA year later, the San Diego district attorney announced charges against 11 individuals - all of them antifascists.\n\nThe case drew extra attention for its overt focus on Antifa, which is generally understood as a leaderless ideology, rather than an organization. Far-right commentators and conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson and conservative politicians, all the way up to Trump, have long claimed Antifa is not just a social movement but an organized, shadowy army .\n\nAll of the original defendants were charged with conspiracy to riot, and prosecutors portrayed them as an organized, malicious force that came to San Diego to pick a fight with supporters of former President Donald Trump, just three days after the Capitol insurrection.\n\nThe defense questioned the motivation of Stephan's office and filed a motion seeking to have her dismissed from the case. The top prosecutor, a Republican who left the party to run in the nonpartisan DA election, has a history of supporting conspiracy theories about Antifa.\n\nA former federal prosecutor told USA TODAY the decision to charge only one side of the fracas was \"idiotic.\"\n\n\"It's an insult to the public's intelligence to suggest that that's a legitimate prosecution. It's not. It's selective prosecution,\" said Patrick Cotter, who now works in private practice.\n\nOf the 11 original defendants, nine cut deals with prosecutors that saw some of them agree to multi-year prison sentences. Two, Los Angeles residents Lightfoot and White, decided to argue their cases before a jury. They were represented by civil rights attorneys, who told USA TODAY they took on the cases because of their potential impact on the broader anti-fascist movement.\n\nOf the two defendants, Lightfoot was facing the most charges. He was accused of spraying pepper spray at Trump supporters and of committing assaults likely to commit great bodily injury. During closing arguments of the trial, prosecutors said he came to San Diego ready to commit violence.\n\n\"He wanted to fight,\" said Deputy District Attorney Makenzie Harvey. \"They were here looking to commit violence.\"\n\nOf the 16 counts he faced, Lightfoot was found guilty of six. The jury could not make a decision and \"hung\" on nine of the charges, and found him not guilty of one of the charges of assault.\n\nJohn Hamasaki, Lightfoot's attorney, noted that his client was never offered a plea deal by prosecutors prior to trial. He called Friday's verdict \"a repudiation of the District Attorney's efforts.\"\n\n\"It looked like the jury really did an independent and thorough job looking at the facts and coming to a decision,\" Hamasaki said.\n\n\"I feel pretty good,\" Lightfoot told USA TODAY. \"I was at peace with it.\"\n\nWhite was less upbeat.\n\n\"I was heartbroken - it felt surreal that they could find us guilty of that,\" he told USA TODAY. \"This is a group of prosecutors and cops who have never once prosecuted the violent white supremacists that we were counter-protesting that day.\"\n\nBriggs said the verdict doesn't make sense, since his client was convicted of conspiracy to riot, but acquitted of actually ever committing any crime on the day.\n\n\"It's illogical,\" Briggs said, adding, about White: \"He's devastated. He's a political activist who cares about his community who is now facing jail time.\"\n\nThe San Diego District Attorney's Office sent USA TODAY a statement thanking the jury for their service:\n\n\"This was a complex case with 11 defendants indicted and now all convicted - nine by guilty pleas and two by jury verdict. The DA team worked tirelessly on this case in order to be sure our community remains safe, and that the rule of law is followed.\"\n\nWhite told USA TODAY he is committed to appealing his conviction. He said he is less worried about the impact of the case on his own life, and more concerned about the future of the anti-fascist movement and the broader protest movement.\n\n\"The prosecutors did everything they could to make us look like this criminal gang or terrorist cell,\" he said. \"It has bad implications for protestors out there trying to fight against fascism, against police brutality and state repression.\"\n\nHamasaki agreed.\n\n\"As we're looking at all these protests happening around the country, I think this bodes ill for a lot of people if prosecutors are looking to file felony conspiracy charges against people who are involved in active first amendment behavior,\" Hamasaki said. \"It can have a chilling effect.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Antifa trial in San Diego ends in two landmark guilty verdicts"

      "text": "Violent protests shine spotlight on extremists, from antifa to 'Boogaloo'\n\nManage your account\n\nThe majority of protests over the past week calling for systemic reforms to end police violence after the deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville have been peaceful. But some have turned violent, with looting in some cities and possible instances of police brutality in others.\n\nPresident Trump has blamed antifa, an umbrella term for radical left-wing activist groups that sometimes engage in street brawls, for the violence. However, antifa's ties to the past week's protests are unclear.\n\nWhile elected officials across the country have pointed fingers at outside agitators for the violence, so far there is limited evidence that outside extremist groups have been involved. For example, Minnesota officials initially said that all the Friday night arrests in the Twin Cities were from out of state, a claim they later walked back .\n\n\"Public protests like this are going to attract people of all kinds,\" Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, told Yahoo News.\n\n\"No extremist is going to miss an opportunity to try to leverage a crisis to amplify their views and push their agenda,\" said Segal. But we have no evidence - none - that any extremist movement, or group that embraces extremist tactics, is significantly organizing any of these events.\"\n\nWhile protesters call for reform measures the White House has resisted - including Justice Department oversight of police departments with a history of violence, an agreement known as \"consent decrees,\" and ending the transfer of military equipment to local police - Trump has used his bully pulpit to push for harsher crackdowns, specifically in regard to antifa.\n\n\"A national Oval Office address is not going to stop antifa,\" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Monday morning. \"What's going to stop antifa is action. And this president has committed to acting on this. He has several meetings pertaining to that today. And that's his focus - acting and keeping our streets safe.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Trump announced that he was declaring antifa a terrorist organization, even though it's not an organization in the formal sense and he does not have the ability to designate domestic terrorist groups .\n\nShort for anti-facist, antifa refers to a secretive movement of combative leftists , including many self-described anarchists, who are ready and willing to use violence in order to fight white supremacists, neo-Nazis and others they deem to be \"fascists.\" They attempt to \"deplatform\" anyone they consider homophobic, racist or xenophobic, a process that sometimes involves shutting down controversial speakers or gatherings through the use of force.\n\nAntifa traces its origins to the street fights between European right-wing and left-wing groups in the 1920s and '30s. The American version of the movement is rather new; Rose City Antifa, a group in Portland, Ore., that is one of the most well-known chapters, says it was founded in 2007.\n\nBut, Segal explained, antifa is not an organized group in the traditional sense.\n\n\"It's not like antifa has card-carrying members,\" he said, suggesting that \"in some ways it's more of a concept or movement than group structure.\" Due to the loose, decentralized style of organizing, it's impossible to tell how many people are involved in antifa.\n\nSegal noted similarities between the fluidity of antifa and other modern extremist movements, such as the far-right \"Boogaloo,\" which is also not really a group but rather a \"concept that means so many different things to different people.\"\n\n\"This is the challenge [with] designations of any kind against any sort of ideologically motivated movement,\" he said, referring to Trump's recent pledge to designate antifa as a terrorist organization. \"Less and less, organizational structure is not the glue that keeps movements together. It's the ideology.\"\n\nAs a result, Segal said, antifa activity is \"much more difficult to track, which, by the way, is by design.\"\n\nThere are, of course, certain social media channels run by people who self-identify as antifa, but on the internet as well as in the real world, it's almost impossible to gauge who, exactly, is involved in this loosely defined movement and to what degree. Basically, Segal said, \"you are if you say you are.\"\n\n\"It's quite hard to know the level of on-the-ground engagement because not everybody is going to identify their worldview and their affiliations while they're at a protest,\" he said.\n\n\"I think sometimes people assume that black-clad people are antifa, and that's not necessarily the case. We have anarchists, and we have people who are just angry, period. I will say anarchists are opportunistic and they view unrest in society as an opportunity to destroy the corrupt system, in some cases.\"\n\nSegal noted that \"property destruction\" is \"a classic anarchist tactic,\" and New York City officials have blamed anarchists for the violence there. Antifa generally focuses on those they deem as racist or fascist, taking them on through direct physical confrontation or releasing their personal information in an attempt to cost them their jobs or otherwise shame them.\n\nTrump has used antifa interchangeably with anarchists. While some members of antifa would describe themselves as anarchists, the anarchist movement as a whole rejects governments of any kind and has been responsible for protests and violence for decades. Antifa and anarchist groups do, however, share a similar dress code of black clothing and masks.\n\nVideos circulating on social media suggest that young, white men - the demographic both antifa and \"Boogaloo\" tend to draw from - are responsible for much of the violence over the last week, although their exact affiliations and ideologies are unknown. This confusion allows for the possibility that both far-left and far-right groups could be involved, although there is little hard evidence to substantiate either claim.\n\nNot unlike antifa, the relatively young Boogaloo movement is not a defined group but rather a concept that has been appropriated by a variety of extremist factions who, for different reasons, want to see the destruction of modern society through violent conflict.\n\nThe term Boogaloo, which is derived from an old internet joke referring to the 1984 break dancing-themed movie \"Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo,\" has become code for the impending second civil war.\n\nThe recent protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere have drawn interest from various Boogaloo proponents , from white supremacists and neo-Nazis to more libertarian, antigovernment activists. But J.J. MacNab, a fellow at the George Washington University Program on Extremism, cautioned that \"the Boogaloo movement is not cohesive.\"\n\n\"While there are pockets of white supremacist Boogaloos, the younger and bigger groups are generally not,\" MacNab wrote in a Twitter thread Saturday. Though some Boogaloos strongly support Trump, many others \"hate him,\" as well as the police.\n\n\"While there are Boogaloos that want to discredit protests angry at the murder of a black man, there are younger Boogaloos that are incensed by the murder and want to join the protests,\" wrote MacNab.\n\nWhile the stated goals of different Boogaloo factions may vary, they share a desire to bring about violent conflict, including armed clashes with law enforcement, that will ultimately lead to a civil war.\n\nMuch of the conversation about the protests in the context of the Boogaloos has taken place online, in Facebook groups and on other social media platforms, but some armed demonstrators across the country have been spotted wearing Hawaiian shirts, which has become a symbol for the movement.\n\nSegal said he's been a bit wary about focusing too much on the extremist elements who may be opportunistically drawn to these protests, for fear of distracting from the majority of those who've taken to the streets in legitimate protest against police brutality and structural racism.\n\nHowever, he admitted that \"with the amount of violence that we've seen night after night, I am concerned that the longer this lasts, the more extremists will actually be the more relevant narrative.\n\n\"At some point these protests may completely devolve into political violence. I hope that does not happen. But as someone who is monitoring extremism, that's my big concern. That these protests morph into something more nefarious than initially, originally intended.\"\n\n_____\n\nCOVID-19 and food security: Yahoo News hosts virtual town hall with Joe Biden and chef José Andrés\n\nCoronavirus puts the future of college - and colleges - in limbo\n\nFlight attendants see a very different future for airplane travel in the age of coronavirus\n\nCan 'social bubbles' offer relief from lockdown loneliness?"

They didn't exist.

They take that very seriously, when a lot of this stuff... is coming from the militias... This isn't just a police thing, or a training thing. It's like, how are law enforcement so targeted algorithmically by this stuff? Or how are they falling down these rabbit holes?\"\n\nCollins pointed out that \"one of the biggest vectors last year of these, 'Antifa is coming to your house personally to, you know, take your grandma's medicine' stuff was police Facebook pages, who have like blue checks next to the name on Facebook, who are trusted by the community...

Also likely to turn out: antifa groups, whose appearance at neo-Nazi and white nationalist rallies has led to heated and sometimes nasty confrontations.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Sept. 22, 2017, 10:15 a.m. ET | Los Angeles\n\nConcerns about possible violence are surfacing again in the Bay Area as the University of California, Berkeley, gears up for \"Free Speech Week.\" The four-day event, hosted by a conservative student group, features controversial personalities from the so-called \"alt right\" - a coalition of groups that espouse white nationalism, anti-Semitism, and populism.\n\nThe occasion follows counterprotests in Berkeley and other cities such as Portland that have given critics fodder to accuse leftist activists of stirring up violence in otherwise peaceful public gatherings. At the heart of the allegations is antifa, whose appearance at neo-Nazi and white nationalist rallies has led to heated, and sometimes nasty, confrontations.\n\nQ: What is antifa?\n\nAntifa (pronounced either AN-tifa or an-TEE-fa), is short for anti-fascist or anti-fascist action. It refers to a loose collection of far-left-leaning and anti-racist groups, networks, and individuals. The majority are anarchists, but affiliates range from far-left factions, including socialists and communists, to citizens spurred to action by the election of President Trump and upset by what they perceive as state support for white nationalism. Uniting them is a \"desire to directly and even physically confront white supremacists in the public square,\" says Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow at the nonprofit Anti-Defamation League (ADL).\n\nThey also associate with opposition to homophobia, sexism, and the kind of capitalism that gave rise to the Occupy movement, among other progressive ideologies.\n\nQ: Where do they come from?\n\nAntifa strategies draw from the clashes between militant leftists and fascists in the streets of Germany, Italy, and Spain in the 1920s and '30s, writes Peter Beinart for The Atlantic . \"Their conviction is that the Nazis never would've taken power in Germany, and similar movements wouldn't have taken power elsewhere, if people hadn't ceded the public square to them,\" Mr. Pitcavage says.\n\nThe idea saw a resurgence in the 1970s and '80s, when skinheads and neo-Nazis began to penetrate the punk scene in both Europe and the United States. German anti-fascists in the 1980s gave the term its modern connotation, while the Anti-Racist Action Network - a similarly deregulated association that was influenced by anarchist principles - became, in the '80s, '90s, and early 2000s, the core of antifa in the US, said Mark Bray, author of \"Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook,\" in an interview with the book's publisher, Melville House.\n\n\"It wasn't really until West Coast antifa shut down [alt-right commentator] Milo Yiannopoulos at UC Berkeley, however, that the term gained the mainstream attention that it has now,\" he noted.\n\nQ: How do they operate?\n\nAntifa groups have no formal structure or national leadership. Instead they rely on local organizations like By Any Means Necessary, which originated in Detroit, and Rose City Antifa, in Portland, Ore., to engage people in direct action: anything from pressuring venues to cancel events held by white nationalist groups to tracking and exposing racists and neo-Nazis both on- and offline.\n\nBut the disruptive presence of antifa at these groups' public gatherings has drawn the most attention - and criticism. Anarchists, who make up the bulk of antifa affiliates, tend to see the state and its structures as vehicles for oppression. To them, it's more the streets and less Congress or the courts that serve as a crucial battleground against racist and fascist forces. That kind of thinking, analysts say, can - and sometimes does - lead to physical conflict.\n\nQ: Does this mean the left is becoming more violent?\n\nNot so fast. Many experts warn against conflating \"the left\" with antifa groups. While the antifa catalog of opposition is broad enough to resonate with progressives who don't condone violence, even as self-defense, antifa groups make up only a small sliver of progressives and liberals, says Jody Armour, a University of Southern California professor who specializes in race, social justice, and the law.\n\nEven if the focus were narrowed to antifa and the far left, the claim of growing violence still lacks weight, adds Pitcavage at ADL. If anything, he says, violence from the militant left is down from the 20-year period between 1965 and 1985, when groups like the Earth Liberation Front and the Symbionese Liberation Army engaged in brutal attacks and bank robberies. From 2007 to 2016, 372 people were killed by domestic extremists of all stripes, according to ADL data. Of those, only 2 percent were victims of leftist extremists, compared with 74 percent at the hands of right-wing extremists. \"Zero were killed by the antifa specifically,\" Pitcavage says.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nNone of this is meant to condone or excuse assault or other forms of violence that antifa groups employ, he and others say. And it is crucial that America remain a place where people of opposing - and even abhorrent - beliefs are able to express them without fear of violence or censorship, Professor Armour says . Which is why the idea of rationalizing violence as a necessary defense against hate can be problematic, he says. \"If you start saying that, then self-defense can be used to justify anything.\"\n\nBut others note it's also important to distinguish between those who would revive Nazism or call for the return of a predominantly white America, and groups opposing them - even if the tactics the latter employ are questionable. White nationalists' \"vision of democracy is Jim Crow Alabama,\" says Cathy Schneider, who teaches urban politics and comparative social movements at American University in Washington. \"But I think that [antifa is] not thinking carefully enough about the long-term solution. You're not going to win a battle in the streets.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in\n\nMonitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

But by using barriers and bridge closures - and allowing a large contingent of right-wingers to leave when they asked to - authorities were able to mostly keep the two sides apart. Six minor injuries were reported.\n\nJoe Biggs, the organizer of the right-wing gathering that featured the Proud Boys, Patriot Prayer and other far-right groups, said they accomplished their goal of drawing attention to black-clad anti-fascist protesters - known as antifa -who showed up to meet them.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted early Saturday that \"major consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an 'ORGANIZATION of TERROR.'\" It wasn't immediately clear what he meant by that because there's no mechanism for the United States government to declare a domestic organization a terror group.\n\nBiggs told The Oregonian/OregonLive he was pleased the rally attracted Trump's attention. \"He talked about Portland, said he's watching antifa. That's all we wanted,\" he said.\n\nBiggs said he and the right-wing groups would keep coming back to Portland so long as antifa was around.\n\nBut Eric K. Ward, executive director of the Portland-based Western States Center, said the right-wing rally was a bust. \"Portland won today, and far-right leaders like Joey Gibson and Joe Biggs lost,\" Ward said in a statement. The Western States Center stated mission is to increase inclusive democracy.\n\nIn an interview, Ward said Biggs' groups cut short a planned five-hour rally after only one hour and left. \"The white nationalist, alt-right coalition that came to Portland were denied what they sought to create, which was large-scale civil disturbances,\" Ward said.\n\nWhile antifa protesters get a lot of attention, Ward said there were many others who came out to oppose the right-wing groups. He also praised police and city officials for their actions. \"What I saw yesterday was the first step in Portland really putting together a citywide response,\" he said.\n\nWheeler, Portland's mayor, said at a Saturday evening news conference that Biggs and anyone espousing hate or violence was not welcome. \"We do not want him here in my city. Period,\" Wheeler said.\n\nWheeler tied the demonstrations to \"a rising white nationalist movement\" and a growing sense of fear in the country. \"Portland being a very progressive community is always going to be at or near ground zero of this battle.\"\n\nWheeler emphasized that there are hundreds of protests every year in Portland, and most don't get any attention.\n\nThe latest rally began late Saturday morning. Flag-waving members of the Proud Boys, Three Percenters militia group and others gathered downtown, some wearing body armor and helmets like the antifa protesters.\n\nMore than two dozen local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, were in the city for the right-wing rally. As of early afternoon, most of the right-wing groups had left the area. But hundreds of people remained downtown and on nearby streets, and there were tense skirmishes, mostly with antifa protesters who were trying to find right-wing rallyers, throughout the day.\n\nPatriot Prayer's Gibson, who organized similar rallies in 2017 and 2018 that erupted in clashes, surrendered Friday on an arrest warrant for felony rioting. He was at a confrontation that broke out on May 1 outside a bar where antifa members had gathered after a May Day demonstration.\n\nIn a video he livestreamed on Facebook, Gibson accused the police of playing politics by arresting him but not the masked demonstrators who beat up conservative blogger Andy Ngo at a June 29 rally that drew national attention. A video of that attack went viral and led the Proud Boys, who have been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, to organize Saturday's event.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The Grannies, who use humor to defuse tense situations, are among those trying to calm the streets.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Aug. 24, 2017, 1:34 p.m. ET | Portland, Ore.\n\nAmid the hubbub of Portland's waterfront \"Saturday Market,\" song suddenly erupts from what looks like a Mayberry sewing circle, their raised fists punctuating the chorus: \"It is a time to care, not to kill....\"\n\nThe singers' dresses and hats are mismatched, their song a tad out of tune, but they are, Portlanders say, ever so endearing: Twenty-odd older ladies in hats, outsized glasses, and gingham dresses, belting out protest lyrics set to standards - and sometimes set to dance. One has little cherries hanging off her hat, while others don faded \"ERA\" pins.\n\nOne of the most beloved social activist groups in this Pacific Northwest city, they are the Raging Grannies. \"Grannying is the least understood and most powerful weapon we have,\" writes Granny Rose de Shaw on the national blog. And in a time when peaceful protest is increasingly giving way to fistfights, clubs, and chemical spray, their humorous message may be more important than ever.\n\nThe Grannies offer a kind of satirical street theater that challenges authority while charming the public - but lately, they're having to act as referee between two opposing political extremes, whose violent tactics led Politico to dub Portland \"the most politically violent city in America.\"\n\nAs cities such as Berkeley, Calif., and Seattle have become epicenters of rolling street fights fueled by intense partisanship, the model of peaceful protest that has held since the civil rights era is being challenged - not just by the emboldened neo-Nazis and white supremacists who roiled Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend, but also left-wing anarchists. Here in Portland, both sides' tactics of physical confrontation have begun to scrape away at the city's peaceful image.\n\n\"We're struggling with our role,\" admits Granny Linda Schmoldt, a retired librarian. \"The difference for us now is we're having to say, amid all this punching and rolling in the streets, 'You have to stop right now and go to your corners. Be nice to each other.'\"\n\nIn a new tactic, experts say, the white nationalist movement is targeting progressive cities, calling leftist activists out on their own turf. And for its part, the antifa (short for anti-fascists) movement has embraced violence as a tactic against what it sees as creeping fascism on American streets. The ensuing clashes have rattled residents. In late May, a participant in an alt-right rally stabbed to death two Good Samaritans, and wounded a third, who were coming to the aid of two minority women on the city's light rail train. The deaths sparked shock and mourning, and then a wave of counter-protests that often have devolved into violence.\n\nThe situation has put Portland at the epicenter of what some call a soft civil war of fists and sticks \"for control of America's streets,\" as National Review essayist David French writes.\n\nAccording to University of Michigan political scientist Michael Heaney, only about 3 percent of protest attendees, who tend to be more politically active, say violence is \"very\" necessary to make a point. (Only 1 percent of the general population makes that claim.)\n\nNotably, he says, that number has not shifted since President Trump's election, suggesting that Americans are not growing more accepting of political violence in the streets. Indeed, since the 1980s, says Rachel Einwohner, a political scientist at Purdue University, Americans have increasingly come to see nonviolent protests as not only legitimate but necessary for democracy. And so far, most Trump era marches, including the women's march and Mr. Trump's campaign-style rallies, have remained peaceful.\n\nYet the growing frequency of actual street fighting in liberal strongholds like Portland and Berkeley, Calif., says Mr. Heaney, is notable, since the upshot is that America is witnessing a sum total of more political violence, including deadly serious incidents such as the weekend of violence in Charlottesville, Va., that left three dead and several dozen injured, and the targeting of Republican congressmen at a baseball practice this year. The nature of the violence, too, he says, is different.\n\n\"This is really ideological and partisan violence ... [not] violence in response to very concrete issues,\" says Heaney, the co-author, with Fabio Rojas, of \"Party in the Street: The Antiwar Movement and the Democratic Party after 9/11.\" \"People are clashing now because they see the world in a different way ideologically - and they detest the beliefs that the others have about the world. We have two camps in our society that are not communicating civilly any more. This violence ... is one manifestation of that decline in civility.\"\n\nProgressive organizers say they are seeing several shifts in response to the stubborn street battles, as people try to turn the emotional temperature down. The Grannies may be the most colorful - if not the most quirky.\n\nThe blue-vested Portland Peace Team has seen applications skyrocket since the MAX train stabbings. Progressives in Berkeley have utilized a tactic of empathy tents at rallies, offering 10 minutes of nonjudgmental listening to help ease tensions. Organizers in Portland are being trained as \"vibe-watchers\" to look out for brewing trouble.\n\nNative American groups, too, have urged peace to bring antifa and the self-described alt-right back from the brink of battle.\n\nPart of the message is getting through. One antifa group, Rose City Antifa, said they would stay away from a July protest, choosing instead to do a fundraiser.\n\nAt the same time, mainstream organizers are struggling to persuade the antifa flank that violent tactics are counterproductive. Instead, antifa, who often hide their faces to avoid legal repercussions, have accused the Portland Peace Team of trying to unmask them.\n\nFor her part, Granny Denise Busch, she of the cherry hat, says she has been treated warmly by antifa protesters. In turn, she has engaged some of the hooded anarchists with pleas to not fight, some of which, she said, seems to have worked.\n\n\"We become idealized grannies to them, and they don't want to disappoint us,\" she says.\n\nOr, as Portland resident Tom Hastings says, \"It's very, very hard to go making nasty, rotten claims about a granny.\"\n\nLong-time civil rights protesters, like the Grannies, say they are dismayed by the left fringe's embrace of violence. While punching Nazis may be a popular internet meme, they argue, the answer to hatred cannot be more hate, and peace movements shouldn't be in the business of hurting people.\n\n\"Movement leaders sort of agree to what is known as a diversity of tactics, but my question now is: Do you want diversity of tactics or do you want diversity of people?\" says Mr. Hastings, a Portland State University professor and a veteran of Portland's so-called nonviolent army. \"If there's a violent flank in a movement, your recruitment numbers go down, which correlates with a much lower chance of succeeding with your announced goal.\n\n\"Therefore, God bless the Grannies.\"\n\nThe Raging Grannies were founded in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1987. A satirical temperance-style union, they cite \"a history of trouble-raising when not listened to,\" as Ms. de Shaw wrote on the group's web page. \"Even in our times, we grannies have raised a few mountains, caused a few floods.\"\n\nRequirements to be a Granny are: being at least 55, and a \"willingness to make noise\" tempered by \"an open heart to learn something new.\" \"No singing ability\" and \"no color sense, obviously,\" are required, writes de Shaw.\n\nSince Trump's election, the Portland Raging Grannies' ranks have almost doubled, to 55. Their oldest member is well into her 80s. They employ a strategy exemplified by the Otpor (\"resistance\") movement in Serbia, which helped undermine political and law enforcement support for strongman Slobodan Milosevic through humor, satire, and street theater.\n\nThey are also not beyond civil disobedience. Grannies have been arrested during events held by the North Carolina protest movement known as \"Moral Mondays.\" And a hero of the national group tied her rocking chair to a train track to protest a planned oil rig. She calmly knitted a sweater until police arrested her.\n\nIn 5-1/2 years of existence, the Portland Grannies have fine-tuned similar tactics, sometimes to great effect.\n\n\"They went to a military recruiting center, a place where I'd been doing candlelight vigils for a year, and they were very gung-ho,\" says Hastings, the veteran anti-war organizer. \"They put a whole bunch of rocking chairs in front of this recruitment center - a rocking chair blockade. When police came, they warned the Grannies. The Grannies took off but left their chairs, so the police had to load up the chairs. The picture in the paper: Police arrest grandma's rocking chair.\"\n\nThe Grannies \"show people what it means to be an activist, and in that way it highlights something else that social movements do: They sort of provide therapy for disaffected people,\" adds Purdue's Ms. Einwohner, who studies the dynamics of protest and resistance.\n\nPortland has a long history of protest - 40,000 protested the decision by President George W. Bush to invade Iraq in 2003; a decade earlier, President George H.W. Bush's Secret Service nicknamed the city \"Little Beirut\" for its raucous anti-war protests.\n\n\"What's happening in Portland is really just the latest chapter of an old story - sort of the frontier spirit where the margins are celebrated and where to be a registered Democrat is something of a stodgy, boring position to take,\" says Randy Blazak, who studies hate movements at Portland State University. \"There are probably more anarchists out admitting their political position than dyed-in-the-wool traditional Democrats. May Day is the biggest holiday in the city, much bigger than Christmas.\"\n\nThe roots of the current conflict can be found in the skinhead wars of the 1980s and '90s, when punks-turned-antifascist rumblers took on similarly attired neo-Nazi skinheads after the 1988 beating death of an Ethiopian college student by white supremacists. Then as now, antifa would look for tattoos or jewelry that suggested Nazi sympathies - and then attack - verbally or physically.\n\nAlexander Reid Ross, author of \"Against the Fascist Creep,\" told Portland's Willamette Weekly earlier this year that antifa - in his view, rightly - understands that \"the alt-right has to be understood as a fascist movement.\"\n\nTheir opponents include rally organizer Joey Gibson, who advocates for free speech rights for conservatives. While Mr. Gibson says he does not welcome white supremacists, some regular attendees admit that part of their mission is to defend themselves - and their cause - by \"kicking some antifa [butt],\" as Tiny Toese, a self-styled Samoan patriot who was arrested after a brawl in July, told followers on social media.\n\nThe stated aim of that Sunday's \"Patriot Prayer\" rally was to accuse antifa of domestic terrorism by using tactics to hurt conservatives, including calling their bosses to inform them of their political activities. The focus on leftist agitators is part of a deeper political shift, as well. Under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice has disbanded a unit on right-wing extremism and is now monitoring Portland and other cities for evidence of \"domestic terrorism\" from the left.\n\n\"We're seeing kind of the children of [the skinhead wars],\" says veteran Portland organizer Jamie Partridge. \"The Proud Boys are the street fighters who aren't really that ideological, but they are mad as hell. They see in Donald Trump a beacon of hope for bringing back the America that they think once was, but that they've never known.\"\n\nThere are growing concerns among organizers like Mr. Partridge that the self-described alt-right, despite its embrace of white nationalism and white supremacy, is having success in recruiting as a result of the attacks from antifa. The addition of Oath Keepers, a national group of retired law enforcement, as volunteer security has helped give the \"Patriot Prayer\" movement legitimacy in broader conservative circles.\n\n\"The thing about the left, we tend to be Chicken Littles: 'Oh, this is Hitlerian,'\" says Hastings. \"We tend to default straight to the bottom of the slippery slope, so our credibility has been radically compromised. Yes, there are spooky parallels between what Trump is doing and what Hitler did. But antifa can't operate with violence and expect it to produce anything other than a [backlash] in the general population.\"\n\nIt also is having an impact on rally attendance. On that Sunday, noticeably fewer activists on both sides showed up for dueling rallies before the fighting began, only to quickly dissipate.\n\nFredric Alan Maxwell, a Portland writer and activist, stayed home from that event with his cat. At an earlier melee, he was left slumped and scratched up after a group of antifa swept past him. Afterward, he wrote that his attackers were \"hiding their faces under bandannas as though robbing not speech but a stage....\"\n\nSuch decisions by longtime peace activists to stay home, as much as the fighting itself, is driving the transformation of protest in the Trump era, including for the Raging Grannies.\n\nIn response, the Grannies have adjusted their clothing policy, replacing at times their traditional dresses and hats for black T-shirts for mourning and white T-shirts with sashes for observing rallies - and engaging with edgy young protesters.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The day underscored the tensions between free speech and trying to counter hate speech.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Aug. 21, 2017, 6:32 p.m. ET | BOSTON\n\nOne of America's oldest theaters for free speech today signaled that when it comes to issues of white nationalism, it doesn't want to have a public conversation.\n\nAt a Boston \"free speech\" rally organized by a small group with ties to the alt-right, counter-protesters turned out in the tens of thousands to assert both their own values of inclusion and to shout down what many view as hate speech rooted in white supremacy.\n\nThey marched peacefully along a two-mile route to the rally on Boston Common, many of them protesting publicly for the first time and toting the humorous and heartfelt signs that have become hallmarks of anti-Trump demonstrations.\n\nBut the afternoon had a new and noticeable edge to it. Last week's large alt-right rally in Charlottesville, Va. - and President Trump's subsequent blaming of \"many sides\" for violence that injured 19 people and killed one counter-protester - appeared to infuse the crowd with a sense of urgency as well as anger. Even as Boston's Mayor Martin Walsh praised those who \"expressed themselves in such a positive, great manner today,\" the firm hand that Boston police exhibited throughout the day underscored the challenges cities across the nation face as they try to strike the right balance on free speech at a time of deeply polarized politics.\n\nLoading...\n\nBefore noon, off to the side of the Boston Common bandstand where the rally is scheduled to take place, around 15 free speech protesters are huddled in the shade, waiting for the main organizer to show up with the necessary permit. With the exception of one man wearing a shirt bearing an image of Mr. Trump, they blend in with the counter-protesters - no Nazi symbols, racist slogans, or signs.\n\nA tall white man in his early 20s, who asked to only be identified by his first initial, \"A.,\" says he really is here to support free speech - not hate speech.\n\n\"We're not seeing each other as people,\" says A., who identifies himself as a Libertarian. \"They're seeing each other as the 'other' and that's the problem.... It doesn't matter if you're with Antifa [anti-fascist activists] or if you consider yourself a white nationalist.\"\n\nAfter the organizer arrives with the permit, the free speech protesters are patted down by Boston police officers before passing into a fenced-off area that surrounds the bandstand. \"A.\" and other rally organizers invite The Monitor inside, but the police officers refuse: no counter-protesters or media allowed in the gates.\n\nSoon there are thousands of counter-protesters surrounding the fenced area. They are looking for the rally organizers, unsure of where to direct their chants.\n\nMatt, a mechanic from Hull, Mass., 15 miles south of Boston, wears a \"Proud Boys\" t-shirt - a reference to a far-right \"Western chauvinist\" group . He says he came to support the free speech protesters, but isn't being allowed inside the fenced area.\n\n\"Anyone that is different from them will be considered a Nazi,\" he says, pointing to the dozens of black-bandanna-clad Antifa members walking through the park. \"I know what I am, and I know what I am not. I am not a Nazi. I respect people who respect me - of all races.\"\n\nOutside the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center in Roxbury, a Boston neighborhood with a large minority population, Laura Moon is waiting with her teenage daughter, Monique, for the counter-protest march to start. They both have signs, and Monique has a Pride flag tied around her neck like a cape. It's their fifth or sixth march since Trump became president, but this one, Ms. Moon says, feels a bit different.\n\n\"The other marches we've been to, we've been standing for something,\" she continues. \"Today I feel a little nervous because I don't know what to expect.\"\n\nA young woman named Amelia, wearing a yellow felt Star of David on her dress, has also joined a half-dozen rallies since Trump became president. Today, for the first time, she wore a bracelet with her allergies and emergency contact information written on it.\n\n\"It's always going to be difficult when there are people out clearly with two sides,\" she says.\n\nThe man next to her, also wearing a felt Star of David and a bracelet, chimes in: \"There's an aspect of fear to it that's more present after what happened in Charlottesville.\"\n\nThe march is almost entirely peaceful, as the thousands of all ages and races chant and wave signs. But there is a strong sense among many of the marchers that only one group of protesters has a right to be in the city.\n\n\"I think [the free speech rally is] using free speech as an excuse to incite violence, incite hate,\" says Tori Schein, as a friend pushes her in her wheelchair, \"and that radically goes against the point of free speech.\"\n\nAs the march moves closer to the Common, with the marchers battling the cloying humidity and gulping from water bottles, Matthew Martin elaborates.\n\n\"I'm not going to say I'm against free speech,\" says Mr. Martin, a young African-American man sporting a black t-shirt, \"but why can't ISIS and Al Qaeda have nonviolent representatives march? Because it's incitement.\"\n\n\"The Klan is a terrorist organization,\" he adds, \"so if ISIS can't march, the Klan shouldn't be able to march.\"\n\nOn the Common, the small group of \"free speech\" protesters mill around on the bandstand. The growing crowd of counter-protesters - separated from them by a large, fenced-off neutral zone - breaks periodically into loud chants, diminishing the prospects that those on the bandstand will be heard: \"No hate, no fear, Nazis are not welcome here!\" \"\"Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy's got to go!\"\n\nBy 1 p.m., a roar goes up, and everyone seems to agree the protest is over. Estimates of the size of the counter-protest crowd vary, but all agree it runs into the tens of thousands. Two of the free-speech rallyers walk into the street without police supervision. John Pacheco, wearing a black t-shirt and a \"Don't Tread On Me\" hat, is soon surrounded by about 50 counter-protesters who yell obscenities and make crude hand gestures.\n\nMr. Pacheco begins by rebutting their slurs, but then decides to leave. He walks down the street with hundreds of counter-protesters yelling and throwing trash at his head. He keeps walking across the street as a crowd follows him, yelling.\n\n\"This is for free speech. Everyone has free speech. I just don't understand,\" says Pacheco, with tears in his eyes. He is standing in the middle of an intersection with counter-protesters yelling at him from four sides. The light turns from red to green, but everyone stays in the middle of the street.\n\nPacheco and his friend ask two transit police officers on the corner for help. Soon the transit police officers are loading them into an armored police truck to drive them to a safer location.\n\n\"Make them walk!\" the call rises from the sidewalks.\n\nAt about the same time, the march that has been flowing through Boston's streets finally reaches the Common, and news spreads that the free speech rally has ended early. Sweaty and smiling, the crowds begin to disperse onto the grass and into the shade. A few minutes later, around a dozen counter-protesters start sprinting toward the State House.

It is better known for identifying political prisoners in Nazi concentration camps.\n\nLoading...\n\nJune 19, 2020, 12:03 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nFacebook has removed campaign ads by President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence that featured an upside-down red triangle, a symbol once used by Nazis to designate political prisoners, communists, and others in concentration camps.\n\nThe company said in a statement Thursday that the ads violated \"our policy against organized hate.\" A Facebook executive who testified at a House Intelligence Committee hearing on Thursday said the company does not permit symbols of hateful ideology \"unless they're put up with context or condemnation.\"\n\n\"In a situation where we don't see either of those, we don't allow it on the platform and we remove it. That's what we saw in this case with this ad, and anywhere that that symbol is used, we would take the same action,\" Nathaniel Gleicher, the company's head of security policy, told lawmakers at a hearing.\n\nThe Trump campaign spent more than $17,000 on the ads for Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence combined. The ads began running on Wednesday and received hundreds of thousands of impressions.\n\nIn a statement, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said the inverted red triangle was a symbol commonly used by antifa so it was included in an ad about antifa. He said the symbol is not in the Anti-Defamation League's database of symbols of hate. The Trump campaign also argued that the symbol is an emoji.\n\n\"But it is ironic that it took a Trump ad to force the media to implicitly concede that Antifa is a hate group,\" he added.\n\nAntifa is an umbrella term for leftist militants bound more by belief than organizational structure. Mr. Trump has blamed antifa for the violence that erupted during some of the recent protests, but federal law enforcement officials have offered little evidence of this.\n\nSome experts disputed that the red triangle was commonly used as an antifa symbol.\n\nEuropean anti-fascist groups initially used the red triangle as a symbol, hoping to reclaim its meaning after World War II, but it is no longer widely used by the movement nor by U.S. antifa groups, said Mark Bray, a Rutgers University historian and author of \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.\"\n\nThe ADL said the triangle was not in its database because it is a historical symbol and the database includes only those symbols used by modern-day extremists and white supremacists.\n\n\"Whether aware of the history or meaning, for the Trump campaign to use a symbol - one which is practically identical to that used by the Nazi regime to classify political prisoners in concentration camps - to attack his opponents is offensive and deeply troubling,\" ADL chief executive officer Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement.\n\nEven with the ads removed, Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg still faced persistent criticism for not removing or labeling earlier posts by Mr. Trump that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, many said, encouraged violence against protesters during recent unrest in American cities.\n\nThose questions arose anew during Thursday's hearing as Democrats pressed the executives about what moral obligations they felt they had when it came to content and about decisions they've made to remove, label, or leave up false or incendiary posts.\n\nFacebook, for instance, was asked why it did not swiftly remove a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last year that appeared to show her slurring her words.\n\n\"If we simply take a piece of content like this down, it doesn't go away,\" Mr. Gleicher responded. \"It will exist elsewhere on the internet. People who are looking for it will still find it.\"\n\nLater Thursday, Twitter labeled a video Mr. Trump had posted as \"manipulated media.\" The president had tweeted a doctored video of two young children with a fake, misspelled CNN headline of \"Terrified todler runs from racist baby.\" For the first time last month, Twitter began flagging some of Mr. Trump's tweets with a fact-check warning.\n\nWith Thursday's hearing focused on the spread of disinformation tied to the 2020 election, the companies said they had not yet seen the same sort of concerted foreign influence campaigns like the one four years ago, when Russian sowed discord online by playing up divisive social issues.\n\nBut that suggests the threat has simply evolved rather than diminished, said the executives, who pointed out that media entities linked to foreign governments were now directly engaging online on American social issues as a way to influence public opinion. Chinese actors, for instance, have likened allegations of police brutality in the U.S. to the criticism China faced for its aggressive treatment of protesters in Hong Kong.\n\n\"That shift from platform manipulation to overt state assets is something that we've observed,\" said Nick Pickles, Twitter's public policy strategy and development director.\n\nThe companies say they have accelerated efforts to root out fake accounts. Twitter, for instance, said it had challenged in the first six months of 2019 more than 97 million accounts that showed signs of platform manipulation, and Facebook said it had disabled about 1.7 billion fake accounts between January and March.\n\nPreventing disinformation ahead of the election is a significant challenge in a country facing potentially dramatic changes in how people vote, with the expected widespread use of mail-in ballots creating openings to cast doubt on the results and spread inaccurate narratives.\n\nFacebook said Thursday that it is working to provide Americans with accurate information about the vote-by-mail process, with notifications to users about how to request ballots and about whether the date of their election has changed. The outreach is targeted to voters in states where no excuse is needed to vote by mail or where fears of the coronavirus are accepted as an excuse.\n\n\"Providing that accurate information is one of the best ways to mitigate those types of threats,\" Mr. Gleicher said.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Anti-racist organizations fear the ruling could empower the group.\n\nLoading...\n\nJune 05, 2019, 12:46 p.m. ET | Los Angeles\n\nFederal charges against three alleged members of a violent white supremacist group accused of inciting violence at California political rallies were dismissed by a judge who found their actions amounted to constitutionally protected free speech.\n\nProsecutors said members of the Rise Above Movement (RAM) conspired to riot by using the internet to coordinate hand-to-hand combat training, traveling to protests, and attacking demonstrators at gatherings in Huntington Beach, Berkeley, and San Bernardino. The group also posted videos to celebrate violence and recruit members.\n\nDespite the group's \"hateful and toxic ideology,\" a rarely used criminal statute passed during civil rights and Vietnam War protests went too far in regulating free speech, Judge Cormac J. Carney ruled Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.\n\nJudge Carney said the Anti-Riot Act of 1968 - most famously used to prosecute the \"Chicago Eight,\" including Abbie Hoffman, Bobby Seale, and Tom Hayden, for conspiring to incite a riot at the '68 Democratic National Convention - was unconstitutional in part because it criminalized advocating violence when no riot or crime was imminent. He said prosecutors cited social media posts the men made months before and months after the rallies.\n\n\"Some posts express repugnant, hateful ideas,\" Judge Carney wrote. \"Other posts advocate the use of violence. Most, if not all, are protected speech.\"\n\nThe judge threw out the charges and ordered the release of alleged RAM leader Robert Rundo and suspected member Robert Boman. Charges against Aaron Eason, who was free on bond, were also dropped.\n\nDefense attorney John McNicholas, who represented Mr. Eason, said his client was never a member of RAM and committed no crime.\n\nHe said the men thought they were doing good going to conservative rallies to counter the anti-fascists known as Antifa who were \"committing acts of violence to suppress speech they disagreed with.\" He criticized prosecutors for not pursuing charges against Antifa members that he said instigated violence and doused rally participants with pepper spray.\n\n\"Beyond the unconstitutional nature of the statute, nothing about the case makes sense because the people inciting the riot were never charged with a federal offense,\" Mr. McNicholas said.\n\nThe Los Angeles ruling alarmed groups that track white supremacist activity and fear the court decision could empower RAM, which is known for espousing anti-Semitic and other racist views.\n\nRAM's account on Gab, a social media network known as a haven for racists and anti-Semites, hailed the dismissals and announced it would relaunch its Right Brand clothing line.\n\n\"It underscores their sense of vindication,\" said Joanna Mendelson of the Anti-Defamation League. \"This court victory has the great potential of giving them renewed energy and will reinvigorate the group overall.\"\n\nProsecutors were disappointed with the ruling and reviewing grounds for appeal, spokesman Ciaran McEvoy said.\n\nA federal judge in Virginia reached a conclusion opposite of Judge Carney's in a similar case involving other California members of RAM who participated in violent white nationalist rallies in both states.\n\nFour alleged members of the group pleaded guilty and admitted punching and kicking counter-protesters as white nationalists led a torch-lit march at the University of Virginia and at the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville in August 2017.\n\nDefendants in those cases plan to appeal on the grounds that the statute is unconstitutional because it is overbroad, vague, and infringes on protected First Amendment activities, said Lisa Lorish, assistant federal public defender in Charlottesville. She expects the appeals court will agree with Judge Carney's reasoning.\n\nThere are plausible arguments in support of both decisions - with Judge Carney taking a broad interpretation of the law and Judge Norman Moon in Virginia taking a narrow one, said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nThe conflict between the rulings on opposite coasts could rise to the Supreme Court if both rulings are appealed and circuit courts reach different conclusions, he said. But that's far from certain.\n\nIn the California case, a fourth defendant, Tyler Laube, who pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge in November, filed papers in court Tuesday to withdraw his guilty plea and have the charges against him dismissed after Judge Carney encouraged him to do that, attorney Jerome Haig said.\n\nMr. Laube was facing nearly three years in prison after he admitted that as a member of the group he assaulted counter-protesters at a \"Make America Great Again\" rally in Huntington Beach in 2017.\n\nBrian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said if members discussed a criminal plan and took steps to carry it out, their speech was not protected.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has basically held that hateful speech is protected; however, violence and conspiracies are not,\" Mr. Levin said. \"That's where I think the judge may have gotten this one wrong.\"\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

That trend should not be easily reversed as the US ponders attacking North Korea or as groups in the US justify violence at public protests. Humanity has grown in its understanding and use of empathy as a tool for peace.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Aug. 29, 2017, 4:11 p.m. ET\n\nOne reason for a general decline in violence worldwide since World War II is that many nations and people no longer rely on preemptive violence, or attacking foes in anticipation of being attacked. The world is now bound closer by rules, trade, stable governments, and a greater knowledge of each other.\n\nYet this restraint against preemptive strikes is not assured. Just consider a few recent developments:\n\nAfter North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan on Aug. 29, the Trump administration further raised the possibility of military action on the North's nuclear facilities. \"All options are on the table,\" President Trump said. Even in pacifist Japan, nearly a third of people would favor a preemptive move.\n\nMr. Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, was ready in 2013 to launch a preemptive strike against Syria to prevent further use of its chemical weapons on its citizens. In 2003, President George W. Bush invaded Iraq on the premise that Saddam Hussein had the capacity to build or export weapons of mass destruction. And since the 9/11 attacks, all presidents have relied on \"target killings\" of terrorists deemed to be plotting attacks on Americans or others.\n\nCloser to home, many members of extremist groups have justified violence during protests. On Aug. 12, a neo-Nazi demonstrator rammed a car into a group of anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Va., killing one. And in skirmishes in Berkeley, Calif., on Aug. 27, members of an anti-fascist movement (known as \"antifa\") attacked right-wing demonstrators. Dartmouth College went so far as to issue a statement distancing the institution from the views of one of its lecturers, an expert on antifa, who supported violence by the \"revolutionary left\" movement against fascists during public protests.\n\nThe idea of preemptive attacks has a strong legal basis in international law. Nations are entitled to preemptive self-defense if an attack is considered \"imminent.\" But today's threats are less clear-cut. Rogue states like North Korea or terrorist groups like Al Qaeda do not easily make known their intent or the exact whereabouts of their threat. And extremist groups in the United States rely on individuals or small groups to initiate attacks.\n\nThe world must be careful, however, not to easily accept preemptive violence as it once did. The days when kings, tribes, or clans would strike an enemy for the slightest threat have been replaced by a rise in organized governments granted a monopoly over the use of violence. And nations have steadily devised rules aimed at decreasing threats or they rely on international bodies, such as the United Nations, to justify a collective preemption attack.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nAs Harvard University professor Steven Pinker notes in his 2011 book, \"The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined,\" humanity has grown in its understanding and use of empathy as a tool for peace. Diplomacy and negotiation are preventing wars. The more people know of each other, the more they see their own good in the good of others. People's \"moral circles\" have expanded.\n\nThe global trend away from violence, whether it be the murder of individual or a government's use of armed missiles, requires vigilance to maintain it. And one of the best ways is to keep questioning those who too easily justify preemptive violence.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Yet styling itself the capital of blue America has not come without cost to the state, political analysts say.\n\nLoading...\n\nAug. 28, 2017, 1:27 p.m. ET | San Francisco and Berkeley, Calif.\n\nThey came, they marched, and in their view, they conquered.\n\nThe thousands who hit the streets of San Francisco and Berkeley this weekend declared their demonstrations a success after Patriot Prayer, an Oregon-based group - which says it eschews racism, but whose gatherings have previously attracted white nationalists and neo-Nazis - canceled rallies scheduled to take place in both cities.\n\n\"When Nazis and white supremacists and white nationalists are in our city, we cannot stay home and we cannot stay silent,\" says Mia, a data analyst from the South Bay. \"We're going to resist!\" adds her mother, Barb, who wore a hat adorned with flowers and carried a bouquet as the pair joined the crowd in San Francisco. (They declined to give their last names.)\n\nThe marches reaffirmed the Bay Area's, and more broadly California's, position as the center of resistance to what liberals see as a wave of ultra-conservatism and right-wing extremism sweeping the nation. And, like Mia and Barb, many who turned out for the events were proud to call themselves Californian because of it.\n\n\"The resilience of California's populace sends a strong message of, 'We can take it,' \" says Shirley Song, who came up to the Bay Area from Sunnyvale, near San Jose, to participate in both rallies.\n\nYet styling itself the capital of blue America has not come without cost to California, political analysts say. Since President Trump took office, the state has regularly wrangled with Washington over approaches to immigration, climate change, and social services - and still faces the threat of cuts to key federally-funded programs. The state has also seen a surge in both hate crimes and violent public demonstrations over the past year and a half, as protesters across a range of ideologies converge in the state's most liberal enclaves. Those same cities have also become a frontline for a nationwide struggle over freedom of speech and how to effectively respond to hatred and bigotry.\n\nThat all this is taking place here is no coincidence, says Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.\n\n\"California is not only viewed as a bastion of progressive politics but a battleground for a demographically changing America,\" he says. \"To white nationalists, this is what they want to prevent the rest of the country from turning into. So this is tapping into a vein that's existed for some time.\"\n\nThe tension between the Golden State and the nation's capital has found its most visible expression at the level of politics and policy. When Mr. Trump pulled the US out of the Paris accord, California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) met separately with China's President Xi Jinping to discuss global efforts to address climate change. When Trump released his budget proposal, which outlined a hike in defense funding while cutting support for spending on social services, Governor Brown called it \" unconscionable and un-American .\" And as Trump doubles down on his campaign promise to build a wall along the US border with Mexico, California lawmakers prepare to pass the California Values Act, a statewide \"sanctuary\" bill that would further limit cooperation between state and local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.\n\nNearly every action Trump takes \"is a gut punch to California,\" says Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California. \"[The administration has] targeted the state that gave Hillary Clinton her popular vote win. And California's responding to what it perceives as a threat to its Democratic constituency.\"\n\nBut conflict has manifested in the streets, too. While police reported only one arrest in San Francisco on Saturday, Berkeley saw more than a dozen people taken into police custody and several confrontations between right-wing activists and the larger crowd. Antifa - the term used for a loose affiliation of leftist-leaning, militant groups opposed to fascism - crossed police barricades to storm a park named for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., in downtown Berkeley.\n\nThe Sunday protest adds to the 27 public gatherings statewide that have involved \"injury, arrests, property damage, or significant aggressive physical disruption\" since February last year, according to data compiled by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.\n\n\"The engagement in the mainstream between progressives and conservatives is playing out in a dangerous carnival mirror reflection between anti-fascists and anarchists, and white nationalists,\" Professor Levin says.\n\nTo California's most dedicated activists, such clashes are part of the cost of resisting racism and white supremacy. The social movements of the past were fraught with violence because sometimes that's what it takes to defend democratic values, says Emily Lee, spokeswoman for Bay Resistance, a coalition of Bay Area advocacy groups. \"We're clearly in a fight around the moral soul of our country,\" she says. \"We can't simply sit by and hope these alt-right groups go away. So we support nonviolent direct action, but also people's right to self-determination and to defend themselves.\"\n\nFor others, however, the situation is not so clear-cut. \"We want to stand for justice, freedom, and free speech. I'm not sure that shutting down [Patriot Prayer] is the best way to fight,\" says Betsy Bigelow Teller, a Berkeley resident who came to Sunday's counter protests wearing Groucho Marx glasses. \"I think there needs to be some sort of understanding and dialogue.\"\n\nObservers point out there's a long history behind the struggle to define the line between free speech and hate speech, which is legally protected in America under the First Amendment, and between self-defense and outright violence. The events in the Bay Area this weekend, they say, serve as an expression of that struggle.\n\nPatriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson insists that although he started the organization as a response to counter-protesters attacking attendees of a Trump rally during the presidential campaign, his anti-extremism message cuts both ways. \"Nazism is extremely dangerous, but in my opinion no different than Antifa,\" he says in a phone interview ahead of the Bay Area demonstrations. \"Hate is hate. That's what I'm trying to preach to people.\"\n\nHe and his supporters say they have a right to be able to get that message out. Although the rallies he'd planned over the weekend were cancelled, Mr. Gibson did show up in Berkeley on Sunday, where protesters chased him and reportedly sprayed pepper spray at him. The police said they detained him for his protection, according to TV reports.\n\nMany leading the counter protests in the Bay Area disagree. \"It's doesn't matter if they themselves don't support white supremacism,\" says Ms. Lee with Bay Resistance. \"They know who their rallies attract, and that has a direct impact on our communities, whether they claim that's their intention or not.\"\n\nIt's a situation that analysts say American society will continue to grapple with in the face of deeply polarizing forces. \"What are we supposed to do?

He called on Americans to move forward \"as one people\" and \"to rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.\"\n\nTrump's earlier comments on Charlottesville came one day after he met in private with Sen. Tim Scott (R) of South Carolina, the Senate's lone black Republican, at the White House. The two discussed the president's past remarks blaming \"many sides\" for the violence and death around a Confederate statue.\n\nRecounting his conversation with Senator Scott, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday: \"I think especially in light of the advent of antifa, if you look at what's going on there, you know, you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also. And essentially that's what I said.\"\n\n\"Antifa\" is short for \"anti-fascist,\" an umbrella description for far-left-leaning militant groups.\n\nTrump added that more and more people are starting to agree with him.\n\n\"A lot of people are saying - in fact a lot of people have actually written, 'Gee, Trump might have a point,'\" Trump said. \"I said, 'You got some very bad people on the other side also,' which is true.\"\n\nTrump last month said there were \"very fine people\" among the nationalists and neo-Nazis protesting the possible removal of a Confederate statue in Charlottesville.\n\nScott said he told the president that there was no comparison.\n\n\"We had three or four centuries of rape, murder, and death brought at the hands of the (Ku Klux Klan) and those who believe in a superior race,\" he told reporters at the Capitol. \"I wanted to make sure we were clear on the delineation between who's on which side in the history of the nation.\"\n\nScott bluntly criticized Trump for assigning blame in a way that put white supremacist protesters on equal footing with counterdemonstrators who turned out for the Aug. 12 protests, sparked by Charlottesville officials' decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThat remark, Scott said, compromised Trump's moral authority as president.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump told Scott that he just meant to convey \"that there was an antagonist on the other side\" - to which Scott replied, \"The real picture has nothing to do with who is on the other side.\"\n\nScott continued: \"I shared my thoughts of the last three centuries of challenges from white supremacists, white nationalists, KKK, neo-Nazis, so there is no way to find an equilibrium when you have three centuries of history.\"\n\nThe president said that he got the point, Scott said. Asked if the president can regain his moral authority, Scott responded, \"That will take time.\"\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump and Scott had an \"in-depth\" discussion about the Charlottesville comments, \"but the focus was primarily on solutions moving forward.\"\n\n\"That was what both people came to the meeting wanting to discuss,\" Ms. Sanders said during a White House briefing. \"What we can do to bring people together, not talk about divisions within the country.\"\n\nScott said Trump also brought up Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett, who has accused Las Vegas police of using racially motivated excessive force against him.\n\nBennett sat on the bench during the national anthem before Sunday's game at Green Bay, one of several NFL players protesting in support of former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who remains unsigned after starting the protests last year to bring attention to police brutality against minorities.\n\n\"I believe he found it unsettling and challenging,\" Scott said.\n\nThis came as several athletes, activists and celebrities signed a letter of support for Bennett.\n\n\"Michael Bennett has been sitting during the anthem precisely to raise these issues of racist injustice that are now an intimate part of his life. Now we stand with him,\" the letter said.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "What Is The Difference Between Antifa And The Radical Left? It Depends On Who You Ask\n\nBy Seth Cohen\n\nBy Seth Cohen ,\n\nFormer Staff.\n\nAmidst the violent protests in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, over the weekend, President Trump announced that the United States would be designating \"ANTIFA\" as a terrorist organization. Putting aside the questionable constitutionality of the designation, Trump's tweet was accompanied by comments from Attorney General William Barr and other administration officials that claimed Antifa and the so-called \"far left\" are behind the vandalism and looting that marred this past week's protests.\n\nTake for example Barr's comments on Saturday remarking that the Justice Department plans to enforce federal laws that prohibit crossing state lines to incite violence:\n\n\"Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protests are being hijacked by violent radical elements,\" Barr said. \"In many places it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by far-left extremist groups and anarchic groups using Antifa-like tactics.\"\n\nComments like Barr's raise an important question  - what exactly is the difference between Antifa and the far, or radical, left?\n\nWell, like everything in America right now, it depends on who you ask. Officials like Trump and Barr are using the terms interchangeably, blurring the lines between the two. By doing so, administration officials are attempting to inject volatile language into an already combustible situation. As a result, they are sowing deeper seeds of confusion about who might really be engaging in criminal activity.\n\nWhat exactly is Antifa?\n\nAntifa, short for the word \"anti-fascist,\" is a loose group of radical activists that has emerged over the past several years in order to confront white supremacists, right-wing extremists, and others it deems as fascist. Often dressed in all black and wearing black face masks (so called black bloc tactics), Antifa has been known to use violent tactics, particularly amidst mass protests and other times of heightened tension. Past examples of Antifa protests include taking part in violent anti-capitalist marches, protesting a 2017 speech by alt-right speaker Milo Yiannopoulus in Berkley, California, and protesting the \"Unite the Right\" rally held at Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.\n\nDemonstrators gather to protest the death of George Floyd, Saturday, May 30, 2020, near the White ... More House in Washington. Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers. '(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nUnlike conventional political movements, Antifa activists do not appear to have a centralized leadership structure, although they may organize in smaller groups on a local basis. Yet given its size and significance, Antifa has become an increasing presence in America. A 2019 report by the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness describes Antifa in the following manner:\n\n\"Antifa is a movement that focuses on issues involving racism, sexism, and anti-Semitism, as well as other perceived injustices. The majority of Antifa members do not promote or endorse violence; however, the movement consists of anarchist extremists and other individuals who seek to carry out acts of violence in order to forward their respective agendas.\"\n\nWho exactly are the radical left?\n\nThis is a lot more complicated because of our deeply divided political environment. Over the past several years, President Trump has used the term \"radical left\" to describe almost every single one of his political opponents, ranging from former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ilhan Omer, and others. Just last month, President Trump said in a Tweet that \"[t]he Radical Left is in total command & control of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google.\" And on Monday morning once again President Trump used the term \"radical left\" in association with former Vice President and current Presidential candidate, Joe Biden.\n\nIn other words, in President Trump's mind, and the minds of his supporters, the radical left and far left are interchangeable terms for Trump's political adversaries. Using this term has been a tried-and-true tactic of the President since his election in 2016, and as a result, the terms have become divorced from their more classical political meaning - which includes political views that fall outside of mainstream democratic and liberal perspectives. By increasingly painting all Democratic views as \"radical left,\" President Trump has negated the real meaning the words.\n\nWhich is why the interchangeable use of the terms Antifa and radical left is so troubling. As federal, state, and local law enforcement officials begin to work through the aftermath of mass protests and focus on addressing accountability for the violent outbreaks that accompanied them, there will be a desire to find scapegoats for America's current crisis. With the President and Attorney General making it clear they believe Antifa is the culprit, there is no question that the extremist protesters will be in the sights of law enforcement action.\n\nYet as right-leaning media outlets continue to echo the President and others' comments about the radical and extreme left, it is clear that it is not just the Antifa that has reason to be concerned. The United States has a history of using federal power to surveil otherwise peaceful movements like the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's in times of national upheaval. And with America currently being led by a President who has not shied away from using his social media platform to promote division and violence, the present moment is cause for deep concern.\n\nBy conflating Antifa and the \"left,\" President Trump and his followers are leading the country down a confusingly perilous path with no easy way to define its future. Yet among all of the complexity of the past several months, one thing remains abundantly clear:\n\nIn crisis, language, like leadership, matters."

More September 30, 2020, in Washington, D.C.\n\nAccording to Axios, in a \"tense and aggressive\" phone call Monday morning with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Trump parroted the baseless conspiracy theory that antifa supporters-not a mob of pro-Trump insurrections, as has been amply documented-were responsible for Wednesday's insurgence.\n\nMcCarthy pushed back, telling the president : \"It's not antifa, it's MAGA. I know. I was there,\" according to the report, which cites a White House official and another source familiar with the call.\n\nDuring the call, Trump also repeated his groundless claims concerning election fraud, which reportedly led to McCarthy cutting in to say, \"Stop it. It's over. The election is over .\"\n\nMcCarthy advised Trump to call Joe Biden, meet with him and leave a welcome letter in the Resolute Desk for his successor, according to the report, but the president reportedly told McCarthy he had not yet decided if he will.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes .\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the infiltration and occupation of the Capitol building, leading Republican lawmakers and popular right-wing pundits began spreading the unfounded rumor that antifa was responsible for the rioting. Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin all echoed the conspiracy theory. The Washington Times published a story mere hours after the attack, claiming facial recognition analysis from a technology company called XRVision provided proof. However, XRVision would quickly denounce the Times story as entirely false. On Friday, FBI Assistant Director Steven D'Antuono confirmed there was no evidence that antifa activists were involved. In a separate conference call on Monday, this one with GOP members, McCarthy reportedly said that there is \"undisputedly\" no evidence that individuals linked to antifa participated in the storming of the Capitol. McCarthy said that he has \"been receiving FBI briefings, and it is clear that antifa was not behind this,\" one source familiar with the call told The Hill , adding, \"it was, in fact, right-wing extremists and QAnon adherents, and he urged members to stop spreading false information to the contrary.\" In addition to McCarthy, Texas Lt.

      "text": "'And Tomorrow The Entire World' On Netflix: Tense German Drama On Antifa Activism\n\nBy Sheena Scott\n\nBy Sheena Scott ,\n\nContributor.\n\nJulia von Heinz at the Venice Film Festival in 2020.  (Photo credit: Kurt Krieger - Corbis/Corbis ... More via Getty Images)\n\nNetflix NFLX released on May 7 the German movie And Tomorrow the Entire World ( Und Morgen die ganze Welt ) directed by Julia von Heinz, from a script she co-wrote with John Quester. It is a coming-of-age film about young political activists fighting the rise of fascism that is both tense and thought-provoking.\n\nAnd Tomorrow the Entire World follows Luisa (Mala Emde), a twenty-year old law student from an upper-class family who joins a group of Antifa activists with the help of her best friend Batte (Luisa-Céline Gaffron). Like her friend, Luisa is opposed to the rise of the political extreme-right in Germany and wants to do something about it.\n\nIn the Antifa commune, she meets charismatic Alfa (Noah Saavedra), an activist with a radical tendency, and his tech friend Lenor (Tonio Schneider). Contrary to the pacifism of the group, Alfa employs more violent tactics to fight fascism. After Luisa is assaulted by a neo-Nazi, she finds herself drawn to Alfa and his radical ideas, believing that the Antifa group isn't going far enough. But is countering violence with more violence going too far?\n\nThe film opens with a quotation from Art.20, Par.4 of Germany's Constitution, which states that all Germans have the right to resist anyone who seeks to abolish the free democratic constitutional order. This right will later be discussed in one of Luisa's classes, in which she explains that the police and the judiciary must be called first before taking any action. It is the implication of this very right written in the German Constitution that the film explores through Luisa's character.\n\nIn full knowledge of this right, Luisa is thus faced with this pending question: how do you combat the alarming rise of fascism? And, is the use of violence justified? These questions, the film suggests, are ever more pressing in a country with a history that directly links to the consequences of rising fascism. The title of the film refers back to this history. \"And tomorrow the entire world\" is a line taken from the official song of the Hitler Youth. And yet, while the film is very specifically about Germany, the questions the film poses extend far beyond its borders.\n\nThe story of the film was inspired by the director's own experience of joining Antifa when she was younger. This sense of a personal journey of discovery is reflected in the film's shaky handheld aesthetic style (by director of photography Daniela Knapp) with the camera always staying close to Luisa's face. We hear her breath when she is anxious, and see the nightmare that plagues her after she is assaulted by a neo-Nazi. This is her experience of becoming part of an Antifa group that the film depicts, thus creating a strong connection with the character. This is the strength of Julia von Heinz's film, the way in which it embarks viewers into Luisa's emotional journey and thought process.\n\nProduced by Seven Elephants, Kings & Queens Filmproduktion and Haïku Films, and a Franco-German co-production, the film was in competition at the last Venice International Film Festival in 2020. It was Germany's entry for the International Film prize at this year's Oscars, which spurred on public attacks from the far-right political party AfD (Alternative for Germany). These attacks from Germany's far-right political party isn't too surprising considering the subject of the film. It is the rise in popularity of the AfD in Germany that the film appears to be referring to, without naming the political party directly.\n\nAnd Tomorrow the Entire World is a tense film, creating a constant sense of impending doom, that something will eventually explode. It is a great film about anti-fascist activism that is thought-provoking."

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), the first senator to announce he will object to certification of the Electoral College vote, said protesters showed up at his home in Vienna, Virginia, on Monday and terrorized his wife and newborn daughter, though protesters described the event in a different light and unconfirmed footage of the demonstration appears to show a less menacing sequence of events than Hawley portrayed.\n\nSen.

(Photo by Greg Nash / POOL / AFP) (Photo by GREG NASH/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn a tweet , Hawley referred to the demonstrators as \"Antifa scumbags\" who \"screamed threats, vandalized, and tried to pound open\" his door.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet disputing the protesters' version of events, Hawley said demonstrators \"screamed through bullhorns,\" shouted at his wife when she asked them to leave, \"vandalized property,\" and \"terrorized\" his neighbors.\"\n\nThe protesters, members of the group ShutDownDC, characterized the event as an \"hour long vigil\" in which about a dozen activists \"lit candles and delivered a copy of the Constitution to Hawley's door\" in a statement on Twitter, which was subsequently removed from the platform for violating its rules.\n\nThe demonstrators said they were there to \"demand\" Hawley \"drop his baseless contestation of the 2020 presidential election results.\"\n\nVideo of the protest posted by ShutDownDC on YouTube showed protesters chanting with a megaphone outside Hawley's home, and at one point in the clip, three demonstrators walk up to the senator's door, but do not appear to knock.\n\nVienna police did not immediately respond to Forbes ' request for comment.\n\nThe homes of multiple politicians have been targeted over the past year. Last week, protesters vandalized the homes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) after McConnell blocked a measure that would have sent $2,000 direct payments to Americans. Vandals spray painted \"Where's my money\" on McConnell's door, and the message \"$2K cancel rent\" was emblazoned on Pelosi's San Francisco home. Protesters also left a severed pig's head and a trail of blood in the speaker's driveway. In December, \"dozens\" of armed protesters arrived at the home of Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to protest President Donald Trump's victory in the state.\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Post , Patrick Young, a member of ShutDownDC, said the demonstration was not intended to be threatening. \"This was not threatening behavior,\" Young said. \"This is people engaging in democracy and engaging in civil discourse...This was a pretty tame and peaceful visit to his house.\" Young added the group decided to travel to Hawley's home, instead of at his congressional office, because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHawley and 11 other GOP senators have said they will object to the Electoral College results when Congress convenes Wednesday. Thousands of pro-Trump protesters are expected to arrive in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. The D.C. National Guard said Monday it will activate 340 troops to assist the D.C. police in handling the protest.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News on Monday, anchor Brett Baier pressed Hawley repeatedly about the challenge, asking the Missouri senator whether he believed Trump would be president after January 20. \"That depends on what happens on Wednesday, that's why we have the debate,\" Hawley responded . President-elect Joe Biden's victory has been certified by all 50 states, and Republicans have yet to produce substantial evidence of fraud.\n\nSen.

More of Azusa, California, September 17, 2020.\n\nData from CrowdTangle, an analytics tool owned by Facebook, shows interest surged in May and June for Antifa, as protests erupted across the country over the killing of George Floyd and conservatives blamed the loosely defined network for rioting and looting.\n\nDuring a one-week period from May 31-June 6, there  were 20 million interactions on posts about Antifa on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data.\n\nThe Trump campaign quickly capitalized on the online interest during that period, running several ads on Facebook warning about Antifa and \"dangerous mobs\" that were \"running through our streets.\"\n\nSince then, Facebook interactions on posts about Antifa has decreased, even as far-right groups on the platform attempted to spread false rumors that Antifa was behind the wildfires on the West Coast and the Trump campaign tried to tie Joe Biden to the left-wing network, without showing evidence.\n\nThis week, climate change overtook Antifa in Facebook engagement, as hurricanes slam the Southeast and devastating wildfires rip through towns across the West Coast.\n\nFrom September 13 to September 18, there've been 5.7 million interactions on posts about climate change on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle, while posts about Antifa have garnered just 2.9 million interactions during the same period.\n\nData pulled from CrowdTangle on keywords \"antifa\" and \"climate change\" for date ranges specified. CrowdTangle does not track all public Facebook accounts, and limits its search to \"public Pages, public Facebook Groups, and public Verified Profiles\" of a certain account size following.\n\nFBI Director Chris Wray appeared to contradict the president during testimony on Capitol Hill Thursday, saying Antifa was \"not a group or an organization\" but rather \"an ideology.\" Experts and studies of data by police departments have concluded that Antifa is not the driving force behind the violence. Instead, analysts say , most of the violence was carried out by gangs and random locals.\n\nThe online interest in climate change could play into Joe Biden's hands. The Democratic presidential nominee has slammed Trump for his denial of climate change, including when the president wrongly questioned whether climate change had an effect on the wildfires last week. Biden has proposed an aggressive climate change plan, and his campaign recently ran a Facebook ad saying there \"is no greater challenge facing our world than the climate emergency.\"\n\nCalifornia has experienced 6 of the 20 worst wildfires in history this year, according to the Los Angeles Times .\n\n980 groups, 520 pages and 160 ads. That's how many groups, pages and ads Facebook announced it took down in August that were tied to Antifa, the company said . (CrowdTangle measures public groups and pages of a certain size, so it's not clear Facebook's crackdown markedly affected engagement on antifa posts.)\n\nOne Community. Many Voices.

      "text": "'They'll Attack Your Homes': Trump Campaign Sends 'Antifa Alert' To Supporters\n\nThe Trump campaign sent out an \"ANTIFA ALERT\" to supporters on Saturday as part of a broader effort by President Trump to instill fear of civil unrest and left-wing vigilantes, even as he says his crisis management strategy is primarily aimed at maintaining calm.\n\nTOPSHOT - US President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a campaign rally at the Minden-Tahoe airport ... More in Minden (50miles/80km south of Reno), Nevada on September 12, 2020. (Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAmid a furor over audio revealing he knew of the virus' severity as early as February and admitted to \"playing it down,\" Trump insisted during a news conference on Thursday that he sought to maintain \"calmness\" and show that the U.S. would be \"fine, one way or the other.\"\n\nThe comments came as something of a contradiction of Trump's dystopian rhetoric on law and order, housing, and what the country would look like under his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nAt a Michigan rally on Friday, Trump mused about a mass exodus of wealthy families from the suburbs if \"residents of Antifa,\" an ill-defined group of left-wing and anarchist activists, were to move there, telling supporters that if Biden wins, \"the rioters, anarchists, arsonists and flag burners win.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign has embraced the \"Antifa\" narrative as well, most recently through a text message with the subject \"(1) ANTIFA ALERT,\" which told supporters \"they'll attack your homes if Joe's elected. Pres Trump needs you to become a Diamond Club Member.\"\n\nTrump campaign Facebook ads also tell supporters that \"MOBS of far-left groups\" are \"causing absolute mayhem\" and \"DESTROYING our cities,\" and depict Biden kneeling in front of scenes of \"chaos and violence\" at protests.\n\nConfronted by Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace over Trump playing the \"panic card\" on Biden, Trump campaign senior adviser Steve Cortes insisted there is a \"key difference\" between that and Trump downplaying coronavirus. \"He is trying to exhort the American people to action, to say... we can restore order,\" Cortes said of Trump's rhetoric on Biden. On coronavirus, he asserted it is \"not helpful\" to tell Americans that the virus is \"out of control,\" claiming Trump \"didn't just use flowery language and then sit back.\"\n\n38%. That's the percent of Minnesota voters who said in a CBS News/YouGov poll that Trump is trying to \"calm the situation down\" with regards to protests in U.S. cities, compared to 50% who said the same of Biden. 46% also said Trump is trying to \"encourage fighting,\" while 30% said Biden is.\n\nTwitter users took aim at Trump for comparing his coronavirus response to Winston Churchill telling Brits to \"keep calm and carry on\" during World War II. \"Churchill never said, 'We won't have to fight on the beaches, since the enemy threat will just go away,'\" tweeted Steve Benen, a producer for MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.\n\nThe Trump campaign has also been fundraising off the president's nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize - a distinction shared with 317 other people this year - for striking a deal between the United Arab Emirates and Israel. One Trump campaign Facebook ad even went as far as declaring \"President Trump achieved PEACE in the MIDDLE EAST!\" and misspelled the prize as the \"Noble Peace Prize.\"\n\nOne Community.

(Senate Television via AP)\n\n\"It is apparent that extremists of various different strifes and political persuasions pre-planned and premeditated an attack on the Capitol,\" Attorney Michael van der Veen said without evidence.\n\nThe claim came a day after Democrats rested their case that Trump incited the deadly Capitol insurrection last month, presenting evidence that supporters of the 45th president who attended believed they acted on his behalf.\n\nVan der Veen falsely claimed one of the first people arrested was \"a leader of antifa,'' the loosely organized network of antifascism activists.\n\nThe FBI said last month there is \"no indication\" that antifa was involved with the insurrection, which led to at least five deaths and hundreds of reported injuries.\n\nVan der Veen's claim that an antifa leader was arrested seemed to be a reference to the Utah activist John Earle Sullivan, who was arrested for civil disorder, unlawful entry and disorderly conduct at the Capitol insurrection. Sullivan has past ties to Black Lives Matter - whose leaders have disavowed him following the arrest - but has denied connections to antifa, Trump supporters or any political group.\n\n50%.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nClashes in Portland, Oregon between far-left antifa activists and the Proud Boys , a far-right group, descended into violence on Sunday, August 22, following separate protests by both groups.\n\nAntifa is shorthand for anti-fascists, and as a group with no central leadership, is a general description for the far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events.\n\nSunday's events marked the latest of a series of violent confrontations between both groups in recent years, most prominently in Oregon, Washington and New York.\n\nPortland has been a center for clashes among the opposing groups in the past year as protests raged across the nation following the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, 2020.\n\nSunday's demonstrations took place on the anniversary of a clash that became violent between right- and left-wing protesters in Portland following Floyd's death.\n\nHere we take a closer look at both groups and their history.\n\nThe term \"antifa\" is short for \"antifascist\" and followers of the movement are focused on going against the view of those they deem fascist or white supremicist.\n\nIt is a decentralized movement whose ideologies are based on various left-wing causes, including communism, anarchism, and socialism.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service (CRS) of the U.S. Congress reported in 2018: \"Adherents do not necessarily just hold these opinions, however. Among many other things, they may also support environmentalism, the rights of indigenous populations, and gay rights.\"\n\nThe roots of the antifa movement can be traced back to a period just after World War I when German and Italian leftists came together and fought against fascist gangs, a June 2021 article published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) explains.\n\nThe 2018 CRS report said antiracist groups in the U.S., such as Anti-Racist Action (ARA), that took up antifa ideology in the late 1980s \"embraced the international movement's provocative and occasionally criminal-even violent-tactics.\n\n\"A portion of antifa movement members are willing to commit crimes to promote their beliefs,\" the CRS report added.\n\nThe CSIS article from June 2021 explains that while many followers of the antifa movement do not support violence as the only or even main medium for opposing fascism, \"they do view violence as a legitimate option.\"\n\nThe antifa movement in the U.S. became more prominent after violent clashes between white supremacists and their opponents in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 12, 2017.\n\nThe antifa movement saw increased national attention after a tweet on May 31, 2020 by former president Donald Trump said: \"The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.\"\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney General William Barr issued a statement at the time that read: \"Legitimate protests have been hijacked by violent radical elements...the violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"\n\nHowever in September 2020, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ), Christopher Wray, said that while antifa activists were a serious concern, noting it was a \"real thing,\" he clarified it is \"not a group or an organization. It's a movement or an ideology,\" the Associated Press reported at the time.\n\nAccording to a January 2021 report from the U.S. Department of Justice , the Proud Boys are a \"nationalist organization.\"\n\nThey are self-described as a \"pro-Western fraternal organization for men who refuse to apologize for creating the modern world; aka Western Chauvinists,\" the report said.\n\nThe 2021 report, which indicted two Proud Boys members for conspiracy and other charges related to the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, explained that members of the group are often seen wearing the colors yellow and black and other clothing bearing Proud Boys-related logos and emblems.\n\nOthers associated with the Proud Boys have been charged in connection with the Capitol riot since late January, including in February and in March this year.\n\nThe Proud Boys were established in 2016 by Gavin McInnes, the Canadian-British co-founder of Vice Media. McInnes left Vice in 2008 and has had no involvement with the publication since, according to Vice. In 2018, he stepped down from his role as the leader of the Proud Boys following the advice of his legal team, the BBC reported in September 2020.\n\nAccordig to the BBC, the group's name is a reference to a song from the musical version of Aladdin, the Disney animation film.\n\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a nonprofit civil rights advocacy group, members of the Proud Boys \"regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists.\"\n\nThe SPLC claims the Proud Boys are known for \"anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric\" and have \"appeared alongside other hate groups at extremist gatherings.\"\n\nThe group has been banned from several major social media platforms including Facebook , Instagram , Twitter and YouTube.\n\nIn February 2021, the Proud Boys were classified as a terrorist entity by the Canadian government, noting the role the group played in the U.S. Capitol riot in January 2021.\n\nThe AP reported at the time that authorities in Canada were reported to have been monitoring and collecting evidence about the Proud Boys before the January riot and the event provided information that aided their decision to list the organization as a terrorist group.\n\nCanada's Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said at the time: \"Their intent and their escalation toward violence became quite clear.\"\n\nCalling the terrorist designation \"ridiculous,\" Enrique Tarrio, the chairman of Proud Boys, told the AP in February 2021: \"There is no basis for it. It's [an] infringement of free speech rights. All the Canadian Proud Boys have ever done is go to rallies. They used what happened at the Capitol to push for this.\"\n\nSoo Kim is a Newsweek reporter based in London, U.K. She covers various lifestyle stories, specializing in travel , health , home/interior design and property/real estate .

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nGeorgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene 's resolution calling for the Antifa movement to be designated as a \" terrorist organization \" has been sharply criticized by a number of counter-terrorism and counter-extremism experts.\n\nThe House Republican introduced the proposal to Congress on Tuesday, arguing: \"Antifa has been terrorizing Americans for years, and it's time to end the lawlessness.\"\n\nGreene's proposal comes at a time of intense debate in the United States about political extremism, with both Republicans and Democrats attempting to link opponents to groups or movements that use violence to achieve political goals.\n\nOn Sunday, police in Atlanta made 35 arrests after \"violent agitators\" attacked a law enforcement training facility in the city, lighting multiple fires. The same complex was also attacked in January , with Atlanta police telling Newsweek domestic terrorism charges would be filed.\n\nGreene explicitly referenced Sunday's Atlanta violence in support of her bill, commenting: \"Last weekend, Antifa rioters firebombed the future police training facility in Atlanta.\"\n\nDonald Trump pledged to declare Antifa a terrorist group in 2020 as president, while House Republican Lauren Boebert introduced a bill to this effect in 2021, though it failed to pass the chamber.\n\nHowever, a number of experts told Newsweek Antifa, short for \"anti-fascism,\" is more of a loose network than a coherent organization.\n\n\"Claims such as that by Rep. Greene are political, not substantive. By most accounts, Antifa is a network or movement of loosely affiliated activists, not an organization as such. Those describing it as 'terrorist' tend to use that label pejoratively,\" Peter Romaniuk, the director of the Center on Terrorism at the City University of New York, said.\n\n\"Antifa is not an organization (in any logical definition of the term). There is no way to accurately designate it as a 'terrorist organization,'\" Professor James J.F. Forest, a University of Massachusetts academic who also edits the Perspectives on Terrorism journal, told Newsweek .\n\n\"This resolution is yet another political scam meant to appeal to specific voters, an attempt to highlight the threat of violence from the extreme far left, in order to try and deflect attention from the threat of violence from the extreme far right...the extreme far left is presently disorganized and leaderless, punctuated by largely ad-hoc protests that sometimes devolve into brief spasms of violence,\" he said.\n\nA number of the academics argued the proposal is inoperable because there is currently no means of designating a domestic political organization, as opposed to an overseas one, as a terrorist group in the United States.\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek , Tricia Bacon, an associate professor at American University who has written a number of books on terrorism, explained: \"This proposal is a non-starter because there is no legal basis to 'designate' a domestic organization. The very first legal criteria evaluated to determine whether a given organization can be formally designated is that it needs to be a foreign organization.\n\n\"In this case, one could debate whether Antifa meets the criteria for an organization, given its lack of structure,\" she said. \"But it is unambiguous that it is a domestic entity, which means that it cannot be formally designated as a terrorist organization in the United States. There is no legal mechanism in the U.S. to designate a domestic terrorist organization, only a foreign terrorist organization.\"\n\nProfessor Audrey Kurth Cronin, an expert in international security at Carnegie Mellon University, made a similar point.\n\n\"There is no legal mechanism for designating a US-based domestic group as 'terrorist.' There are many mechanisms for labeling foreign groups and actors but none for US domestic groups,\" Cronin told Newsweek .\n\n\"Antifa is a loose movement that has no leader, no hierarchical structure and an unknown number of members. Without proving that Antifa is 1) a discreet group; and 2) primarily located outside the United States, there is no U.S. legal tool that can be used to 'designate' it.\"\n\nProfessor Joseph Young, an expert in political violence at Washington D.C.'s American University, agreed, telling Newsweek that the U.S. has a \"Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list\" but not a domestic one.\n\nMore generally, Young said Antifa is \"only loosely connected with a handful\" of recorded terrorist attacks around the world, \"suggesting they are not a major threat.\" He added, though, that law enforcement is right to take note of \"any group that uses violence in our democracy.\"\n\nJeffrey Lewis, who teaches the \"Terror and Terrorism\" course at Ohio State University, told Newsweek technological developments have made it easier for individuals to associate themselves with an extremist movement without having to be directly involved, leading to looser organizations.\n\n\"The impact of electronic communications/social media on political violence is forcing us to rethink basic ideas about what really differentiates an organization from a movement,\" he said. \"Now people can immerse themselves in the ideology of a movement vicariously, from a distance, whereas in the past such an immersion would typically have taken place in a more real, physical environment. It would have been people getting together and so seen as an actual organization.\n\n\"Now that virtual communities and movements have become so powerful and compelling, the difference between formal organization and informal movement has blurred quite a bit, for the left, right, and for Islamic militants as well.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Marjorie Taylor Greene via phone for comment.\n\nJames Bickerton is a Newsweek U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is on covering news and politics in Texas, as well as other general news across the United States.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSome political commentators have predicted that a Joe Biden presidency would spell the end of Antifa and its riots.\n\n\"Notice, there are no post-election riots because the media have declared Biden the next president, and Biden declares himself president,\" tweeted conservative commentator Mark Levin . \"So, most of the looters, arsonists, rioters were, in fact, pro-Biden voters.\"\n\nComments like these reflect a widespread misunderstanding about Antifa. Antifa is not made up of supporters of the Democratic Party, even if it shares a hatred of the Donald Trump administration. It is a movement of anarchist-communist individuals, organizations and networks that seek the abolishment of the United States itself. That means no Republicans-or Democrats.\n\nTo see what Antifa has done and what it's likely to do under a Biden administration, just look to Portland-the epicenter of American Antifa militancy.\n\nFrom May through October this year, Antifa and far-left extremists carried out more than 125 days of violent protests and riots. National media focused on the riots in July when thousands of protesters tried to tear down the barrier protecting the downtown federal courthouse. Some of them tried to burn down the whole facility. The Portland mayor, Oregon governor and other Democrats blamed the Trump administration. But like Levin, they were wrong to believe that Antifa has a partisan agenda.\n\nAs soon as federal officers withdrew at the beginning of August, Antifa simply moved its riots to other parts of the city-areas inhabited by residents. In the months after, the rioters have tried to burn down police stations and have vandalized dozens of businesses and homes. But since Election Day, not only have they not ceased their violence, they've stepped up their attacks on smaller targets to avoid arrests.\n\nOn Nov. 4, the day after the election, they gathered in the hundreds downtown and held a large banner declaring: \"WE DON'T WANT BIDEN-WE WANT REVENGE!\" The marauders marched through a business district where they smashed windows one by one using hammers. Nothing in their path was spared. A church that provided support services to Portland's homeless shut down its charity work due to severe damage to its building exterior. Gov. Kate Brown activated the National Guard for the first time to clamp down on the mass violence that night.\n\nBut it was just getting started. The day after, a mob of Antifa rioters gathered at the home of Portland city commissioner Dan Ryan and vandalized it as punishment for being the swing vote against a city council proposal to defund police.\n\nOn Nov. 8, another Antifa mob destroyed the exterior of the Multnomah County Democrats' headquarters using melee tools in a late-night riot. They spray-painted \"F- BIDEN\" on the building to top it off.\n\nFour days later, several dozen Antifa members secretly marched in the middle of the night to the offices of the Rapid Response Bio Clean, a business contracted with the city to clean and remove homeless encampments. There, they disabled the security cameras and smashed out the glass windows.\n\nAnd just last Friday, in an evolution of riot tactics, Antifa publicly announced a downtown \"direct action\" via social media flyers. But this was a trick. The event was a decoy to fool police into responding to the wrong place while the main group of 100 Antifa members smashed out and vandalized more than two dozen businesses in northeast Portland. Police made no arrests.\n\nAntifa's activities in Portland show that not only is the group still a force to be reckoned with post-Election Day, but it's also improving its organizing to evade arrest. The goal of the riots is the same today as it was before: drain public resources and make economic recovery after COVID-19 impossible for the public. Some signs show it is working. Businesses that didn't already shutter earlier this year continue to suffer routine damage costing thousands to repair each time. All the while, the entire state of Oregon has now gone under a new set of lockdown restrictions. Moribund businesses will meet their end.\n\nBiden infamously said in the first presidential debate in September that Antifa is an \"idea.\" He is right, but Antifa also organizes and carries out violence based on that idea. And it views him, Kamala Harris and the state as its primary enemies now that Donald Trump will soon be out of the way.\n\nAndy Ngo is the author of the upcoming Unmasked: Inside Antifa's Radical Plan to Destroy Democracy .\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump spent much of the year blaming \"antifa\" for the violent unrest that erupted in some cities across the U.S. in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nDespite many noting that antifa-short for anti-fascists-is not a formal organization, but rather an umbrella term for a number of left-leaning militant groups that oppose or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists, the president vowed to declare it a terrorist organization.\n\nThat looks unlikely now with Trump losing the election to Joe Biden , the Democratic candidate who in the first presidential debate dismissed the threat of the movement and said, \"His own FBI director said...antifa is an idea, not an organization,\" referring to FBI Director Chris Wray.\n\nThe movement came to prominence under Trump's presidency, but will it continue to protest with Biden in office?\n\nArie Perliger, a professor of security studies at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, told Newsweek that because antifa is \"basically a collection of local groups, it doesn't have any kind of coordinating mechanism that can make these kind of collective decisions.\"\n\nBut he doesn't believe antifa will disappear when Trump leaves office.\n\n\"I think it will focus more on how they can really promote their objectives, their goals, in this new political environment, which is more accommodating to their goals, to their ideas, that is more open to hear their voices and their views,\" Perliger said.\n\nAndy Zee, of Refuse Fascism, a group that describes the Trump administration as fascist, told Newsweek that the \"fascist movement that metastasized around Trump will not go away\" with Biden in office.\n\n\"In one form or another, that will need to be fought, but the defeat of Trump will put everyone who desires social and environmental justice and all progressive social movements in a potentially stronger position,\" Zee said.\n\nMark Bray, a historian and the author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook , told Newsweek that the history of such militant, anti-fascist politics in the U.S. has existed for several decades and will continue regardless of who is in power.\n\nBut he adds that antifa's importance in national politics \"has been greatly overstated by Trump for political purposes.\"\n\n\"There were groups, not always calling themselves antifa, but there were groups doing this kind of work of opposing the far right when George Bush was in office, when Bill Clinton was in office, when George W. Bush was in office, when Obama was in office and with Trump in office, so it's a politics that's going to continue,\" Bray said.\n\n\"It's a politics that responds to the threat of the far right, whether that threat has access to the White House or not.\"\n\nBut he noted that the number of antifa groups in the U.S., and their membership, has \"everything to do with the rise and fall of far-right politics.\"\n\nBray said there was a decline in anti-fascist activity in the early 2000s, but this changed when the so-called alt-right began its attempt to establish a public presence and when Trump started his first campaign for the presidency.\n\n\"So many of the antifa groups that I interviewed for my book formed in 2015, 2016 and 2017 in response to this perceived new threat,\" Bray said. \"So although antifa as a politics and as a movement continues regardless of who's in office, the changes in far-right politics have a very big role in determining how many groups, how many people participate in these groups and what the anti-fascist resistance is like.\"\n\nWith Biden in power, the far right certainly will have less of an influence on national politics, Bray said.\n\n\"But Trumpism as a kind of phenomenon won't disappear,\" he added. \"Plenty of other politicians will attempt to capitalize upon his legacy by promoting those kinds of ideas or politics at a local or state level.\n\n\"The kinds of far-right groups that have been emboldened by Trump will continue to exist, and in some cases, may even become more dangerous as they may give up hope in the ability of their desired essentially fascist ethno-state to exist within the framework of the United States,\" he said. \"And so what anti-fascism looks like in that context will have everything to do with what the right does in response.\n\n\"It's not so much a question of what antifa would do without asking what the right would do and how they would respond, because in general, the politics of antifa groups is a politics in response to far-right mobilization and activism.\"\n\nPerliger and Bray are concerned that far-right violence could erupt in the U.S. following Biden's victory because of Trump repeatedly casting doubt on the integrity of the election process. If that occurs, it could draw a response from anti-fascists, they said.\n\n\"If that happens, I don't think that antifa and other leftist groups will disappear from the streets,\" Perliger said. \"The opposite, because of their victory in the election, they'll feel empowered, they'll feel that they have now more legitimacy.\"\n\nIf Trump refuses to accept the results of the election and protesters take to the streets in opposition, Bray said he wouldn't be surprised if \"the far right feels emboldened to attack them with cars, possibly with guns, possibly in other ways, particularly in areas of the country where we've seen significant far-right activity.\n\n\"Those kinds of conflict could potentially involve anti-fascists, they may not.\"\n\nPerliger said antifa in recent years was motivated by its animosity toward Trump and his administration's policies, such as the widely condemned family separation policy and \"complete unwillingness\" to tackle police brutality.\n\nWith Trump gone, Perliger believes anti-fascists will start merging with other left-leaning groups.\n\n\"I think that what the movement may try to do is to move into a less contentious track,\" he said.\n\n\"Less of a movement that is focusing on countering far-right activity but more focusing on trying to influence the policies of Biden's administration. I think in this sense, there's also a good chance that antifa eventually will merge with other left-wing organizations to focus mainly on trying to pressure the Biden administration to adopt progressive policies and to promote different types of reforms.\"\n\nBray agreed.\n\nThe U.S. is getting to the point where the struggle between an emboldened far right and the left in general is \"taking on such a scale that the role of explicitly antifa groups is becoming less and less important, as the struggle gets bigger and bigger,\" he said.\n\n\"They will likely be involved in pushing back against any kind of far-right activity during the election. But increasingly as time goes on, I think it'll be a broader question that will impact Black Lives Matter, the left and other kinds of groups more broadly.\"\n\nBray also said that support for the kind of politics backed by Trump and the far right are becoming less popular as the demographics of the U.S. continue to shift.\n\n\"It's becoming less white, less Christian and more in favor of queer and trans rights. Clearly over the coming generations, (the far right) is going to be losing the culture war that is so central to what its politics are about.\n\n\"I think the question is, 'What the kind of danger is there of a far right that is increasingly more convinced that they are being victimized and in their own language, the victims of white genocide, in a country with a lot of guns?' How will they respond to that?\"\n\nKhaleda Rahman is Newsweek's National Correspondent based in London, UK. Her focus is reporting on education and national news.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nAnti-fascist-or \"Antifa\"-chapters around the U.S. are concerned about the push for new domestic terrorism legislation that may include them, but say they remain committed to violent opposition to far-right groups and police regardless.\n\nAntifa activists are determined to continue their activities even if the threat of a terror designation becomes reality, and predict more upheaval and violence this year amid America's divided social landscape and fears of rising extremism.\n\nThe recent political violence has prompted lawmakers to propose domestic terrorism laws targeting those involved. Though the main drivers of this looming crackdown are groups on the far right, it may also sweep up leftists routinely engaging in violence.\n\nNewsweek spoke with members of three Antifa chapters-one in Atlanta, Georgia; one in Corvallis, Oregon; and one in Portland, Oregon-who were worried about being branded terrorists if new legislation is introduced.\n\nBut all were clear they would continue their activities-with or without a terror designation. None wished to be named, citing concerns about their security.\n\n\"We're going to continue doing what we're doing,\" the Corvallis member told Newsweek . \"Whenever the state affords more powers to law enforcement and police, it almost always comes down the hardest on Black and Brown people.\"\n\nThey continued: \"The biggest misconception is that we're hyper-militant, well-funded, super-soldiers who want to kill every god-fearing white American. This is the perspective a lot of mainstream right-wing journalism seeks to perpetuate and it's patently false.\"\n\nOne Atlanta activist said: \"The left, in general, has plenty of experience in organizing despite repression.\" Another added: \"There are anti-fascists who are already in prison simply for defending themselves and their communities.\"\n\nNewsweek spoke with two members of the Atlanta Antifascists, a group operating since 2016. Neither wished to be named publicly and declined to say how large their group was.\n\nVideos and pictures posted on the group's social media accounts show between 10 and 15 people arranged behind anti-fascist banners. The chapter has more than 21,000 Twitter followers.\n\nNewsweek also spoke with a representative of the Corvallis Against Fascism group from Oregon, which formed in 2018, and a member of Portland's Rose City Antifa, which has been operating since 2007 and has less than 50 dedicated members.\n\nThe former group has more than 4,600 followers on Twitter, and the latter more than 46,000.\n\nThe three chapters claimed leftist groups are already more harshly treated under existing legislation than far-right actors. \"It seems possible that 'anti-terror' legislation could build upon the repression anti-fascists and the left already face,\" one Atlanta activist said.\n\nOne Portland activist said: \"Anybody who spent any amount of time dealing with state repression on radical groups knows that when laws like that are passed, it's really a matter of time\" before it is turned on leftists more broadly.\n\n\"If their priority is still quashing left organizing, they're going to use whatever laws you make to crush left organizing,\" they added.\n\nContrary to suggestions by leading figures on the right, including former President Donald Trump , Antifa is not a coherent, centralized organization.\n\nIt is made up of loosely connected local chapters that share information and coordinate with one another. There is no central authority nor set guiding ideology aside from confrontation-often violent-of groups and individuals considered fascists. Anarchism is prevalent, as are various strains of socialism and communism.\n\nAntifa groups have always openly used violence and property damage, arguing that these are necessary tools to quell dangerous fascist groups that seek the repression and extermination of minorities and political opponents.\n\nBut Antifa's critics cite the violence as proof of wanton criminality and even terrorism among far-left activists, justifying what they say is a long-due crackdown. Politicians including Trump have pushed to designate Antifa groups as terrorist organizations.\n\n\"I've talked to every police chief in every city where there has been major violence and they all have identified Antifa as the ramrod for the violence,\" Trump's former attorney general Bill Barr told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer in September.\n\n\"They are flying around the country. We know people who are flying around the country...We see some of the purchases they are making before the riots of weapons to use in those riots. So, we are following them.\"\n\nSuch a move, however, faces practical difficulties in its enforcement because of Antifa's decentralized nature, lack of clear leaders, and it does not have known bank accounts, assets, or infrastructure.\n\nAdherents are not card-carrying members of Antifa organizations, and it is extremely difficult to establish the true size of these groups. All of these problems could make life harder for terror prosecutors.\n\nAntifa could in theory be designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO)-the designation used against Islamist groups such as Al-Qaeda , which has itself become decentralized over the past few years-given anti-fascist organizing's international history and links.\n\nThis designation has been used to prosecute Americans who are not clear members of an FTO but demonstrably align with their ideology.\n\nBut according to an article by Heather Williams, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation think tank: \"Designating a largely domestic organization as an FTO would likely invite legal challenge. The U.S. legal counterterrorism framework is fragile, and it has been successfully challenged before...\n\n\"Terrorism laws give intelligence and law enforcement authorities access to a suite of surveillance tools they would not have otherwise.\n\n\"They also make certain actions that would otherwise be protected speech or assembly illegal; doing so could have significant short- and long-term political implications that we do not understand. This alone would justify concerns about their potential for abuse.\"\n\nWilliams concluded: \" Designating Antifa may be intended to be a discrete act, but the precedent it would set could bring major strategic changes to how the United States uses counterterrorism laws, with uncertainties about whether those changes better serve national security.\"\n\nIt also risks inflaming political divisions. Designating Antifa as terrorists would \"pave the way to criminalizing and delegitimizing all politics to the left of Joe Biden,\" argued political historian Mark Bray, who wrote a book on Antifa, in The Washington Post .\n\nAntifa has become something of a bogeyman, seen as a malign hand behind many societal ills, its prominence and threat often exaggerated. Polls show that many Republican voters have internalized the supposed scale of the threat.\n\nRight-wing figures blamed Antifa activists for the violence associated with the Black Lives Matter protests, though an Associated Press review of thousands of court documents suggested they were not responsible for most of it.\n\nLast year, then-attorney general Barr declared that \"the violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"\n\nIn September, The New York Times reported that Barr pushed prosecutors to charge protesters with sedition.\n\nSome on the right, including in Congress , have even tried to blame Antifa for the storming of the U.S. Capitol by a Trump-supporting far-right mob on January 6 .\n\nTrump's \"Platinum Plan\" unveiled in October vowed to prosecute Antifa activists as terrorists along with the Ku Klux Klan. The president had branded anti-fascists as terrorists during the summer's unrest, and later described them as a \"very bad group.\"\n\nA report on the domestic security threat by the Department of Homeland Security in October last year, when Trump was still in office, noted the bubbling \"anti-government/anti-authority violent extremism\" in the U.S.\n\n\"These violent extremists, sometimes influenced by anarchist ideology, have been associated with multiple plots and attacks, which included a significant uptick in violence against law enforcement and government symbols in 2020,\" the report said.\n\n\"These violent extremists are increasingly taking advantage of large protest crowds to conduct violence against government officials, facilities, and counter-protestors.\"\n\nBut the DHS was clear about the source of the biggest security threat: White supremacists. It described them as \"the most persistent and lethal threat in the Homeland\" among domestic violent extremists.\n\nThis is one of the reasons Antifa groups organize in secret-they are, inevitably, a target of the far-right. \"We are careful about security,\" one activist said.\n\n\"The Base plotted to murder a couple they believed, incorrectly, were members of our group,\" they added, referring to a notable neo-Nazi group. \"We take these threats seriously.\"\n\n\"We're already semi-underground and likely to stay that way,\" another added. \"It's not just a matter of personal safety; the far-right goes after families as well.\"\n\nThe Portland activist added: \"We've just gone through four years of the Trump administration. So I think we're about as paranoid and careful as you can get.\"\n\nAll were relatively unconcerned about local police. \"Cops are dumb,\" said a Corvallis activist. Others noted reports of local police departments adopting right-wing propaganda and conspiracy theories to inform their own intelligence-gathering operations.\n\nIn 2018, for example, a public records request by Unicorn Riot, a leftist nonprofit media outlet, uncovered internal emails from Georgia's Coweta County Sheriff's Office that featured disinformation spread by neo-Nazis on Facebook .\n\nThe Facebook post shared among officers included false reports of damage done by supposedly armed anti-fascists. They shared the post by email while preparing to police a rally by the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement.\n\nIn another instance, a public records request by Willamette Week revealed Portland Police were communicating with far-right organizer Joey Gibson regarding events involving his Patriot Prayer group in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nPortland Police Lieutenant Jeff Niiya exchanged friendly texts with Gibson and even told him where leftist protests were being held. Niiya was later cleared of misconduct after an investigation by city officials.\n\nThe activists defended their use of violence and property damage , arguing it is a response to far-right and police violence. They also believe it is more effective at making protestors heard than being peaceful.\n\n\"In an era where police frequently murder Black people with impunity, we don't care too much about the concern trolling of centrist commentators,\" the Corvallis activist said.\n\n\"A few panes of broken glass should not generate more outrage than Black men being murdered.\"\n\nAs for violence against the far-right, the Portland activist framed it as \"community defense.\" Fighting police, too, is justified they argued because it is seen as a response to law enforcement violence.\n\n\"Police here beat the crap out of people in the middle of the street on a fairly regular basis,\" they said.\n\nBystanders are sometimes caught up in the chaos of violent protests. Not all damaged properties belong to large corporations or police departments, for example; some are owned by small businesses just trying to eke out a living.\n\nEven in those that are corporate-owned, it is the ordinary workers, not the executives, who have to clear up the mess left behind.\n\nAntifa activists are usually present on the fringes of larger events, such as the Black Lives Matter protests. But the nebulous nature of Antifa makes it tricky to definitively assign blame for specific incidents to individual actors or chapters who are associated.\n\nThere were many reports of damage to small businesses during last year's racial justice protests, whether from arson, looting, or other acts of violence, which occurred on the edges of the mostly peaceful marches.\n\nIn New York City, the Department of Small Business Services said at least 450 businesses were damaged by looting and vandalism in late May and early June.\n\nAnd in Minneapolis, the epicenter of the racial justice protests last year after George Floyd 's murder by a police officer, almost 1,500 businesses were badly damaged in riots, forcing some buildings to be demolished entirely.\n\nThe Rose City activist defended the damage as an expression of grief and injustice: \"While it is at times sad, especially if it's somebody who supports the movement, it's also sad that like Black people are dying and being shot by police. It's a sad situation overall.\"\n\nAntifa chapters are ideological umbrellas for a range of leftists, though anarchism is \"definitely influential,\" according to a member of the Atlanta group. One thing is certain: Very few, if any, are liberals or Democrats.\n\nAccording to members of the three Antifa chapters, President Joe Biden 's victory offers little hope for those committed to fighting and silencing far-right actors in the U.S.\n\nAll framed the Democrats as a fresh face on toxic American capitalism, imperialism, and inequality, and warned of more domestic turmoil in the coming year.\n\n\"I see the administration as simply an extension of the status quo which often enables authoritarianism and fascism (e.g. police repression) but will fight back against fascism if fascism threatens its material interests,\" one Atlanta activist said.\n\nAnti-fascism has its roots in early 20th century Europe, where leftists and community groups organized against rising fascist regimes in countries including Spain, Italy, and Germany.\n\nAmerican Antifa emerged in parallel, centered in European immigrant communities and labor movements.\n\nSince the end of World War Two, anti-fascist groups have continued to agitate against resurgent fascism and racism in Europe and the U.S., for example organizing against neo-Nazi skinheads and armed racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe chapters that spoke with Newsweek are all part of the Torch Antifa Network, which was founded in 2013 and operates across the U.S. and in Canada.\n\nAll the activists that spoke with Newsweek scoffed at claims that Antifa is linked to the Democratic Party or the Biden-Harris administration. \"The right-wing scapegoating doesn't have any reference to reality,\" one Atlanta activist said.\n\n\"It's interesting to examine the history of how the right wing scapegoats their enemies using conspiracy theories because the pattern is very common over the past century or so. We are a decentralized group and we don't work for or with the DNC.\"\n\nMany Antifa groups follow the \"Three-Way Fight\" philosophy, which puts them in conflict with both the state and the non-state far-right. Leftists were vehemently anti-Trump but saw him as the product of a corrupt system rather than its cause.\n\n\"The Trump administration was especially dangerous because it represented an accelerating alliance between the state and the non-state far right,\" one Atlanta activist said. \"Now we're back to a more fractured landscape.\"\n\n\"Biden is not going to be an anti-fascist president,\" said another.\n\n\"But it's less about him as a person and more about the presidency itself being part of a system that ends up structurally enabling fascism to some degree no matter what individual politicians are plugged into it.\"\n\n\"Our actions are not coordinated or funded by anyone but ourselves,\" said the Corvallis chapter member.\n\n\"The Democrats are not funding anti-fascist groups. In fact, we oppose the Dems and other liberal institutions because they exist to perpetuate capitalism and imperialism.\"\n\nThe activist called efforts to tie Antifa to the Democrats a ploy to rile up voters and undermine the idea of independent community organizing: \"We don't get paid for this.\"\n\nActivists also batted away claims they had organized or directed Black Lives Matter protests around the country over the past year, calling it a \"persistent myth\" and adding: \"They're simply organic community responses to racist police violence.\"\n\nThe Corvallis member said: \"Most of the folks out there are poor and working-class kids who just give a fuck. There isn't any motivation other than love for our neighbors and a desire for a more just society.\"\n\nThe Rose City activist added: \"There is no [George] Soros money, it's just us when we don't have work.\"\n\nAll three groups vowed to continue their opposition to far-right groups around the country, including by violent means.\n\nAmerica's far-right is regrouping after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, trying to navigate increased scrutiny, public opposition, and-for some-criminal charges.\n\nGroups like the Proud Boys , Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, and others are still recruiting, training and marching. Yet the much-promoted \" white lives matter \" rallies scheduled for April 11 largely failed to materialize.\n\nAnti-fascist groups infiltrated several social media channels for far-right organizing to undermine the planned events, while leftists and community groups turned out in force to face down far-right activists who did show up in person.\n\n\"It was very poorly organized on the national level, so that made our job easier,\" one Atlanta anti-fascist said of the \"white lives matter\" marches.\n\n\"It is good to see that in most places nationally where white nationalists showed up, they got outnumbered and humiliated.\"\n\nStill, experts and police have told Newsweek that this summer could see a reinvigorated far-right , one using more sophisticated and extreme tactics while even forging alliances and cooperation between groups.\n\n\"What we are noticing here is that the far-right is re-composing after January 6 and repression,\" one Atlanta anti-fascist said. \"But they are forming new alliances, and will likely be back on the streets soon enough. Their confidence and organization has suffered, though.\"\n\n\"These groups probably won't hold big open events for at least several more years, but they'll be busy recruiting and propagandizing,\" said another Atlanta chapter member.\n\n\"They're in a holding pattern where they're waiting for some kind of disruptive cultural or political moment that works in their favor (such as the Trump campaign in 2016) to come along so they can take advantage of it and use it for cover.\n\n\"These movements operate in cycles, like horrible cicadas.\"\n\nIn Atlanta, anti-fascists are keeping an eye on the Three Percenters and watching for resurgent neo-Nazi accelerationist groups like The Base and Atomwaffen Division.\n\nIn the Pacific Northwest, anti-fascists are expecting far-right organizing and rallies \"through the summer,\" though the Corvallis chapter has seen a \"significant decline\" in recent activity.\n\n\"That doesn't mean they're not going to try to rally though, and wherever they go, they will be met by people who oppose them.\"\n\nActivists in Corvallis are particularly concerned about the Proud Boys , despite the group's recent internal conflict. \"Many have embraced more extreme, openly fascist, aesthetic and ideology in the last few months,\" they said.\n\nAll activists who spoke to Newsweek accused law enforcement of collusion with the far-right. There has been a steady stream of law enforcement employees disciplined or fired for involvement with or sympathy for far-right organizations.\n\nIn October, a Chicago police officer was investigated for wearing a Three Percenter face mask while policing a protest.\n\nA Michigan officer was fired in 2019 after a KKK application form was found in his home, and the same year a Connecticut officer admitted he had been a member of the Proud Boys before leaving the group out of fear of leftist attacks.\n\n\"The abolitionist left is much more of a political threat to the police than the right are, because we'd like to defund and/or abolish their repressive institutions,\" one Atlanta activist said.\n\nAnother Atlanta activist said: \"In Georgia, up to the 1960s the KKK and the police were completely synonymous. Nowadays it's still an overlapping Venn diagram, especially in the more rural areas. We've doxxed KKK sympathizer cops and Nazi jailers.\"\n\nEven after January 6 and with increasing concerns about domestic terrorism, the activist believes the \"unequal treatment will still continue because police culture is inherently repressive and nearly impervious to reform from above or below.\"\n\n\"Whenever far-right groups challenge the police/state monopoly on violence, they will invoke a strong defensive reaction and be put down, but will otherwise be ignored or handled with kid gloves,\" they said.\n\nBut the Corvallis activist noted fault lines opening between the far-right and police.\n\n\"Right now one of the biggest dividing points in the far-right is whether or not to 'back the blue',\" they said. \"This fight started in Oregon about a month before January 6 when fascists here broke into our state Capitol and got maced for the first time in their lives.\"\n\nContinued violence between the left and right is near-guaranteed. Police often frame both sides as equal threats, though data shows the far-right is far deadlier and more disruptive than their opponents on the left.\n\nThere has been only one deadly anti-fascist incident in the last 25 years-a 2020 shooting of a far-right activist in Portland by a self-described anti-fascist-according to a Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report from October.\n\nThere have been 21 killings since 2010 attributed to the broader \"far-left.\"\n\nFar-right actors, meanwhile, have been responsible for 329 deaths since 1994. CSIS said the far-right had been responsible for 41 politically motivated attacks and plots in the year up to October 2020, versus 12 among the far-left.\n\nThese far-right groups are traditionally well-armed and make a point of marching with body armor and long guns in a show of strength.\n\nThe leftist activists were hesitant to say whether they would be arming up too, though also said they see little benefit in an \"arms race\" with the far-right. \"Our strength is in broader-based organizing,\" one said.\n\n\"We're aware of the risks,\" an Atlanta activist said. \"I don't view it as a heroic stance, because if these people ever took over, they'd kill most of us anyway. It's about defense more than anything.\"\n\nCorrection 24/04/21, 1:18 p.m. This article was updated to note that neo-Nazi group The Base was not involved in the attempt to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nDavid Brennan is Newsweek's Diplomatic Correspondent covering world politics and conflicts from London with a focus on NATO, the European Union, and the Russia-Ukraine War.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA new poll has found that a majority of Republican voters still believe anti-fascist activists were responsible for the storming of the Capitol last week, despite clear statements from GOP leaders and law enforcement dispelling the conspiracy theory.\n\nAn Economist/YouGov poll published on Wednesday evening shows more than two-thirds of the Republicans surveyed blame anti-fascist activists-colloquially known as antifa-for the violence, which was actually perpetrated by Donald Trump supporters and conspiracy theorists seeking to overturn the result of November's presidential election.\n\nThe surveys were conducted using a nationally representative sample of 1,500 American adults interviewed online between January 10 and 12, just days after a mob breached the Capitol building. The poll's margin of error is around 3.6 percent.\n\nSixty-nine percent of Republicans surveyed said anti-fascist activists were involved in the Capitol takeover. Only nine percent said they were not, with the remaining 22 percent unsure.\n\nVoters are breaking with party grandees who have tried to douse the flames ahead of Trump's departure. \"Some say the riots were caused by antifa,\" House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy said on Wednesday . \"There is absolutely no evidence of that, and conservatives should be the first to say so.\"\n\nStill, some of the president's closest allies including Rep. Matt Gaetz , Rep. Mo Brooks and Rep. Louie Gohmert-as well as media figures such as Fox host Lou Dobbs-have propagated the conspiracy theory. It is at odds with the FBI , which said there was \"no indication\" of anti-fascist involvement in the Capitol rioting.\n\nThe Economist/YouGov poll indicates that even Republicans who do believe right-wing activists were to blame for the riots do not think those involved represent the president.\n\nSeventy-seven percent of Republican respondents said the rioters did not represent most Trump supporters. Forty-two percent of Republicans claimed they were peaceful, with 35 percent saying they were violent.\n\nDemocrats have predictably different opinions. Sixty-five percent of those surveyed said those who took over the Capitol did represent most Trump supporters and 84 percent saw the protesters as mostly violent.\n\nFifteen percent of the Democrats surveyed believed antifa activists were involved in the riot and takeover of the Capitol. Fifty-eight percent said they were not, with 26 percent unsure.\n\nAntifa has become a useful bogeyman for figures on the right, with Trump and others declaring it a terrorist organization and vowing to prosecute those who adhere to its ideology of violent resistance against fascism.\n\nDespite the efforts of Trump and other GOP politicians to claim otherwise, antifa is not a centralized organization. Rather, it is an ideology by which activists use violent methods to stop those they consider fascists. Antifa critics have blamed activists for murders, assaults and property damage, particularly during the summer's racial justice protests.\n\nAntifa advocates have responded to the criticism by pointing out that anti-fascist advocates have been implicated in one murder in the U.S. over the past 25 years, compared with at least 329 people killed by right-wing activists in the same period.\n\nThe first killing involving an antifa activist took place in Portland, Oregon, during clashes with far-right groups in August. Michael Reinoehl was accused of shooting dead Aaron Danielson, a supporter of the far-right Patriot Prayer group. Reinoehl was later shot dead by police in Lacey, Washington.\n\nDavid Brennan is Newsweek's Diplomatic Correspondent covering world politics and conflicts from London with a focus on NATO, the European Union, and the Russia-Ukraine War.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nAntifa has become famous for rioting in the streets and setting police cruisers on fire, but behind the scenes, the left-wing activist organization has done the unthinkable: establish political power in major American cities.\n\nThe media has long provided cover for Antifa, perpetuating the myth that \"Antifa is an idea, not an organization\" and playing the childish semantic game that \"Antifa only means standing against fascism.\" But the truth is that Antifa is not only real, but has advanced a sophisticated three-part strategy to move the country towards its political program of anarcho-socialism. The plan goes like this: First, create chaos at the national level through identity politics-fueled protests, riots and civil unrest. Second, quietly elect sympathetic officials to local councils in America's most progressive cities. And third, stamp out dissent through intimidation and build political power from the bottom up.\n\nAt this point, most Americans have come to understand Antifa's role in street demonstrations and violent protests. But Antifa has already advanced to the second stage of its strategic plan and established itself as a substantive political power in major American cities. As journalist Andy Ngo has reported, Antifa functions as the paramilitary wing of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), which has expanded to 70,000 dues-paying members nationwide and has won local council elections in cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and New York City. The members of the DSA and Antifa often overlap in local \"affinity groups\" and, last year, the DSA formalized its support for Antifa by voting to \"[institutionalize] the fight against fascism as an official DSA initiative,\" despite concerns from some members that it might \"cause negative legal and safety consequences for the DSA.\"\n\nIn recent months, as riots consumed dozens of American cities, some progressive political leaders have turned their support for Antifa from latent to explicit. In Minneapolis, City Councilman Jeremiah Ellison openly declared his allegiance to the \"anti-fascists,\" even as the group's rioters burned down entire blocks of his city and as President Donald Trump denounced the movement as a \"terrorist organization.\" In Seattle, City Councilwoman Teresa Mosqueda dressed up her newborn baby in an Antifa onesie and told followers on social media that you have to \"start 'em early\" in the world of radical political activism.\n\nEven more dangerously, some city councils have begun to implement the policy agenda of the DSA-Antifa alliance. Ellison and his associates on the Minneapolis City Council voted to \"abolish the police\" citywide, which they must know will enable the kind of Antifa-dominated street violence that has been seen in Portland, Oregon and, more recently , in Seattle's so-called \"Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.\"\n\nFor their part, Mosqueda and her Seattle City Council colleague Kshama Sawant rallied behind violent protestors and hailed Antifa's armed takeover of the six-block autonomous zone as a \"victory\" against \"the militarized police force of the political establishment and the capitalist state.\" Both have vowed to cut police funding by 50 percent and support a plan to redirect $100 million in city funding to \"community-based programs\"-which would doubtlessly include funding for some of the same activist organizations that are leading the current protests.\n\nWhat happens to citizens who resist the takeover of local politics by Antifa activists? Violence, threats and intimidation. In Portland, journalist Andy Ngo has been the victim of a years-long campaign to silence his reporting on Antifa. In the Seattle municipal elections last year, when conservative candidate Ari Hoffman ran against DSA candidate Tammy Morales, Antifa-affiliated activists sent death threats and posed as neo-Nazis on the website 8Chan to encourage a campaign of anti-Semitic intimidation against him. In response to my own reporting on left-wing politics, Antifa supporters have published my home address, followed my movements around the city and even posted threatening flyers around the school of my oldest child.\n\nUnless a higher authority steps in and federal law enforcement takes the threat of left-wing political violence as seriously as right-wing political violence, Antifa's malign influence will continue to expand. Be forewarned: As we have seen on a small scale with the \"Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,\" if the radical activists of the Left succeed in abolishing the police, prisons and courts, Antifa paramilitaries will be the last men standing-and they cannot be trusted.\n\nChristopher F.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, posted on July 25, 2023, viewed 283,000 times, shared another post juxtaposing photos captioned \"ANTIFA attacking police in Portland\" and \"ANTIFA attacking on J6.\"\n\nThe photo said to be from January 6 shows a person in a black helmet, holding a baton in what looked like a violent gesture. The opposite picture, from a protest in Portland, Oregon, shows a group of people wearing black helmets.\n\nGreene tweeted: \"Interesting how the DOJ hasn't spent their resources on prosecuting Antifa. Anyway. Try that in a small town..\"\n\nThe Facts\n\nThere have been numerous claims since January 6 that Antifa was a part of or infiltrated the crowd that stormed the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe FBI told reporters there had been \"no indication\" that Antifa was disguised among the crowd when asked two days after the riot about such theories.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray echoed that on March 2, 2021 , stating: \"We have not seen, to date, any evidence of anarchist violent extremist or people who subscribe to Antifa in connection with Jan. 6.\"\n\nSome claims have already been debunked. In 2021, CNN fact-checking journalists assessed claims by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and then Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), that Antifa had snuck in among Trump supporters; they found no evidence to support it.\n\nIn August last year, USA Today also investigated a video said to depict Antifa in the Capitol dressed as Trump supporters. The video, however, was unsubstantiated and journalists found no other evidence that left-wing sympathizers were part of the crowd.\n\nThe latest claim, which juxtaposes an image of a protest in Portland from June 29, 2019, with an individual photographed just outside the Capitol, creates the impression that Antifa followers may have been present on January 6.\n\nHowever, the person highlighted as Antifa does not appear to be part of that movement.\n\nThe photo was published as part of a collection available via Getty Images; these also show the person unobscured by their helmet and less obscured by the crowd.\n\nUnlike typical Antifa dress conventions, the person is not head-to-toe in black, instead wearing a camo overshirt under black shoulder pads, with wraparound orange visors.\n\nLooking closer, they can also be seen wearing a patch of Louisiana's official state motto \"Union, Justice and Confidence\", which is on the state's flag and seal. There appears to be no link between this symbol and symbols worn or adopted by Antifa associates.\n\nJanuary 6 blog Sedition Hunters , using video and film footage from the riot, was further able to identify the person without the helmet and visor. A photo of them remains on the FBI website among the list of people the bureau has requested information on.\n\nNewsweek contacted the FBI via email for comment. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia responded and told Newsweek that it \"cannot comment on ongoing investigations.\"\n\nSince the person has not yet been found, we cannot say with absolute certainty whether or not they had any Antifa sympathies.\n\nHowever, as we have mentioned, investigations have not stated that any of the more than 1,000 individuals arrested had links to Antifa.\n\nNewsweek has contacted a Marjorie Taylor Greene representative via email for comment.\n\nIn light of the testimony of security officials who have stated that there was no evidence Antifa was among the January 6 crowd, and no evidence or reasoning that the person in the photo shared on Twitter was associated with the left-wing movement, we can confidently conclude that the claim shared by Taylor Greene is false.\n\nA Department of Justice investigation into Trump's alleged involvement in the January 6 riots continues. Special Counsel Jack Smith this month sent a letter to Trump stating that he is a target of the investigation . Trump has maintained his innocence, accusing prosecutors of investigating him for political purposes.\n\nThe Ruling\n\nFalse.\n\nThe photo shared by Marjorie Taylor Greene via Twitter is not evidence that there was an Antifa follower in the crowd on January 6. Other images show the person unobstructed by their helmet, wearing a Louisiana state flag patch that is not associated with Antifa.\n\nThere is no other compelling evidence that suggests the person in the photo is associated with Antifa, (more the opposite), further supported by prior investigations that concluded Antifa followers were not present on January 6.\n\nFACT CHECK BY Newsweek's Fact Check team\n\nTom Norton is Newsweek's Fact Check reporter, based in London.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nInvestigators are still hunting for suspects seen at the January 6 Capitol attack two-and-a-half years ago, despite more than 1,000 arrests that include more than 350 people charged with \"assaulting or impeding law enforcement\".\n\nThe riot has become a fractious topic for many conservatives, some of whom have decried the manner in which those who entered the Capitol building have since been treated.\n\nThe riot began following a pro-Trump rally near the Capitol, with the crowd typically described as Trump-supporting.\n\nYet a recent tweet by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene , a Georgia Republican, suggested that an associate of the left-wing movement Antifa was also involved.\n\nThe Claim\n\nA tweet by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, posted on July 25, 2023, viewed 283,000 times, shared another post juxtaposing photos captioned \"ANTIFA attacking police in Portland\" and \"ANTIFA attacking on J6.\"\n\nThe photo said to be from January 6 shows a person in a black helmet, holding a baton in what looked like a violent gesture. The opposite picture, from a protest in Portland, Oregon, shows a group of people wearing black helmets.\n\nGreene tweeted: \"Interesting how the DOJ hasn't spent their resources on prosecuting Antifa. Anyway. Try that in a small town..\"\n\nThe Facts\n\nThere have been numerous claims since January 6 that Antifa was a part of or infiltrated the crowd that stormed the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe FBI told reporters there had been \"no indication\" that Antifa was disguised among the crowd when asked two days after the riot about such theories.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray echoed that on March 2, 2021 , stating: \"We have not seen, to date, any evidence of anarchist violent extremist or people who subscribe to Antifa in connection with Jan. 6.\"\n\nSome claims have already been debunked. In 2021, CNN fact-checking journalists assessed claims by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and then Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), that Antifa had snuck in among Trump supporters; they found no evidence to support it.\n\nIn August last year, USA Today also investigated a video said to depict Antifa in the Capitol dressed as Trump supporters. The video, however, was unsubstantiated and journalists found no other evidence that left-wing sympathizers were part of the crowd.\n\nThe latest claim, which juxtaposes an image of a protest in Portland from June 29, 2019, with an individual photographed just outside the Capitol, creates the impression that Antifa followers may have been present on January 6.\n\nHowever, the person highlighted as Antifa does not appear to be part of that movement.\n\nThe photo was published as part of a collection available via Getty Images; these also show the person unobscured by their helmet and less obscured by the crowd.\n\nUnlike typical Antifa dress conventions, the person is not head-to-toe in black, instead wearing a camo overshirt under black shoulder pads, with wraparound orange visors.\n\nLooking closer, they can also be seen wearing a patch of Louisiana's official state motto \"Union, Justice and Confidence\", which is on the state's flag and seal. There appears to be no link between this symbol and symbols worn or adopted by Antifa associates.\n\nJanuary 6 blog Sedition Hunters , using video and film footage from the riot, was further able to identify the person without the helmet and visor. A photo of them remains on the FBI website among the list of people the bureau has requested information on.\n\nNewsweek contacted the FBI via email for comment. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia responded and told Newsweek that it \"cannot comment on ongoing investigations.\"\n\nSince the person has not yet been found, we cannot say with absolute certainty whether or not they had any Antifa sympathies.\n\nHowever, as we have mentioned, investigations have not stated that any of the more than 1,000 individuals arrested had links to Antifa.\n\nNewsweek has contacted a Marjorie Taylor Greene representative via email for comment.\n\nIn light of the testimony of security officials who have stated that there was no evidence Antifa was among the January 6 crowd, and no evidence or reasoning that the person in the photo shared on Twitter was associated with the left-wing movement, we can confidently conclude that the claim shared by Taylor Greene is false.\n\nA Department of Justice investigation into Trump's alleged involvement in the January 6 riots continues. Special Counsel Jack Smith this month sent a letter to Trump stating that he is a target of the investigation . Trump has maintained his innocence, accusing prosecutors of investigating him for political purposes.\n\nThe Ruling\n\nFalse.\n\nThe photo shared by Marjorie Taylor Greene via Twitter is not evidence that there was an Antifa follower in the crowd on January 6. Other images show the person unobstructed by their helmet, wearing a Louisiana state flag patch that is not associated with Antifa.\n\nThere is no other compelling evidence that suggests the person in the photo is associated with Antifa, (more the opposite), further supported by prior investigations that concluded Antifa followers were not present on January 6.\n\nFACT CHECK BY Newsweek's Fact Check team\n\nTom Norton is Newsweek's Fact Check reporter, based in London.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA surprisingly large number of Americans blame Antifa for last week's violent breach of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump , despite the FBI determining that there is no evidence the group was involved.\n\nIn a new poll from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), 40 percent of respondents said that Antifa, the largely unorganized movement of anti-fascist activists that President Donald Trump has repeatedly lobbied be designated a \"terrorist organization,\" was either \"significantly\" or \"somewhat\" responsible for the Capitol attack. Of that number, 27 percent believed that Antifa was significantly responsible.\n\nTrump, who has come under fire by many who say his rhetoric incited the riot, still received most of the blame in the survey. The outgoing president was deemed responsible by 67 percent of respondents, including a 53 percent majority who said that he was significantly responsible. Members of white supremacist, far-right or militia groups were deemed culpable at a similar level, with 64 percent assigning them some portion of the blame.\n\nA majority of respondents also agreed that two other groups bore at least some responsibility for the insurrection. Members of Congress who voted against certifying Biden's Electoral College win were deemed responsible by 55 percent, while social media companies were blamed by 51 percent. Biden was blamed by 27 percent, including by 16 percent who believe that the president-elect was significantly responsible, despite no evidence that he was even remotely involved.\n\nThe poll was conducted on behalf of ADL by polling firm YouGov. Respondents, consisting of 1,176 U.S. adults, were surveyed online in the two days follow the attack, January 7 and January 8. It has a margin of error of 2.95 percent.\n\nThe FBI has found no evidence for Antifa involvement in the Capitol riot, according to a call agency officials held with members of the press on Friday. Countless videos and photographs of the event, along with other evidence, have shown that those directly involved in the attack were a group of pro-Trump extremists, fueled by baseless conspiracy theories claiming that massive fraud had \"stolen\" the election from the president.\n\nNot long after the angry mob breached the Capitol building as Congress met to certify Biden's win, new conspiracy theories formed online to explain away their violent actions, which resulted in the deaths of five people. Prominent Republicans including Rep. Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin quickly repeated the unfounded allegations that the rioters were Antifa members.\n\nMany boosting the false claims cited a report published on the night of the attack by conservative newspaper The Washington Times , which said that a \"retired military officer\" had confided that a facial recognition software firm identified two out of the hundreds of people who breached the building as Antifa members.\n\nThe report was discredited the following day when the firm cited, XRVision, released a statement saying that its software had not identified any of the rioters as Antifa members. Instead, the firm said, the software had identified two people participating in the insurrection as members of neo-Nazi groups and another as a prominent supporter of the pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Washington, D.C. field office of the FBI, which declined to comment.\n\nAila Slisco is a Newsweek night reporter based in New York.

      "text": "Trump Can't Designate Antifa a Domestic Terrorist Group, and It's a Bad Idea Anyway\n\nAntifa\n\nRobby Soave | 6.1.2020 9:00 AM\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Sunday that he would designate the leftist \"antifa\" movement a domestic terrorist organization, following several days of peaceful protesting but also rioting and looting in the wake of George Floyd's killing .\n\nActivists informally associated with antifa-which is short for \"antifascist\"-were responsible for some of the violence over the weekend. They have also committed crimes during previous protests: Trump's inauguration in D.C., the Portland demonstrations against the Proud Boys, and many others . This is consistent with antifa's ideology, which holds (generally speaking) that harsh tactics are necessary to combat the far right and does not believe in extending free speech to people who oppose its goals. (My book Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump includes an in-depth look at antifa's history, tactics, and goals.)\n\nSo antifa is well worth criticizing. But Trump's declaration is flawed in a number of ways.\n\nFor one thing, it's not actually possible for the president to label antifa a domestic terrorist group: There is no such designation. The U.S. State Department maintains a list of known terrorist organizations, but it includes only foreign groups-mostly radical Islamists.\n\nAntifa is obnoxious, and it has been responsible for a fair amount of violence, but it's obviously not a threat to U.S. security on the same level as al-Qaeda or ISIS. It doesn't even have a leader, central organization, or formal membership.\n\nFor another thing, giving the government greater license to consider all antifa activities terroristic in nature would certainly result in civil liberties violations. The authorities would end up harassing and surveilling Americans who have professed sympathy for the far left but are not engaged in anything approaching criminal activity.\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr said on Sunday that the Justice Department would investigate the \"criminal organizers and instigators\" who are responsible for this weekend's mayhem. The government already has all the authority it needs to go after people who committed violence, whether or not they consider themselves part of antifa. A domestic terrorist designation is a meaningless gesture: It gives a bunch of social irritants more legitimacy than they deserve.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The Conservative Trans Woman Who Went Undercover With Antifa in Portland\n\nPortland Protests\n\nNancy Rommelmann | 10.2.2020 2:20 PM\n\nErin Smith was at a GOP election watch party at Twitter headquarters in San Francisco on November 8, 2016. For the one-time deputy vice chair of communications for the city Republication Party, it should have been a time of jubilation.\n\n\"As soon as they announced Trump the presumptive winner, we're told, 'Hey, there's a mob of protestors out front,'\" says Smith, who stepped outside to find the San Francisco cops being pushed back by a crowd, some in head-to-toe black: clothes, helmets, face masks.\n\nA trans woman, conservative, and former tugboat captain who says she's \"a weird activist/analyst-type person right now,\" Smith soon became galvanized to find out more about a group that dressed as revolutionaries and took their fight to the streets. What was animating them? Trump animus? The romance of revolution? The boredom and frustration of COVID sequestration? An unfocused desire to fuck shit up?\n\nIt takes a special moral blindness to see setting fires, breaking windows, and threatening journalists as the road to justice. I've seen this moral blindness rise along with the violence in Portland. Young activists have told me frankly that they don't give a shit if someone working in the basement of the police station burns to death because, hey, she chose to work there. I've seen activists cheer the murder of a member of the conservative group Patriot Prayer. You cannot employ the violence of your perceived enemies and expect your revolution to end in peace.\n\nWhat Smith has experienced has not been peaceful. She's had friends beaten up by antifa. She's been threatened herself. It made her curious. This summer, she decided to find out more by going undercover with the black bloc anarchists in Portland.\n\nI went out with Smith several nights, and while I could not follow her directly-black bloc avoids having those outside its ranks interview or photograph them-I was able to watch her, wearing all black and carrying a shield bearing an anarchist \"A,\" slip into the group. I saw that she was present at the same locations where black bloc attacked buildings and set fires.\n\nAfter one such night, Smith and I sat over a couple of hard seltzers and discussed why she decided to infiltrate the black bloc and what she found.\n\nWhat did you know about antifa when you first encountered them in San Francisco?\n\nI had a vague idea of what antifa was, but it wasn't nearly as big a deal as it is now, outside of maybe Berkeley or Seattle. I'd had friends that got attacked at the Trump rally they tried to hold in San Jose [in April 2016]. I'd had a year of watching that happen, and basically, I don't like bullies, so I started showing up at these things, at rallies and protests and places where my friends were getting beaten up. It felt like in 2016, everything really changed in the Bay Area. It stopped being so carefree, in a sense Everything started kind of feeling like it was for keeps.\n\nApril 27, 2017, was the first rally I went to, in Berkeley. This was a Trump MAGA rally. I started livestreaming in June and I got to be pretty good at talking to people from the other side. The first time I ever actually dressed in black and put on a mask on and tried to slip into the bloc was last weekend. It is a little scary, because I've faced them down so much. I'm like, \"I'm going to dress in black and slip in?\"\n\nI've studied them for a bit, watching videos and stuff. I wrote a piece on antifa tactics for a monograph that's coming out next month, for the Center for Security Policy. And I have an advantage, having gone to the rallies. But they know who I am. When antifa hates you and know who you are, the best way to hide is right in the middle of their black bloc. That's the last place they think to look. It's one of the advantages of dressing in black and wearing your mask.\n\nYou had a shield tonight. Did you make it?\n\nActually, I acquired it at the riot. Someone set it down, and I'm like, \"That's cool. It's communism, no property. This is mine.\"\n\nHow organized are things on the inside?\n\nThere are different types of bloc organization styles. The building block of antifa is what's called an affinity group, people you live and work with and trust and know in real life. All the planning is done within that closed bloc, and they don't let everyone know [what they're going to do]. I didn't know that they were going to burn the Portland Police Association when I joined. What they did was put a call out that said, \"Anyone show up in black that night at this place, and you can join the action.\"\n\nThat's called a semi-open bloc. The planning is done within the closed group, but anyone who's dressed in black can come join the action. If you know what you're looking for, you can spot affinity groups that are working together. One thing they'll do sometimes is have written agreements with other protest organizations that aren't in black bloc. I know of one from Berkeley that illustrates this: \"We agree that to not take pictures of anyone in antifa.\" It will say that literally in writing, so everyone's working together. It's like a combined arms type thing, almost like the military. They work together and are mutually reinforcing.\n\nSo your first night with them, you burned the Portland Police Association...\n\nWe get to the Portland Police Association and immediately, they blockade both ends of the street. They built the shield wall and they're hammering the door open. I went over and I'm standing in the bloc as they're breaking the door down. It took them a little while longer than what I thought. They could have found better ways to breach the building, but they had hammers and pry bars and they pry it open and pry the plywood back and they pour fuel and light it on fire and start burning stuff.\n\nStrategically what they're doing is, they're forcing a dilemma action. A dilemma action is when you put your opponent in a no-win situation. Your enemy has to react. If they don't react, they look weak; if they do react, they have to react in a certain way where it looks like it's an overreaction.\n\nWhen the feds were in Portland, they were presented as overreacting, a presentation helped by innumerable people with PRESS written across their clothing flooding the internet with images that presented protesters wholly as victims of an authoritarian regime.\n\nThat's their [antifa's] objective. It's not a tactical thing. That's why all the \"press\" is there, the sympathetic press. They're trying to create propaganda. They know how the police are going to react, so they carefully calibrate what they do to try to provoke the police into reacting and then filming it. They want to try to push public opinion in favor of removing the police. The police aren't perfect, but what a police force is, it's putting force under an objective third party, under government control. Antifa wants to separate the police from the populace.\n\nThis is basically guerilla warfare. They're trying to undermine legitimacy of the state. The police right now, I think some of them are catching up. There's a playbook for how police respond to riots and they're not actually doing it; it's not an actual riot. I mean, it is a riot, but at the same time, it's a specific type of riot that's trying to make the police respond in a certain way.\n\nMeaning, they're able to provoke the police into taking the bait.\n\nYeah. Basically they're baiting the police into overreacting.\n\nSo how did you feel when the police station was on fire?\n\nIt was pretty wild, actually. Right when the fire was lit, the police announced, \"This is a riot\" and they [the black bloc] started marching. For me it was really kind of amazing, because they were incredibly proficient. This was 600, 700 people. They moved a group of people through the city in close order, quickly and efficiently, and attacked a target and caught it on fire and then escaped from the police.\n\nI describe it as an open-source networked insurgency. They were incredibly efficient. They hit a target and vanished into the city and got away. Basically, they're like skirmishers: They come in, they attack the cops, they get out.\n\nAntifa goes for a certain type of violence, a mid-level violence. Most people aren't practiced in violence, and what they'll do is, they'll either back down or they'll overreact. Antifa basically as a group does the equivalent of just pushing someone on the shoulder, and again, and again.\n\nThey keep it at a simmer.\n\nYes. It's very tricky to react to because people get angry. If you just go in public and pick someone and start pushing them, if you keep pushing them, they're going to slug you; it's just how it's going to work, at the individual level but also at the group level too. I'm also speaking metaphorically, in a sense. Of course if you hit them , they're going to fall down and go, \"Oh, God, you're violent. You're a Nazi!\"\n\nWhat they're intending to do is use that level of violence that will scare people enough to back down. [The radical left] learned in the '70s that killing people is bad PR. A body count is horrible.\n\nSo we're not going to see another Weather Underground?\n\nNot at this point. They've learned and adapted. What they want to do is make it difficult for people [they don't like] to organize.\n\nSo that's really the two responses. Most people don't know how to handle that mid-level force. So they either back down or they slug people; either way is a win.\n\nWhen you don't know what you're looking at, you see a lot of random, rage-filled kids. You sometimes wonder: Do they even know how to formulate a plan? But you go out with them a few nights and understand, people are actually working together.\n\nIt's really interesting. I did a breakdown of the Grant Park video , the tech they had. And that was freaking incredibly sophisticated. This is Grant Park in Chicago, when they attacked the statue and put like 49 police officers in the hospital. [Tonight] was so much like this, in terms of operational sophistication, how coordinated everything was.\n\nBut not centralized.\n\nLet me explain that a little more. People keep looking for a chain of command, and you don't necessarily need that, as long as everyone understands a basic level of instruction it works.\n\nWhat are the basics?\n\nBasically, don't talk about it. Don't photograph people's faces. \"What did you see?\" \"I didn't see shit!\" is a chant you'll hear. You can go to websites like CrimethInc. and they'll have a lot of breakdowns of tactics. It's an anarchist website. It's an open-source network insurgency, not so much a chain of command.\n\nPeople think antifa and they picture people in black. Antifa is bigger than that. Black bloc is a tactic. Dressing in black, it's a tactic. You don't have to dress in black to be antifa. You don't even have to hit the streets. There are people who work in tech, hackers who never hit the streets, and they're still antifa. [The media] play these little word games, \"Oh, antifa doesn't exist.\" Yes and no. It's not an organization where you have to sign up for a membership. It's one of those things where it's just a loose-knit network of people.\n\nWhose message can be a sweet song, not just young people looking for identity, or those for whom COVID-19 has cooped up, but anyone wanting to be part of what they see as a fighting force for justice.\n\nPeople want to fight through things. I first heard of CrimethInc in 2000. I've got their seminal work, Days of War, Nights of Love . I've got it inscribed, \"Love and insurrection\"; it's anarchist stuff. I'm not an anarchist or a communist or anything like that. But it is a siren song. Young people, they sense there's something wrong, and they want to fight. That's a human instinct. Francis Fukuyama talks about it : People want to struggle. And if everything is fine, they'll struggle against democracy.\n\nI understand where some of that comes from. People want community and want to feel like they're fighting. That's why we love Star Wars . We love the underdog fighting. And I think young people that don't have a network, it's just something very intoxicating.\n\nAnd totally honestly, when I was out there with black bloc [and] busted open a door to a police station, set it on fire and ran from the cops? It was fun. I know that sounds weird. I don't support that as a policy, but when you're there in the street, it's fun.\n\nViolence is fun. This is one of the things we don't talk about as a society. It's like, wow, this is pretty fun, especially when you feel like you have grounds for any type of legitimate complaint. It's easy to knock on these people. And I still do. I don't agree with what they're doing, but I respect them. I've been facing these people down for four years. I take them seriously and I respect their skill at what they're doing and their dedication.\n\nWhat are the ages of the people you were hanging out with?\n\nAnywhere from twenties to thirties.\n\nDo you have any idea what they do for work?\n\nIn the Bay Area, we've had people arrested that were physicists. Look up Freddy Martinez . He was arrested for punching some guy in Berkeley. And Freddy Martinez is the director of Lucy Parsons Labs . I know there's another guy who was a Johns Hopkins grad. You can dismiss them as a bunch of losers, but I've seen some incredibly smart people.\n\nI've told some demonstrators mouthing off to me to read Utopia or Auschwitz , about the 1968 generation in Germany who were livid with their Nazi-collaborating parents and were going to build a better society. The movement became progressively less peaceful and eventually took to bombing and murdering people. Antifa right now is able to keep things at a simmer and provoke others into behaving badly, but history tells us things usually don't stay at a simmer. Do we get to skip the part where people are building bombs in basements in Portland?\n\nWell, they are making those primitive small IEDs made out of commercial grade fireworks. They're roughly about the power of police flash-bangs. I've had them go off right next to me and you feel it; you feel the heat wave hit you. But a big thing for them [antifa] is they have convinced themselves that they're doing something good. They're very big about trying to maintain, at least in their eyes, the moral high ground. Part of that is not killing people. They want that moral high ground and they construct it. And that's kind of what they do by using that mid-level of violence. They want you to overreact because not being extremely violent is how they convince themselves they're better. And it's also great propaganda.\n\nDo you see antifa as getting more than a toehold in city government here?\n\nQuite possibly, yes, I think by weakening the police, or defunding the police. They have the organization that if the police went away tomorrow, you would basically have an antifa police force. They wouldn't call themselves antifa, but they have the organization that, if there's no objective third-party security force, then who's going to stop it?\n\nI think the worst case is if they weaken the police; they don't go away because then the police are still there and they'll be able to target the normal law-abiding people. It's what we have in San Francisco. It's anarcho-tyranny. It's like the law really only applies to people that are trying to follow the law.\n\nI wouldn't say the majority of people in Portland are sympathetic to antifa, but you've got a lot of people that either are apathetic or don't think it matters or they're scared. You put all of those people together, maybe you have a majority. There's a woman running for mayor that is openly pro-antifa, a woman who was photographed wearing a skirt with Chairman Mao's face on it. It could be that Portland is the place where antifa goes Main Street.\n\nI think that in many areas they are already there. I don't think antifa will get out there and start dressing in police uniforms and be the official police. I think they'll always stay kind of a paramilitary. But the police are weakened to the point where they can barely oppose [antifa] now as it is. So the police go away, it's operant conditioning. If every time I grabbed this [hard seltzer] I got shocked, after a while I would stop grabbing it. And that's basically how they operate. It's not so much a matter of ruling the whole city, it's the sense that antifa [moves] the Overton window. \"If this person is advocating for something we don't agree with, we can go punish them and we can punish their friends and family.\" It's a self-censorship. If the cops are a token force now, and they can't stop anyone, and antifa can destroy your life, then people are going to know that.\n\nAnd they're going to shut up and just try to go about their lives.\n\nThat's what they're going to do.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "From Antifa to UFOs, One Joke Can Spawn a Thousand Conspiracies\n\nConspiracy Theories\n\nJesse Walker | From the August/September 2020 issue\n\nIf a radical movement is prepared to use violence, that real-world willingness can inspire wild rumors about the group's plans and alliances. We've seen that dynamic play out with movements ranging from the Black Panthers to right-wing militias. So when the militant anti-fascist network known as antifa started attracting new levels of attention during and after the 2016 presidential campaign, it was probably inevitable that it would trigger some bizarre conspiracy theories.\n\nWhat might not have been as easy to anticipate was the role that jokes would play in the rumor mill.\n\nOver the last few years, at least 375 fake antifa social-media accounts have appeared, posting over-the-top comments like \"THIS IS WHY THE #SolarEclipse2017 IS BIGOTED AND RACIST.\" (The statement appeared alongside a picture of an American flag on the Moon.) The \"Boston Antifa\" feed greeted the news of Jerry Lewis' death with a video denouncing \"unsafe humor\" and declaring that the comedian \"embraced the power of white supremacy.\" It doesn't take much digging to discover that these aren't actual antifa accounts, but several media outlets have mistaken them for the real thing. When a fake antifa group announced that there was \"no room\" in its city for \"supporters of the US constitution,\" the Washington Examiner cited the post in an anti-antifa editorial. In Texas, an account convinced reporters that antifa was planning to protest a statue of Sam Houston and to beat up anyone who counterdemonstrated; the news inspired hundreds of people to come to a counterprotest against a rally that was never going to happen.\n\nCoverage of these accounts often presents them as disinformation meant to sow confusion and make the movement look bad. And that's obviously a part of what's going on: During the sometimes violent protests that followed the police killing of George Floyd in May, for example, members of the white nationalist group Identity Evropa started tweeting as @ANTIFA_US, promising to \"move into the residential areas...the white hoods....and we take what's ours.\" But many of the accounts are also clearly meant as entertainment. One of the men behind the Boston Antifa account, Brandon Krebs, has claimed the comedian Andy Kaufman as an influence, and he appears to have followers who take his work in that spirit. (As I write, the top comment below the Jerry Lewis video says, \"This is one of the best comedy channels on Youtube right now.\")\n\nThe accounts have fooled some mainstream outlets, such as Reuters and the Houston Chronicle . But the audiences that think the accounts are real, like the audiences that think the accounts are funny, tend to come from the political right. The people who maintain the feeds tend not to be very good at mimicking real antifa groups' rhetoric-they sound more like generic left-wing caricatures-so they're less likely to fool leftists.\n\nOnce memesters on the right started spoofing antifa, memesters on the left took to spoofing right-wing fears of antifa. Before long, the leftists found that their jokes were getting mistaken for reality too. In late 2017, for example, one @KrangTNelson tweeted this: \"can't wait for November 4th when millions of antifa supersoldiers will behead all white parents and small business owners in the town square.\" Some rather unhinged stories were already circulating about an alleged antifa plot to launch a civil war on that day-a Maoist front group called Refuse Fascism was indeed planning a November 4 protest, and the rumors had spiraled from there-and the tweet went viral among people who took it literally. @KrangTNelson was soon suspended from Twitter. After another account repeated the joke, the conservative site Gateway Pundit ran an article headlined \"ANTIFA Leader: 'November 4th [...] millions of antifa supersoldiers will behead all white parents.'\" (The site later added a postscript: \"UPDATE: Far-left radicals now claiming it was a 'funny joke.'\")\n\nSometimes left- and right-wing pranksters end up accidentally collaborating. In summer 2017, a rumor took hold that antifa was going to burn flags and desecrate Confederate burial markers at Gettysburg National Park. This didn't make much sense-there are no Confederate burial markers at Gettysburg-but the story nonetheless got picked up by Breitbart and other right-wing outlets. The Gettysburg hoax was pushed by people claiming to be affiliated with \"Harrisburg Antifa,\" but the rumors also drew on an online invitation to a Gettysburg \"Burn a Confederate Flag to Trigger Trump Fans Day.\" The event in the invitation wasn't real: If you tried to buy a ticket, you landed on the Southern Poverty Law Center's donation page. It had been posted by \"Trolling Trumpsters,\" a lefty group dedicated to baiting people on the right.\n\nAs in Houston, the Gettysburg hoax inspired a counterprotest. At this one, a rallygoer accidentally shot himself in the leg.\n\nThe most puzzling antifa jape might be a document that started circulating in mid-2017 called The ANTIFA Manual . Made up to look like a well-worn dossier, complete with a coffee stain on the front page, the file was purportedly found at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, the site of some infamous protests earlier that year. The manual was taken seriously in several quarters-it even got linked on Rush Limbaugh's Facebook page-but anyone familiar with antifa's largely anarchist membership would quickly recognize it as a fake. (Among other things, it announces plans to \"vote pro-ANTIFA politicians into office\" and to establish a one-world government whose \"ANTIFA-approved regulators\" would use microchips \"to monitor the citizenry of the world.\") The fact that it keeps referring to the movement as \"ANTIFA,\" in all caps, is itself a clear sign that something screwy is going on. What isn't clear is whether this was originally intended to fool people or whether it was just a particularly hamfisted satire. And if it was a satire, was it supposed to be a satire of antifa itself or of the goofy rumors that swirl around antifa? Did this come from the left, from the right, or from someplace else?\n\nOne thing is certain: In addition to all the other ways that false conspiracy stories begin, from honest speculation to commerce-minded fraud, we need to appreciate the role of jokes. We can divide those jokes into three categories: pranks, accidents, and enigmas.\n\nPranks are deliberate hoaxes, like the plots promoted on fake antifa accounts. In some cases, these are essentially disinformation campaigns. But even then-unlike, say, the fake Black Panther literature the FBI planted in the 1960s, or the stories the KGB spread in the 1980s claiming that the U.S. government created AIDS-the aim is at least partly satiric. In many cases, the story's author intends to reveal the truth after a while, hoping to embarrass or illuminate the people who embraced the story. Such plans do not always work out as intended.\n\nAccidents , by contrast, were not meant to be believed. Like @KrangTNelson's tweet, they are works of fiction that people unexpectedly mistake for facts. Not only do their authors not intend to fool anyone, but sometimes they are not even aware that they have fooled anyone.\n\nEnigmas fall into the cloudy territory in between. As with The ANTIFA Manual , it's not clear whether they were supposed to trick people. Sometimes the author himself may feel ambivalent about his intentions.\n\nThe internet is infamously awash in disinformation, as intelligence agencies, clickbait sites, political campaigns, and freelance trolls spread deceptions. It is also filled with practical jokes, many of them devoid of any political content at all. Make a Venn diagram of those two categories, and the overlapping zone will contain these conspiracy pranks.\n\nTake Christopher Blair, who used to post apocryphal stories at a site called America's Last Line of Defense . His headlines-\"5 Liberal Terrorists Arrested At Capitol Planning To Assassinate President Trump,\" \"Democrat Mayor BUSTED Working With Latino Thug To Sell Meth And Extort Sex From Young Girls,\" \"Police Identify Monica Lewinsky's Killer\"-sound like tales that might be spread by a dedicated Republican, and several of them went viral among conservatives who appear to have believed they were true. But Blair insists he's actually a liberal. A profile in The Washington Post described him writing a transparently false story about Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton giving Donald Trump the finger during the national anthem, then saying, \"How could any thinking person believe this nonsense?\" before hitting publish .\n\nWhile disclaimers on his page identified the site as satire, Blair clearly got a charge out of fooling people. Yet he didn't intend to fool them forever: Part of the game was to jump in to tell them they'd been had. He \"didn't have time to personally confront each of the several hundred thousand conservatives who followed his Facebook page,\" the Post reported, \"so he'd built a community of more than 100 liberals to police the page with him. Together they patrolled the comments, venting their own political anger, shaming conservatives who had been fooled, taunting them, baiting them into making racist comments that could then be reported to Facebook.\" Nonetheless, many people continued to share the stories as though they were true.\n\nThis may feel like a uniquely internet-era phenomenon, but it goes back long before the age of social media.\n\nConsider Gabriel Jogand-Pagès, a French journalist who tasted his first fame writing anti-clerical polemics under the pseudonym Léo Taxil. In 1885, Taxil made a show of converting to Catholicism and renouncing his earlier writings. He then published a series of exposés claiming that Freemasonry was controlled by a libertine and murderous Satanic cabal based in Charleston, South Carolina. He spent 12 years doing this, at one point even scoring an audience with the pope, before calling a press conference in 1897 to declare that this had been \"the most grandiose prank of my existence\" and to gloat that so many Catholics (and even some Masons) had swallowed his lies.\n\nDespite his confession, Taxil's claims kept circulating in anti-Masonic conspiracy literature, from Edith Starr Miller's Occult Theocrasy (1933) to Pat Robertson's The New World Order (1991) to a Jack Chick comic called The Curse of Baphomet . Sometimes the conspiracist ignores the material's flim-flam origins; sometimes the writer argues that the revelation of the hoax was itself a hoax. Either way, it's a case study in how difficult it can be to put a falsehood back in the bottle.\n\nHoaxes have been common in the UFO subculture as well-not just crudely faked photos of flying saucers but prank phone calls, phony letters from government agencies, and other tricks. Some UFO writers delighted in playing practical jokes on the competition, as when Gray Barker and James Moseley got their hands on some U.S. government stationery in 1957 and decided to send letters to other ufologists. One of these, purportedly from \"R.E. Straith\" of the State Department's \"Cultural Exchange Committee,\" informed the alleged alien contactee George Adamski that \"the Department has on file a great deal of confirmatory evidence bearing out your own claims,\" though it \"cannot publicly confirm your experiences.\" Adamski immediately started using the letter to promote himself, and the document continued to attract believers even after Moseley revealed the prank in 1985.\n\nThen there's the Priory of Sion, an allegedly age-old order that was in fact founded in France in the '50s by a man named Pierre Plantard. He and a confederate, Philippe de Chérisey, deposited several fabricated documents in the National Library of France, then worked with the writer Gérard de Sède to use them as the basis for the 1967 book L'Or de Rennes . Other esoteric writers produced still more texts building on de Sède's supposed discoveries. In this way the Priory was linked to a hidden treasure, the Knights Templar, the Merovingian dynasty, and, eventually, a secret bloodline descended from either extraterrestrials or Jesus Christ, depending on which writer you asked. This mythos took off in the English-speaking world after Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and former Doctor Who writer Henry Lincoln worked it into their nominally nonfiction 1982 bestseller Holy Blood, Holy Grail . It got an even bigger boost after Dan Brown used it in his wildly successful 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code .\n\nNot everyone who launched this legend necessarily saw it as a joke. Plantard in particular may have had a far-right political agenda, which perhaps included the notion that he would be recognized as the rightful heir to the Merovingians and crowned king of France. But de Chérisey was both a radio satirist and a surrealist, and de Sède was involved in surrealism as well. It's plausible, even likely, that they saw the project as a puckish sort of performance art.\n\nLike Blair and Taxil and Moseley, de Chérisey eventually came clean about his hoaxing. Needless to say, that hasn't stopped stories about the Priory from spreading.\n\nFinally, let's look at the Report From Iron Mountain on the Possibility and Desirability of Peace . This bestselling book, published in 1967, presented itself as the leaked text of a classified report by an organization called the Special Study Group. Written in a parody of the prose one might find in a RAND Corp. white paper, the book argued that war is a social stabilizer: It allows planners to judiciously burn off excess economic inventory, it channels \"antisocial elements\" into \"an acceptable role,\" it establishes \"the basic authority of a modern state over its people,\" and it helps \"preserve whatever quality and degree of poverty a society requires as an incentive.\" The book's comic peak comes when the Special Study Group ponders other ways to fulfill war's nonmilitary functions, including the creation of \"fictitious alternate enemies.\"\n\nIt wasn't just a satire; it was a prank. Conceived by the journalist Victor Navasky and written primarily by his friend Leonard Lewin, the book was classified as nonfiction when it first appeared. Lewin admitted the hoax in 1972, but many people have continued to take it as an authentic leak. The right-wing Liberty Lobby even printed its own edition: As a government document, the group reasoned, it must be in the public domain. (Lewin sued.) In 1990, the Associated Press distributed a story about the history of Iron Mountain, the spot in New York state where the Special Study Group supposedly met. The article casually cited the book's claims as a part of the place's past. \"After two years of meetings, the commission decided that permanent peace was a bad idea,\" the reporter recounted matter-of-factly.\n\nSnopes and similar fact-checking websites are filled with viral stories that began on satire sites-not just outlets like America's Last Line of Defense , which actively hoped to fool people, but places that aim only to make people laugh. Many of these articles involve conspiracies: \"Military Drawing Up Plans For Nationwide Gun Confiscations\" ( Duffel Blog ), \"Hillary Clinton Accidentally Posts Condolences For Tulsi Gabbard's Suicide One Day Early\" ( The Babylon Bee ), \"CIA Issues Posthumous Apology After New Evidence Clears Osama Bin Laden Of Involvement In 9/11 Attacks\" ( The Onion ).\n\nThat last one was temporarily reprinted at Yahoo! News . The site's editors probably realized it wasn't true-they posted the piece under the \"Entertainment\" header-but you can't assume every casual browser understood that. A 2019 study by R. Kelly Garrett, Robert M. Bond, and Shannon Poulsen, a trio of researchers based at Ohio State University, found substantial numbers of readers willing to describe various headlines from The Onion or The Babylon Bee as either \"definitely\" or \"probably\" true. The Babylon Bee itself commented on such confusions with a story headlined \"Reality Criticized For Not More Clearly Distinguishing Itself From Satire.\"\n\nThis phenomenon also goes back long before the birth of the internet. Indeed, it helped produce one of the most infamous and influential conspiracy theories of the last two centuries.\n\nIn 1864, the French attorney Maurice Joly wrote The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu , a book protesting Napoleon III's authoritarian regime. In Joly's satire, Machiavelli explains the ways a modern despot can manage public opinion. \"I would assign a dedicated organ to each opinion, in each party,\" he declares at one point. \"I would have an aristocratic organ in the aristocratic party, a republican organ in the republican party, a revolutionary organ in the revolutionary party, an anarchist organ-if need be-in the anarchist party. Like the God Vishnu, my press would have a hundred arms and these arms would place their hands upon all the nuances of opinion throughout the entire country. One would be of my party without knowing it. Those who believe they speak their language would be speaking mine; those who believe they were acting in their party would be acting in mine; those who believe they were marching under their flag would be marching under mine.\"\n\nSeveral decades later, The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion , a notorious forgery that claims to be a Jewish plot to rule the world, would include a strikingly similar passage. \"All our newspapers will support different parties-aristocratic, republican, revolutionary, and even anarchical-but, of course, only so long as constitutions last,\" it declares. \"These newspapers, like the Indian god Vishnu, will be possessed of hundreds of hands, each of which will be feeling the pulse of varying public opinion. When the pulse becomes quick, these hands will incline this opinion towards our cause, because a nervous subject is easily led and easily falls under any kind of influence. If any chatterers are going to imagine that they are repeating the opinion of their party newspaper, they will in reality be repeating our own opinion, or the opinion which we desire. Thinking that they are following the organ of this party, they will in reality be following the flag which we will fly for them.\"\n\nThat wasn't the only place where the anti-Semitic text mirrored the anti-Napoleonic text: A fifth or more of the Protocols originated in Joly's book. (Joly himself may have done some \"borrowing\" as well: Umberto Eco has argued that Dialogue in Hell includes \"no less than seven pages that are, if not plagiarized, at least laden with generous and unconfessed quotations\" from the conspiracy novels of Eugène Sue.)\n\nNorman Cohn and other historians have traced the chain of transmission: The Prussian writer Hermann Goedsche had plagiarized heavily from Joly's Dialogue when he wrote his 1868 conspiracy novel Biarritz , with Machiavelli's confessions now attributed to a cabal of rabbis meeting in a cemetery; that standalone sequence was later published as a pamphlet that claimed to be based on a true story; and so one text followed another, until at last it evolved into the Protocols . Joly-a liberal-minded satirist whose Dialogue in Hell included just one passing reference to Jews-had accidentally planted a seed for a document used to justify pogroms in Russia and genocide in Germany.\n\nIn addition to satires that are simply mistaken for factual accounts, some satires are recognized as fictions but nonetheless construed as thinly disguised truths. This has happened frequently to the libertarian novelist Robert Anton Wilson.\n\nWilson conducted his share of outright hoaxes: He was a member of the Discordians, a group of pranksters who introduced the idea of the Illuminati to the counterculture in the 1960s and '70s by dreaming up facetious conspiracy theories, planting articles about them in the alternative press, and sending letters about them to various public figures. Wilson and one of his confederates, Robert Shea, eventually transmuted the Discordian mythos into a comedic science fiction trilogy, Illuminatus! , that was published in 1975. Rumors immediately began to circulate that the books were more than just fiction. Conspiracy Digest reported that while many of the digest's readers believed Wilson \"was an Illuminati agent attempting to lampoon and discredit conspiracy theories,\" others thought he was trying \"to slip the truth past Establishment censors by disguising the truth as a titillating parody\"; still others took the books as \"a reliable guide to the inner doctrines of the hidden world of the secret societies alleged to control the conspiracy.\"\n\nThese sorts of reactions continued for decades afterward. The Rev. Ravi Holy, today an Anglican vicar, was an anarchist and occultist in his youth. Back then, the British journalist Damian Thompson has reported, Holy accepted Illuminatus! as \"truth lightly clothed as fiction.\" When he was born again in a Pentecostal sect and created a conspiracist website, he \"carried out only minor adjustments to this narrative.\" (Holy now describes himself as a \"recovering conspiracy theorist.\") The same sort of thing has happened to some of Wilson's other novels. In a 1992 tract called Dark Majesty , for example, the conspiracist Texe Marrs writes that Wilson's Masks of the Illuminati \"purports to be fiction\" before declaring that \"there is little doubt that it contains much insight and many hard facts about the Secret Brotherhood.\"\n\nIt isn't just satiric texts that work their way into conspiracy theories. Satiric acts can be misconstrued by people unaware of the context that originally gave them meaning. In the 1950s and '60s, for example, it was common for conservatives to mock politicians they deemed soft on communism by bringing umbrellas to their public appearances. It was a sort of guerrilla theater: The umbrellas represented Neville Chamberlain, and Chamberlain represented appeasement. So when President John F. Kennedy came to Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, a man named Louie Steven Witt arrived with an umbrella, even though it was a sunny day, and raised it as a protest. Witt has said that he wasn't accusing Kennedy of appeasement so much as he was trolling him, having heard that the umbrellas were \"sort of a sore spot\" for the president.\n\nKennedy was killed that day, and Witt's bumbershoot entered American folklore. You can see it in Abraham Zapruder's film of the Kennedy assassination, and if you Google \"umbrella man\" you can read some of the conspiracy theories that emerged around the parasol once the initial context that gave it meaning had receded from public consciousness. (Usually the umbrella is assumed to be a signal to the assassins, but some of the more outré theorists have suggested that it was used to target the president with a dart.) In 1978 Witt came forward to explain himself, but that didn't stop stories from circulating-I can attest that I first heard of the allegedly inexplicable umbrella more than a decade after Witt's testimony, and I didn't hear about his explanation until more than a decade after that.\n\nI'll close out this section with a note on birtherism, the idea that Barack Obama was secretly born in Africa and thus was not eligible to hold the U.S. presidency. The most compelling investigation I've read into the origins of this story suggests that it began when someone saw a hypothetical question in a comment thread at a legal blog and mistook it for a statement of fact. In \"The Secret Origins of Birtherism,\" published online, Loren Collins traces the trail of rumors back to a perfectly benign blog post by Eugene Volokh, a law professor at UCLA. Volokh's post discussed the debate over whether John McCain's birth in the Panama Canal Zone rendered him ineligible for the presidency. A commenter piped up and proposed, \"just for grins and giggles,\" that they \"change the hypothetical.\" The reader then offered a series of scenarios involving Obama, including one where he was \"born in a third country, and...immediately taken to the United States.\" A little more than a day later, Collins reports, someone on the right-wing FreeRepublic web forum was describing that very scenario as a fact he had just learned. From there it made its way into the 2008 presidential election.\n\nThere is an online adage known as Poe's Law. Its original formulation, by one Nathan Poe, went like this: \"Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone won't mistake for the genuine article.\" It was soon applied far beyond the debates over Creationism, becoming a general warning about how easy it is to confuse spoofs with sincerity.\n\nEven when you're sure that someone is making something up, it isn't always easy to tell what her intent is. Was The ANTIFA Manual supposed to fool people, or was it supposed to mock the sort of people who take documents like The ANTIFA Manual at face value? Was it written in the spirit of those fake antifa Facebook accounts, or was it written in the spirit of @KrangTNelson's tweet? I don't know, and on a certain level it doesn't matter. Even if its authors assumed that everyone would recognize their creation as a joke, there were readers who took it as The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Antifa . And even if it was meant to trick people, there were readers who instantly laughed at it.\n\nConfusing matters still further, people who call themselves satirists are not always what they seem. Many \"satire\" websites are filled with stories that do not make an attempt to be funny and do not appear to have a satiric point. They're clickbait operations whose business model depends on readers believing their articles (and then sharing them, thus generating ad revenue), but they try to cover themselves by tossing in a this-is-satire disclaimer somewhere on the site. Alas, it's not always easy to tell these fake satire sites from what are merely bad satire sites.\n\nThe enigma factor is magnified when more than one person is involved in constructing a story: As with the Priory of Sion, different participants may have different motives. Consider the sprawling \"QAnon\" mythos, in which an anonymous figure called Q claims to be a government insider leaking information about Donald Trump's battles with a vast pedophilic deep-state conspiracy. Q's tidbits usually take the form of gnomic clues that are open to multiple interpretations. There have been speculations that Q was a leftist prankster winding up Trump fans, but that's far from certain; some evidence suggests that Q's posts have come from people who have simultaneously solicited donations over a QAnon-themed YouTube channel, which would suggest a motive more mercenary than satiric. But set that aside. What's important for our purposes are all the other participants in the QAnon world.\n\nThe Q narrative is built by multitudes trying to interpret Q's clues in the light of the news and to interpret the news in the light of the clues. \"QAnon has a canon, but the canon is basically this coded language of the drops,\" the podcaster Jake Rockatansky has argued. \"The tapestry of the story is done by these amateur researchers....It's decentralized storytelling, like thousands of different fanfic threads going on at once with very little to chew on at the center.\" It is close to certain that some of the people participating in these discussions are trolls rather than sincere believers, but it is not always certain which participants are which. In QAnon as elsewhere, Poe's Law applies. Perhaps future scholars will have more luck discerning which ideas that caught on in the Q subculture were proposed with a straight face and which were suggested with a smirk.\n\nSometimes, of course, even the person proposing an idea might not be fully sure of whether he believes it. Just as one can say something \"as a joke\" while in fact meaning every word, irony can mask a sort of half-belief; you say something facetiously while suspecting that some version of it is true. This applies in the conspiracy world as much as anywhere else.\n\nLike pranks and accidents, enigmas predate the internet. They are especially common in the UFO literature and the broader world of anomaly hunting inspired by the paranormal writer Charles Fort. To read a certain sort of Fortean writer is to be constantly unsure about when he's being serious, when he's pulling your leg, and when someone is pulling his leg.\n\nOn that last note: The UFO literature is also filled with another sort of enigma-stories told by people who might be pranking us or might sincerely believe what they're saying. In 1961, a plumber named Joe Simonton told the world that a saucer had flown to his home in rural Wisconsin; a man allegedly exited the spacecraft, asked for some water, and then gave Simonton some pancakes. I'll go out on a limb and say that I doubt this really happened. But I'll be damned if I could tell you whether Simonton thought it happened.\n\nIn Pranksters , his impressive history of political put-ons, the media scholar Kembrew McLeod argues that even the Rosicrucian manifestos-a series of 17th century manuscripts that have launched hundreds of conspiracy theories-are best understood as a prank: a \"joke with a serious objective\" written to \"encourage people to be more accepting of new ideas.\" The authors, he reports, \"lost control of the narrative, and the resulting furor ended up obscuring their intended message.\"\n\nWhether or not you accept that gloss on the Rosicrucian pamphlets, it definitely describes a recurring pattern in the genesis of conspiracy rumors. A document or comment or gesture falls out of its original context, and the original author loses control of the message. Christopher Blair, Léo Taxil, James Moseley, several people involved in the Priory of Sion hoax, and the authors of the Report From Iron Mountain have all confessed their deceptions, yet many people refuse to believe their confessions. And on a certain level, you can understand that: Once you declare yourself a liar, you invite people to wonder what other lies you might be telling.\n\nTwo lessons leap out. One is a warning: Don't assume that you can reel back in a story you've released into the wild. If a belief fulfills a need, people can find all sorts of rationales for believing it, even if you go out of your way to tell them you made it up. Genuinely creative pranks and satires enrich the world, and it would be a tragedy if social-media moderators tried to enforce an order of flat earnestness. But any prankster would do well to think hard about the worst-case scenario before pressing send . Anything you say runs the risk of being believed forever, even if you plan to come clean next week.\n\nLesson two is about the importance of media literacy.

      "text": "No, Antifa Wasn't Behind the Capitol Riot\n\nJanuary 6\n\nRobby Soave | 1.7.2021 1:39 PM\n\nIn the wake Wednesday's mob assault on the U.S. Capitol, some conservatives are trying to shift blame from the dozens of pro-Trump protesters who stormed the building to a fictitious antifa boogeyman.\n\n\"Those who stormed the capitol yesterday were not Trump supporters,\" claimed Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. \"They have been confirmed to be Antifa. Violence is not the answer.\"\n\nPaxton's sentiments were echoed by other pro-Trump figures, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), and the conspiracist attorney L. Lin Wood, who touted \"indisputable photographic evidence that antifa violently broke into Congress today.\" This assertion, like Wood's previous claims that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is part of a pedophile cabal and that Vice President Mike Pence will face execution by firing squad , is wrong, as are all other claims that antifa was responsible for the Capitol riot.\n\nFor one thing, this isn't antifa's m.o. Antifa protesters typically use \"black bloc\" tactics: They dress in black and conceal their faces with masks and hoods. Individuals will quickly smash windows and set fires, then blend back into a crowd of similarly dressed people. They don't aim to get caught.\n\nThe people who stormed the Capitol, by contrast, were captured in numerous photos and videos. Their faces are easily identifiable. Many are obviously sincere Trump supporters associated with the far right. Several of them , including \"groyper\" leaders Nick Fuentes and Baked Alaska, are well-known to the media by now. The woman who was sadly killed by police under circumstances that require further investigation was genuinely pro-Trump . The guy who sat in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's chair and stole her mail is definitely not antifa, nor is the half-naked fur-and-horns guy . This latter individual is named Jake Angeli, and he is a conspiracy theorist-the self-stylized \"Q Shaman\"-who has appeared at multiple Trump rallies.\n\nI covered the unrest at the Capitol , and it's simply not possible that these acts of violence and property destruction were carried out by undercover antifa agents. The people smashing windows, climbing walls, and knocking down police barriers were often the leaders of the crowds; they were known to the other protesters. For these activists to be secret agents of the left would have required a covert operation far beyond antifa's capabilities, and at odds with antifa's typical behavior.\n\nAndy Ngo, a writer with a record of harshly criticizing antifa, agrees.\n\n\"The people occupying the Capitol building do not look like antifa people dressed in Trump gear or Trump costumes,\" he told The Washington Examiner . \"I have seen no evidence that they are able to coordinate a mass infiltration on this scale before, so I'm really skeptical that they would have been able to do it here without any of that information leaking out.\"\n\nAn article in The Washington Times claimed that a \"facial recognition firm\" had confirmed antifa's involvement in the attack. That article was debunked, and it has since been deleted .\n\nThousands of people were at the Capitol on Wednesday, and many of them caused trouble. It's possible that someone, somewhere, was trying to falsely pin a crime on a Trump supporter. But the many acts of violence and intimidation that transpired in the halls of Congress yesterday were overwhelmingly and provably committed by the president's most fervent supporters.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Antifa Has Backed Its Message With Violence for Decades in Europe\n\nFascism\n\nFredrik Segerfeldt | 9.8.2017 5:10 PM\n\nIt is a cold and dark January night in the Swedish town of Eskilstuna. Fredrik Nyqvist and a friend are walking home from the founding meeting of the local section of the minuscule Libertarian Party.\n\nSuddenly, four men in black clothes and facemasks show up, knocking the two unconscious. One of the offenders later bragged about jumping on Fredrik's head, causing injuries that kept him hospitalized for days.\n\nThe two libertarians had no way of identifying the perpetrators and assumed it was just a regular criminal incident. They could not know they had just become victims of political terrorism. But they would soon find out.\n\nAt his home a couple of days later, a third party member received a note from a group claiming responsibility for the attack, and was warned:\n\nWe hereby give you a chance to terminate all political activities. Failing to do so, you may be the next one to be physically reminded of the consequences of pursuing anti-working class policies.\n\nThe Antifa, or anti-fascist, movement of Charlottesville, Portland, and Berkeley fame did not come out of nowhere. It is a carbon copy in name, tactics and ideology of groups that have been active in Europe for decades. The website of the Swedish organization is www.antifa.se .\n\nOriginally an anti-Nazi body in a pre-WWII Germany, organizations resurfaced in various European countries in the 1980s and 1990s, attracting plenty of attention during the anti-globalization protests at the turn of the millennium. Since then, Antifa have systematically used violence as a political tool. Victims are in no way limited to Nazis or the alt-right. Mainstream center-right politicians, leftist mayors and government bureaucrats have been targeted. Apart from the usual assaults, Antifa members have made arson and gas attacks.\n\nAn original Antifa specialty is rioting, making up the Black Bloc of more mainstream leftist demonstrations, not least in protests against summits of international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization. The most recent example was the G20 meeting in July, when large parts of Hamburg, Germany were under siege and private property worth millions of dollars was vandalized. \"Welcome to hell\" was the message.\n\nThe American outfit copycats its elder siblings from across the pond, blending in with democratic leftist groups (acting as self-appointed bodyguards), creating Lenin-style united-front coalitions to gain legitimacy (who is not an anti-fascist?) and applying a very wide definition of the term fascist (most people they don't agree with).\n\nThe extreme-left tradition of misusing terms to their own benefit is not only an Orwellian cliché, but also an historic reality. Remember that the official East German name for the Berlin Wall was \"Antifaschistischer Schutzwall\" or Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart.\n\nIn The Washington Post , Dartmouth historian Mark Bray, author of the recent book Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook , whitewashes the movement , putting forward the argument that Nazis need to be dealt with at an early-stage. But neither libertarians nor Social Democrats are Nazis. Do the ends really justify the means, especially when the end is undemocratic socialism?\n\nIn Germany, with its particular history, freedom of speech is more restricted than in the US. Nazism and its symbols are forbidden. And recently, after the Hamburg riots, authorities closed down a website used to coordinate the extreme-left activities. It is in this context that Americans should remind themselves that the First Amendment also protects authoritarian right-wingers and white supremacists.\n\nJust as its European counterparts, the US Antifa is a mix of mainly left-anarchists and hard-core Marxists. Not trusting the government to protect them from authoritarian right-wing rule, they rely on pre-emptive \"self-defense.\" The more experienced Europeans, working in loose networks and strategically appearing under different group names, opportunistically set up and dissolve bodies as they go along. The same people commit one crime under one banner, going with another headline for the next deed.\n\nOne particular difference is that some European Antifas have close ties to certain labor unions, anarcho-syndicalism being a weak tradition in the US. This is one of the reasons why the struggle against capitalism is considered just as important as the fight against fascism. In fact, the latter is viewed as an integral part of the former.\n\nWhich brings us to the paradoxical enmity between European Antifa and libertarians, something that to my knowledge has not yet revealed itself in the US. In many ways, anarcho-syndicalism/left-anarchism is a cousin of libertarianism, or at least of anarcho-capitalism. After all, the US Anarcho-Syndicalist Review used to be called the Libertarian Labor Review .\n\nSo, should libertarians not be favorably inclined towards a movement that fights authoritarianism and centralization, standing up against the ugly collectivist ideology of racism? Well, it takes two to tango. And Antifa itself does not seem to think we have much in common.\n\nOur beliefs in the rule of law, property rights, and markets are anathema to them. So, on the contrary, they are not allies, but rather a major challenge to the liberty that we cherish. Libertarians do not subscribe to threats, physical violence, and vandalism as political methods. The non-aggression principle, remember?\n\nSomewhat ironically, European Antifa activists tend to belong to the intellectual middle class, later going on to careers in the media and academia. This is one of the reasons why they are handled with kid gloves by parts of the establishment here. Important parts of the chattering classes identify with or are apologetic of the group, a tendency that also seems to be copied in America.\n\nTrue, the very top of the establishment in the US is more inclined to make excuses for the other kind of extremism. So the American problems might not be the same as the European. But beware.\n\nDue to its political sophistication, the Swedish security police reckon that the autonomous leftist groups, of which Antifa is the most important one, constitute a more serious threat to the functioning of the country's democracy than do the two other forces being watched, namely radical Islamists and neo-Nazis.\n\nThe false equivalence is less false in Europe. And may become so in the US as well.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Antifa-vs.-Patriot-Prayer-Related Tort Lawsuit Partly Thrown Out but Partly Allowed to Go Forward\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nFree Speech\n\nEugene Volokh | 1.31.2024 5:30 PM\n\nFrom today's Oregon Court of Appeals decision in Cider Riot, LLC v. Patriot Prayer USA, LLC , in an opinion by Chief Judge Erin Lagesen, joined by Judge Jacqueline Kamins and Megan Jacquot:\n\nPlaintiff Cider Riot, LLC, is a brewery and bar in Northeast Portland. Plaintiff Goldman-Armstrong is its owner and operator. This tort case arises, for the most part, out of a 2019 clash between patrons of Cider Riot, who are associated with Antifa, and, among others, defendants Gibson, Kramer, Ponte, Willis, and Lewis, all of whom are associated with a group or movement known as Patriot Prayer.\n\nDefendant Patriot Prayer USA, LLC, is a limited liability company owned entirely by Gibson. It has no members other than him. Those who identify with Patriot Prayer hold starkly divergent views from those who identify with Antifa. Those divergent views have generated immense hostility, which has led to confrontations, which has resulted in violence between those holding opposing views.\n\nThe clash at the heart of this case began as a heated exchange of political viewpoints between defendants, who were on public property adjacent to the brewery and bar, and plaintiffs' patrons, many of whom were sitting in the bar's outdoor seating area. Ultimately, the verbal dispute escalated into some physical confrontations. This resulted in injuries to some of plaintiffs' patrons and, plaintiffs allege, a range of economic and noneconomic losses. Several days after the incident, Gibson urged people to report Cider Riot to the OLCC. Other individuals made online comments disclosing the names and addresses of plaintiffs' business partners.\n\nFor their involvement in that clash, encouraging complaints to the OLCC, and identifying plaintiffs' business partners, plaintiffs seek to hold all defendants liable for four torts: negligence, trespass, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and intentional interferences with economic relations....\n\nThe Court of Appeals held that some of the claims against Gibson should be thrown out, at the \"anti-SLAPP motion\" stage (a means for claims arising out of constitutionally protected activities to be promptly dismissed), but others-based on Gibson's allegedly personally egging someone on to fight a bar patron-could continue. I focus here on the claims against Gibson because the other individual defendants' defenses were rejected as untimely, and thus weren't substantively discussed by the court.\n\n[a.] Negligence\n\nPlaintiffs' first claim against Gibson is negligence. The gravamen of that claim is that Gibson's prolific and well-publicized activities opposing Antifa created a foreseeable risk of harm to plaintiffs when \"Gibson coordinated with Patriot Prayer members to arrive at Cider Riot\" to \"[t]ake the fight to Antifa.\" Plaintiffs allege that \"[g]iven the repeated extreme incitements of violence against perceived political enemies, it was foreseeable that Defendants' actions would lead to harm to Cider Riot.\" This claim rests largely on evidence of speeches and other statements that Gibson made about Antifa and its association with Cider Riot, as well as evidence of prior violent acts and vandalism against Cider Riot, acts that indicated Antifa was the target.\n\nWe have no doubt that, on this record, a reasonable jury could find that it was foreseeable that Gibson's anti-Antifa advocacy, together with his comments associating Cider Riot with Antifa, would lead to violent or unlawful acts against plaintiffs. But, as explained in Counterman v. Colorado (2023) and Judge Willett's dissenting opinion in Doe v. Mckesson (5th Cir. 2023), the First Amendment does not allow for imposition of liability for speech or for protest organization based on a negligence standard. For that reason, plaintiffs have not established a prima facie case of actionable negligence against Gibson, and the trial court erred in denying the special motion to strike the negligence claim against Gibson.\n\n[b.] Trespass\n\nPlaintiffs' second claim against Gibson is trespass. \"Trespass to real property is an intentional entry upon the land of another by one not privileged to enter.\" Here, plaintiffs have identified no evidence that Gibson entered the Cider Riot property. Indeed, in their discussion of the evidence supporting a prima facie case of trespass, plaintiffs have not pointed to any particular evidence in support of their trespass claim. Rather, their theory on appeal is that Gibson caused others to throw objects or spray pepper spray onto plaintiffs' property. Having reviewed the record on our own, we have been able to locate no evidence that would allow the reasonable inference that Gibson himself directed or authorized third parties to throw objects or spray mace onto plaintiffs' property, that he otherwise directed or authorized third parties to enter plaintiffs' property, or that he ratified any intrusion onto plaintiffs' property. The trial court erred in denying the special motion to strike the trespass claim as to Gibson.\n\n[c.] Intentional infliction of emotional distress\n\nPlaintiff Goldman-Armstrong asserts a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) against defendant Gibson. A prima facie showing of IIED requires a plaintiff to submit sufficient evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find that he met his burden of production for the following elements: \"'(1) the defendant intended to inflict severe emotional distress on the plaintiff, (2) the defendant's acts were the cause of the plaintiff's severe emotional distress, and (3) the defendant's acts constituted an extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct.'\"\n\nHaving reviewed the record, taking into account the protections of the First Amendment, much of the evidence would not allow for the conclusion that Gibson's \"acts constituted an extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct\" in a way that would permit the imposition of liability consistent with the First Amendment. The conduct of Gibson and other individuals involved with Patriot Prayer no doubt caused emotional distress to plaintiff Goldman-Armstrong. The same thing, however, is undoubtedly true with respect to much protest activity targeting a business because such activity interferes with business. In other words, as with the Black Hats in NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware (1982) [who enforced a boycott by taking down the names of people who weren't complying with the boycott, names that were later publicized in the community-EV], protest activity that is protected by the First Amendment may often result in the intended infliction of emotional distress but, because of the First Amendment protections, will not give rise to tort liability.\n\nNevertheless, as the trial court recognized, plaintiff Goldman-Armstrong produced evidence of some conduct by Gibson that would allow for the imposition of liability for IIED consistent with Claiborne Hardware. In support of plaintiffs' prima facie case, Justin Allen averred that he observed Gibson \"encourage and direct defendant Cooper to engage a bar patron in a street fight, saying, 'Go on, go on.'\" Directing a person to engage in physically assaultive conduct is not protected activity under Claiborne Hardware. For that reason, Allen's declaration could support the imposition of tort liability on defendant Gibson.\n\nAlthough the video evidence tends to paint a different picture of events, it does not compel the conclusion that Allen's testimony is inaccurate or that the identified conduct by Gibson is protected by the First Amendment. Furthermore, that conduct of directing someone to engage in a street fight with one of Goldman-Armstrong's patrons could, in context, permit a rational inference that it was intended to [and did] cause Goldman-Armstrong severe emotional distress.... Finally, a factfinder could permissibly conclude not only that the conduct of directing someone to engage plaintiff's patron in a street fight falls outside of the range of conduct protected under Claiborne Hardware , but also that it \"constitute[s] an extraordinary transgression of the bounds of socially tolerable conduct.\" The trial court therefore correctly concluded that Goldman-Armstrong established a prima facie case of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Of course, as in Claiborne Hardware , any eventual judgment for damages would have to be tailored to the damages caused by the particular act of violence that Gibson directed. But such a tailored judgment is permitted by the First Amendment.\n\n[d.] Intentional interference with economic relations\n\nPlaintiffs' final claim is for IIER. The prima facie elements of a claim for IIER are: \"(1) the existence of a professional or business relationship * * *, (2) intentional interference with that relationship, (3) by a third party, (4) accomplished through improper means or for an improper purpose, (5) a causal effect between the interference and damage to the economic relationship, and (6) damages.\"\n\nPlaintiffs predicate this claim both on Gibson's conduct during the May 1 incident, and on his subsequent conduct of encouraging reports about Cider Riot to the OLCC [Oregon Liquor Control Commission]. At least with respect to the May 1 incident, we conclude that plaintiff has established a prima facie case of IIER. Specifically, the same conduct that would support the imposition of liability for IIED would support the imposition of liability for IIER. To the extent that Gibson's conduct of directing a person to engage in a fight with a bar patron interfered with plaintiffs' business relationships by deterring customers from patronizing Cider Riot, and there is some evidence that all the violent acts of May 1 deterred customers, that would support the imposition of liability for IIER on Gibson in way that does not run afoul of Claiborne Hardware.\n\nIn particular, that conduct, along with other evidence in the record, could support a finding that Gibson, a third party to plaintiffs' relationships with their customers, interfered with plaintiffs' relationships with their customers by encouraging assaultive conduct against one of their patrons, something that deterred patrons from patronizing plaintiffs' business, resulting in damages. For that reason, the trial court did not err in denying Gibson's special motion to strike the IIER claim. Of course, as noted above, under Claiborne Hardware , any ultimate damages award would have to be tailored to the harm caused by the specific conduct that is not entitled to First Amendment protection, should a factfinder find in plaintiffs' favor on the other elements of the claim.\n\n{As to Gibson's conduct encouraging reports to the OLCC, plaintiffs did not introduce evidence of the content of those reports but, instead, summarily characterized them as untrue. Absent evidence of the content of the reports demonstrating that the reports were, in fact, false, plaintiffs have not established that they suffered any cognizable damages from Gibson's conduct.}\n\nThe court offered this brief background on Patriot Prayer and Antifa:\n\nAlthough the record in this case does not permit us to describe with confidence the respective ideologies or structures of Patriot Prayer and Antifa, it does permit us to describe with confidence those groups' respective understandings of each other. According to the allegations in the pleadings and the declarations in the record, those associated with Antifa, short for \"anti-fascist,\" view those associated with Patriot Prayer as right-wing extremists, supporting fascism, white nationalism, and xenophobia. Those associated with Patriot Prayer view those associated with Antifa as left-wing extremists, supporting communism and socialism. Each group perceives the other, and what the other stands for, to be a dire threat to their own view of democracy and American values. Each group, in addition, views the other as supporting violence as a means to achieving its goals. The latter perspective has a basis in fact; the record also contains evidence demonstrating that some individuals associated with each group have engaged in acts of violence, and have threatened acts of violence, toward individuals associated with the other group.\n\nAnd here's more from the court on its view of \"First Amendment limitations on negligence liability\":\n\nFor purposes of this case, one final area of First Amendment law warrants discussion. In one claim, plaintiffs seek to hold defendants Gibson and Patriot Prayer, LLC, liable under a negligence theory: that Gibson's speech and related conduct created a foreseeable risk of harm to plaintiffs' business by other individuals. In Counterman , though, the Supreme Court clarified what type of mental state is required to hold a person civilly or criminally liable when the First Amendment is implicated, even if the individual's speech or conduct ultimately falls outside the protection of the First Amendment. In so doing, the Court held that liability may not be imposed under a negligence standard.\n\nAt issue in Counterman was the minimum mental state required for the imposition of liability for threats. The Court explained that although threats are not entitled to First Amendment protection, the Court's case law affords \"'strategic protection'\" to unprotected speech so as to steer wide of the chilling effect created by the potential for civil or criminal liability. One component of that strategic protection \"is to condition liability on the State's showing of a culpable mental state.\" Further, to provide adequate protection, the culpable mental state must be a subjective one: \"[T]he First Amendment precludes punishment, whether civil or criminal, unless the speaker's words were intended (not just likely) to produce imminent disorder.\" An objective mental state standard is not permissible because it creates the risk of self-censorship. For that reason, the First Amendment forbids the use of a negligence standard for the imposition of liability based on speech that, itself, is not entitled to First Amendment protection. Ultimately, the Court concluded that recklessness was a constitutionally sufficient mental state for the imposition of liability for threats under the circumstances at issue in Counterman.\n\nOn this point, we acknowledge that the Fifth Circuit, in a divided decision issued 11 days before Counterman , reached a different conclusion as to whether the First Amendment permits the imposition of tort liability for negligence in organizing or leading protest activity. In Doe v. Mckesson (5th Cir. 2023), that court considered whether Mckesson, the leader of a Black Lives Matter protest in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, could be liable under a negligence theory for serious injuries sustained by a police officer when an unidentified protester-not Mckesson-threw a rock or similar projectile which hit the officer in the face. The majority opinion held that the leader could be liable in negligence to the officer for \"organiz[ing] and direct[ing] the protest in an unreasonably dangerous manner [that] caused the violent encounter that led to [the officer's] injuries,\" rejecting Mckesson's arguments that the First Amendment, as construed in Claiborne Hardware , precluded the imposition of liability on a protest leader for the violent conduct of another, unless the Claiborne Hardware standards were met.\n\n[Judge Willett's] dissenting opinion agreed with Mckesson that, under Claiborne Hardware , Mckesson could not be liable for the unidentified protester's violent act because Mckesson did not \"stray from lawfully exercising his own rights.\" Apart from concluding that Mckesson's own activities did not fall within the categories for which Claiborne Hardware permits imposition of liability, the dissenting opinion also concluded that the First Amendment does not permit the imposition of liability for a third party's violence under a negligence standard: \"[A] protest leader's simple negligence is far too low a threshold for imposing liability for a third party's violence.\" The dissenting opinion, instead, read Claiborne Hardware to require a higher-level mental state because of how a negligence theory of liability \"would have enfeebled America's street-blocking civil rights movement, imposing ruinous financial liability against citizens for exercising core First Amendment freedoms.\" The dissenting opinion explained:\n\n\"Holding Mckesson responsible for the violent acts of others because he 'negligently' led a protest that carried the risk of potential violence is impossible to square with Supreme Court precedent holding only tortious activity meant to incite imminent violence, and likely to do so, forfeits constitutional protection against violent acts committed by others.\"\n\nThus, the dissenting opinion concluded, the First Amendment does not allow for the imposition of liability on a protest leader based on the violent conduct of a protest participant absent some showing that the protest leader committed an intentional tort: \"Summing up: McKesson is not liable for intentional violence, foremost because he did not commit any violence, but at a minimum because he did not commit any intentional tort.\"\n\nAs noted, the Supreme Court decided Counterman shortly after the Fifth Circuit's decision in Mckesson. In its decision, the Court unequivocally rejected a negligence standard for the imposition of liability arising out of speech because such a standard would not adequately insulate the core freedoms protected by the First Amendment from the chilling effect of potential liability. In view of Counterman , we are persuaded that the dissenting opinion in Mckesson was correct to conclude that the First Amendment does not allow for the imposition of liability on a protest leader or an organizer under a negligence theory. {As of this writing, a petition for a writ of certiorari [as to Mckesson ] is pending in the United States Supreme Court.}\n\nJames L.

But the rest of us can do better.\n\nThe problem many Americans had with Trump's weasel words was that Heather Heyer was dead, and many other people injured, in Charlottesville, allegedly at the hands of James Alex Fields, Jr. , a neo-Nazi who drove his car into a crowd in an act of political terrorism. And Fields was in Charlottesville to attend a rally featuring a dollar-store version of a Leni Riefenstahl torch-lit parade , chants of \" Jews will not replace us ,\" and racist speakers like Richard Spencer , who openly support Trump. A little specificity in placing blame would seem to be in order, but was prominent by its absence in Trump's comments.\n\n\"One has to take sides,\" Shuja Haider wrote at Jacobin , echoing other voices on the left. \"There is a side that asserts our common humanity and fights fascism, racism, and hate. It was represented in Charlottesville by the leftist groups who took to the streets to confront the far right. The other side is the one that took innocent lives on those same streets.\"\n\nTake a side? You bet. But Haider and company are trying to force a false choice. They'd have you believe that advocates of free speech, open society, tolerance, and peaceful political change have to pick between fascists with tiki torches and masked \"anti-fascists\" clashing with them in the streets. But advocates of a free, open, and liberal society are a side-the correct side-and the left-wing and right-wing thugs battling in the streets are nothing more than rival siblings from a dysfunctional illiberal family.\n\nIn June, James Hodgkinson opened fire on Republican members of Congress gathered for a baseball practice. That the supporter of Occupy Wall Street and former Bernie Sanders volunteer sent six people, including Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), to the hospital instead of the morgue was a consequence not of better intentions than his soulmate, Fields, but rather a result of fortunately bad aim.\n\nBefore that, left-wing protesters violently shut down a Middlebury College speech by Charles Murray , injuring Professor Alison Stanger in the process, rioted over a speech by professional provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, and forced the cancellation of a Republican parade in Portland, Oregon, with promises that \"the police cannot stop us from shutting down roads.\" They boast of their contempt for free speech .\n\nRight-wing and left-wing mobs seem to have a few preferred Thunderdome venues where they set up regular fight-club dates. \"For reasons political and geographic, Berkeley has become a particularly common battleground,\" reports the Los Angeles Times . \"They will glom themselves onto a tax day rally, a Trump rally, but there is a subgroup of extremists on both sides who are angling for a street battle,\" said criminal sociologist Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino.\n\nFight-club dates? Yes. This is an old and unoriginal kabuki theater of political violence, echoing another period when demoralized advocates of liberal democracy were urged to pick between competing brands of illiberalism as if their own set of principles didn't represent a side in itself.\n\n\"Antifa traces its roots to the 1920s and '30s, when militant leftists battled fascists in the streets of Germany, Italy, and Spain,\" notes Peter Beinart in The Atlantic .\n\nPartisans of \"pick a side\" insist that every mention of violence by both right-wing and left-wing thugs is an exercise in \"whataboutism.\" That is, an attempt to deflect from one's own sins by invoking the misdeeds of the opposition. In the case of Donald Trump's hemming and hawing over Charlottesville, that's likely true. Asked to comment on a terrorist act by a neo-Nazi at a rally of racists and neo-Nazis who have vocally lent the sitting president their support, an invocation of \"many sides\" sounds an awful lot like whataboutism intended to shift blame from his friends.\n\nBut for those of us already calling out the violent bigots flaunting Nazi imagery, it's not whataboutism to point out that an alleged alternative isn't actually an alternative at all-it's just another version of the same thing. As New York Times reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg tweeted from Charlottesville, \"The hard left seemed as hate-filled as alt-right. I saw club-wielding 'antifa' beating white nationalists being led out of the park.\" She later, understandably, changed \"hate-filled\" to \"violent,\" since actions are clearer and more important than motivations. And CNN's Jake Tapper commented that \"At least two journalists in Charlottesville were assaulted by people protesting the Klan/Nazi/alt-right rally.\"\n\nBut is it fair to compare the violent far left in our streets to the violent far right opposing them? The left-wing antifa activists claim to be opposing the powers-that-be.\n\nIt's certainly true that the violent right generally supports President Trump. Given that support, his hesitancy about criticizing even the most extreme Nazi imagery and lethal violence (he did call out \" racist violence \" two days later, then walked it back ) creates the impression that, if he isn't explicitly sympathetic to the marching morons at Charlottesville, he at least enjoys basking in the scented glow of tiki torches. If we're balancing dangers on the great scale of suckage, that connection to the White House would seem to make the fascist right the more immediate threat.\n\nBut that doesn't mean we have to pick a competing brand of ideological awfulness as a viable alternative to fascism. The thugs on the left have already proved themselves to be violent and intolerant. There's no reason to favor one illiberal force over another when our country has a long history based on much different, and much better, political principles.\n\n\"Sooner or later... one has to take sides-if one is to remain human,\" Haider writes, quoting a character from Graham Greene's The Quiet American . \"The liberal center has to heed the same warning,\" Haider adds. \"In order to reject Trump's equivocations about 'many sides,' we have to take one.\"\n\nBut the character Haider quotes is a member of Vietnam's Communist party-which killed \"probably about 1,040,000\" people in the post-Vietnam War period, after it came to power over the united country, as estimated by the late Prof. R. J. Rummel of the University of Hawaii. What about that? That's an unpalatable side to pick in any situation.\n\nWe do have to pick a side. But we already have one. Despite our many differences over specific policies, most Americans have traditionally supported the side of liberty, tolerance, free speech, and peaceful political change, within broad parameters. That side is in opposition to the violent, authoritarian thugs of the right and of the left. If we regain our faith in what we already have, there's no reason to choose between rival siblings competing to rule over the ruins of everything that's worthwhile on behalf of their illiberal family.\n\nThe Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D.

      "text": "What Would It Mean for President Trump to Declare Antifa a \"Domestic Terrorist Organization\"?\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nFree Speech\n\nEugene Volokh | 6.7.2020 5:55 PM\n\nA week ago, President Trump said:\n\nThe United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020\n\nIt's not clear to me, though, what (if anything) this substantively means. The Secretary of State can designate foreign groups \" Foreign Terrorist Organizations ,\" which makes it a crime for people to give them various \"material support or resources\" (see, e.g., Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project (2010) )-which includes giving them money and other tangible goods, giving them your services (by joining them and doing work under their control), giving them certain kinds of advice, and the like. But I don't know of any law that would similarly cover domestic groups, such as Antifa. (There are of course people in other countries that call themselves \"Antifa,\" and doubtless there is some communication among American and foreign people who labeled themselves this way, but I can't see how that would be enough to trigger the statute, especially given the First Amendment.)\n\nNow of course there is already a well-established legal category for domestic terrorist or otherwise criminal organization: conspiracies. If people are conspiring to burn or bomb or even just vandalize abortion clinics, or animal research facilities, or synagogues, or buildings that happen to be near demonstrations, or for that matter the property of a rival mafia family or street gang, that's of course a crime. And there are particular crimes defined as \" domestic terrorism \"-\"activities that\":\n\n(A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State;\n\n(B) appear to be intended--\n\n(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;\n\n(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion;  or\n\n(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping;  and\n\n(C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\n\nWhen people conspire to commit such crimes, they may indeed be a sort of domestic terrorist organization (or, if you prefer, a conspiracy to commit domestic terrorism). Abstractly advocating or praising such behavior isn't a crime, and is indeed protected by the First Amendment. Indeed, joining an ideological group that has some unlawful ends is constitutionally protected unless it's done with the \"specific intent of assisting in achieving the unlawful ends of the organization.\" But engaging in various kinds of violence is a crime-and is constitutionally unprotected-as is conspiring with others to do so (which is to say, generally speaking, deliberately agreeing to work with them in their criminal projects).\n\nStill, there's no legal significance in labeling a particular conspiracy or set of conspiracies a \"domestic terrorist organization,\" or in using that label for a political movement. Perhaps it might send a signal to federal investigators and prosecutors to look at the organization more closely-as they would generally be free to do, even as to ideological groups, when there's serious reason to think that those groups are actively planning criminal conduct. I certainly hope that the FBI and DoJ have closely investigated all sorts of violent ideological groups like that, and are continuing to do so for any other such groups that continue to be threats, whether they are white supremacists or radical leftists or ecoterrorists or violent anti-abortion groups. But, as best I can tell, all the government can do with regard to those domestic groups (again, unlike designated foreign terrorist organizations) is investigate them and prosecute their members for actual conspiracies to commit specific criminal acts.\n\nUPDATE: Kevin Gerson, Director of the UCLA Law Library, notes that domestic terrorist organization status does matter in one context: 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(B)(vi)(II) , which provides that alien members of designated terrorist organizations-foreign or domestic-are not to be allowed into the U.S. So President Trump's planned designation might mean that alien members of domestic Antifa who are trying to come to the U.S. won't be allowed to enter, and may even be deported . I doubt that this would have much effect on Antifa, and I doubt that this is what most voters would expect from President Trump's statement, but there it is.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Antifa Still Wants to Punch the Two Dozen Damp, Sad Nazis Who Showed Up at Unite the Right II\n\nAlt-Right\n\nJoe Setyon | 8.12.2018 9:40 PM\n\n\"I really think we should just ignore them,\" counterprotester Glen Hellman told Reason outside the Vienna Metro station this morning, where Unite the Right II rally participants boarded a subway headed into downtown D.C. \"We're validating them, and that is a problem,\" he added, describing himself as \"torn\" over whether to ignore the rally or protest it.\n\nAs expected , it was a chaotic scene outside the White House on this rainy Sunday, as white nationalists staged a rally in the nation's capital.\n\nBut the core \"Unite the Right II\" group managed to draw only about two dozen people , compared with thousands who showed up in response, including plenty of anti-fascist (antifa) and Black Lives Matter (BLM) protesters.\n\nThe white nationalist rally in Washington, D.C., served as a sequel to last year's Unite the Right event in Charlottesville, Virginia, where violent clashes broke out and one counterprotester, Heather Heyer, was killed. In light of the events in Charlottesville, D.C. authorities made sure they were prepared for unrest. There was a huge police presence in Lafayette Square (where the rally was held) and the surrounding area. Cops guarded the white nationalist protesters wherever they went.\n\nThere just weren't that many of them. Rally organizer Jason Kessler predicted in his National Park Service permit that 400 people would participate. Less than 30 actually showed up.\n\nThe rally's actual size didn't stop antifa protesters from getting all riled up. Decked out in black with their faces covered, they screamed chants like, \"Any time, any place, punch a Nazi in the face\" and \"Whose streets? Our streets!\"\n\nBut there were also plenty of level-headed counterprotesters, like Hellman.\n\n\"Anti-fascism isn't just punching Nazis in the face. It's giving food out to people who don't have food,\" says Marina, who declined to give her last name.\n\nMany counterprotesters say they support the white nationalists' right to hold a rally. \"Everybody has to have a right to free speech, but man, there can be some disgusting messages out there,\" one anonymous protester told Reason . \"You can't stop it. That's the way our country is built.\"\n\nPaul Mitchell, a counterprotester wearing a U.S. Army veteran cap, compared the white nationalists' right to hold a rally to NFL players' right to kneel during the pre-game playing of the national anthem. \"I would never do it, but I do support their right to make a statement,\" he says.\n\nThe range of emotions was perfectly represented by the variety of signs counterprotesters were clutching outside the Vienna Metro station. Some, like \"Hate has no home here\" and \"We were all created equal\" had anti-hate, pro-equality messages. Other signs were much blunt. \"Give them a platform,\" read one, next to an illustration of a guillotine. \"Fuck you fascist fuck,\" read another.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "This Liberal Carried an American Flag to Protest Fascism in Portland. Antifa Cracked His Head Open With a Bat.\n\nAntifa\n\nRobby Soave | 8.21.2018 8:55 AM\n\nPaul Welch is not a fascist. He is a liberal who voted for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary, and for Hillary Clinton in the general election. On August 4, he attended a far-right rally in Portland, Oregon, as a counterdemonstrator intent on signaling his opposition to the \"tacitly fascist event,\" he told The Oregonian.\n\nTell that to Antifa: One of the masked militants attacked Welch, striking him over and over again with some kind of metal rod concealed in black cloth. One blow landed on his head, which caused Welch to immediately crumple to the ground. He would eventually need four staples to close up the gaping wound.\n\nHow did Antifa misidentify Welch? He had brought an American flag with him in an attempt to take the symbol back from Patriot Prayer, the group holding the rally. According to The Oregonian :\n\n\"The right and certainly a lot of smaller groups like Patriot Prayer might rush to things like the flag and try to take it up as, 'This is our symbol exclusively,'\" [Welch] said. \"Part of my thinking was to take it back.\"\n\nAside from a few odd looks, Welch did not encounter any problems when he joined hundreds of other counter-protesters who gathered at City Hall late that morning.\n\nIn fact, Welch said, he saw several other people with American flags sprinkled among the group of progressives, union members and social justice activists.\n\nBut then, two members of Antifa confronted him and demanded he hand over the flag, which they characterized as a \"fascist symbol.\" When Welch resisted, they attacked him. The concussion landed him in the hospital for two days.\n\nIt was, of course, wrong to attack Welch regardless of his political views. Even if Welch had been a Trump-worshipping alt-right troll, the masked man still had no right to try to take Welch's flag and club him over the head when he resisted. This was an ill-founded and immoral initiation of violence, full stop.\n\nBut it's also a good reminder of why Antifa's resistance strategy, punch Nazis in the streets, wherever and whenever they appear , is deeply misguided. Not everybody who attends a protest is a Nazi. Not everyone who waves an American flag is a fascist. Not every Republican is racist ( Queer Eye 's Jonathan Van Ness is right ). A group that endorses political violence while claiming that everyone who isn't with them is against them, and that centrists are essentially fascist collaborators, is not a group that is making careful distinctions or thoughtfully considering its tactical approach. A broad endorsement of violence as a resistance tactic is certain to result in innocent people getting hurt, and to turn the moderate masses away from whatever it is Antifa supposedly represents. As a general matter, civil resistance works and violent protests backfire .\n\nIt's easy to abuse the whole \"See, this is why Trump won!\" thing. But beating the crap out of a liberal because he committed the sin of carrying an American flag does in fact seem like it belongs in the win-for-Trump column. If the left wants to defeat Trump, the worst thing it can do is make people fear Antifa more than they fear the administration.\n\nUpdate: This post initially gave the wrong first name for Welch.

      "text": "What Is Antifa?\n\nThe loose coalition of left-wing militants isn't the clandestine terrorist organization that the president says it is. But it's still a lot more dangerous than many progressives claim.\n\nThe rioting caught Simon Hinton by surprise. \"It started on Friday with a protest for George Floyd,\" he says. \"I don't even think the cops were expecting things to explode.\" But what began as a peaceful demonstration in Omaha, Nebraska, got out of control quickly : Suddenly, \"almost 1,000 people were in the streets in a massive battle between cops and protesters,\" Hinton says. \"And from that point on through the rest of the night, it was just a mess.\"\n\nThat's more or less what Hinton, 25, had been hoping for. The self-professed revolutionary communist attended the protest with his comrades to \"try to agitate things politically,\" he tells me. And it worked: \"It grew exponentially. Next thing you know, there's like 700 to 1,000 people in the street, marching straight down Dodge Street.\"\n\nThe rioters faced off against a wall of riot police for hours, even briefly attempting to construct a makeshift barricade in the middle of the street using drywall and plywood from a nearby dumpster. \"It was just all out war at that point,\" Hinton says. \"I mean, cops just tear-gassing indiscriminately.\"\n\nThe scene in Omaha was mirrored throughout the country. As thousands gathered to protest the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, a wave of looting and violent rioting swept many major cities, overwhelming local police departments and resulting in 17 deaths . But there continues to be widespread disagreement over which groups bear primary responsibility for the chaos that accompanied peaceful protests. Many argue that the looters were low-level opportunists using the unrest as occasion to break into unprotected stores while law enforcement was distracted; others see a significant portion of deliberate violence that seemed to be explicitly political in nature.\n\nThe latter claim continues to be difficult to verify: The nature of the protest-related political violence remains murky, and fundamental questions about its perpetrators are still unanswered. But testimonies from purported agitators like Hinton, paired with reports from many major cities, seem to give credence to the suspicion that the destructive uprisings throughout the country were at least partially the handiwork of a radical political contingent at the fringes of recent protests: Antifa.\n\nAntifa, a loose collection of far-left activists who describe themselves benignly as \"anti-fascist\" and are distinguished both by their outward-facing appearance and their disruptive tactics, have become the favorite bogeyman of the right.\n\nPresident Trump went so far as to declare on Twitter that his administration would \"be designating ANTIFA as a terrorist group\" last week-provoking a flurry of speculation regarding the president's legal authority to designate domestic terrorist groups-and Attorney General William Barr released a similar statement soon after, reading: \"The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\" But it's still unclear whether this violence stemmed from a coherently organized movement or a decentralized coalition of smaller militant groups.\n\nIt's often difficult to discern the official, monolithic \"Antifa\" from smaller, disconnected organizations that adopt the group's traditional appearance and tactics. Activists who associate themselves with Antifa usually dress in \" black bloc \"-clothed in black from head to toe with face-masks to conceal their individual identities-and are notorious for their propensity for violent confrontation in a variety of settings, most commonly on the margins of contemporary left-wing protest movements but also in direct conflict with right-wing and alt-right groups..\n\nBut beyond that, \"it's really not its own group at this point,\" says Hinton, who regularly participates in local anti-fascist demonstrations. \"Like, there's no one group that really meets that definition. It's largely just other militant leftist groups wearing black bloc. There's so many people that just wear all black and masks to these things regardless, without any sort of affiliation with Antifa.\"\n\nThere are some exceptions to this description: In cities like Portland, Oregon, where large numbers of Antifa activists regularly hold demonstrations with minimal resistance from the police , Antifa is a formal organization with a public website, leadership structure and network. \"In places like Oregon, there's a much larger presence and you can get hundreds of people to march together en masse, \" Hinton acknowledges. Elsewhere, \"that's not really the situation.\"\n\nBut regardless of the state of their organizing structure, the militants associated with Antifa or Antifa-adjacent leftist groups throughout the country all adhere to a set of uniformly identifiable ideological precepts, undergirded by a violent radicalism that sets them apart from more mainstream progressive movements. Most identify as either anarchists or communists and are united by a desire to overthrow the existing social order, despite lacking a centralized leadership structure. Although the tensions between the group's anarchic and communistic elements are occasionally challenging, those doctrinal disputes are \"long-term differences,\" Hinton says. \"Right now, they're not important, because we're just focused on pushing a unified anti-capitalist and revolutionary politic to the masses and getting more regular people to radicalize.\"\n\nThe group's participants are also united by an antipathy toward liberal notions of free speech and a deep skepticism of the normal democratic avenues for affecting political change. This persistent illiberalism is the foundation of Antifa's militancy, which stems from the conviction that violent, extra-legal action is necessary to further their political goals. \"You can't condemn violence inherently. Sometimes we reach a point where it should be utilized,\" says \"Tashi,\" a Toronto-based Antifa activist who asked that his real name not be used. \"There's a moral or ethical difference between the violence of a white supremacist and that of somebody who punches Richard Spencer. And I think that the problem with liberalism and liberal politics is that within the confinements of the law, within the confinements of our political discourse, those two things are equated. And that's dangerous, to equate those two kinds of things.\"\n\nIn the years since the group's emergence on the national stage, they have used violence to disrupt events that adherents deem to be \"fascist\" or to contain otherwise intolerable ideas. In many ways, this is the raison d'être that unites the loose network of Antifa affiliates across the country: a militant commitment to preventing the far-right from gaining a platform. In his influential 2017 Anti-Fascist Handbook , Mark Bray writes: \"Anti-fascists have concluded that since the future is unwritten, and fascism often emerges out of small, marginal groups, every fascist or white-supremacist group should be treated as if they could be Mussolini's one hundred fasci, or the fifty-four members of the German Workers' Party that provided Hitler's first stepping stone.\" And, Hinton adds, one of Antifa's main goals is \"to educate the public on how fascism is still really a threat. Because when you talk about fascists, a lot of people tend to think they don't have any relevance, or they all died in the forties. But that's really not the case. A lot of new groups like Identity Evropa and Patriot Front couch their fascism in a more moderate tone, but in reality, they're all still white supremacists.\"\n\nAs a result of this militant anti-fascism, many Antifa activists see classically liberal concepts of free speech as unacceptable. \"More mainstream traditional concepts of protesting and protesting tactics are rooted in the idea that we must work within the consignments of the law,\" says Tashi. \"The perspective of people in Antifa is that the social order we live in and its false notions of free speech have maintained and reinforced structures of white supremacy. And we need to reactively make sure that [fascists] are not able to influence or otherwise participate in public discourse.\"\n\nThe problem, however, is that many purported anti-fascists have expanded the definition of \"fascism\" to encapsulate a broad range of mainstream political philosophies that they find distasteful. Self-identified Antifa activists have subsequently begun to violently disrupt and shut down conservative speakers like Ben Shapiro whose speech they deem to be dangerous, and have even physically attacked attendees at a variety of fringe right-wing rallies and gatherings. As a result, Antifa has become the veritable bête noir of the American right. The president and his surrogates have even taken to using the group for campaign emails .\n\nIn contrast, progressives have generally been more skeptical that Antifa poses any real threat at all to the public order: Although some prominent Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi have felt obligated to distance themselves from the organization, many on the left have called it a trumped-up right-wing myth deployed either to energize the Republican base or distract from larger issues . Some have even gone so far as to actively defend the group, arguing that its nominal \"we're just opposed to fascism\" position is analogous to American soldiers fighting Nazis in World War II . (\"Biggest antifa rally in history,\" reads a recent tweet from NPR's Mara Liasson, attached to a map of the American invasion of Normandy).\n\nBut the events of the past few weeks should give pause to those who are tempted to soft-pedal the group's character: Although it's admittedly difficult to determine their membership in a singular organization, Antifa or Antifa-affiliated militants are clearly responsible for some portion of the recent violence in major metropolitan areas throughout the country. In this most recent endeavor, these activists have graduated from disrupting the occasional right-wing demonstration to a more dangerously violent level of criminal activity, often enabled by local progressive leadership that sees left-wing radicalism as a non-issue. This past week, for example, armed Antifa activists in Seattle chased law enforcement out of the Capitol Hill neighborhood-sending multiple officers to the hospital in the process-and established a lawless \"autonomous zone,\" empowered by a sympathetic Seattle City Council that is largely uninterested in supporting police efforts to reclaim the area. Multiple City Council members actively supported the activists' efforts, with one-Kshama Sawant, a councilwoman from the Socialist Alternative Party-going so far as to travel to the hostage neighborhood and give encouraging speeches .\n\nThis disorder will likely persist if political leaders continue to refuse to take leftist militancy seriously. Antifa is hardly the clandestine terrorist organization that President Trump makes it out to be, but the group's political goals, while often ideologically murky, promote violence and destruction. Riots \"are a good thing,\" says Hinton. \"It's a practical, material way of giving people experience in how to fight the state and showing that it's possible. Rioting also serves a purpose in building a more militant consciousness, and demonstrating the need for revolt more generally, not just around these specific issues every once in a while.\"\n\n\"I think it very quickly and very easily demonstrates what the two sides actually are, you know?\" he adds. \"Because when there's a riot, the whole 'well there's some good cops, there's some good businesses, blah blah blah,' that goes out the window. There's two sides, and two sides only.\"\n\nOn at least one count, Hinton is right: Rioting and looting do serve to further polarize communities throughout America. Productive political discourse is made nearly impossible by mass lawlessness. For activists in the Antifa movement, this is precisely the point: The chaos caused by civic unrest drives our society one step closer to all-out war, which the radicals see as the precursor to revolution. But for those who eschew the wild-eyed utopianism of the revolutionaries and maintain a measured belief in our political system's ability to correct its faults, the battles currently being waged in our streets are an alarming threat to the basic ideals of liberal democracy. Left-wing militants have little use for these ideals; this, of course, is only to be expected. But the apathetic, faint-hearted politicians who have allowed for this chaos should still know better.\n\nNate Hochman ( @njhochman ) is a summer Intercollegiate Studies Institute fellow for The Dispatch.\n\nPhotograph by  Barry Chin/Boston Globe/Getty Images.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "Did Merrick Garland Deny Antifa Attacks Were Domestic Terrorism Because They Happened at Night?\n\nThe attorney general nominee drew a distinction between events that disrupt democratic processes and those that entail property damage.\n\nFollowing the Senate confirmation hearings for attorney general nominee Merrick Garland, viral posts on social media claimed that he said Antifa attacks on federal property were not domestic terrorism because they occured at night.\n\nDuring the hearing, Garland highlighted the Department of Justice's responsibility to \"battl[e] extremist attacks on our democratic institutions\" and described the January 6 attack on the Capitol as \"the most heinous attack on the democratic process\" he'd ever seen. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) asked Garland, \"Do you regard assaults on federal courthouses or other federal property as attacks of domestic extremism, domestic terrorism?\" Hawley referred specifically to Portland and Seattle, pointing to the attacks on the Hatfield Federal Courthouse and the William Kenzo Nakamura Courthouse that occurred during left-wing protests.\n\nGarland responded:\n\n\"Well senator, my own definition, which is about the same as the statutory definition, is the use of violence or threats of violence in an attempt to disrupt the democratic processes. So an attack on a courthouse while in operation, trying to prevent judges from actually deciding cases, that plainly is domestic extremism, domestic terrorism. An attack simply on a government property at night or any other circumstances is a clear crime and a serious one and should be punished. I don't know enough about the facts of the example you're talking about, but that's where I draw the line. One is-both are criminal, one is a core attack on our democratic institutions.\"\n\nMany of these posts actually included video of Garland's remarks, though the accompanying captions still misleadingly left out his distinction between interrupting the democratic process and attacking an empty building, suggesting that he said it was the time of day that mattered instead.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

Mark Finchem released a statement in which he claimed \"the use of facial recognition software\" proved Antifa was present at the storming of the Capitol. He also wrote that participants were \"positively identified as Antifa infiltrators.\"\n\nRepresentative @MarkFinchem has released a statement. #AZleg https://t.co/gd3S7u3row pic.twitter.com/UEjZYENU3a\n\n- Arizona House Republicans (@AZHouseGOP) January 11, 2021\n\nThere is still no evidence that Antifa infiltrated the riot. Finchem appears to be referencing the already-debunked Washington Times article that claimed that facial recognition software company XRVision identified two Antifa members among the rioters. They didn't-in fact XRVision says it identified two neo-Nazis. As outlined at length in a previous fact check , numerous Trump supporters have been identified among those who stormed the Capitol. While it remains possible that out of the thousands of individuals present during the riot some may have been Antifa members, there's nothing to suggest they led or incited the riot. In fact, Trump supporters discussed violence and attacking Congress at length in the lead-up to January 6 on pro-Trump discussion boards and social media platforms as well. And some known Trump supporters photographed and took video of their participation in the assault.\n\nOn Saturday, Jessica Davis, a press representative for the FBI, told The Dispatch Fact Check : \"At this time we have no credible intelligence suggesting Antifa involvement in Wednesday's criminal activity. However, the investigation is ongoing and we are aggressively working to identify all individuals involved, no matter their association.\" Other officials with the FBI and the Department of Justice have made similar statements denying evidence of Antifa's participation in the attack on Congress.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "Debunking the Conspiracy Theories Claiming That Antifa Led the Attack on the Capitol\n\nRight-wing groups were planning online for weeks to protest the electoral vote count.\n\nFollowing the storming of Capitol Hill by Trump supporters on Wednesday, many on the pro-Trump right attempted to shift blame for the attack to Antifa instead. Two connected conspiracy theories started to spread: one claiming that two men at the riot had been identified as leftists and Antifa members, the other claiming that a facial recognition software company had identified two Antifa members at the siege. Both conspiracies appear to be referring to the same two men, neither of whom have actually been identified as Antifa members-one is, in fact, a rather prominent QAnon believer-and the facial recognition software company claims it actually identified two neo-Nazis at the attack, not two Antifa members.\n\nThe New York Post shared a variant of these conspiracies in an article that claimed two rioters had been recognized as Antifa members, citing an anonymous law enforcement source. The article attempts to differentiate this conspiracy from others by noting that the two supposed Antifa members were from New York, unlike the other conspiracy theories that claimed the two Antifa members were from Philadelphia. The article does not provide information about who the two Antifa members are or how they were recognized, and does not include images or anything of substance to back up the claim. Regardless, the article went viral on social media.\n\nThese conspiracies gained incredible traction quickly, thanks to being shared by prominent figures such as Lin Wood, Sarah Palin , Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton , and Rep. Matt Gaetz , who made the claim both on social media and during a speech on the House floor. The idea that the attack was a false flag operation by Antifa has now taken on a life of its own, and many are making the claim without offering evidence based solely on the view that such behavior didn't seem typical for Republicans. Rush Limbaugh, for example, stated on his January 7 show that \"Republicans do not join protest mobs. They do not loot and they don't riot. To the grand disappointment of many people. But a tiny minority of these protesters, and undoubtedly including some antifa Democrat sponsored instigators, did decide to go to the Capitol to protest the people's House.\" Laura Ingraham suggested on her January 6 show that the rioters might not be Trump supporters because of \"those knee pads and all the pads on their elbows\" which she said she'd never seen at a Trump rally before.\n\nOthers didn't outright claim Antifa was definitely behind the attack, but attempted to cast doubt on the idea that Trump supporters were behind the chaos by \"just asking questions\" and encouraging people not to rush to judgement.\n\nPlease, don't be like #FakeNewsMedia , don't rush to judgment on assault on Capitol. Wait for investigation. All may not be (and likely is not) what appears. Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.\n\nEvidence follows:\n\n- Mo Brooks (@RepMoBrooks) January 7, 2021\n\nThis has all the hallmarks of Antifa provocation. https://t.co/HJLN3Ijn4K\n\n- Paul Gosar (@DrPaulGosar) January 6, 2021\n\nA rumor has also started that Antifa members were bused into D.C. The rumor appears to have originated with Twitter user Paul Sperry, a journalist who falsely accused National Security Council official Victoria Coates of being the author of the New York Times \"Anonymous\" op-ed. Sperry cited a \"former FBI agent\" serving as the source of information for this claim. Ken Kohl, a current official at the Department of Justice, told reporters on Friday: \"We have no indication of [Antifa presence at the riot] at this time.\" Steven D'Antuono, an assistant director at the FBI, echoed Kohl, telling reporters on a call that there is \"no indication\" Antifa participated in the riot.\n\nSome also claimed that the D.C. police escorted Antifa buses into the rally. The police department denies having escorted any group, and the video used as proof has been circulating since at least December of last year. It appears to show a protest outside of the Minnesota governor's home.\n\nWhile it is, of course, possible that a crowd of tens of thousands of individuals included troublemakers with ties to Antifa or other left-wing groups, there is no evidence to suggest that Antifa members were among those who stormed the Capitol. There is, however, an abundance of evidence demonstrating that Trump-supporting radicals participated in the siege. A number of pro-Trump accounts livestreamed the attack on Congress on social media platforms, including prominent far-right figures Nick Fuentes and Tim Gionet (better known as \"Baked Alaska\") who livestreamed themselves breaking into Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office. Derrick Evans, a Republican member of West Virginia's legislature, broadcast himself breaching the Capitol. A Proud Boy \"elder\" was among many who shared a selfie from Congress on social media.\n\nOther people who participated in the attack on Congress have been identified as well. Noted QAnon and Trump supporter Jake Angeli drew lots of attention with his face paint and horned hat. Kristina Malimon, a Turning Point USA ambassador who gained notoriety for organizing a Trump boat parade that sank a non-participating boat, was arrested along with her mother for unlawful entry due to her alleged participation in the storming of the Capitol. Ashli Babbitt, who died after being shot while breaking through a window in the Capitol, was an ardent QAnon believer and Trump supporter. Many others openly identified themselves to reporters, such as Richard Barnett, who bragged about a letter from Nancy Pelosi's office. Barnett is a member of the pro-Trump group 2A NWA Stand and has posted white nationalist comments on social media. A number of participants were identified after sharing videos and pictures of themselves from the storming of the Capitol. After the names of those arrested for their participation in the siege were made public, news outlets looked through social media platforms and interviewed those who knew them, identifying them as Trump supporters.\n\nEven if there were Antifa members present-again, a claim lacking proof-all evidence still points to Trump supporters as the ringleaders of the attack. After Trump encouraged his supporters to come to D.C. on January 6-and after he had spent weeks making the false claim that the election had been stolen-plans were crafted on fringe right-wing media platforms and discussion boards in the weeks leading up to the siege, with plans for sneaking weapons into the rally openly discussed.\n\nAll available evidence indicates that Trump supporters, not Antifa members or liberals in disguise, were responsible for the violence and destruction that took place on Capitol Hill Wednesday. There is no current evidence to support claims to the contrary.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

Several politicians, including Rep. Matt Gaetz and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton , referenced this article while claiming that Antifa was behind the attack on Congress Wednesday.\n\nThe conspiracy has clear parallels to another conspiracy that identified two men as Antifa members- fact checked on January 6 -citing some of the same \"evidence.\" The Washington Times article claimed \"One has a tattoo that indicates he is a Stalinist sympathizer.\" The already-debunked conspiracy claimed that one man was part of Philly Antifa and had a Communist hammer and sickle-the man was misidentified and his tattoo was a video game symbol. The Washington Times article also claims that \"XRVision also has identified another man who, while not known to have Antifa links, is someone who shows up at climate and Black Lives Matter protests in the West.\" The already-debunked conspiracy claimed that one rioter has been seen at a BLM protest in Arizona-he was actually a prominent QAnon and Trump supporter who was seen regularly at right-wing rallies in Arizona.\n\nBut beyond that, it appears XRVision never actually identified Antifa members at the riot: The company's attorney issued a statement to BuzzFeed decrying the Washington Times article as \"outright false, misleading, and defamatory.\" While the attorney admitted XRVision had performed facial analysis for \"private consumption and not for publication,\" he claimed that the analysis identified two members of neo-Nazi organizations and said that he reached out to the Washington Times to demand a retraction and apology. Some questions have been raised about XRVision's analysis, as the company has not gone through a testing procedure commonly used by biometric companies. Their identification of one neo-Nazi at the rally may be in error, as both individuals have tattoos on their right hands that do not appear to match .\n\nFacial recognition software did not identify two Antifa members at the storming of Congress, and there remains no evidence that Antifa was behind the event.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "The Morning Dispatch: A Primer on Antifa\n\nPlus, the latest moves to eliminate symbols of the Confederacy.\n\nHappy Wednesday! It sure is nice having six extra hands aboard. How did the old guard survive these past eight months?\n\nAs of Tuesday night, 1,985,670 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the United States (an increase of 25,028 from yesterday) and 111,989 deaths have been attributed to the virus (an increase of 999 from yesterday), according to the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dashboard , leading to a mortality rate among confirmed cases of 5.6 percent (the true mortality rate is likely much lower, between 0.4 percent and 1.4 percent, but it's impossible to determine precisely due to incomplete testing regimens). Of 21,048,183 coronavirus tests conducted in the United States (432,880 conducted since yesterday), 9.4 percent have come back positive.\n\nDespite ongoing economic damage from the coronavirus, the stock market has rebounded strongly in recent days. The S&P 500 briefly reached its January 1 peak on Monday (although it remains below its February highs), while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index finished at a record high Tuesday.\n\nPresident Trump, channeling a conspiracy theory that has percolated in far-right media, accused a 75-year-old man who was assaulted by Buffalo riot police last week of being a possible \"ANTIFA provocateur\" who \"fell harder than he was pushed.\" Asked about the accusation, Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney denounced it while countless other GOP senators uncomfortably avoided the question.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders pushed back against activists' calls to defund the police yesterday, telling the New Yorker that he wants police officers to be better paid, better educated, and better trained to help end police brutality. \"Do I think we should not have police departments in America? No, I don't. There's no city in the world that does not have police departments. ... I think we want to redefine what police departments do, give them the support they need to make their jobs better defined.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott, the sole black Republican in the Senate, is putting together a GOP police reform proposal, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday. The package would likely increase funding for training and strengthen police reporting requirements but would not include measures like qualified immunity reform that bills proposed by Democrats and Libertarian Rep. Justin Amash have included.\n\nGeorge Floyd was laid to rest in Houston yesterday after a private funeral that was attended by close friends and family members. Rev. Al Sharpton delivered the eulogy, and Joe Biden spoke during the service via video message.\n\nIn the wake of violent rioting, President Trump last week declared his administration would \"be designating ANTIFA as a terrorist group.\" Questions over Trump's legal authority to designate domestic terrorist groups aside, the tweet was indicative of an emergent line of thinking on the right that placed blame on Antifa for much of the violence cropping up in the middle of widespread anti-police brutality protests. But the tweet also raised a more foundational-and more difficult-question: What exactly is Antifa?\n\nAntifa-shorthand for \"anti-fascist\"-is generally understood as a loose collection of far-left activists who are distinguished both by their outward-facing appearance and their disruptive tactics. FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress last year the bureau views Antifa \"as more of an ideology than an organization.\"\n\nPeople who claim the Antifa label usually dress in \" black bloc \"-clothed in black from head to toe with face-masks to conceal their individual identities-and are known for their willingness to deploy violence in a variety of settings. Antifa activists are most active on the margins of contemporary left-wing protest movements, and-though they're almost always a small minority-the group's appetite for violent confrontation has afforded them a ubiquitous notoriety, particularly in conservative circles.\n\nIt's still unclear whether Antifa is a coherently organized movement. But although the group lacks a centralized statement of political principles, its members are united by an antipathy toward liberal notions of free speech and a deep skepticism of the normal democratic avenues for affecting political change. This persistent illiberalism is the foundation of the organization's militancy, which stems from the conviction that violent, extralegal action is necessary to prevent the far-right from gaining a platform. In his influential 2017 Anti-Fascist Handbook , Mark Bray writes: \"Anti-fascists have concluded that since the future is unwritten, and fascism often emerges out of small, marginal groups, every fascist or white-supremacist group should be treated as if they could be Mussolini's one hundred fasci, or the fifty-four members of the German Workers' Party that provided Hitler's first stepping stone.\"\n\nThe problem, however, is that many self-proclaimed anti-fascists have expanded the definition of \"fascism\" to encapsulate a wide range of political philosophies that they find distasteful. And as a result, self-identified Antifa activists have begun to violently disrupt and shut down mainstream conservative speakers like Ben Shapiro whose speech they deem to be dangerous. In recent years, Antifa groups have also physically attacked attendees at a variety of right-wing rallies and events.\n\nOver the last few weeks, many Republicans have speculated that Antifa is largely responsible for the violence and rioting seen during some protests that swept the country after the killing of George Floyd. \"With the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful and legitimate protests have been hijacked by violent radical elements,\" wrote Attorney General William Barr in a statement released on May 31. \"The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"\n\nProgressives are generally more skeptical, arguing that Antifa is a trumped-up right-wing myth , deployed either to energize the Republican base or distract from larger issues .\n\nThe nebulous character of Antifa makes it difficult to determine just how involved the group has been in the riots and looting of recent weeks. It seems likely that members who affiliate themselves with the label have had some hand in the recent unrest, but Justice Department records show no links to Antifa for any of the \"51 individuals facing federal charges in connection with the unrest.\"\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean the ties are not there-Barr told Fox News's Bret Baier on Monday that \"the initial phase of identifying people and arresting them ... [doesn't] require us to identify a particular group\"-but it's also clear that at least a portion of the violent rioting is more cynically opportunistic than political. KSAT.com reported three Antifa members were arrested over the weekend after looting a Target in Austin, but an FBI spokesperson told The Dispatch yesterday the news story was incorrect, the individuals were not officially classified as belonging to any organized group.\n\n\"Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on individuals who commit violence and criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security,\" the spokesperson said. \"The FBI does not and will not police ideology.\"\n\nNationwide protests over Floyd's death have reignited the debate over Confederate monuments. Last Thursday, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam announced his plans to remove a Robert E. Lee statue in Richmond. But by Monday, Richmond Circuit Court Judge Bradley V. Cavedo had issued a 10-day injunction blocking its removal.\n\nIn response to an 18-page lawsuit filed by William C. Gregory, Judge Cavedo's injunction reads, \"It is in the public interest to await resolution of this case on the merits prior to removal of the statue by defendants, and the public interest weighs in favor of maintaining the status quo.\"\n\nNortham claimed broad executive authority over public statues under the Virginia state code. But Gregory argued that an 1890 deed said otherwise. As the great grandson of two of the deed's signatories, Gregory's lawsuit argued that his family \"has taken pride for 130 years in this statue resting upon land belonging to his family and transferred to the commonwealth in consideration of the commonwealth contractually guaranteeing to perpetually care for and protect the Lee Monument.\"\n\nThere is movement on this issue nationally as well. In the past week, both the Marines and Navy have made plans to ban the use of Confederate symbols from their ranks, ordering the removal of \"the Confederate battle flag from all installation public spaces and work areas in order to support our core values, ensure unit cohesion and security, and preserve good order and discipline.\"\n\nOn Monday, Army spokesperson Col. Sunset Belinsky told Politico that \"the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the Army are open to a bipartisan discussion\" on whether to rename the 10 Army installations currently named after Confederate leaders. For example, Ft. Bragg-named after Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg, \"a major slave-owner\" who is \"largely considered to be one of the most incompetent generals of the Civil War\"-had already drawn scrutiny earlier in the year after a wide-ranging piece on the issue ran in May in the New York Times .\n\nDefenders of Confederate memorialization-such as the Sons of Confederate Veterans -claim that to destroy these monuments is to erase history. But the two biggest peaks in monument building actually occurred not during or immediately after the Civil War itself, but at the turn of the 20th century-as the anti-discrimination laws passed during the Reconstruction Era were being repealed and replaced with Jim Crow laws intended to disenfranchise and segregate blacks-and during the civil rights era of the 1960s.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hilary Green-an associate professor at the University of Alabama and an expert on civil war history in the Richmond area-the intent underlying the statue's construction should matter.\n\nGreen told The Dispatch most late-19th century Americans did not have a problem with the early Confederate commemorations because they were usually located in private cemeteries. The construction of Richmond's Robert E. Lee monument in 1890, she argues, tells a different story. The shift of Confederate monuments to public spaces after Reconstruction was intended to \"create a geography of a white versus black\" with a message that African-Americans were no longer welcome.\n\n\"In what other country would there have been civil war\" after which the \"losing side was allowed to honor its heroes on the same soil?\" asks Chris Peace, a former Republican member of the Virginia House of Delegates. Peace believes the Virginia Republican Party's embrace of the monuments will \"continue its decline electorally.\"\n\nDespite the focus on racism and police brutality in recent weeks, and prevalence of mass gatherings at protest, the coronavirus has not disappeared. Far from it. According to data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, more than 20 states have experienced either an increase in COVID-19 cases over the past two weeks. While increased testing capacity accounts for some of this growth, it doesn't account for all of it. Texas, Arizona, and California-all of which are moving forward with plans to reopen in one way or another-are among the states experiencing a surge.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott announced last week that Texas was moving to its third phase of reopening. Under these guidelines, for example, restaurants are now permitted to return to 50 percent capacity-and that number jumps to 75 percent capacity on June 12. Professional and collegiate sports teams can invite fans back to events, at 50 percent capacity. Some Texans think Abbott is moving too fast. \"The data are clear,\" State Rep. Chris Turner, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, tweeted . \"Unfortunately, COVID-19 cases are moving in the wrong direction right now and we need to tap the brakes, not step on the gas.\"\n\nAbbott chalks any surges in positive cases up to a few high-volume facilities, pointing out that jails, nursing homes, and meat packing plants comprised over 45 percent of new cases between May 26 and June 2. Since those remarks, however, Texas has experienced record numbers of hospitalizations due to coronavirus complications. As of yesterday, the Texas Department of State Health Services was reporting 2,056 COVID-19 patients in Texas hospitals, the Lone Star State's highest number since the outbreak began.\n\nIn Arizona, hospitals and health care workers are preparing for possible ICU and equipment shortages as the number of intensive care beds in use reaches 1,258-76 percent of the state's capacity. To complicate matters further, about 50 percent of these patients are being hospitalized within a single health system: Banner Health. A representative from the 15 Phoenix-based hospitals informed the Arizona COVID-19 surge line that they could no longer take new patients requiring an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an external lung machine used for patients with severely damaged lungs.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) director sounded the alarm on Monday for hospitals across the state to activate their emergency plans. In a letter to Arizona health care workers, ADHS director Dr. Cara Christ recommended suspending or reducing elective surgeries to free up beds for coronavirus patients. While some attribute the surge in COVID-19 cases to the expiration of Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey's stay-at-home order on May 15, Ducey has credited the state's expanded testing apparatus. Critics of the reopening measures point out that increased testing does not explain the rise in hospitalizations.\n\nCalifornia-despite its more gradual easing of coronavirus restrictions-is also experiencing a surge. The state reported 3,570 new positive cases last Friday, its highest daily tally yet.\n\nCoronavirus data lag behind current events-it can take up to 14 days after infection for COVID-19 symptoms to appear, and deaths would not begin to show up in the data until weeks after that. That means these surges in states across the country took hold before the protests over George Floyd's death. As Andrew noted in a piece last week, the virus tends to be more difficult to transmit outdoors, but \"it's undeniable [the crowds] present an elevated risk.\"\n\nThe New York Times 's Elizabeth Bruenig recently spent a few weeks in her homeland of Texas, following along as the Lone Star State became one of the first states in the nation to get back to business following the coronavirus shutdown. \"Something more fundamental than stir-craziness spurred Texas to reverse its coronavirus measures so swiftly,\" she writes in this feature . \"It was driven in part by crass political interests and in part by more ecumenical economic ones. It seemed to me that it was also motivated by something unambiguously Texan, a romantic spirit at the heart of the state that mandates fearlessness, orneriness, liberty. When disciplined, it can be fruitful, even sublime; when unmannered and libidinal, lethal.\"\n\nHave you noticed images of anti-racism protests taking place following the death of George Floyd, not just in America, but around the globe? In this piece for The Bulwark , Tamara Berens and Shay Khatiri examine how many protesters around the world have been driven by \"a recognition that America has been-and ought to be-a standard-bearer for freedom and human dignity,\" and that \"many citizens of the free world see their own destiny as inextricably bound up with America's.\"\n\nGugino declined comment in a text to the USA TODAY Network New York, saying only, \"No comment other than Black lives matter. Just out of the ICU. Should recover eventually. Thx.\" https://t.co/1E11uJeTVc\n\n- Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) June 9, 2020\n\nDavid's latest French Press (🔒)newsletter examines rapidly changing social attitudes on police brutality and racial justice to take an optimistic look at what a \"Bill of Rights Republican Party\"-as opposed to a GOP focused on \"law and order\"-might look like in the aftermath.\n\nPresident Trump hasn't let a pesky little thing like the Biden campaign's explicit statements that U.S. police should not be defunded stop him from insisting Joe Biden wants to defund the police. Alec investigates in his latest Dispatch Fact Check here.\n\nOn the latest episode of The Remnant , Jonah is joined by the Washington Examiner 's Tim Carney, who has been on the ground reporting on the protests over the last few weeks.

And shortly after the 2020 presidential election, Angeli spoke at a pro-Trump rally and claimed that the election \"has not been called.\"\n\nA higher quality version of the image of the bearded man in a hoodie with Angeli shows that, contrary to what has been claimed in many of the posts, the tattoo on his hand is not a hammer and sickle: It's a symbol from a video game called \"Dishonored.\" This man has not been identified, but the picture from the Philly Antifa website is of a man whom the Philly Antifa group was attempting to publicly out as a neo-Nazi in order to shame him. Analyzing the images of the two men suggests that they're not the same person: Tattoos on their hands, for example, do not match up (On the Philly Antifa site, you can see a photo showing tattoos on the man's right hand if you scroll to the bottom of this post ).

      "text": "Viral Claims Distort Findings of the DOJ's January 6 Report\n\nThe report found that the FBI had confidential sources but no agents at the Capitol riot.\n\nIn the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, claims emerged that the violence was instigated not by supporters of Donald Trump but by Antifa agitators or even government agents. For example, in his documentary Patriot Purge , former Fox News host Tucker Carlson suggested that federal agents played a formative role in the riots. \"Direct incitement by federal agents? The intentional entrapment of American citizens? No decent person wants to believe that,\" he said, as PolitiFact noted at the time. \"But increasingly there's evidence it is true.\"\n\nAccording to a Washington Post -University of Maryland poll released earlier this year, 25 percent of Americans believed it was \"definitely\" or \"probably true\" that \"FBI operatives had organized and encouraged\" the January 6 Capitol attack, with a further 26 percent saying they were \"not sure\" about the claim's merit. Less than half of Americans said this theory was \"definitely\" or \"probably false.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) released a new report December 12 examining the FBI's role in the leadup and aftermath of the January 6 riots. The report, released from the DOJ's office of the inspector general, found that while 26 FBI confidential informants were in Washington, D.C., the day of the Capitol attack, there were no undercover FBI agents at the \"Stop the Steal!\" rallies, the breaching of the Capitol building, or within any other protesting crowds on January 6.\n\nSome posts shared online incorrectly summarize those findings.\n\n\"Literally everything you've been told about January 6th is a lie,\" tweeted Liz Wheeler, a right-wing influencer and podcaster. \"The truth: It wasn't an insurrection. Protesters didn't have illegal weapons. It wasn't 'coordinated'-except by Feds. 26 undercover FBI sources entered the Capitol & restricted areas.\" Another prominent X account with nearly 250,000 followers similarly claimed , \"The IG report just released admits to at least 26 undercover FBI operatives involved on J6.\"\n\nThese claims are partly false. While the FBI had 26 \"confidential human sources\" at January 6-related events, such sources were there of their own accord and FBI policy forbade them from engaging in any illegal activity.\n\nThe report found no evidence that any undercover FBI agents were at the Capitol or other protest sites on January 6. \"FBI policy does not permit the FBI to have undercover employees in crowds at First Amendment-protected events absent some investigative authority,\" the report stated. In fact, one senior FBI agent in the agency's Washington field office told the inspector general he denied another FBI office's request to have undercover agents \"engage in investigative activity on January 6.\"\n\nConfidential human sources are not FBI employees-they have not gone through formal FBI agent training and, while some are paid for their services, are not salaried employees in the federal intelligence agency.\n\nAccording to the U.S. attorney general's official guidelines , confidential human sources include \"any individual who is believed to be providing useful and credible information to the FBI for any authorized information collection activity, and from whom the FBI expects or intends to obtain additional useful and credible information in the future, and whose identity, information, or relationship with the FBI warrants confidential handling.\" The FBI is tasked with recording payments made to various confidential informants, though receipts are not made publicly available, so specific payment amounts and informant identities remain confidential.\n\nSigning up to be a FBI confidential informant is not as simple as volunteering for a local soup kitchen. Informants must first pass a standardized \"validation\" process, which requires an FBI agent to collect personal information, including their identity, prior criminal history, and potential motivations for becoming an informant. If approved, informants must attest that information they give is truthful, shared voluntarily, and that they will \"not take or seek to take any independent action on behalf of the United States Government.\"\n\nThe FBI often relies on confidential informants when the agency is trying to gauge information, but lacks first-hand accounts and critical details. \"[Confidential human sources] can play a crucial role in DOJ law enforcement, including the FBl's efforts to combat crime and protect national security,\" the DOJ report stated. They \"provide the FBI with information and insights about the inner workings of criminal, terrorist, and espionage networks that otherwise would be unavailable.\"\n\nThe report found that 26 confidential FBI informants were present in Washington on January 6. Three informants traveled there to report on the activity of specific suspects, while the 23 other informants were in the city \"in connection with the events planned for January 6.\"\n\nThe FBI said its informants were not allowed to engage in any illegal behavior, even if the suspects they were following participated in the unlawful Capitol attack. \"None of these FBI [confidential human sources] were authorized to enter the Capitol or a restricted area, or to otherwise break the law on January 6,\" the report stated, \"nor was any [confidential human sources] directed by the FBI to encourage others to commit illegal acts on January 6.\" However, of the 26 FBI informants, 13 illegally entered the Capitol security perimeter, while an additional four went inside the Capitol building. None have been prosecuted to date.\n\nThe U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., explained it is not giving the FBI informants special legal privileges. Rather, the office said it has generally abstained from prosecuting January 6 participants whose only offense was illegally entering the restricted Capitol area. \"The D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office generally has not charged those individuals whose only crime on January 6, 2021 was to enter the restricted grounds surrounding the Capitol, which has resulted in the Office declining to charge hundreds of individuals,\" the office said in the report. \"We have treated the [confidential human sources] consistent with this approach.\"\n\nIn October 2021, the New York Times reported that two FBI informants-members in separate chapters of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group-had entered the Capitol building during the riots, based on confidential records the outlet obtained. The Times reported that an FBI agent communicating with one of the informants \"appeared not to grasp that the building had been breached, the records show, and asked the informant to keep him in the loop-especially if there was any violence.\" The second informant reportedly debated whether or not to enter the Capitol building with fellow Proud Boys members. When they entered, the informant followed inside, but reportedly did not engage in any violence, destruction, or vandalism. \"The records say that he hurt no one and broke nothing,\" the Times reported, adding the informant swiftly left the Capitol through a window upon hearing from police officers that shots were fired in the building.\n\nNonetheless, the report states that FBI informants relayed critical information relevant to the January 6 events. \"The [Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General] determined that many of these 26 [confidential human sources] had provided information relevant to the January 6 Electoral Certification before the event and that a few [confidential human sources] also provided information about the riot as it occurred.\"\n\nThese include warnings that the Oath Keepers-a far-right militia group present in Washington on January 6-had more than 200 members traveling to D.C. and \"may become involved in unplanned violent activity,\" and additional warnings regarding travel plans of the Proud Boys. The FBI had informants \"in more than one field office\" that were reporting on Stewart Rhodes, the Oath Keepers' leader who was later sentenced to 18 years in federal prison on charges including seditious conspiracy.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nAntifa is an umbrella term to describe radical left-leaning militant groups that typically confront neo-Nazism and white supremacists at demonstrations.\n\nPublic and elected officials , including President Trump , have blamed antifa activists for violence at protests sparked by the death of George Floyd last week. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died last Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes.\n\nHOW SHOULD AMERICA HANDLE ANTIFA?\n\nBut officials have said that in parts of the country, what started as peaceful protests have devolved into organized riots.\n\nShort for \"anti-fascists,\" antifa has no hierarchical structure or universal set of tactics that makes its presence immediately recognizable, though members tend to espouse revolutionary and anti-authoritarian views, said Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University and author of \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.\"\n\nLiterature from the antifa movement encourages followers to pursue lawful protest activity as well as more confrontational acts, according to a 2018 Congressional Research Service report.\n\nANTIFA PROTESTS NEW YORK CITY POLICE, TRANSPORTATION\n\nThe literature suggests that followers monitor the activities of white supremacist groups, publicize online the personal information of perceived enemies, develop self-defense training regimens and compel outside organizations to cancel any speakers or events with \"a fascist bent,\" the report said.\n\nPeople associated with Antifa have been present for significant demonstrations and counter-demonstrations over the last three years, sometimes involving brawls and property damage.\n\nTrump and members of his administration have singled out antifa as being responsible for the violence at protests triggered by the killing of Floyd.\n\nPROTESTS DRIVE DEMAND FOR TASER MAKER AXON'S LAW ENFORCEMENT PRODUCTS\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, told FOX Business' Maria Bartiromo the FBI has evidence that shows antifa's involvement.\n\n\"This is an organized effort. I don't say it's a strictly organized effort, but it's organized,\" Giuliani said. \"They're communicating with each other, you know the FBI has a lot of the texts that show antifa's involvement. They're anarchists, they're people who want to drive this government down.\"\n\nIn a pair of statements over the weekend, Attorney General William Barr described \"antifa-like tactics\" by out-of-state agitators and said antifa was instigating violence and engaging in \"domestic terrorism\" and would be dealt with accordingly.\n\nAt a White House appearance Monday, Trump blamed antifa by name for the violence, along with violent mobs, arsonists and looters.\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters earlier in the day that antifa is a \"big element of this protest,\" though she deferred to the Justice Department on the question of how one could be identified as a member.\n\nBut it's unclear how big its involvement is.\n\nPolice stand near an overturned vehicle and a fire as demonstrators protest the death of George Floyd, Sunday, May 31, 2020, near the White House in Washington.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nBray said that although he believes people associated with antifa are participating in the demonstrations, it is difficult to establish how big of a role they're playing since there is no official roster of members and since the movement lacks the numbers to mobilize nationwide in such a dramatic, forceful way.\n\n\"The radical left is much bigger than antifa- much, much bigger - and the number of people who are participating in the property destruction are much, much bigger than the radical left,\" Bray said.\n\nLittle is known about who funds antifa activists, or how the groups get their resources. Antifa is not a single organization, and therefore, financial details, if any exist, are murky.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump tweeted: \"The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.\"\n\nAsked Monday what legal authority the president would have for labeling antifa a terror organization, McEnany pointed to the existing statute under the U.S. criminal code that defines acts of domestic and international terrorism.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nEven if antifa is not a designated terror organization, FBI Director Chris Wray has made clear that it's on the radar of federal law enforcement.\n\nHe has said that while the FBI does not investigate on the basis of ideology, agents have pursued investigations across the country against people motivated to commit crimes and acts of violence \"on kind of an antifa ideology.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

They said they acted based on behavior, not the politics of any content, and that Facebook had not designated antifa as dangerous.\n\nThe company said it was looking closer at accounts discussing protests when it saw what it deemed white nationalist accounts encouraging violence.\n\nThe misleading antifa accounts were removed for \"inauthentic behavior,\" because they purported to be something they were not, Facebook said.\n\nAs with a false antifa tweet that Twitter Inc tied to a third white nationalist group and which was widely distributed as a screen shot, the Facebook executives said Tuesday the goal of such content is often not to win thousands of followers but to plant a single false flag that can be used to sow distrust about the target group.\n\nFacebook declined to comment on whether it had been in touch with law enforcement, which it typically does in cases of an imminent threat.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Metropolitan Police officer on Capitol grounds on January 6 which raises more even more questions about the behavior of law enforcement agencies on that day.\n\nPublished: November 21, 2023 7:16pm\n\nUpdated: November 21, 2023 9:56pm\n\nJust the News on Tuesday obtained footage of an undercover Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) officer recorded by his camera behind police lines on the U.S. Capitol grounds. The footage was obtained directly from official sources and has not been altered.\n\nHe is seen giving water to his fellow police officers who were suffering from the effects of tear gas which the Capitol Police had deployed against the pro-Trump protestors. The footage showed the officer in plainclothes with a grey jacket. Spotted in the video and  identifying him as a police officer is a badge hanging around his neck.\n\nWhile helping his fellow officer, the undercover officer told his colleague that \"we go undercover as Antifa in a crowd.\"\n\nThe footage obtained by Just the News is embedded in the player above. It was turned over to Congress recently to investigators for House Administration Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., who are investigating the official police response on Jan. 6.\n\nA snippet of the video began appearing on social media a few weeks ago. Just the News obtained the complete footage and verified its authenticity.\n\nThe video does not make clear whether the officer was referring to being undercover as Antifa in the crowd of Trump supporters gathered at the Capitol on that day or to any prior experience with Antifa protests, such as during the Summer 2020 BLM riots that swept the country.\n\nThe officer's words are likely to raise more questions during the House GOP probe of the wider police response on Jan. 6.\n\nJust the News has learned that Congressional investigators believe that the officer captured in the footage wearing plainclothes is a member of the MPD's Electronic Surveillance Unit (ESU).\n\nThe D.C. Metropolitan Police Department did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nLast week, Just the News reported on other January 6 security footage that shows a group of unidentified individuals delivering and hauling materials for and building the infamous wooden gallows on the National Mall.\n\nNo MPD or Capitol Police interfered with or questioned the individuals during construction of the gallows, which remained standing throughout the protests that day."

Biden argued that Wray \"said unlike white supremacists, antifa is an idea, not an organization ... not a militia.\"\n\nCritics are now speaking out against Wray's description and the FBI's approach to antifa following the arraignment of at least seven antifa militants earlier this week.\n\nThose arraigned in San Diego Superior Court were part of a group arrested last Thursday in raids conducted by police officers and sheriff's deputies across Southern California. The defendants \"are self-identified to be affiliated with Anti-fascists or Antifa,\" according to the criminal complaint.\n\nProsecutors allege the antifa members used pepper spray, small flag poles, sticks, and other items - including their fists - to attack the crowd at a pro-Trump \"Patriot March\" in Pacific Beach in January.\n\n\"Video evidence analysis shows that overwhelmingly the violence in this incident was perpetrated by the Antifa affiliates and was not a mutual fray with both sides crossing out of lawful First Amendment expression into riot and violence,\" said the office of San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan in a press release.\n\nOne man, Jeremy Jonathan White, 39, is accused of pepper spraying a dog and its owner, appearing to match video of the incident that was shared online.\n\n\"I was very heartened to see law enforcement take steps to make these arrests,\" said Kyle Shideler, director and senior analyst for homeland security and counterterrorism at the Center for Security Policy. \"Hopefully it will be the start of a trend in state and local law enforcement to reject the inaccurate notion promoted by the FBI that Antifa lacks organization, network, or structure.\"\n\nRetired FBI Special Agent Jeff Danik agreed with Shideler that local authorities need to fill the void left by federal law enforcement.\n\n\"Once again, local law enforcement has had to step up to fill gaping systemic failures which Chris Wray and a highly politicized Department of Justice refuse to address: enforcing the law equally, especially against violent rioters, irrespective of the perpetrators' political opinions or motivations,\" said Danik, who served nearly three decades with the bureau. \"Wray, and his carefully selected echo chamber of rear-echelon executives, should take a lesson in law enforcement ethics from these professional southern California local agencies.\"\n\nThe antifa militants are accused of conspiracy to commit a riot and other felony charges, including illegal use of tear gas, assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury, and vandalism.\n\nThe alleged conspiracy began one week before the pro-Trump rally, according to the criminal complaint, which described antifa groups from Los Angeles and San Diego planning to commit acts of violence.\n\n\"Antifa, and similar anarcho-communist extremists, have elaborate but decentralized structures,\" explained Shideler. \"But so do many criminal gangs and other terrorist groups which are understood by law enforcement to function as organizations, and which are addressed as such through a variety of laws to deal with such threats (gang designations, criminal conspiracy and racketeering charges, etc.).\"\n\nThe FBI and the Justice Department have been reluctant to treat antifa as an organized threat, viewing it as a decentralized, leaderless movement.\n\n\"Many, like FBI Director Christopher Wray, have continued to say Antifa is not a group, but is an ideology,\" said Robyn Gritz, a retired FBI special agent who worked in counterterrorism for several years. \"However, Antifa actually has a handbook entitled 'Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,' just like the al Qaeda manuals/handbooks found back in the 2000s.\"\n\nGritz explained that terrorist organizations often operate as cellular organizations composed of quasi-independent cells similar to those of antifa. \"It doesn't make them any less of a terror group,\" she said.\n\nWhen President Trump was in office, he pushed unsuccessfully for the U.S. to designate antifa as a domestic terrorist organization.\n\n\"With members in every one of the 50 states,\" Gritz said, antifa utilizes \"sophisticated communication methods to plan their operations, just like other terrorist organizations. Using the 'it's an ideology' excuse gives politicians and the media, as well as the FBI director, the confusing semantics to describe only the why of what they do as opposed to who they are ... Wray confuses the reason behind Antifa's terrorist violence with who they actually are.\"\n\nGritz noted that antifa has individuals who are named leaders of the group, citing Daryle Lamont Jenkins of Philadelphia as an example, and uses terror to further its goals.\n\n\"Antifa pushes the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of their political aims and ideology,\" she said. \"This fits perfectly into the definition used to designate terrorist organizations.\"\n\nOthers argue that designating Antifa as a terrorist organization would set a precedent that could change counterterrorism laws in major ways that wouldn't necessarily help America's national security.\n\nIn addition to the seven defendants arraigned on Monday, three other individuals face charges, and a fourth has a $250,000 warrant out for his arrest, according to the district attorney's office.\"I think we will continue to see that the effort to deal with Antifa violence will take place at the local and state level,\" Shideler said. \"Law enforcement should be prepared not to wait on a federal law enforcement apparatus that has lost the plot.\""

At the time, he claimed that change sometimes takes \"property damage\" and that it requires \"more than just peaceful protests to get the government's attention.\"\n\nBut dozens of deaths, hundreds of injured cops and billions in insurance damages across the country seem to have changed his tune. Or maybe it was the fact that Mayor Ted Wheeler received death threats last month for promising to \"take our city back\" from the reign of terror.\n\nCharges against 10 suspected Antifa were announced on Thursday alone, mostly for vandalism around Election Day and an Inauguration Day riot.

Yes, we reached maximum capacity and had a wait list to get inside. Yes, we ran out of food. Yes, we passed the 'no sexual content' inspection from the Texas Comptroller's Office. And, yes, love won today,\" Anderson wrote after the event.\n\nAdvertisement"

Statues were toppled, the White House was besieged, looters had a field day, and police were assaulted with bricks, Molotov cocktails, bottles of urine and lasers.\n\nMore than 30 people were killed, 700 police officers were injured, and insurance damages were estimated at over $2 billion.\n\nThe American people, already battered by a pandemic, had to endure six months of relentless terrorism from anarchist militants whose actions were minimized, normalized and, in some cases, applauded by the Democratic Party and Trump-deranged media in an election year.\n\nUntil he was against it, candidate Joe Biden was all for \"Defunding the Police\" - or \"absolutely\" redirecting funds away from police, as he put it.

They fed the malicious lie that police are \"systemically\" racist murderers of black people.\n\n\"This is our moment to root out systemic racism and ensure justice finally rings out for all in America,\" tweeted Biden while our cities were burning.\n\nAt the same time, far-left politicians such as Minnesota's Democratic Attorney General Keith Ellison tried to divert blame onto Trump voters who he pretended were the external agitators in Minneapolis' riots. \"White supremacists,\" he called them.\n\nIt was a narrative that would stick.\n\nAnd, if you remember, on election eve, retailers from Columbus Circle to Soho and elsewhere across the country boarded up their storefronts , in anticipation of extreme violence if Donald Trump won.\n\nOf course, he lost, so there were no riots. What does that tell you?\n\nThrough it all, the Democratic Party and its media enablers persisted in characterizing what was happening as \"mostly peaceful protests.\"\n\nSince the only riot footage was from fearless young video journalists such as Julio Rosas and it barely aired on CNN or MSNBC et al., half the country was only dimly aware of the mayhem, unless it was happening in their back yard.\n\nWhat may have begun as peaceful protests under the banner of the Marxist-based group Black Lives Matter had been hijacked by black-clad militants affiliated with the hard-left revolutionary movement Antifa.\n\nWherever there was a local BLM grievance, Antifa exploited the moment and stoked the rage.\n\nVideos on social media showed shadowy figures in black bloc, wearing oxygen masks and goggles, toting backpacks full of weapons, strategically corralling crowds, systematically smashing store windows, cutting through fences outside police stations, lobbing rocks and Molotov cocktails, carrying umbrellas to ward off tear gas and scrutiny. They blockaded roads and highways and terrorized motorists.\n\nMug shots showed these people overwhelmingly to be white, and many were seemingly drug-affected. A good number were the children of privilege. Of those who were arrested, almost all were released with a slap on the wrist. Talk about white privilege.\n\nDonald Trump railed against Antifa and declared he would have them classified as domestic terrorists. But nothing ever happened. FBI Director Christopher Wray famously downplayed the threat, telling lawmakers in September that Antifa is just an ideology, \"not a group or an organization.\"\n\nIn a presidential debate a week later, Biden defended Antifa as \"an idea, not an organization\" and said white supremacists pose a greater danger.\n\n\"When a bat hits you over the head, that's not an idea,\" Trump replied.\n\nNothing characterizes the peculiar impotence of the Trump presidency better than the summer of unchecked riots that demoralized the nation.\n\nA new book, \"The Antifa: Stories from Inside the Black Bloc,\" by former naval intelligence officer Jack Posobiec, sheds light on the battle behind the scenes at the White House to take the militant organization seriously as a domestic terrorist threat.\n\nPosobiec opens with a meeting in the Oval Office between Wray and Trump, a few days before the election, in which the president expresses his frustration at the FBI's inaction on Antifa. It is the third such meeting in six months.\n\n\"Antifa, they're a nonfactor,\" Wray told Trump, citing the extremism/domestic terrorism database compiled by FBI analysts.\n\n\"'That's a damn lie, Chris, and you know it,' shot back the president. 'I see this stuff night after night on Twitter. We've got Homeland Security up in Portland getting attacked by gangs of these thugs and you're going to sit there and tell me it's not happening?'\n\n\"'Sir, we're working on it' said Wray.\"\n\nWray balked at the president's order to crack down on Antifa, records Posobiec, just as the Pentagon balked at Trump's order for 10,000 troops from the National Guard to be activated to defend Washington, DC, on Jan. 6, the day of the Capitol riot.\n\nA senior Trump White House official is quoted on the tug of war over Antifa: \"It mostly consisted of Wray playing [Antifa] down as a minor inconvenience with no real training ... or saying the FBI can't go after a political ideology ... Wray would say Fox and OAN were exaggerating. He ... always promised to come down harder after every scrap but obviously never did.\"\n\nOf course, since Jan. 6, now Wray has focused the FBI's efforts almost exclusively on Trump supporters, in one of the largest, most complex investigations in the agency's history.\n\nAntifa remains untouched.\n\nIt is extraordinary that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House medical adviser throughout the pandemic, never disclosed earlier the part he played in the risky research that may have prompted the coronavirus outbreak in a laboratory in Wuhan, China.\n\nThe so-called \"gain of function\" research to juice up coronaviruses in the lab had been banned by the Obama administration as unsafe pending a review - against the wishes of Fauci, the longtime director of the Nat­ional Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which partly funded research in Wuhan through a subcontractor.\n\nIn December 2017, the ban was lifted by the neophyte Trump administration, after Fauci told junior White House staffers at a meeting in the office of science and technology that a review had cleared the research as safe, according to a report in The Australian newspaper.\n\nFauci did not mention this resumption of research funding to senior administration figures, nor to the president or White House chief of staff, claims the article by Sharri Markson, author of an upcoming book, \"What Really Happened in Wuhan.\"\n\n\"It kind of just got rammed through,\" she quotes one official as saying.\n\nYou'd think Fauci might have mentioned something in the last year.\n\nAdvertisement"

Is that the world that we want to live in? No. Is it the world we want to inhabit? No. Is it the world we want to create? No. But will we push back? Yes,\" Scott Crow, a former organizer for ANTIFA, told The Atlanta Voice .\n\nThey accept the violence because \"they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist.\"\n\nANTIFA like to trace its history of fighting hard right-wing groups to those who opposed Benito Mussolini in Italy and Adolf Hitler in Germany last century.\n\nBut the modern outgrowth stems from Anti-Racist Action that first appeared in 1987 in opposition to Neo-Nazi groups and the Rose City ANTIFA in Portland in 2007.\n\nNow, ANTIFA has expanded and become more active since President Trump entered the White House in January 2017.\n\nIn February of that year ANTIFA activists infamously staged protests at the University of California at Berkeley over the appearance of conservative speaker Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\nMembers set fires, threw rocks at the police and vandalized businesses, causing an estimated $100,000 in damages.\n\nIn August, they clashed with white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, Va., during a Unite the Right rally.\n\nBlack-clad ANTIFA activists brought Portland to a standstill in August 2019 when they squared off against right wing groups.\n\nSkirmishes between the group happened in a nearby park and on the streets.\n\nPolice arrested 13 people and confiscated a stun gun, a shield, bear spray and metal and wooden poles."

      "text": "Who funds Antifa protests? We all do\n\nLast week, the city of Philadelphia agreed to pay $9.25 million to 343 left-wing protesters who alleged they suffered \"physical and emotional injuries\" when police used tear gas and pepper spray to clear them off a major highway in downtown at a Black Lives Matter-style direct action in 2020.\n\nVideos recorded at the time showed the mob shut down the highway while vandalizing public property.\n\nAs a journalist who reports on the militant far-left and its rioters, the question I'm asked most often is, \"Who funds them?\"\n\nSome believe billionaire George Soros is responsible.\n\nAnd they would be partially correct. Soros funds groups that form part of the support apparatus of left-wing militants - district attorneys, biased media and legal groups.\n\nBut his money doesn't directly reach the pockets of militants on the street.\n\nWho ends up paying far-left rioters like Antifa? Too often, taxpayers like you and me.\n\nThrough a developed network of radical leftist legal groups, like the National Lawyers Guild, lawfare against cities and police departments is the go-to method for payloads. At nearly every left-wing \"direct action\" or riot, you'll see NLG \"legal observers\" move in and out with the mob to record police. This \"evidence gathering\" is propaganda made to portray the police in the worst possible light while specifically omitting any recordings of what their comrades do.\n\nIndependent press are subjected to assault and robbery by others in the group to maintain tight control over the narrative and any photographic evidence. Kyle Seraphin, a former-FBI agent who was assigned to do surveillance in Portland during the 2020 Antifa riots, says the green-hat \"legal observers\" were linked via radio with the mob and worked as auxiliary counter-surveillance.\n\nSeraphin told me: \"My team witnessed several instances of NLG hat-wearing 'legal observers' calling out the license plates of suspected surveillance personnel [over] radios - sometimes accurately, sometimes not. These call-outs were met with a response by 5-6 uniformly clad, black-bloc individuals who attempted to intimidate the suspected 'fed.' \"\n\nOn March 5, an NLG member and staff attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center named Thomas Jurgens was charged with domestic terrorism for his alleged involvement in a violent Antifa attack on police in Atlanta.\n\nWhen the NLG's legal observers and their comrades are arrested, they're immediately provided with pro-bono legal aid and connections for bail money (rioters often write the NLG's phone number on their body in anticipation of arrests.)\n\nAnd then the lawsuits come.\n\nLast year, New York City agreed to pay tens of thousands to NLG members arrested in the Bronx in June 2020.\n\nIn Detroit, NLG members are suing the city for alleged wrongful conduct stemming from its police response in 2020.\n\nNearly every American city afflicted by mass protesting and rioting in 2020 ended up settling and paying out millions in taxpayer money to radical protesters who were allegedly subjected to force by law enforcement.\n\nDenver settled to pay $1.6 million to just seven people.\n\nAustin settled to pay $17.3 million.\n\nThe cities, led by Democrats, don't even bother to fight the cases, preferring to write a check.\n\nThe settlement cash doesn't just end up rewarding the protesters, awarded inflated attorney fees are used to reinvest in the legal groups to grow the operation for the next cause. Additionally, law enforcement morale declines as they are punished for doing their jobs.\n\nBut lawsuit settlements aren't the only way that militant protesters and riot suspects get paid. Bail funds have emerged as a lucrative cash source with progressive district attorneys refusing to prosecute most left-wing riot-related cases.\n\nIn Portland , for example, the 2020 riot suspects that needed bail money due to the seriousness of their felony charges later received the cash back when district attorney Mike Schmidt declined to prosecute. I witnessed this creating an incentive for rioters to get arrested, as outside groups covered the bail and the suspect would keep the returned cash when the case was dropped.\n\nThe NLG is just one among dozens of well-financed legal groups across the U.S. operating to help the far left.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the Legal Defense Fund, which was one of the groups representing the plaintiffs in last week's multi-million dollar settlement, previously received a $1 million pledge from Soros' Open Society Foundations.\n\nThe second most-asked question I'm asked is if mass far-left riots will erupt again. I can't predict when but the answer is yes.\n\nThe systems that provide legal, social and financial incentives to far-left extremists, no matter how violent they are, have become better funded following 2020.\n\nAndy Ngo is senior editor at The Post Millennial and author of the NYT bestseller, \"Unmasked: Inside Antifa's Radical Plan to Destroy Democracy.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

Rosen and Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf - to \"assess whether to classify\" Antifa as a terrorist group, backing up a promise he made months ago.\n\n\"The Department of Justice has already publicly confirmed that actions by Antifa and similar groups meet the standard for domestic terrorism,\" the memo reads.\n\n\"The violence spurred on by Antifa - such as hurling projectiles and incendiary devices at police, burning vehicles and violently confronting police in defiance of local curfews - is dangerous to human life and to the fabric of our nation.\"\n\nThe order also states it would ensure \"immigration benefits may be granted only to those individuals who will follow the laws that govern all United States citizens.\"\n\n\"Active membership in a criminal association is relevant to the determination of whether an applicant for a visa or other immigration benefit is seeking to enter the United States to engage in unlawful activity,\" it reads.\n\nThe memo cites protests in California dating back to 2017 when Antifa members physically assaulted several people in Berkeley and caused significant property damage.\n\nIn August 2017, \"black-clad\" Antifa agitators \"viciously attacked a rally,\" including targeting at least one person because of his conservative political views, the memo states.\n\nThe demonstrations led to 13 arrests, including charges of assault with a deadly weapon and obstructing a police officer.\n\n\"Those affiliated with Antifa have also repeatedly threatened violence, including against law enforcement officers,\" Trump's memo continues, also citing an Antifa-linked Twitter account that shared the names of 1,500-plus Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees in June 2018 - leading some of them to be harassed.\n\nMore recently, alleged Antifa activists in Portland were caught on video attacking a woman who was carrying an American flag, according to the memo.\n\n\"Reliable reporting suggests that the movement known as Antifa is directly or indirectly responsible for some of the recent lawlessness in our communities, and has exploited tragedies to advance a radical, leftist, anarchist and often violent agenda,\" it continues.\n\nTrump tweeted in May that the US would seek to designate the extreme anti-fascist group as a terrorist organization. He reiterated that in a tweet Tuesday, warning the group to stay out of Washington.\n\n\"Law enforcement is watching you very closely!,\" the president tweeted.\n\nMonths after Trump's initial tweet, FBI Director Christopher Wray said the agency considered Antifa to be \"kind of a movement\" or ideology rather than a group - despite evidence that self-identified anti-fascist activists took part in violent unrest following the May killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.\n\nFormer Justice Department officials, meanwhile, told the New York Times in May that Trump's plan to declare Antifa a terrorist group lacked clear legal authority, citing the absence of a domestic terrorism law.\n\n\"There is no authority under law to do that - and if such a statute were passed, it would face serious First Amendment challenges,\" said Mary McCord, who previously headed the Justice Department's National Security Division.\n\n\"But right now, the only terrorist authority is for foreign terrorist organizations.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that the violence committed by Antifa activists will be \"called out for the domestic terrorism that it is.\"\n\n\"President Trump will not allow Antifa, or any terrorist organization, to destroy our great country,\" McEnany said in statement."

The night included five shootings, three serious crashes and one stolen ambulance within a 12-hour span.\n\nOfficers responded to a call about shots fired and people throwing objects off an overpass while a protest \"convoy\" driving through Portland was confronted by a group of counter-demonstrators.\n\nGiven limited staffing, Portland residents calling 911 are often left on hold for hours during evening spikes in calls, which police are forced to prioritize calls based on seriousness.\n\n\"We're pretty good, generally, at deploying resources to the area of the highest need. It's been a while since I could say that I feel like we have enough cops to do everything that we want to do to keep the public safe,\" Sgt.

      "text": "AfD and antifa both want 'Nazis out!' in Berlin\n\nBERLIN - Everyone in German politics seems to want the \"Nazis out,\" but no one can agree who the \"Nazis\" actually are.\n\nThe Alternative for Germany party held a final pre-election rally in Berlin on Saturday in the Linden-Center shopping district. The hundreds of supporters in attendance were surrounded on multiple sides by an equal number of left-wing activists attempting to drown them out with horns and organized chants.\n\nThe narrow gap between the warring political groups was filled with dozens of stoic police officers in berets and bullet-proof vests, clustered in groups and forming human walls along the fence dividing the parties. Private security hired by the AfD wore yellow fluorescent jackets and guarded the backstage area.\n\nThe AfD - the party currently occupying second place in German election polls with 22% support - boasted four party officials who did their best to ignore the cacophony coming from their detractors, even as AfD supporters taunted the antifa gathering by displaying the German flag and posters of party leader Alice Weidel.\n\nDisrupters carrying communist flags, foam middle fingers, and hand-made antifa banners denouncing the AfD as \"Nazis\" attempted to shout down each speaker by yelling and blasting music from their designated protest area just a stone's throw away from the stage.\n\nThe left-wing demonstrators employed a variety of chants, but none as frequently and vocally as \"Nazis raus!\" (English: Nazis out!)\n\nThis sentiment - a wish to expel those Germans who are perceived as intolerant, violent, and outright malicious - was echoed from the right toward the left just as vehemently.\n\n\"We have some [foreign journalists] here. I've talked to some from Great Britain. There are some from Sweden, from [the] United States of America. I've seen some folks from Canada,\" Beatrix von Storch, deputy parliamentary leader of the AfD, told rally attendees in English over the cries of the antifa protesters. \"So a very warm welcome - you've got a very clear view on our side here. And if you want to see, look in our faces - this is love. Go over there, you will meet hate.\"\n\nThe AfD supporters in attendance cheered, chanting along with von Storch the same chant lobbed at them by antifa: \"Nazis out! Nazis out! Nazis out!\"\n\nImmigration is the defining issue not only of the Feb. 23 election but the entirety of modern German political discourse.\n\nThe AfD is the most hard-line anti-immigration party to gain success in the country since the end of World War II. They are seeking the immediate removal of all illegal immigrants, intense scrutiny for individuals claiming to need asylum, and an end to state-supported multiculturalism.\n\nThey are not alone in championing these goals. The Christian Democratic Union , which is currently polling in first place with approximately 30% public support, has acknowledged the growing demand from even moderate Germans for widespread immigration reform.\n\nA long string of violent crimes committed by foreign nationals living legally in Germany has strained the nation's decadeslong proclivity for cultural tolerance.\n\nJust yesterday, a 30-year-old Spanish tourist was reportedly stabbed at the Berlin Holocaust Memorial by a 19-year-old Syrian refugee.\n\nThe city's police force published a statement following the attack, stating, \"According to what we know so far, especially based on statements made by the accused to the police, he has been planning to kill Jews for several weeks.\"\n\nOn Feb. 13, an Afghan national legally living in Germany drove a car into a crowd of bystanders, injuring 30 people. The month prior, another Afghan migrant killed a 2-year-old and an adult during a stabbing attack at a preschool in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg.\n\nThe most brutal instance of terrorism-related violence occurred at the Magdeburg Christmas market in December when a Saudi Arabian man injured just under 300 people and killed six by ramming his car into a crowd of shoppers.\n\nRonald Glaser, a former member of the Berlin State Parliament who is running again with AfD in this election, talked to the Washington Examiner on Friday while handing out party pamphlets near Berlin-Karow station with several other AfD activists.\n\n\"Overall, illegal immigration is the most important topic to all our people. You can't go out at night, you can't feel safe here anymore. You have to pay much more money for the welfare state. People don't feel secure,\" Glaser said. \"In this district, we have 18 places where refugees are brought and they live there - more than 8,000 people. This puts a burden on everyone's life.\"\n\nWhile Berlin is as overwhelmingly liberal and progressive as most major world cities, the eastern part of the city carries a deeply entrenched grudge against communism and socialism due to its history as a Soviet territory.\n\nGlaser and his fellow AfD supporters see room for growth in the area, drawing connections between rampant illegal immigration, a stagnated economy, and socialist political philosophy.\n\n\"In 2021, we had the last general election and it was very disappointing. We got just above 10%. So now we are above 20%, which means we're doubling our outcome,\" the candidate told the Washington Examiner . \"This is very good - we are like a surfer on the high of the wave.\"\n\nAfD is rising, but it is still approximately 10 points behind the mainstream CDU, which refuses to form a coalition with its further-right rival on the grounds that \"far-right\" politics have no place in modern Germany.\n\nCDU leader Friedrich Merz denounced the AfD during a four-way political debate on Sunday, even while his party promises it will adopt more moderate versions of their rivals' immigration policies.\n\nAfD supporters see the CDU as too entrenched in the German political machine to ever act on their stated positions. They blame CDU's commitment to moderate policies meant to appease voters across the spectrum for the lack of meaningful conservative changes thus far.\n\n\"They copy [our positions] and they talk about doing these things, but they won't act on it. That's the truth,\" Glaser said. \"Who threw open the door of Germany? It was [CDU former Chancellor] Angela Merkel. And they did not make a break from her.\"\n\nHe continued, \"They are not reliable. They might make a PR stunt - they might close the borders for a week or something - but that's not enough. We want secure borders for eternity.\"\n\nImmigration concerns are directly tied to the AfD's secondary flagship issue, freedom of speech. AfD members say that German hate speech laws make criticism of migration policy and foreign cultures being imported into the country a crime punishable with fines or even prison.\n\n\"The topics of asylum and immigration are characterized by an ideologically-biased climate of political correctness, accompanied by banned terms and newspeak. Non-compliance leads to social stigmatization, even to job-related discrimination,\" the AfD states in its official manifesto. \"Such treatment of non-conformist opinions has been a characteristic of totalitarian countries, but not of free democratic societies. Negative developments in the field of asylum and immigration are not addressed in order to prevent a turnaround in public opinion.\"\n\nThe AfD's concerns are not unfounded - it is genuinely a crime to publicly insult another person in Germany. Even reposting a statement found to be \"hate speech\" or \"misinformation\" opens a social media user to prosecution, a fact that may shock U.S. citizens accustomed to strong First Amendment protections.\n\nPolice teams conducted raids on private residences earlier this week in one of the nation's widest crackdowns on hate speech yet, seizing phones and issuing fines costing thousands of dollars.\n\nIt's not just \"hateful\" rhetoric about race or religion that can result in a visit from the police.\n\nThe Green Party member currently running for the office of chancellor, Deputy Chancellor Robert Habeck, pressed charges on a Bavarian man in November of last year after the individual made a social media post calling him a professional \"schwachkopf.\" (English: \"dimwit.\")\n\nThese are the behaviors and policies that AfD members acknowledge when they accuse their critics of being Nazis.\n\nGlaser was among the four AfD speakers at the Saturday rally outside the Linden-Center. After his address, he spoke with foreign press near his campaign's attention-grabbing vehicle - a repurposed firetruck emblazoned with the party logo.\n\nSupporters who attended the rally varied wildly in age and background, but tropes familiar to conservatives across the Western world abound - acne-faced teenagers in Fred Perry hats, married couples from middle-class backgrounds who wandered in, elderly gentlemen dressed in old-fashioned suits, and girls with caked on make-up that would not look unfamiliar in New York's Dimes Square.\n\nA woman attending the event told the Washington Examiner that she was not interested in politics until the COVID-19 pandemic, when she felt unable to speak out against mandatory vaccinations and strict behavioral guidelines.\n\nAnother AfD supporter said he was a Green Party member in his younger years but made a sharp turn rightward when he began fearing for the safety of his children as the crime rate spiked.\n\nAntifa - a loose affiliation of \"anti-fascists\" that organize locally but share imagery and tactics with fellow participants around the world - carry a silhouette similar to their counterparts in other countries: black clothing, face masks, hoodies, colored hair, and rainbow paraphernalia. Flags and signs are adorned with images of fists raised in defiance and communist hammer and sickles.\n\nOn the outskirts of the event, co-ed groups of teenagers on both sides of the fence raised their middle fingers to one another before returning to their cigarette-smoking cliques, laughing, and returning to make the gesture again.\n\nFor an American observing this tense and polarized political landscape, it may seem like an echo of the movement that resulted in President Donald Trump's rise, fall, and return to the White House over the past 10 years.\n\nThe emphasis on deporting problematic foreign nationals, the consternation of mainstream political parties, the outrage and threats from those identifying as \"anti-fascist\" - there are endless parallels to be observed between the Make America Great Again movement and the AfD's rise.\n\nAfD members invite the comparison, expressing extreme enthusiasm for Trump's second administration, his policies thus far, and his vision for a more nation-minded global ecosystem.\n\nMembers regularly hand out blue baseball caps with the words \"Make Meinungsfreiheit [Free Speech] Great Again\" embroidered on the front.\n\nMultiple AfD members who spoke to the Washington Examiner expressed admiration for Vice President J.D. Vance specifically, who they say broke decades of enforced silence by lending them his support.\n\nVance made a landmark address in Munich last week that shocked the German public in which he urged the mainstream parties to end the \"firewall\" between themselves and the AfD, accusing leaders of suppressing the will of their own people.\n\n\"What no democracy - American, German, or European - will survive is telling millions of voters that their thoughts and concerns, their aspirations, their pleas for relief are invalid or unworthy of even being considered,\" Vance said. \"Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There's no room for 'firewalls.' You either uphold the principle or you don't.\"\n\nChristian Buchholz, another former Berlin State Parliament member who now helps lead the local chapter of the AfD, told the Washington Examiner that he has listened to the Vance speech at least six times since the Munich event. He plans to listen to it again on election day.\n\nGerman officials, on the other hand, were aghast.\n\n\"A commitment to 'never again' is not reconcilable with support for the AfD,\" Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in rebuke of Vance after the conference. \"I'm not going to let an American vice president tell me who I have to talk to here in Germany.\"\n\nHe added that Germany would \"not accept\" lectures on how to run its democratic process. \"Where our democracy goes from here is for us to decide,\" Sholz said.\n\nIt's not a surprise. An ascendence of AfD into the mainstream would mark a political upheaval as unprecedented and countercultural as Trump's victory in the U.S.\n\nThe party hopes to take an axe to a long list of cultural trends dominating German politics: gender theory, state support for multiculturalism, high taxation, green energy mandates, European Union participation, tolerance for Islamic institutions, and more.\n\nIn their minds, the German nation, language, and culture are not dying naturally. The political establishment is choosing to suffocate them.\n\n\"The ideology of multiculturalism is blind to history and puts on a par imported cultural trends with the indigenous culture, thereby degrading the value system of the latter,\" the AfD manifesto states. \"The AfD views this as a serious threat to social peace and the survival of the nation state as a cultural unit. It is the duty of the government and civil society to confidently protect German cultural identity as the predominant culture.\"\n\nIn a nation that in many ways defines itself by World War II and the atrocities it committed in that era, such brazen advocacy for the native culture inspires the antifa protests and their accusations of Nazism seen at the Berlin rally on Saturday.\n\nIf one chooses to believe the mainstream parties and antifa protesters, that means at least one-fifth of modern-day Germans are Nazi sympathizers. Such a scenario would be horrifying - and necessitate domestic and international alarm.\n\nIf one chooses to believe the AfD, the movement is the explosive response to decades of abuse and persecution by their own government - a revolution of self-respect in the face of a political machine that no longer cares about the lives of its own citizens.\n\nWhichever side one falls on, there is a nationwide consensus on the future Germans want - \"Nazis raus!\""

      "text": "Wray contradicts Biden on antifa, saying it's not just an idea - and it's a real threat\n\nF BI Director Christopher Wray contradicted Joe Biden's previous comments about antifa, with the bureau chief arguing the radical leftist group is not just an \"idea\" but rather a real threat the FBI is investigating.\n\nLast summer, during congressional testimony on antifa, Wray said the FBI viewed the group as an \"ideology\" or \"movement\" but declined to call it an organization. That brought a swift rebuke from then-President Donald Trump and was exploited by candidate Biden, who subtly twisted Wray's quote, calling antifa an \"idea\" instead and implying the bureau chief said only white supremacists were a true threat.\n\nLast week, however, Wray was repeatedly grilled by Republicans during a House Intelligence Committee hearing, and while he ditched the \"ideology\" language in favor of just calling it a \"movement,\" he would not call antifa an organization, though he insisted he did not mean it wasn't dangerous and repeatedly said the FBI was investigating and taking it seriously.\n\nRIOTERS SET PORTLAND ICE FACILITY ON FIRE AS FEDERAL AGENTS SHOOT BARRAGE OF PEPPER BULLETS\n\nRep. Michael Turner, an Ohio Republican, asked if it was his testimony that antifa was not an organization that was conducting violence in cities and against the U.S. government.\n\nWray replied: \"We consider antifa to be more of a movement. ... There are certainly local and regional nodes, individuals who self-identify with antifa, who commit violent attacks citing that as their motivation, and we have a number of predicated investigations into such individuals. Antifa is a real thing; it's not a fiction, and it's a concern.\"\n\nTurner asked if antifa had organized training for members, and Wray said: \"We have seen individual instances in small regional nodes of people coming together to train,\" but \"there's not some big, national structure that is responsible for the violence - what we have seen is locally organized nodes.\" When pressed on the organizing, the FBI chief said \"at the local level, in some cases the regional level, we have seen organized activity - people working together.\"\n\nTurner also repeatedly grilled him on antifa's funding, with Wray replying, \"I think the financing issue is something we continue to investigate, but there's nothing that I can share at this time.\"\n\nBiden used Wray's comments to downplay the threat posed by antifa during the first presidential debate . The moderator, Fox News host Chris Wallace, noted Trump had criticized Biden's stance toward antifa but asked if Trump would be \"willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say that they need to stand down.\" The exchange subsequently led to Trump's \"stand back and stand by\" remark about the Proud Boys, but not before he charged that \"somebody has got to do something about antifa and the Left.\"\n\nBiden then falsely implied Wray had said antifa was not a threat and misquoted him, with Biden saying he called antifa an \"idea\" - not an \"ideology\" or a \"movement.\"\n\n\"His own FBI director said the threat comes from white supremacists - antifa is an idea, not an organization,\" Biden said, with Trump retorting, \"Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.\" Biden then repeated that \"that's what his FBI director said.\"\n\n\"Well, then you know what? He's wrong,\" Trump said. \"When a bat hits you over the head, that's not an idea. Antifa is bad.\"\n\nBiden replied, \"Everybody who gives you advice in your administration that tells you the truth has a bad idea.\" Trump quipped, \"Antifa is a dangerous, radical group. And you ought to be careful with them - they'll overthrow you in a few seconds.\"\n\nLast week, Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat, followed up after Turner's back-and-forth with Wray to see if the FBI director had more to add.\n\n\"So, we take anarchist violent extremism, much of which associates with the antifa movement, very seriously. ... It is something that we investigate very aggressively, and in fact, the number of investigations in that space is something that's dramatically increased on my watch over the last few years. And I think last year, we had more arrests in the anarchic violent extremism space than in the prior three years combined,\" Wray said, adding, \"There's a tendency on the part of people to want to view how structured and organized something is as a proxy for how seriously threatening it is or isn't, and those two things don't necessarily conflate. There is a lot of very dangerous, serious activity out there that's not organized.\"\n\nWray added that he wasn't trying to minimize the threat, saying his assessment of antifa as a \"movement\" does not mean they are \"any less dangerous or less threatening\" and that \"we have seen organized, tactical activity at the local and regional level; we're investigating it very aggressively.\"\n\nRep. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, pressed Wray on why he would say that antifa is not a national organization.\n\n\"What I can tell you is that we have seen adherents to the antifa movement who organize at the tactical level, locally and regional, what I call small nodes,\" Wray said, adding, \"We are using our Joint Terrorism Task Forces to investigate things like tactics, funding, logistics, targeting, that sort of thing.\"\n\nThen-Attorney General William Barr declared in May that violence being \"instigated and carried out\" by \"antifa and other similar groups\" in connection to nationwide rioting is \"domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"\n\nLast summer, self-described antifa member Michael Forest Reinoehl shot and killed right-wing Patriot Prayer supporter Aaron \"Jay\" Danielson on the streets of Portland, fleeing to Washington, where the U.S. Marshals found him; when he attempted to escape and produced a firearm, he was killed by law enforcement. Barr said then that \"the tracking down of Reinoehl - a dangerous fugitive, admitted antifa member, and suspected murderer - is a significant accomplishment in the ongoing effort to restore law and order to Portland and other cities.\"\n\nThe Justice Department indicated last year that over 300 people were charged with federal crimes during nationwide protests and rioting last year, with 80 charges related to arson and explosives, with others tied to assault on law enforcement and the destruction of government property. There were an estimated 14,000 or more total arrests during protests across the country, and over two dozen people died during the violence.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community concluded in March that domestic violent extremists pose an \"elevated threat\" in 2021. The declassified assessment focused on domestic violent extremists, including racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists and anti-government or anti-authority violent extremists. \"Antifa\" was not mentioned by name."

They deserve their due process rights.\"\n\nWhile some prominent people accused of participating in the riot - including Jacob Chansley , often called the \"QAnon Shaman\" - were sentenced to prison time , other rioters were only hit with fines, community service, and probation for less serious crimes.\n\nThe interview aired during the Conservative Political Action Conference in Texas last weekend, which featured speeches from both Greene and Lindell. Greene also caught the attention of attendees after getting into a fake jail cell with internet personality Brandon Straka.\n\nGreene has supported claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump despite officials' assurances that vote counts were secure.

      "text": "Split among GOP lawmakers over labeling antifa a terrorist group\n\nRepublicans applauded President Trump for designating antifa as a terrorist organization, but some believe the designation was unnecessary.\n\nTrump and Attorney General William Barr, along with national security adviser Robert O'Brien, have recently pointed to antifa as the root cause of the violence and massive property damage. Barr, on Saturday, said the Justice Department would be focused on \"apprehending and charging the violent radical agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest and are engaged in violations of federal law.\"\n\nFormer assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy, who prosecuted Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind sheikh, for conspiracy in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, argues that naming antifa a terrorist organization would not be necessary. The Department of Justice already has all the prosecutorial powers it needs to prosecute antifa, a loose-knit group of anarchists, communists, and others who are increasingly inserting themselves into otherwise peaceful protests, McCarthy said.\n\n\"They should use RICO, and they should use the statute that I prosecuted the blind sheikh under, seditious conspiracy, which is conspiracy to levy war against the United States,\" McCarthy told the Washington Examiner . \"But RICO would also would work, and you don't have to designate them.\"\n\nSen. Jim Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican and member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said a terrorist designation against antifa would give federal authorities broader leeway to examine its participants' daily activities.\n\n\"It's just a matter of trying to be able to get through the process and make sure all the T's are crossed and I's are dotted,\" Landford said.\n\nSimilarly, Sen. Jim Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, told the Washington Examiner the designation is \"overdue.\"\n\nHowever, Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican , questioned if antifa's loose organization structure would qualify the radical leftist group to be named a terrorist designation.\n\n\"There's no doubt there's terroristic behavior going on. Part of the problem with it is that these groups that we're talking about, they don't have a home office. They're not a traditional group,\" Rubio, interim chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Washington Examiner . \"It's a loosely affiliated group of individuals who would have some differences in ideology, but basically very similar tactics to the kinds of things that we're seeing.\"\n\nThe debate comes as Trump administration critics question whether antifa is being made a catch-all target, including legitimate protests over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police and a series of other officer-involved lethal incidents that past several years.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Monday he has seen \"no evidence\" that many protesters are members of antifa, as Trump has claimed.\n\n\"They've been confronted by some of the legitimate protesters,\" said Ellison, a Democrat."

      "text": "Trump is right: Antifa is a terrorist group. It always was\n\nThe term \"anti-fascist\" began as a lie. It remains a lie today.\n\nClueless commentators, ignorant of its history, have been known to refer to the \"antifa\" movement as \"strictly principled anti-fascists\" or a group that \"protests fascism.\" In fact, this is a movement of violent extremists whose philosophy traces back to the early 20th century.\n\nThe riots now raging in U.S. cities are not about police misconduct. They haven't been for many days. The senseless and callous police killing of George Floyd inspired peaceful protests at first, but now, it has become an excuse for a troupe of professional revolutionaries and marauders. They use these incidents in order to flex their muscle and test how far their impressionabl e recruits are willing to go in breaking the law, as Jared Monroe discovered upon infiltrating one such group in Utah.\n\nThe Soviets coined \"anti-fascism\" as a propaganda term some nine decades ago. The Soviet regime needed to develop a message that would mollify credulous Western democracies and get them to stop viewing Bolshevism as a threat.\n\n\"Anti-fascism\" suited this vision perfectly. It conveyed the impression that Stalinism was not diametrically opposed to the ideals of normal, decent people in free societies. It was a brilliant rhetorical device, a living, practical application of the false choice fallacy: \"You're against Nazis? Well then, you must be with us - or at least, we deserve the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\nImplicit here is the idea that if you don't sympathize, you must be a fascist, so you deserve whatever violence adherents inflict upon you.\n\nOn these terms, \"antifa\" demands that when its black-hooded actors take to the streets to wound and maim passersby in the name of some nice-sounding stated cause - anti-racism, anti-sexism, anti-greed, anti-corruption - they deserve the sympathy of their countrymen. They would get less sympathy if more people understood their overarching goals: the violent overthrow of the U.S. government, the abolition of private enterprise, and the violent suppression of the speech of anyone who disagrees with their ends or violent means.\n\nBut every now and then, so-called anti-fascism is exposed for the lie that it is. We are currently experiencing one of those moments. Amid the riots, the totalitarian mask is slipping.\n\nThere is a word for people who use violence to silence and intimidate others to advance a political cause, who try to make people afraid in their own cities and towns. That word is \"terrorist.\" We cannot speak in detail of every wannabe group that embraces the \"antifa\" label. But those specific groups and networks involved in organizing and conducting violent street actions are domestic terrorists. Those throwing rocks and beating innocent passersby as badly as the worst cop or klansman in America - they are terrorists. And these are the things the antifa movement is rightly known for.\n\nGovernment exists precisely to protect human life and to prevent violence. Part of these directives involves suppressing movements that use street violence and intimidation tactics as a means of infringing the rights of others. It is time for the various states to fulfill their responsibility as guarantors of law and order by arresting and prosecuting rioters to the maximum extent the law allows.\n\nAs for President Trump's suggestion that he will designate such actors and groups as terrorists for the purposes of federal law, he should do just that.\n\nThis is not about condemning viewpoints, left or right - not even the most extreme ones. This is not about preventing controversial speech. Rather, it is about stopping violence, threats, and intimidation, which antifa and other terrorists use as a first resort. It is about stopping those who would infringe others' freedom to speak. Antifa has managed to do this, administering violent beatings and violating laws in cities such as Berkeley and Portland, sometimes with a wink and a nod from local authorities. Such toleration of violence cannot coexist with freedom.\n\nHistorian Norman Davies wrote of the term \"anti-fascism\" that it \"gave the false impression that principled democrats believing in the rule of law and freedom of speech could rub along fine with the dictators of the proletariat.\" That is the same lie that sustains the antifa movement today, and it is betrayed by the violence of its adherents."

They often wear black and take measures to conceal their identity.\n\nChomsky said, \"what they do is often wrong in principle - like blocking talks - and [the movement] is generally self-destructive.\"\n\n\"When confrontation shifts to the arena of violence, it's the toughest and most brutal who win - and we know who that is,\" said Chomsky, a professor emeritus of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"That's quite apart from the opportunity costs - the loss of the opportunity for education, organizing, and serious and constructive activism.\"\n\nThe violence in Charlottesville ended Saturday when an alleged white supremacist drove a car into a crowd of anti-racism activists, not all of whom were Antifa activists, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring more than a dozen others. The driver has been charged with murder.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump shocked viewers of a press conference, including prominent members of his own party, by saying \"both sides\" deserved blame for the violence. Critics said the president should single out white supremacists for scorn.\n\n\"There was a group on this side, you can call them the Left, you've just called them the Left, that came violently attacking the other group,\" Trump said on Tuesday. \"So, you can say what you want, but that's the way it is.\"\n\nWhere Antifa fits in a historical context of progressive activism is not yet clear, but some observers see the increasingly prominent movement - members of which were mass-arrested at Trump's inauguration after a march that featured window-smashing - as becoming an important, accepted part of the mainstream Left.\n\nMark Lance, professor of justice and peace at Georgetown University, said the Antifa movement's rise is a clear response to more open fascist organizing.\n\n\"I'm seeing more concrete productive discussion between anti-fascists and others on the Left these days than ever before in my life,\" Lance said.\n\n\"There is reason to think that it will become integrated into an emerging coalition that includes Sanders supporters, democratic socialists, dreamers, the Movement for Black Lives, environmentalists, [and] Native American organizers,\" he said.\n\nLance said Antifa actions \"need not be violent confrontation, but most Antifa, in practice, are willing to physically resist fascist marches and defend themselves against fascist attack.\"\n\nReaching for American historical parallels for Antifa is difficult.\n\nLance said he doesn't see a close historical reference in leftist groups that formed in the 1960s like the Black Panthers or the Weather Underground, which conducted a bombing campaign aimed largely at damaging property. Both were primarily focused on government institutions, he said.\n\n\"There's some limited similarity to the Weather Underground,\" Chomsky said about the group that grew out of the anti-Vietnam War movement. He added, however, that \"Weathermen differed not only in radically different context, but also in tactics, almost always against property, in intent at least.\"\n\nBy contrast, \"Antifa purports to be defensive,\" he said.\n\nAnti-fascism during the rise of Nazism in Germany is perhaps a better analogy for today's Antifa, said Chomsky, who expressed alarm at Trump's remarks. He clarified that in Germany, \"left violence was hardly the problem.\""

      "text": "Barr warns of 'witches' brew' of antifa and other extremists causing violence in George Floyd protests\n\nA ttorney General William Barr warned about a \"witches' brew\" of extremist groups such as anarchists, \"antifa-related\" groups, those associated with the so-called Boogaloo movement, and others operating within the George Floyd protests to instigate violence and advance their ideologies.\n\nDuring a virtual press conference at the Justice Department on Thursday, Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray offered an assessment of outside groups they said are trying to exploit the protests.\n\n\"I do think it's important to point out the witches' brew of extremists that we have - the individuals and groups involved - and that's why in my prepared statement, I specifically said in addition to antifa and other extremist groups like antifa, there were a variety of groups and people of a variety of ideological persuasions,\" Barr said in response to a question. \"I'm not going to get too specific. But the intelligence being collected by our U.S. attorneys' offices - particularly integrated by the FBI from multiple different sources - is building up.\"\n\n\"There are some specific cases against individuals - some antifa-related,\" he said. \"A lot of the extremists are involved in egging on violence and participating in violence and providing a means of violence, and we are pursuing those cases.\"\n\n\"There are some groups that don't have a particular ideology other than anarchy,\" he said, adding there are \"some groups that want to bring about a civil war - the Boogaloo group that has been on the margins of this as well - trying to exacerbate the violence.\"\n\nFloyd, a 46-year-old unarmed black man, died in police custody last week after a white Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, pinned him down by placing a knee on the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes. Footage of the incident set off a wave of outrage, leading to protests in major cities across the nation, some of which became violent as protesters rioted, looted stores, destroyed property, burned buildings, and clashed with police. Chauvin is now facing charges of second-degree murder and third-degree manslaughter, and the other officers involved in Floyd's detainment have been charged with aiding and abetting murder.\n\nIn recent days, the Trump administration has specifically highlighted the alleged role that the far-left anarchic antifa movement was playing in exacerbating violence, with Barr repeatedly singling the group out by name and President Trump declaring his intent to designate it as a domestic terrorist group. On Wednesday, the FBI announced it had arrested three men appearing to subscribe to a far-right or extreme libertarian ideology for their apparent plan to use Molotov cocktails to cause chaos at a Black Lives Matter protest.\n\nBarr laid out \"three sets of actors\" connected to the protests: first, the large proportion of \"peaceful demonstrators\" exercising their First Amendment rights; second, groups who \"exploit\" the protests as an opportunity to engage in crimes such as looting; and third, the \"extremist agitators\" who \"hijack\" the protests to pursue their own \"separate and violent agenda.\"\n\n\"Our nation is now confronting two serious challenges to the rule of law. The first is a long-standing one but was recently crystallized and driven home by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The video of the police conduct in this episode is harrowing,\" Barr said, later adding, \"Unfortunately, the aftermath of George Floyd's death has produced a second challenge to the rule of law. While many have peacefully expressed their anger and grief, others have hijacked protests to engage in lawlessness: violent rioting, arson, looting of businesses and public property, assaults on law enforcement officers and innocent people, and even the murder of a federal agent.\"\n\nBarr made it clear that \"one of the difficulties\" in tamping down on the violence \"is that while there are peaceful demonstrators in these protests, the instigators - those committed to violence - basically shield themselves by going among them and carrying out acts of violence.\"\n\nWray said the FBI was \"seeing people exploiting the situation to pursue violent and extremist agendas - anarchists like antifa and other agitators\" and said that \"these individuals have set out to sow discord and upheaval, rather than join in the righteous pursuit of equality and justice.\" He lamented that \"many have suffered from the violence instigated by these radical extremists, including members of our own law enforcement family\" and stressed that the bureau \"committed to identifying, investigating, and stopping individuals who are inciting violence and engaging in criminal activity.\"\n\nThe protests across the country spread from Minnesota to dozens of cities across the country, and the ensuing looting and arson in Washington led to the National Guard being called up and federal law enforcement agencies deploying officers to the streets of the nation's capital.\n\nBarr said on Sunday that the Justice Department, including the FBI, the U.S. Marshals, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, and all U.S. attorneys' offices would support local efforts and \"take all action necessary to enforce federal law.\" The DEA in particular gained broader authorities to monitor violence in the protests and carry out arrests.\n\n\"We, the FBI, have quite a number of ongoing investigations of violent anarchic extremists, including those motivated by an antifa-like ideology, and we categorize and treat those as domestic terrorism investigations and are pursuing them through our Joint Terrorism Task Forces,\" Wray said Thursday. \"In terms of the current unrest, while a majority of the protesters are peaceful, there are certainly instigators, agitators, and opportunists seeking to exploit these demonstrations to commit violence and rioting. And exactly who these people are, who is driving them, what's driving them, what tactics they use varies widely sometimes from city to city - and sometimes even from night to night.\"\n\nHe stressed that the FBI was working with state and local law enforcement and was looking to bring federal charges whenever possible.\n\n\"We're about the violence. We're not about the ideology,\" Wray said. \"And it doesn't matter what your ideology is. If you commit violence or rioting or acts that we consider terrorism, we're going to pursue it.\""

      "text": "Facial recognition company demands Washington Times retract story linking antifa to Capitol siege\n\nA facial recognition company is demanding the Washington Times retract and apologize for publishing a story claiming their technology identified members of antifa as being among the pro-Trump crowd that stormed the Capitol on Wednesday .\n\nThe article in question said that the firm XRVision \"used its software to do facial recognition of protesters and matched two Philadelphia Antifa members to two men inside the Senate.\" The report cited a \"retired military officer\" who provided the information and said she or she \"provided the photo match to The Times .\"\n\nXRVision, however, said in a statement to the Washington Examiner that the report is \"outright false, misleading, and defamatory,\" and they are requesting the outlet \"retract the current claims\" and issue an apology. \"XRVision didn't generate any composites or detection imagery for the Washington Times nor for a \"retired military officer\" and did not authorize them to make any such representations.\"\n\n\"Shortly after the rioting started, XRVision performed an analysis on the footage and identified several individuals,\" the company said. \"This information was shared with LEA. We concluded that two of individuals (Jason Tankersley and Matthew Heimbach), were affiliated with the Maryland Skinheads and the National Socialist Movements. These two are known Nazi organizations, they are not Antifa. The third individual identified (Jake Angeli) was an actor with some QAnon promotion history. Again, no Antifa identification was made for him either.\"\n\nBrian Della Rocca, a representative for XRVision, told the Washington Examiner that the two sides had been in touch but that there has been \"no mention of a retraction,\" despite the request. Hours after publication, the Washington Times directed the Washington Examiner to an update that was added to the story after it had been temporarily taken down.\n\nA correction at the top of the article reads, \"An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that XRVision facial recognition software identified Antifa members among rioters who stormed the Capitol Wednesday. XRVision did not identify any Antifa members. The Washington Times apologizes to XRVision for the error.\"\n\nThe headline has been altered to say that \"extremists\" were identified via facial recognition, and the updated article included the following: \"The Washington Times erroneously reported late Wednesday that facial recognition technology backed up that speculation and identified two Antifa members. In fact, XRVision has not identified any members of that far-left movement as being part of the attack.\"\n\nThe report reverberated around the conservative media landscape on Wednesday night and was referenced by Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz on the House floor as Congress was certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory. His speech occurred hours after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, fought with law enforcement, and forced an evacuation.\n\nHours after he encouraged a crowd estimated in the hundreds of thousands to march on Capitol Hill, President Trump changed his tune and urged his supporters to go home peacefully, adding that he understands how they feel and that he loves them. Four people died in the chaos.\n\n\"The Washington Times has just reported some pretty compelling evidence from a facial recognition company showing that some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters,\" Gaetz said to audible boos. \"They were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa.\"\n\nCongress was able to certify Biden's victory early this morning, and Trump promised a peaceful transfer of power on Jan. 20.\n\nGaetz was not the only conservative who claimed that far-left antifa agitators were partaking in the chaos that ensued in the Capitol that left four people dead. Reps. Mo Brooks and Paul Gosar, both of whom voted to object to the certification of the Electoral College results.\n\n\"This has all the hallmarks of Antifa provocation,\" Gosar wrote on Twitter. Brooks cautioned , \"Don't rush to judgment on assault on Capitol. Wait for investigation. All may not be (and likely is not) what appears. Evidence growing that fascist ANTIFA orchestrated Capitol attack with clever mob control tactics.\"\n\nConservative commentators, including Fox News's Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Newsmax's Greg Kelly also speculated more broadly that a portion of the people who stormed the Capitol were outside agitators seeking to make them look bad, per the Washington Post ."

Ngo took issue with the way some in the media have covered riots and violence on the Left and said it feeds into the perception that it is not a major issue.\n\nGOP Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, recently named the subcommittee's ranking member, asked Ngo if he believed antifa would end up going away if the matter is not discussed in the media or Congress. Ngo, who has covered rioting in the Pacific Northwest, pointed out that even after President Biden won the election, there has been violence.\n\nSENATE COMMITTEE SHOULD EXAMINE ALL TYPES OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE\n\n\"No, they're not going away,\" Ngo said, adding that after the Nov. 3 election, the National Guard was activated in Portland , Oregon, by the state's governor as \"more than 100 masked militants marauded through downtown destroying property.\"\n\nHe pointed out that left-wing rioters in Portland vandalized a church that provides services to homeless people following the election. Additionally, Ngo noted antifa violence in Portland and Seattle on the night of Biden's inauguration.\n\nNgo said he thinks \"the lack of understanding\" about violence from antifa and other far-left groups is because of a dearth of attention from major news outlets.\n\n\"There is not a lot of mainstream media coverage of it,\" he said. \"Lawmakers in D.C. will get their media coverage from the New York Times or Washington Post .\"\n\nHe said that while sometimes those publications will send journalists to the Pacific Northwest to cover the violence, \"by and large, they don't have somebody on the ground every day as riots are breaking out.\"\n\nNgo cited the so-called Capitol Hill Organized Protest, an autonomous zone set up by rioters in Seattle over the summer after police abandoned a precinct and allowed protesters to take over the building and the nearby area. He testified that \"people were bringing with them homemade explosives in their backpacks.\"\n\n\"It's my understanding of the law that these do count as terrorist acts,\" Ngo said, \"but they're not being reported as such or perceived as such for political reasons.\"\n\nThe editor said activists referring to themselves as \"anti-fascist,\" which antifa is short for, use that phrase because it is \"essentially marketing and branding to mask what is a very extremist, radical agenda to destabilize the republic.\"\n\nEarlier in the hearing, an analysis from the Anti-Defamation League was cited, which found that 75% of extremist-related murders in the past decade have been linked to right-wing extremists.\n\n\"Does that mean that the other 25% doesn't deserve attention? I don't think so,\" Ngo said. \"It's about keeping all Americans safe, and that includes investigating all extremist ideologies.\""

      "text": "Watch: German Leftist Party Chants Antifa Slogan Before Entering Parliament\n\nAuthored by Paul Joseph Watson via Modernity.news,\n\nMembers of the far-left Die Linke party proudly chanted an Antifa slogan before they entered the Bundestag parliament in Berlin after the German elections.\n\nAt one point, Die Linke (The Left) looked like they wouldn't even make it into parliament by failing to achieve 5 per cent of the vote, but a late rally driven by fearmongering over the Afd helped them to garner 8.8 per cent thanks to a last minute surge.\n\nLeft leaders Jan van Aken and Ines Schwerdtner and former chancellor candidate Heidi Reichinnek gathered for a photo-op with other MPs to chant, \"alerta, alerta, antifascista!\" outside the Bundestag.\n\nUnabhängig von der Parole „Alerta, alerta antifascista\" erzeugt diese Aufführung Unwohlsein beim Zusehen. Wenn Parolen und Kollektivismus sich in der Politik breitmachen, weichen Individualität, Vielfalt und Menschlichkeit. Das atmet den Geist der SED. pic.twitter.com/BZtXlFdpG9\n\n\"The phrase - \"attention, attention, anti-fascists\" - originated in 1920s Italy among leftist opponents of the Mussolini regime before being picked up in the Weimar Republic by the German leftist-extremist Antifascist Action group, the predecessor of the modern Antifa movement. The phrase is often heard at Antifa rallies worldwide to this day,\" reports Breitbart .\n\nIn other words, literal Communists who support a movement that has been defined as a domestic extremist organization by some countries now have a foothold in German politics.\n\nDie Linke was the most popular party among voters between the ages of 18 and 24 at 25 per cent, while the young female vote was crucial to them entering parliament.\n\n34 per cent of women who voted in that age bracket cast their ballot for Die Linke, with their nearest challengers being the Afd on just 14 per cent in that demographic.\n\n🚨🇩🇪Amongst young men the AfD is the No.1 party and amongst young women it's No.2 It's nice to know that some young people see through the leftist propaganda on college campuses. pic.twitter.com/1ZiKwG8d1Q\n\nThis is particularly striking given the plague of sexual harassment that women have suffered in German cities thanks to mass migration, something that Die Linke vehemently supports.\n\nMeanwhile, CDU election winner Friedrich Merz, who has ruled out a government coalition with the Afd despite the right-wing party coming in second, is already caving on his manifesto promises as a result of him relying on the left-establishment SPD to form a coalition.\n\nDespite the SPD being the clear losers on the night, falling to their worst election result since World War 2, they are likely to stay in government.\n\nMerz has signaled he wants a new government to be formed within weeks not months, suggesting he is willing to cede significant policy control to the SPD, particularly when it comes to border control.\n\nAfter vowing to rapidly increase deportations and impose strict border restrictions during the campaign, Merz immediately backtracked after winning the election.\n\n\"None of us wants to close the borders,\" Merz said in a blatant effort to appease the SPD.\n\nEssentially, Germany is right back to where it started, and it remains to be seen whether there will be much of the country left to save when the AfD has the opportunity to challenge the establishment again in the next election.\n\n*  *  *\n\nYour support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.

      "text": "Antifa Radicals Elected To The French And European Parliaments\n\nAuthored by Jonathan Turley,\n\nFor many years, I have testified and written about Antifa and its growing anti-free speech philosophy. Some Democratic leaders have embraced this violent movement, which continues to gain strength on campuses and its cities across the nation. It is also a global movement. That is reflected in the alarming election of Antifa candidates to the French National Assembly as well as the European Parliament .  That is quite an accomplishment for a movement that President Joe Biden dismissed as \"just an idea.\"\n\nAs discussed in my new book, \" The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage, \" I explore the history of Antifa as a movement that began in Germany:\n\n\"Antifa originated with European anarchist and Marxist groups from the 1920s, particularly Antifaschistische Aktion, a Communist group from the Weimar Republic before World War II. Its name resulted from the shortening of the German word antifaschistisch. In the United States, the modern movement emerged through the Anti- Racist Action (ARA) groups, which were dominated by anarchists and Marxists. It has an association with the anarchist organization Love and Rage, which was founded by former Trotsky and Marxist followers as well as offshoots like Mexico's Amor Y Rabia. The oldest U.S. group is likely the Rose City Antifa (RCA) in Portland, Oregon, which would become the center of violent riots during the Trump years. The anarchist roots of the group give it the same organizational profile as such groups in the early twentieth century with uncertain leadership and undefined structures.\"\n\nDespite the denial of its existence by figures like Rep. Jerry Nadler (D., N.Y.), I have long written and spoken about the threat of Antifa to free speech on our campuses and in our communities. This includes testimony before Congress on Antifa's central role in the anti-free speech movement nationally.\n\nAs I have previously written, it has long been the \"Keyser Söze\" of the anti-free speech movement , a loosely aligned group that employs measures to avoid easy detection or association.  Yet, FBI Director Chris Wray has repeatedly pushed back on the denials of Antifa's work or violence. In one hearing, Wray stated \"And we have quite a number\" - and \"Antifa is a real thing. It's not a fiction.\"\n\nWe have continued to follow the attacks and arrests of Antifa followers across the country, including attacks on journalists .\n\nSome Democrats have played a dangerous game in supporting or excusing the work of Antifa. Former Democratic National Committee deputy chair Keith Ellison, now the Minnesota attorney general, once said Antifa would \"strike fear in the heart\" of Trump. This was after Antifa had been involved in numerous acts of violence and its website was banned in Germany.\n\nEllison's son, Minneapolis City Council member Jeremiah Ellison, declared his allegiance to Antifa in the heat of the protests this summer. During a prior hearing , Democratic senators refused to clearly denounce Antifa and falsely suggested that the far right was the primary cause of recent violence. Likewise, Joe Biden has dismissed objections to Antifa as just \"an idea.\"\n\nIt is at its base a movement at war with free speech, defining the right itself as a tool of oppression. That purpose is evident in what is called the \"bible\" of the Antifa movement: Rutgers Professor Mark Bray's Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook .\n\nBray emphasizes the struggle of the movement against free speech: \"At the heart of the anti-fascist outlook is a rejection of the classical liberal phrase that says, 'I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.'\"\n\nBray admits that \"most Americans in Antifa have been anarchists or antiauthoritarian communists...  From that standpoint, 'free speech' as such is merely a bourgeois fantasy unworthy of consideration.\"\n\nThe movement continues to take hold among parties on the left. An Antifa leader who is on France's national security watchlist was elected to the National Assembly as a member of the New Popular Front leftist bloc.  Raphaël Arnault will represent Vaucluse in Provence in the French parliament after winning with 54.98 per cent of the vote, according to Le Figaro.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and his moderate party worked with the New Popular Front in a power deal to defeat conservatives.\n\nAntifa was part of that front.\n\nIn Italy, Ilaria Salis, a school teacher by trade from Milan, Italy, has been elected to the European Parliament despite being arrested in 2023 in Budapest for allegedly taking part in the organized attack by Antifa on attendees of an event commemorating the anniversary of the siege of the Buda castle by the Soviet forces in 1945. Salis' far-left green alliance Alleanza Verdi e Sinistra (AVS) succeeded in securing the seat with the backing of far-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon's La France Insoumise (LFI) party - a member of the New Popular Front alliance.\n\nThese two milestones were secured only with the help of mainstream parties and leaders who continue to delude themselves about Antifa and its true agenda. While convenient allies now to win elections, these same leaders could soon find themselves the next reactionaries denounced by these same radical groups as they gain greater power.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "A Whimper, Not A Bang: Where Was Antifa After Trump's Victory?\n\nAuthored by David Reaboi via Late Republic Nonsense ,\n\nPerhaps the only disappointment for those of us elated with the outcome of this month's presidential election was the muted, downcast response from the Left at Donald Trump's massive victory.\n\nWe'd expected angry riots from purple-haired Antifa goons ; emotive demonstrations of impotent and self-righteous defiance by Handmaid's Tale cosplayers; and, maybe best of all, delicious cable news highlight reels reminiscent of Hillary Clinton's surprise defeat in 2016. The quiet sobbing we got instead came as somewhat of a surprise.\n\nFor the Left, it all seemed to end, as it did at Kamala Harris's victory party at Howard University, with a whimper. There was no defiant or fiery speech that night; in fact, the candidate wasn't seen at all, unwilling to face even the dedicated supporters who had worked hardest for her candidacy. Over the next few days, while there was some hissing and a few entertaining misfiring synapses at MSNBC and CNN - including some angry denunciations of elements of the Democrat coalition - the emotion seemed forced and perfunctory.\n\nFor many, though, the downbeat response to Trump's victory seemed out of place, given the feverish severity of how Democrats had articulated the stakes of this election. In her final month, Harris's campaign dispensed with messaging on any issues, leaning hard into explicit comparisons of Trump with Adolf Hitler, and of MAGA politics with fascism and Nazism, evoking the specter of American death camps in the event of the ex-president's victory.\n\nUsing a strategically-timed news-hook from former Trump Chief of Staff John Kelly, Harris stared gravely into the camera outside her residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory, warning that her opponent was no longer simply a \" threat to democracy\" but, as a Hitlerian-Nazi-Fascist, was openly dedicated to its destruction. The setting, too, was significant: rather than simply reaching down into the rhetorical gutter at a campaign stop, she was using the trappings of her role as vice president to make an official pronouncement on a rival domestic political leader, using language usually reserved for foreign enemies with whom we are at war. The bloody result of a Trump victory, Harris and her media surrogates assured us, was certain.\n\nWhile some in the press had never been shy of slandering Donald Trump as a \"fascist,\" the message coming from the candidate herself marked a serious escalation.\n\nAfter all, when faced with an enemy that would extinguish all freedom in America and usher in a holocaust, procedural resistance in courtrooms or acts of civil disobedience are plainly inadequate. With the evil of a Hitler, there is no negotiation, comity, civility, or ordinary politics; only violent resistance is commensurate with the threat.\n\nSome on the Left received the message clearly, as intended. Even before Harris herself began referring to him as a \"fascist,\" Trump had already been the attempted victim of two failed assassinations . Immediately following the first shooter's very near miss, the New Republic all but endorsed this violent, final solution to the Trumpian problem , revealing a menacing, monochrome drawing of the former president on its cover complete with Hitler mustache. And below the image - subtle, in the color of dried blood - was the headline, \"American Fascism: What It Would Look Like\" in faux-Germanic typeface. Scandalously, law enforcement disappeared any information about the would-be assassins' motives, saving the Democrats having to address the fact that their manifestos dovetailed too closely with the party's messaging.\n\nAll this gathered momentum and intensity in the press until, on the evening of November 5, \"our sacred democracy\" simply ended. Donald Trump won the electoral college and the popular vote by wide margins, and his party was in control of every branch of the Federal government. The people had spoken with a clear and resounding voice. If you'd been following the speeches of Vice President Harris, you'd assume that what they wanted was Nazi Germany.\n\nWhen the defeated Democrat finally emerged in public early the next evening, however, her tone had shifted. \"Earlier today,\" she told the crowd, \"I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory. I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition...\" Would she congratulate Hitler for his victory? Would she help Hitler's team during their transition?\n\nThe Democrats had gone to the very edge of American discourse - beyond which is the disintegration of normal political life - and then, when they'd been repudiated by the voters, meekly pulled back. By stubbornly denying us our riots and hoped-for schadenfreude , the Left had us confused . We on the Right weren't the only ones expecting immediate rage from Antifa and aligned groups in the event of a Republican victory; after all, half of downtown Washington, D.C., was boarded up in anticipation of election night. Why did nothing happen?\n\nThe surface explanation, of course, is that the Democrats didn't really believe any of it ; all that rhetorical venom was merely cynical election year politics at the final crunch of a close election. That theory certainly has some merit, based on the warm, smiling welcome with which Joe Biden received the victorious former president at the White House. And, while corrosive to social cohesion, the gambit made strategic sense: as Trump was gaining momentum in the final weeks, Democrats began to grow despondent. Harris's campaign needed to raise the temperature to make sure her most committed voters got to the polls.\n\nEven if the leadership of the Democratic Party and its surrogates in the media were simply generating outrage, millions of Americans in their audiences now believe, with conviction, that the long night of fascism has finally descended on America. The rhetoric naturally calls to mind Antifa, the bands of militant \"Antifascists\" who inflicted so much disorder on the country during the first Trump administration. For many on the Right, the trauma of the Black Lives Matter riots on the heels of Covid in 2020 - followed by Trump being turned out of the White House the next January - has made us understandably jumpy about black-blocs and cities ablaze in destructive, ideological rage.\n\nHarris's scurrilous rhetoric about Trump's alleged fondness for Hitler, however, wasn't aimed at bringing Antifa's violent shock troops into the streets, but at radicalizing the far larger cohort of mainstream Democrats. (After all, Antifa believes both Biden and Harris qualify as \"fascists\" and, for good measure, \"war criminals.\") But Antifa has always been more strategic than it is reactive, and it's far more concerned with revolutionary politics than with the electoral variety.\n\nFor many of the senior Antifa thinkers and organizers, the model of 1968 continues to resonate: even as the protests against the Vietnam War had been gaining strength for a half-decade, it wasn't until the election of Richard Nixon that the Left's mass-movement exploded. Presented with the foil of a \"law-and-order\" Republican hate-object, the intensity of the anti-war protest movement ballooned, leading to the radicalization of militant groups like the Weather Underground into outright terrorism.\n\nThis was only achievable with the assistance of the media; unencumbered by the balancing act of having to defend a Democrat president, print and television journalists created a roar of grassroots anger that provided far-Left radicals with new recruits, funding, and energy. The parallels to Trump's return to the White House are significant, and the opportunity for a replay of this dynamic has certainly not escaped Antifa's strategic thinkers.\n\nIt's a common misconception that Left-wing violent protest is a spasm of powerlessness. While a David and Goliath narrative is useful in many overseas conflicts, in the United States, violent protest is most useful when it can be used as an expression of majority frustration against an easily identifiable (and beatable) tyrannical minority. Regardless of income bracket, Americans like to think of themselves as middle-clas s, have a bourgeois investment in the continuance of society, and resent violent revolutionaries and anarchists.\n\nUnlike in Europe, significant Left-wing violent riots in America don't appear spontaneously in response to lost elections; they exist in the context of more sweeping political mobilizations that can plausibly be described by allied media as \"largely peaceful.\" As with Nixon and the anti-war movement, the media is the essential element in creating conditions for justifying the cause of unrest and ignoring or contextualizing violent excesses.\n\nIn this way, Antifa is useful as a fearsome tip of the spear, then melting away into a grander social justice narrative that is, on its surface, familiar and sympathetic rather than threatening. As such, all successful modern Left-wing movements in this country are framed in the language of civil rights. The successes of the Left's modern race-oriented protest movements - Trayvon Martin (2012), Michael Brown (2014), and George Floyd (2020) - illustrate that the Left learned valuable lessons about the kind of topical triggers that work, and those that fail. The coming mass mobilization in response to Trump's promises on immigration and deportation will be an obvious inciting event, and law enforcement needs to be prepared, especially in blue states.\n\nIn short , we didn't see post-election violence or mass protests because the scale of Trump's victory meant that such rioting would appear - at least temporarily - as the angry self-indulgence of a minority that had been legitimately beaten at the ballot box. But the riots will come soon enough, and Antifa will menace the streets once again. While it wouldn't have served to activate them during or after the 2024 campaign, the Democrats' rhetoric about fascism and Nazism is a boon to Antifa, which looks forward to being presented again (as it was memorably in 2020, storming the beach at Normandy) as \"freedom fighters\" in the media's next just cause.\n\nSubscribe to Late Republic Nonsense here\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "The Naughty List: Former Obama Aides & Liberal Influencers Sell Antifa Line Of Holiday Gifts\n\nAuthored by Jonathan Turley,\n\nIt appears no liberal Christmas is complete without the ultimate stocking stuffer: an actual stocking to wear over your face while rioting. While not yet selling face coverings for anonymous violence, Crooked Media, co-founded by former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor, is selling a line of Antifa items for liberals wanting to make a statement against any \"Peace on Earth.\" (As of this posting, Antifa items were still being sold on the \"Crooked Store\" site). You can now proudly wear your \"Antifa Dad\" hat to signal your support for political violence and deplatforming. It is the ultimate naughty gift list for putting the slay back into your Sleigh Bells.\n\nThese liberal hosts and their \"POD SAVE AMERICA\" show have been featured on various shows and courted by figures like Hillary Clinton .\n\nThere is no apparent backlash for their support of one of the most violent groups in the world, which routinely attacks journalists and anyone who holds opposing views. Imagine the media response if a conservative site started selling \"Proud Boy\" items.\n\nYet, Crooked Media is now offering liberals the chance to buy \"ANTIFA\" onesies for babies, a T-shirt for toddlers reading  \"ANTIFA\" and other items.\n\nJust to make sure that everyone understands the support for the violent group, a spokesperson for Crooked Media told Fox News Digital that the clothes it has listed on its website \"are not a joke.\" The spokesman added that \"all toddlers are antifa until their souls are broken by capitalism.\"\n\nAs discussed in my new book, \" The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage ,\" I explore the history of Antifa as a movement that began in Germany:\n\n\"Antifa originated with European anarchist and Marxist groups from the 1920s, particularly Antifaschistische Aktion, a Communist group from the Weimar Republic before World War II. Its name resulted from the shortening of the German word antifaschistisch. In the United States, the modern movement emerged through the Anti- Racist Action (ARA) groups, which were dominated by anarchists and Marxists. It has an association with the anarchist organization Love and Rage, which was founded by former Trotsky and Marxist followers as well as offshoots like Mexico's Amor Y Rabia. The oldest U.S. group is likely the Rose City Antifa (RCA) in Portland, Oregon, which would become the center of violent riots during the Trump years. The anarchist roots of the group give it the same organizational profile as such groups in the early twentieth century with uncertain leadership and undefined structures.\"\n\nDespite the denial of its existence by figures like Rep. Jerry Nadler (D., N.Y.), I have long written and spoken about the threat of Antifa to free speech on our campuses and in our communities. This includes testimony before Congress on Antifa's central role in the anti-free speech movement nationally.\n\nAs I have previously written, it has long been the \"Keyser Söze\" of the anti-free speech movement , a loosely aligned group that employs measures to avoid easy detection or association.  Yet, FBI Director Chris Wray has repeatedly pushed back on the denials of Antifa's work or violence. In one hearing, Wray stated, \"And we have quite a number\" - and \"Antifa is a real thing. It's not a fiction.\"\n\nWe have continued to follow the attacks and arrests of Antifa followers across the country, including attacks on journalists .\n\nSome Democrats have played a dangerous game in supporting or excusing the work of Antifa. Former Democratic National Committee deputy chair Keith Ellison, now the Minnesota attorney general, once said Antifa would \"strike fear in the heart\" of Trump. This was after Antifa had been involved in numerous acts of violence, and its website was banned in Germany.\n\nEllison's son, Minneapolis City Council member Jeremiah Ellison, declared his allegiance to Antifa in the heat of the protests this summer. During a prior hearing , Democratic senators refused to clearly denounce Antifa and falsely suggested that the far right was the primary cause of recent violence. Likewise, Joe Biden has dismissed objections to Antifa as just \"an idea.\"\n\nIt is at its base a movement at war with free speech, defining the right itself as a tool of oppression . That purpose is evident in what is called the \"bible\" of the Antifa movement: Rutgers Professor Mark Bray's Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook .\n\nBray emphasizes the struggle of the movement against free speech: \"At the heart of the anti-fascist outlook is a rejection of the classical liberal phrase that says, 'I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.'\"\n\nBray admits that \"most Americans in Antifa have been anarchists or antiauthoritarian communists...  From that standpoint, 'free speech' as such is merely a bourgeois fantasy unworthy of consideration.\"\n\nNow, liberal families can bring a small part of that political violence into their homes for the holiday to pledge that there will be no peace or silent nights so long as opposing views are heard. Antifa has gone retail, and there is no better way to celebrate political violence and rage than your Antifa onesie.\n\nWith tensions rising after the election, the embrace of organizations like Antifa will only fuel calls for violent action. Liberal figures like ex-Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz have even conveyed support for the assassination of  UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan.\n\nIt is not the time to go full naughty list to celebrate a group that regularly beats reporters and others with opposing viewpoints. While this may appeal to your own special smash-mouth Santa, tis the season for political violence.\n\n*  *  *\n\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University and the author of \" The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage .\"\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Mark Bray's Lies About Antifa Legitimizing the anarcho-communism of leftist fascism as its revolution proceeds.\n\nW ho is Mark Bray, and why is he being given a platform in major news outlets, such as the New York Times , the Washington Post , and the New York Post , to provide a rebuttal to the president's call to designate Antifa a domestic terrorist group?\n\nBray is a lecturer in history at Rutgers (and formerly at Dartmouth) and author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook .\n\nThough claiming to caution \"about painting large groups of people with a broad brush,\" Bray asserts that \"Trump supporters voted for their candidate either because of or despite his misogyny, racism, ableism, Islamophobia, and many more hateful traits.\"\n\nAs cities have burned across the country, Bray has been consulted as an authority to explain what Antifa is and why it could not be designated a domestic terrorist group. He was also given an opportunity to dissemble in an op-ed in the Washington Post , where he claimed that Antifa nobly \"traces its heritage back to the radicals who resisted Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.\" Today it is a loose confederation of ad hoc groups opposed to racism, imperialism, and white supremacy, employing \"militant self-defense against the police and the targeted destruction of police and capitalist property that has accompanied it.\" This is in line with his recent tweet asserting that Antifa has no \" overarching organization , with a chain of command.\" Yet, he donates the proceeds of his book to \"Antifa,\" in other words conducts a fundraiser for an organization, which must have enough of a \"chain of command\" to have authorized someone to cash checks. At the same time, Rutgers University lists the book as part of his scholarly qualifications .\n\nBut are Antifa activists simply volunteers working against racism, imperialism, white supremacy, and police brutality? Don't we all have the right to \"self-defense\"? The way Bray presents Antifa in his op-ed, you would think it was as American as the Boston Tea Party.\n\nBut that is not what Bray says in his book, a work that rivals in historical distortion Howard Zinn 's A People's History of the United States.\n\nIn it, Bray presents variants of socialism, communism, and anarchism as the only alternatives to the \"fascist menace.\" He explained on \" Meet the Press \" in 2017 that Antifa's politics are varied but limited to \"pan-left radical politics uniting communists, socialists, anarchists and various different radical leftists.\" Like Zinn, he claims to eschew Stalinist statist communism and favors \"anarcho-communism,\" a system in which all contribute voluntarily to the economy, according to his abilities and needs. But the experiments that have failed since ancient times are not a concern for this history professor.\n\nNor do classical liberalism, constitutional republicanism, or natural rights have a place.\n\nIn fact, according to his book, Antifa's is \"an illiberal politics of social revolutionism applied to fighting the Far Right, not only literal fascists.\" At \"the heart of the anti-fascist outlook\" is rejection of \"the classical liberal phrase ... 'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.' \" Such denial of First Amendment rights is justified: \"After Auschwitz and Treblinka, anti-fascists committed themselves to fighting to the death the ability of organized Nazis to say anything.\"\n\nAfter giving a Zinn-like historical overview of the history of fascism in Europe - a revival of the old communist version that says communists and their allies, alone, resisted fascism - and its resurgence after World War II, documented by interviews of Antifa members identified by first name (or pseudonym) only, Bray leaps over to America, where Antifa came to fight the fascists in \"pinstripes\" (Wall Street capitalists) and in \"tuxedoes\" (today, Trump supporters attending the \"Deplorables\" inaugural ball in January 2017).\n\nBray is determined \"to stem the tide of Trumpism.\"\n\nContrary to what he presents in the Washington Post , Bray reveals that his main purpose is not fighting the Ku Klux Klan and rogue cops.\n\nNo, we must fight \"everyday fascists,\" the \"ardent Trump supporters who 'tell it like it is' by actively trying to dismantle the taboos against oppression that the movements for feminism, black liberation, queer liberation, and others have given actual blood, sweat, and tears to establish.\" These movements are the \"bulwarks against fascism.\"\n\nAnd if you are not on board with these movements, you support fascism.\n\nThough claiming to caution \"about painting large groups of people with a broad brush,\" Bray asserts that \"Trump supporters voted for their candidate either because of or despite his misogyny, racism, ableism, Islamophobia, and many more hateful traits.\" Though it is important, he says, to \"distinguish between ideologues and their capricious followers,\" one must not \"overlook how these popular bases of support create the foundations for fascism to manifest itself.\"\n\nHe gives a warning from history (his version of it): \"we must bear in mind that the fascist regimes of the past could not have survived without a broad layer of public support.\" Since \"Trump's victory,\" this \"public support\" consists of a \"dangerous mix of mainstream conservatives who do not want to appear racist, and alt-right 'race realists' who all accuse the 'Left' of so over-using the term racism that it is rendered meaningless.\"\n\nFor years, we have been hearing smears about Trump supporters being misogynist, racist, Islamophobic, etc. But this is overheated rhetoric from the likes of Jennifer Rubin and Max Boot.\n\nBray, however, openly advocates violence and intimidation to make Trump supporters \"recede into hiding\" - just as Antifa has done to \"fascists\" in Europe. He replies, \"to those who argue that this would make us no better than Nazis, our critique is not against violence, incivility, discrimination, or disrupting speeches in the abstract, but against those who do so in the service of white supremacy, hetero-patriarchy, class oppression, and genocide.\"\n\nIn other words, it's just fine to employ violence, incivility, discrimination, and disruption to those whom he deems guilty of \"white supremacy, hetero-patriarchy, class oppression, and genocide.\"\n\nAntifa's goal is to \"make it politically, socially, economically\" costly for such people to \"articulate\" their ideas. Bray concludes, \"Our goal should be that in twenty years those who voted for Trump are too uncomfortable to share that fact in public.\"\n\nAnd once such \"everyday fascists\" are driven into hiding, Antifa should come up with \"better alternatives to the austerity and incompetence of the governing parties of the Right and Left.\"\n\nWe presume by that by \"the governing party of the Left\" he means Democrats. No doubt, as Joe Biden makes his bid for every single voter on the left, including rioters, while condemning the president as racist and hateful , he believes that his party will be protected from the Antifa brand of fascism.\n\nEvery once in a while, you run into something that...

      "text": "Georgia Should Crush Antifa Without Mercy The Atlanta insurrection is the Münster rebellion all over again, and it ought to be dealt with similarly.\n\nL et me state at the outset that my faith in Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who seems like the ultimate Good Time Charlie of American politics, to do what is necessary to successfully deal with what's happening in Atlanta is ... limited.\n\nI'm being kind.\n\nI don't expect Kemp to follow my advice. But I invite you to take a quick vacation to a slightly different world, a world in which Republican leadership of a red state (and Georgia is still a red state; if you don't agree, just look at the composition of its state legislature, statewide elected officials, and congressional delegation) actually means something.\n\nIn other words, if Brian Kemp had the sand to do what ought to be done with the scum , mostly from out of town , that is turning Georgia's capital city into Münster, Germany, circa 1534 .\n\nIf that reference is a bit too obscure for you, here's a recap. Starting in 1532, a group of anti-Catholic radicals settled in the town of Münster, in the Westphalia region of northern Germany, and distributed pamphlets among the poor calling for the absolute equality of man in all matters - mostly notably the distribution of wealth. The pamphlets had it that the poor were the elect of Heaven and, by golly, they ought to reap some benefit from that. This was the creed of the early Anabaptist sect, who were absolutely the Antifa of their day, and the Münster Anabaptists were led by a radical Lutheran pastor named Bernard Rothmann.\n\nThese guys eventually figured out that God was calling them to take political power over the town, and when the locals had been sufficiently converted to the new radical egalitarian faith, they managed to sweep the local elections, depose the old-line magistrates in charge, and elect one of their number, a wealthy wool merchant named Bernhard Knipperdolling, as the mayor. This turned Münster into a magnet for the Anabaptists who flooded the city, including a couple of ne'er-do-wells - a tailor from Leiden named Jan Bockelson, known as John of Leiden, and a baker from Haarlem named Jan Matthys.\n\nIt didn't take long before the Anabaptists greatly outnumbered the old-line Lutherans and Catholics in Münster, and, after Rothmann called for mass adult baptisms, they were busy dunking folks in every water repository they could find - which was quite uplifting for many and generally harmless for the rest. But when rebaptism became compulsory, and the zealots began rampaging through cathedrals and monasteries and smashing statues and other icons (boy howdy, this stuff is starting to sound familiar, amirite?), the adults elsewhere began to take a more jaundiced view of what Bockelson and others were calling the \"New Jerusalem\" in Münster.\n\nHere's where we introduce Franz von Waldeck, who was the Catholic bishop of Münster. Von Waldeck was among those not gaining much enjoyment from the happenings in his town; in fact, the Anabaptists showed him the city gate and insisted that he reside on the other side of it. He took his expulsion with a deficit of good cheer, in fact raising an army and laying siege to the city.\n\nAnd this is where 1534 comes off a little differently than 2023. Because when von Waldeck's men encircled Münster, Matthys, who fancied himself the new incarnation of the angel Gideon, led a band of Anabaptists (reporting is sketchy on the subject, but if you want to think of them as wearing all black, including black masks, you're welcome to do so) outside the city gates in order to raise the siege. That didn't go so well, as Matthys' force was quickly encircled and routed, and the good bishop had his head removed and placed atop a tall pike for all of Münster to see. In case that wasn't quite demonstrative enough as a signal of his displeasure, he had Matthys' genitals nailed to the city gate.\n\nBut wait, there's more to the story. Because while the Anabaptists were having trouble expanding their little Münster Autonomous Zone, they were for a time quite successful in bringing about social change within it. Knipperdolling, the mayor, was busily preaching a number of things that sound a bit familiar: that men are not justified by their faith in Christ; that there is no original sin; that infants ought not to be baptized and that immersion is the only mode of baptism; that everyone has the authority to preach and administer the sacraments; that men are not obliged to pay respect to magistrates; that all things ought to be in common; and that it is lawful to marry many wives.\n\nHe didn't quite say all cops are bastards, but that wasn't quite yet a thing in the 16th century. You get the general gist, though.\n\nAnd Knipperdolling was the moderate of the group. He managed to talk Matthys out of a plan to murder all non-Anabaptists in Münster; Knipperdolling's idea was just to demand they surrender their property to the collective and then submit to being dunked or get the hell out of town. But after Matthys' career as a social justice warrior came to a suboptimal end, John of Leiden - Bockelson, that is - took over as the grand poo-bah of the New Jerusalem. And Bockelson didn't play quite so well with Knipperdolling. They quarreled in a short power struggle, which ended in Bockelson naming himself king - he very modestly referred to himself as the New David - and Knipperdolling being thrown in prison to cool his heels. But that kerfuffle was resolved with Knipperdolling accepting a job as vice-king and Münster's chief executioner of heretics, and Bockelson marrying Knipperdolling's daughter along with a whole host of other women.\n\nSixteen, to be exact. Though before you marvel at his ability to spin plates, let's understand that it's said that the prospective 17th Bockelson bride, an unfortunately obstinate woman named Elisabeth Wandscherer, was repaid for her refusal to join his harem with a beheading in the marketplace. King John the Tailor had passed a law, you see, that obligated all the Münster women to accept the first proposal of marriage made to them, which certainly changed things up a bit.\n\nThis was a pretty heady triumph for a 25-year-old who a year earlier was measuring people from crotch to ankle.\n\nBut alas, it didn't last. While the Anabaptists did achieve social justice, in that, other than Bockelson's little ruling elite, the citizens of Münster were all equally starving under the siege, Münster quickly fell into ruin. And by June 24, 1535, the Münster Autonomous Zone met its end when the good bishop and his army stormed the city, routed its defenders, and rounded up the rebellion's leadership. And on Jan. 22, 1536, Kniperdolling and Bockelson and the other ringleaders were tortured and executed with great fanfare in the town marketplace, their bodies placed in cages that hung from the steeple at St. Lambert's Church for the next half-century.\n\nWe operate in a bit less dramatic of a fashion nowadays, and, as I said, I don't have much faith that Brian Kemp will feel a calling to copy the way of Bishop von Waldeck. Instead of sieges and nailing testicles to city gates, we have \"white flight,\" \"municipal bankruptcy,\" and \"federal indictments\" as a way of policing totalitarian heresies. Those are more in keeping with modern sensibilities, to be sure.\n\nBut there's a problem with that: our experience seems to show that modern ways, humane though they may be, are a bit less effective in proving to the fanatics that their theories don't work. Bishop von Waldeck was able to restore Münster to market economics and civil society in just 18 months and there is no such timetable for Atlanta.\n\nNot given the damage Antifa, not to mention the former mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, has already done. Don't forget that the current insurrection in that city is merely a redux of 2020, when Antifa loons burned out the headquarters of CNN downtown; now, CNN has said they'd vacate the place for some reason. And in a \"watch what they do, not what they say,\" the media organ had on its air Monday a \"freelance journalist\" named David Peisner who said, \"I do think that you keep using these words violent, violent, violent, violent, and it gives the impression that - the only violence that are - the only acts of violence against people that I saw were actually police tackling protesters.\"\n\nThis while images of a burning cop car and black-clad goons throwing rocks at the Atlanta Police Foundation building played on the screen.\n\nWell - surprise! - Peisner turns out to be raising money for a domestic terrorist named Manuel Esteban Paez Teran, who shot a Georgia state trooper at the site of the future Atlanta Public Safety Training Center and found himself unable to sustain normal body temperature or a heartbeat after the predictable reaction.\n\nOne longs for von Waldeck. That clearly not being in the cards, Kemp might at least send the state troopers or even the Georgia National Guard into the Atlanta Autonomous Zone to inflict a modicum of violence and incarceration among the insurrectionist Antifa mob before this affront to law and order destroys what remains of his capital city.\n\nEvery once in a while, you run into something that...

      "text": "Radical 'Anti-Fascists' Are Pretty Darn Fascist\n\nA ntifa, short for 'Anti-Fascist,' is a term used by and for far-left protesters across the globe. If you've heard of the Berkeley riots against Milo Yiannopoulos, or the threats made against Ann Coulter, you are familiar with at least some of their work. They support using violence and intimidation against politicians and civilian populations perceived as fascist in order to force acceptance of their demands. While fascism has historically been understood as an authoritarian philosophy that calls for government control over industry and the suppression of dissent, to Antifa it means essentially any right-of-center belief. To this end they have targeted protesters, assaulted conservative journalists , sent death threats to a Latino family after misidentifying them as neo-Nazis, attacked 80-year-old grandmothers and high school students with bats, and even stabbed horses .\n\nAntifa is not one movement with a centralized leadership, but instead a loose association of groups and individuals with the same general philosophy and goals. Antifa is broken into cells, such as \"Antifa Midwest\" or \"Berkeley Antifa\" which are the nucleus of organizing and planning protests and events. Antifa groups will frequently promote or retweet each other's content and events, but generally do not coordinate with one another except for major events, such as Trump's inauguration or the May Day protests. When they riot, they use black bloc strategies, alternatively covering their heads with hoodies and faces with bandannas or shirts for anonymity while they smash windows and assault onlookers, and slipping into civilian clothing to blend in among the crowd of peaceful protesters and evade capture by the police. While their weapons have thus far been Molotov cocktails, bricks, bats, and crude blades, they have also sold concealed knives and after the Berkeley riots several members suggested using guns in a sign of things to come.\n\nAmong violent German \"Antifascist\" protesters, Heat Stre et reports that 92% live with their parents, 84% are male, 72% are aged 18-29, 90% are single, and 34% are unemployed. In America they also appear to be largely white college students, though no comprehensive demographic survey of American Antifa has been conducted yet.\n\nWhile Antifa has existed in some form for decades as an underground association, the election of Donald Trump seems to have brought them front and center and their ideas have become more and more accepted into the political mainstream. The Daily Californian Editorial Board described the Antifa riots in Berkeley, which injured 6 and caused over $100,000 in property damage , as \"defending communities.\"  The Pacific Standard has suggested that in the age of Trump, Antifa are \"the most reasonable people in America.\" One has to wonder what these \"reasonable people\" must think of the would-be assassin who left House Majority Whip Steve Scalise in critical condition, or of the climate of hate that produced him. Even as media sources like Vox insist that there is \"no evidence\" that the far left shooter who was active on anti-Trump social media, had worked for Bernie Sanders' campaign, and had participated in marches against Donald Trump, was incited to violence by the left's rhetoric, militant \"anti-fascists\" are celebrating the shooting. It should be no surprise that this happened; after all the underlying message that violence against fascists is justified and that Republicans are fascist is a core part of the wider Antifa message. Many echoed this sentiment on Twitter, expressing support for the shooter and regret that more Republicans were not hit, suggesting that Republicans deserve to be murdered either for supporting gun rights or trying to repeal Obamacare.\n\nAntifa might be aggressive, but it has not been successful. While it has managed to shut down a couple of speakers and beat a few people up, it has not been able to scare people away from their beliefs. Conservatives are standing by their principles. Alabama representative Mo Brooks, who was on the scene of the shooting and who helped Scalise until medical attention could be provided, said in an interview with CNN in response to a question about gun control that \"the Second Amendment right to bear arms is to ensure that we always have a republic. And as with any constitutional provision in the Bill of Rights, there are adverse aspects to each of those rights that we enjoy as people... but we're not going to get rid of freedom of speech because some people say some really ugly things that hurt other people's feelings. We're not going to get rid of Fourth Amendment search and seizure rights because it allows some criminals to go free who should be behind bars.\" Americans, it would seem, are not about to give in to terror. Only time will tell if Antifa will realize this.\n\nThe vast majority of anti-Trump protesters are not Antifa radicals bent on silencing dissent and using terror. Peaceful protest is protected under the First Amendment, and everybody in America has the right to signal their disagreement with the government. The actions of extremists should not be used to justify an infringement on those rights. But the shooting of Scalise shows that those calling for violence cannot be brushed off simply as fringe radicals, and the ideas that these people hold have the potential to be legitimately dangerous. The \"resistance\" to Trump should seriously consider whether it wants angry, hooded, extremists and champagne socialists to be the face of its movement.\n\nIf the mainstream left truly supports peaceful dialogue, it must stop providing shelter to Antifa activists. When black bloc insurgents try to co-opt non-violent demonstrations, protesters should block them out of the crowd, seize them, or point them out to the police. As long as the moderate left tolerates and praises these insurgents, and affords them cover and immunity for their actions, they will be complicit in the violence that Antifa perpetuates.\n\nAs of today, a petition calling on president to declare Antifa a domestic terror organization has received over 86,000 signatures.\n\nEvery once in a while, you run into something that...

      "text": "Begging for Soy in Antifastan Seattle's Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone devolves into near-immediate hilarity.\n\nH istory might not quite repeat itself, but it certainly does offer reboots of past classics. This week's debut of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, a six-block site of an anarcho-communist insurrection in Seattle in which an armed cabal of Antifa loons chased the local police out of a precinct building and cordoned off what had been a relatively upscale area nearby to City Hall as a little slice of Marxist utopia amid the racism and brutality of one of America's most thoroughly Democrat cities, might have seemed like something new.\n\nIt isn't. And the results are entirely predictable.\n\nAntifastan, which is a far more apt moniker for the Left's newest little shop of horrors in Seattle, should never have been allowed to come to pass. It's the culmination of years of weak leadership by that city's mayor and its city council, which have been dominated by Democrats since the last Republican mayor of the city left office in 1968. The current mayor of Seattle is an open lesbian second-generation Democrat political hack named Jenny Durkan, elected in 2017 after another Democrat political hack, Ed Murray, threw in the towel rather than seek reelection. That's likely Durkan's fate, as she's allowed herself to hit the exacta of urban Democrat governance failure: virulently anti-business public policy married with a weak-spined approach to the radical millenarian leftists among her voter base.\n\nSimilarly atrocious urban Democrat leaders like Jacob Frey and Lori Lightfoot have, until this week, stolen Durkan's thunder for the sheer magnitude of riots, looting, and property damage they've allowed in their cities, with Frey providing perhaps the starkest moment of failure when he was bullyragged away from a large public gathering for the sin of failing to support a full disbanding of that city's police department Minneapolis' city council had delivered a veto-proof majority for just a day or two earlier. But Lightfoot might have topped Frey for sheer calamity , as a call with Chicago's aldermen devolved into a torrent of invective and obscenity as one of them unloaded on her for failure to stop the rioting, which has all but destroyed the commercial sector on the city's south side.\n\nNeither one of them have had a separate country brew up within the city limits, though, which gives Durkan something of a checkmate against the competition ... at least so far.\n\nIn Antifastan, you've got a little bit of everything. You have the abdication of the city's police, which abandoned a precinct building to the Antifa rioters - unlike in Minneapolis, whose Third Precinct was torched (and all the contents of its evidence room torched with it), in Seattle the East Precinct was simply boarded up and abandoned. Perhaps it's too rainy in King County for a good blaze. You've also got armed Antifa goons working patrols having declared the place a cop-free zone; one suspects the training and command of constitutional law might be lacking in Antifastan's new law enforcement personnel. You have the little warlords in charge making lots of demands of the city and state government - 30 of them , to be exact, which cover everything from the abolition of not only Seattle's police but its entire judicial system, the emptying of the jails, the \"de-gentrification\" of the city of Seattle, free college for everybody in Washington as a form of reparations to black people (without a recitation of how black people are helped by free college that everybody else gets as well), and even that the hospitals and health-care clinics in Seattle provide black doctors to treat black patients.\n\nBut those aren't the only demands. It seems that Antifastan would like to order out as well. This, from one of the denizens of the new jurisdiction, who goes by the brilliantly unattractive Twitter handle of @anarchomastia (who we are given to believe is a person of, shall we say, exotic tastes in sexual behavior and gender):\n\nthe homeles [sic] people we invited took away all the food at the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.\n\nwe need more food to keep the area operation. please if possible bring vegan meat substitutes, fruits, oats, soy products, etc. - anything to help us eat\n\nThose damned ungrateful \"homeles.\" When are they ever going to be down with the cause?\n\nWe've seen attempts at Little Utopias brought on by armed mobs before. Perhaps the best example, outside of the less-colorful Paris Commune of 1870, would be the Münster Rebellion, in which a crazed sect of Anabaptists seized control of that northwest German city in 1534 and abolished law and order and private property, shortly assigning the various females under their jurisdiction to the care of the male citizens as plural wives while also shortly running out of foodstuffs. The local bishop, a rather intolerant fellow named Franz von Waldeck, was rather put off by having been ousted courtesy of the heretical zealots.\n\nSo von Waldeck promptly laid siege to the city and ultimately tortured and executed the leaders of the rebellion, whose military performance matched closely the expected prowess of the soy-fed shock troops of Antifastan.\n\nAll in all Münster didn't fare too badly; it was restored to market economics and the rule of law in 18 months, which is a quite more successful record than Democrats can offer with respect to, say, Detroit.\n\nBut Bishop von Waldeck's methods, which included nailing the testicles of beheaded utopian leaders to the city gates, won't likely be repeated when Antifastan does finally fall. Depending on your perspective, that might be a pity.\n\nOn the one hand, perhaps all this is relative. One is tempted to believe the Münster Anabaptists were made of sterner stuff than the current crop of radicals. The Anabaptists' demands included compulsory rebaptism, the outlawing of currency, and the banishing of Catholics; there is little evidence they required vegan meat substitutes and soy.\n\nOn the other hand, Jenny Durkan is no Bishop von Waldeck. It might require leadership from out of town to put an end to Antifastan.\n\nEvery once in a while, you run into something that... Read More\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

(RELATED: Entitlement Fraud Is Now a Stated Aim of the Democrat Party )\n\nArizona Senator Ruben Gallego, who joined other Senate Democrats in voting no to the Republican spending bill, posted on X that the legislation is a \"slap in the face to our veterans.\" Gallego argued that the cuts are so that President Trump and Elon Musk \"can give their buddies a tax break,\" calling it \"shameful\" and a \"sin against this country.\"\n\nSocial media users at the Washington D.C. event observe protestors shouting, \"Stand the f**k up,\" and \"Your choice is simple, America or Trump!\" as they march throughout the Capitol . Videos from the protest showed people sporting Ukraine flags, Luigi Mangione hats, ANTIFA posters, and \"F**k MAGA\" banners.\n\nBig protest on March 14th in D.C. This will be the biggest yet.

The comment resurfaced with former President Joe Biden in the first presidential debate in July but was promptly denied by Trump. \"That was a made-up quote, 'suckers and losers' .... We had 19 people that say I didn't say it,\" Trump said in response to Biden.\n\nThe Capitol protest was organized by Fourteenth Now! , an organization that deems Trump as an \"adjudicated insurrectionist, constitutionally disqualified for holding office\" for the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol protest. The organization chose March 14 to protest due to Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which \"demands those who engage in insurrection be barred from office.\"\n\nAn internal memo from Veterans Affairs Chief of Staff Christopher Syrek earlier this month underscored some of the issues veterans were marching against on Friday. The memo outlined plans for the VA to return to its 2019 \"end-strength numbers\" of 399,957 by eliminating 80,000 jobs.

      "text": "It's Time to Declare War on Identity Politics The one way to put a stop to \"white supremacy.\"\n\nT hree years ago, writing in the Federalist , I noted how the Left's embrace - and political deployment - of identity politics had given rise to, and become a perverse justification for (in its own hive mind), white supremacy, a blunt rejection of the collective call by the Left and academia to demonize whiteness.\n\nI pored over and unpacked the \"alt-right manifesto\" of an influential \"thought leader\" of the movement and found what was easily recognizable: a progressive strain placing it on par with La Raza, BLM, CAIR, and Occupy (now Antifa). It's essentially Farrakhanism in a bedsheet.\n\nThe El Paso shooter, if we believe his manifesto, was, for all intents and purposes, a confused National Socialist. He trafficked in identity and grievance politics while supporting much of the Green New Deal. He railed against capitalism and jobs lost to automation. He's a leftist - as were the Nazis - who found himself part of an unprotected class; the Dayton shooter supported, in addition to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, Antifa, which may have actually provided him gun tips in advance of his eventual spree killing. He, too, was a leftist.\n\nThis is why conservatives should deplore all identity and grievance politics, regardless of the color they take. Intersectionality, however, is the Left's stock and trade, from the academy to the media to Hollywood. Until that is marginalized, you won't kill white supremacy, despite pleadings by the editors at National Review .\n\nHere's why: Many of the motivations of the white supremacist movement, which Vox Day couched as \"alt-right\" in his alt-right \"manifesto,\" were predictable and - again, however perversely - understandable: in a political and cultural ethos wherein white straight Christian males have become one of the last \"identity groups\" eligible for collective hostility and scapegoating, there was bound to be defensive pushback. In my piece, I commiserated with some of the alt-right's concerns while rejecting its underlying philosophy; I counseled the rejection of all identity politics and intersectionality, suggesting instead a return to founding principles: constitutionalism, federalism, republicanism, the rule of law, assimilation, and - most crucially - individualism , individual rights, and autonomy.\n\nWhen Rep. Ayanna Pressley spoke out recently demanding people of color or non-traditional sexuality or certain religions she deems marginalized talk with a voice that matches their public face (\"black,\" \"brown,\" \"queer,\" \"Muslim\"), what she was demanding was rank tribalism.\n\nWhat comes to count as an acceptable \"voice,\" in Pressley's dangerous and dehumanizing formulation, is of course tied to a political stance, with progressives determining for all what constitutes \"authenticity.\" Not only is this dictate blatantly racist, homophobic, and wrong, but it has the further - and intended - effect of delegitimating individuality: there can be no black face with a black voice that doesn't stridently echo the black identity narrative progressives like Pressley have adopted and sanctioned. And the preferred identity narratives on the left are always grievance narratives posing as empowerment narratives.\n\nIt is thus inevitable that, in a cultural and political climate that rewards and empowers identity groups while it brackets individualism as some deplorable and dangerous social ill, those most marginalized by the prevailing norm would seek to gain power and \"legitimacy\" within that very system.\n\nIntersectionality developed, then, as a way to prioritize the leftist grievance scale, but the damage had already been done: as a free-floating individual in a political and cultural climate, one was rendered less than powerless (as he perceived it) in the ascendant identity hierarchy; yet in a group , for such individuals, the perception of regained political power and renewed purpose was able to take root. Thus, white supremacy became the extreme version of - and mirror image to - those group identities declaring themselves deserving of special dispensation. Perversely, it was being incentivized by a political milieu that had organized to marginalize it.\n\nAnd this is what we see now: anyone not hewing to leftist dogma is labeled a white supremacist, or racist, or -phobe of some kind, and this frees up a fringe to embrace the designation and marshal it for power. The resurgence of white supremacy is but the manifestation of a competing identity narrative in a toxic, Balkanized identity politics culture.\n\nUnless and until the foundations that undergird this culture are razed, it won't itself be effectively eradicated. It will merely go deeper underground, where it will become more difficult to locate and eradicate.\n\nTrump, I thought back in 2016, had given some cover to this new grievance narrative. But his presidency has shown a clear rejection of \"white supremacy,\" opting instead for an America First platform that has lifted (at least economically) every minority group, age group, and sex. It is a patriotic platform, not a racialist one, and as a result it has augured the reformation of the idea that the U.S. is a propositional nation. Trump rejected the \"genetic heritage\" and \"white culture\" alt-right leaders promoted as essential - in the strictest sense of blood and genes - to the country's salvation. As a result, white supremacists like Richard Spencer, who in a recent CNN appearance noted that most white supremacists don't support the president, have rejected Trumpism as anathema to their essentialist longings.\n\nTo the Left and adepts of identity politics, this return to the dignity of the individual is an existential threat to their political influence. Individuals thinking and acting individually defang bloc voting by identity, which is key to the Left's coalition power. And the Left has shown in the wake of recent shootings and civil unrest that it will not surrender its animating, identity politics program, which it continues ruthlessly to enforce through shaming, doxxing, boycotts, media propaganda, PC language, and physical intimidation. This totalitarian political impulse is at odds with our propositional nation.\n\nIt follows that stamping out white supremacy must happen either by force, or by thoroughly and completely rejecting the identity politics and intersectionality the Left has mapped over the country and its discourse. We are a country of individuals. We need to act like it.\n\nIt's time to declare war on identity politics. It may feel good to single one group out - hell, you might even believe it necessary - but if you don't destroy the foundation, you're just trying to fix a single broken window. During a rainstorm. And the rain is made of rocks.\n\nUnless and until you understand identity politics - how and why it works and from where it draws its \"intellectual\" power - you will not be able to stop it. Pumping your virtue glands does nothing but add to the foundation's decay.\n\nYou can follow Jeff Goldstein on Twitter @ProteinWisdom.\n\nEvery once in a while, you run into something that...

      "text": "The Terrorists of the Left\n\nA t Whitehouse.org, there's a petition with over 110,000 names demanding that the federal government declare Antifa to be a terrorist organization.\n\nThat's not a terrible idea, of course; if you've followed the antics of Antifa and the rioting and violence they've involved themselves in, you might well think of the current definition of domestic terrorism in federal law. That is action which...\n\n\"(A) involve(s) acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State; (B) appear(s) to be intended - (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C) occur(s) primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\"\n\nRioting would certainly be dangerous to human life, particularly when it's intended to intimidate the population into forgoing our right to free expression - look at the mob which showed up to riot not just against what looked like a gaggle of neo-Nazis in Charlottesville two weekends ago but the one which shut down a free speech rally featuring a pair of libertarian political candidates in Boston on Saturday.\n\nThey're not exactly the Symbionese Liberation Army, the Weathermen, the Klan or the Earth Liberation Front... yet. But wherever Antifa, and their Black Lives Matter pals, congregate it sure seems like beatings and property destruction are sure to follow, and it's also notable that somebody else's opinions which differ from the snowflake communism Antifa and Black Lives Matter have on offer - not just the white supremacist folks, but libertarians, classical liberals, old-school conservatives, traditionalist Americans, supporters of the police and practically anybody else they don't like - seem to bring these people out of the woodwork if those opinions are to be aired in public.\n\nWhat's especially interesting is the reaction of Antifa to the neo-Nazi crowd given the similarity of the politics between the two sides. They're both leftists fighting over the same market. No wonder the animus.\n\nCharlottesville looked a lot like Weimar Germany. Boston looked more like the Paris Commune in 1871. \"Counter-protesters\" numbering some 40,000 arrived to attack a rally they believed would be a white supremacist affair because some minuscule outfit affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan said they'd attend. Speakers at the event were hardly what one might expect of neo-Nazis, though; when Shiva Ayyadurai, running as a Republican against Liz Warren for the U.S. Senate, is a featured speaker, it's hard to make the event out as a white-power thing.\n\nFinding no Nazis to bloody, the Antifa nuts turned on the police instead. Some 33 arrests were made following the melee between the agitators and the Boston cops. The media reported the affair as \"mostly peaceful.\" By Antifa's standards that's probably not untrue; they've done far worse and certainly will in the future.\n\nHere's the problem with going the terrorism route, though - while the Patriot Act provides a definition of it, there is no specific criminal charge for domestic terrorism in federal law. Defining Antifa as a terrorist organization doesn't mean a whole lot. As such, there is a bit of a low-reward problem here; just Monday John Fund noted that despite all the bad behavior by these groups the U.S. Civil Rights Commission refused to denounce Antifa violence. What this means is that as Fund says, quoting the old Marxist maxim, there are \"no enemies on the Left.\"\n\nThe Democrats will protect Antifa and Black Lives Matter until and even after someone directly involved with them kills in their name. We know this. We know it because of the short shrift given to leftist violence in the wake of the James Hodgkinson attack on Steve Scalise and his GOP congressional colleagues, and we know it because of the kid gloves they've treated these people with as they've destroyed property and injured people in their previous rioting.\n\nSo to go after Antifa and Black Lives Matter as terrorist groups, or perhaps better to go after them under some more easily prosecutable legal strategy as their behavior worsens, will be an exercise in purely partisan law enforcement and result in ever more increasing howls from Democrats about the authoritarianism of the Trump administration. We know this; it can't be avoided.\n\nBut here's the thing - these people are going to kill someone, and soon. It's inevitable. Black Lives Matter is at least indirectly responsible for the murders of eight law enforcement officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge last year, though the organization isn't going to be held legally responsible for those. When organizations like these, made up of crazies as they are, are egged on by a mainstream media which lets them get away with the conceit that property destruction doesn't constitute violence and that people have the right, or even the responsibility, to use violence against those they believe are Nazis after spending much time comparing Trump and other Republicans to Hitler, and led by a class of Democrat politicians who openly advocate the assassination of the president, are left unchecked, the violence will only grow.\n\nBut at what point does the violence become widespread and serious enough that Democrats stand aside and \"allow\" the Trump DOJ to treat Antifa and Black Lives Matter as what they are?\n\nDo we ever get to that point? Or do we just devolve into a hot civil war from the cold civil war we've endured for the past decade?\n\nThis column's advice is to ignore the Democrats and investigate these people right along with all the neo-Nazi and Klan groups the Justice Department is already scrutinizing - and when they break the law, give them no quarter.\n\nWe're in a dangerous time in America. Half of the country's political class is actively pushing civil strife because they can't accept the results of an election, and far too many in the other half, like Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, are feckless and weak in standing for ordered liberty. Trump may have to go it alone in putting down both iterations of the leftist revolutionaries who turned Charlottesville bloody. Here's hoping he and his Justice Department have the stones to do just that.\n\nEvery once in a while, you run into something that... Read More\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Antifa Attacks Christians in Portland \"Where is your God now?\"\n\nA ntifa mobilizers and activists attacked Christians at a peaceful prayer and worship event in downtown Portland on Saturday, reports the Post Millennial . The prayer event featured pastor Artur Pawlowski, who made headlines this spring when he defied Canadian COVID lockdown orders by continuing in-person services at his church in Calgary, Alberta.\n\nAfter a flyer circulated advertising the event, Portland Antifa groups mobilized on Twitter, with one member tweeting , \"Welcome to Portland, you won't like it here, pastor.\" Antifa members then descended on the open-air event at Tom McCall Waterfront Park near the Battleship Oregon Memorial.\n\nAntifa members donned in all black clothing, masks, and riot gear assaulted the gathering, reportedly throwing flash bombs and spraying mace at attendees. The disruptors could be heard yelling, \"Where is your God now?\" as they harassed the crowd.\n\nShield-wielding and profanity-spewing militants wreaked havoc while the Christian worshipers scrambled to distance themselves. The sound equipment for the event was stolen and tossed into the nearby Willamette River. An Antifa Twitter account claimed that the militants also stole the parishioners' food.\n\nA female attendee of the event described the shocking scene, saying, \"Antifa just rolled in like an angry mob, started throwing flash bombs at everybody, macing everybody . . . They threw a flash bomb into a group of kids that were out there from four months old to like 10.\"\n\nA mother alleged that Antifa threw a firework and had another woman not blocked the projectile with her arm (now burned with a sizable welt, the woman claims), the weapon would have hit her baby's face.\n\nLater that same day, alleged members of the Proud Boys in their signature yellow and black garb clashed with Antifa on a near-by city street. Directly in front of a patrol car, a masked Antifa member attempted to pepper-spray a counter-protester, with the protester firing a paint-ball gun. As the confrontation ensued between the two groups, the police officer remained in his vehicle, and a bystander could be heard yelling at him, \"Do your job!\"\n\nA spokesperson for the PDX Proud Boys disavowed the group, clarifying that they were \"unknown individuals . . . mimicking\" Proud Boy outfits.\n\nSimilar events occurred again on Sunday when Christians returned to attend a worship service with Pastor Sean Feucht, a worship leader with global influence, now with volunteer security. Antifa riot members observed from afar due to being greatly outnumbered; however, they pounced on the event's security when the service concluded. Similar to the day before, Antifa is alleged to have thrown chunks of concrete and lined the pavement with caltrops designed to pop tires, the Post Millennial reported .\n\nPortland police officers did not intervene during any of the confrontations and made no arrests.\n\nAntifa's assault on Christians is just the latest installment of their vehement violence perpetrated in Portland. Since the summer 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, Antifa has become emboldened in their militant law-breaking.\n\nUnder the guise of \"anti-fascism,\" Portland members have vandalized government buildings and terrorized local residents and businesses.

      "text": "A Very Real Silent Majority Will Reelect Trump\n\nT uesday morning, President Trump tweeted two words that succinctly describe the winning coalition that will assure his November reelection: \"SILENT MAJORITY.\" This prompted a considerable amount of fustian mirth from the Twitter mob, a number of ostensibly serious opinion pieces in the corporate media, and contemptuous dismissal by the Democrats. The consensus was that Trump was indulging a Nixonian fantasy whereby white suburbanites frightened by an increasingly diverse electorate would save his presidency. This interpretation betrays profound ignorance about the term \"silent majority,\" which never had any racial connotation, and disregards what suburban voters really fear - Democratic incompetence in a time of economic uncertainty and social unrest.\n\nThe ongoing riots in cities \"governed\" by supine Democrats, combined with the genuine threat that the violence will metastasize outward to the suburbs, is their most conspicuous fear. And they want action. A Morning Consult poll released Tuesday reveals that 71 percent of registered voters support calling in the National Guard to assist the police in quelling the riots, including 67 percent of suburban women. Likewise, 58 percent of voters support calling in the U.S. military if necessary, including 54 percent of suburban women. In other words, clear majorities support President Trump's intention to deploy U.S. troops if state officials are unable or unwilling to contain the violence. Moreover, he possesses the power to do so. As Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) wrote in the New York Times Wednesday morning:\n\nThis week, rioters have plunged many American cities into anarchy, recalling the widespread violence of the 1960s.... Some governors have mobilized the National Guard, yet others refuse, and in some cases the rioters still outnumber the police and Guard combined. In these circumstances, the Insurrection Act authorizes the president to employ the military.... This venerable law, nearly as old as our republic itself, doesn't amount to \"martial law\" or the end of democracy, as some excitable critics, ignorant of both the law and our history, have comically suggested. In fact, the federal government has a constitutional duty to the states to \"protect them from domestic violence.\"\n\nSen. Cotton's straightforward and irrefutable essay has caused something of an insurrection at the Times . The New York Post reports , \"Dozens of New York Times staffers erupted in outrage at the newspaper publishing an op-ed from Republican Sen. Tom Cotton urging President Trump to call out the U.S. military to crack down on protests that have turned violent.\" In addition, the Times has been inundated by angry letters from its readers, a denunciation from the News Guild of New York, and outraged tweets from its own \"journalists.\" In the end, it may be necessary for the president to send in troops to protect James Bennet, the hapless editorial page editor who decided to print Sen. Cotton's heretical op-ed. Bennett certainly can't count on the protection of New York City's Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nMayor de Blasio has been so feckless during the riots that even New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) called him on the carpet for failing to prevent instances of looting and destruction of property in the city: \"I believe the mayor underestimates the scope of the problem.... What happened in New York City was inexcusable.\" Included on the growing list of Mayor de Blasio's incredibly incompetent decisions was his refusal to accept assistance from the National Guard: \"We do not need the National Guard to come into New York City.\" Nor has Gov. Cuomo backed up his threat to remove the mayor and call in the National Guard. These two characters are by no means the only Democrats to remain inert while the riots escalate. At the beginning of the week, the president made it clear that he is losing his patience:\n\nMy first and highest duty as President is to defend our great country and the American people.  I swore an oath to uphold the laws of our nation, and that is exactly what I will do.... But in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, Antifa, and others. A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents.... If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.... America is founded upon the rule of law.\n\nIt goes without saying, of course, that most Democratic governors have made all manner of ill-informed claims about Trump's remarks. Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker (D) said, \"I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois.\" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) claimed, \"Trump is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division.\" Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) declared , \"Unfortunately, the President has once again taken the path of inciting combativeness, stoking racial tensions, and creating division when we need unity more than ever.\" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) brayed, \"I pray no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.\" Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) claimed, \"You don't diffuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets.\" And the beat goes on.\n\nAll five of the Democratic governors named above have ostensibly activated the National Guard in their states. Yet, it's obvious that they don't intend to deploy the troops in any meaningful way. States with GOP governors such as Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah have deployed their troops effectively. Among the states with Democratic governors, the activation has been largely a matter of public relations. In fact, when Secretary of Defense Mark Esper requested National Guard assistance from Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) to protect various national monuments in the District of Columbia, Gov. Northam refused . Esper then turned to Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan (R), who agreed to send the requested troops.\n\nSo, what about that silent majority? The Morning Consult poll noted above makes it clear that they want order restored. This, along with a fast economic recovery, is precisely what the president has pledged. Meanwhile, Trump's likely general election opponent maunders about systemic racism while struggling to keep his figures straight concerning how many lives and jobs have been lost to the pandemic. As former Clinton pollster Doug Schoen writes , \"The political risk to Democrats is becoming associated with the riots ... which would result in the party losing the White House and risking their House majority.\" The Democrats already own the riots, and the silent majority is quietly counting the days to November 3.\n\nEvery once in a while, you run into something that...

      "text": "Journalist Andy Ngo Attacked by Antifa at Portland Protest\n\nA ndy Ngo, a journalist covering a clash between far-right and far-left demonstrators in Portland, was sent to the ER after being surrounded and beaten by members of Antifa on Saturday. Ngo was punched in the head, covered with silly string and eggs, and struck with milkshakes that Portland PD later claimed were filled with quick-drying cement . Ngo's camera equipment was stolen by a member of the group, which can be observed in this video . Ngo was recognized and attacked because of his history of documenting Antifa's actions in Portland.\n\nIn both videos, Ngo can be seen walking among Antifa demonstrators with his camera out before he is rushed by a masked horde cloaked in black. The entire assault is captured; it happens in an instant. One Antifa-affiliated demonstrator, in disguise, pulls Ngo's camera away from him. Ngo is then sucker-punched by another masked protester, who quickly backpedals in retreat. The crowd closes in; Ngo covers his head. He is kicked, sprayed with silly string, hit with milkshakes, and pelted with eggs. Taunts and profanity can be heard. Ngo makes his way from the street, trying to protect his head as the mob behind him cheers.\n\nAndy Ngo was beaten for covering an anti-fascist protest against a demonstration by the far-right nationalist group known as the \"Proud Boys.\" Antifa and the Proud Boys alike have a history of promoting violence. A member of the Proud Boys threatened Portland's mayor in January, and group members have participated in a number of street fights, some of which have led to arrests. Antifa also advocates the use of force against their political enemies, often clashing with right-wingers during counter-protests . Both groups embrace violence and were active participants during the \"Unite the Right\" white supremacist rally that took place in Charlottesville in 2017.\n\nAntifa members wear black and cover their faces, arguing that such measures are necessary to be effective in their mission. Their stated aim is to prevent the spread of fascism. This is not the first time, however, that Antifa members have targeted observers. They rose to prominence for protesting speaker Milo Yiannopoulos at UC Berkeley, starting fires and causing approximately $100,000 in collateral damage in the process.\n\nIn a video from October 2018 , which later went viral, members of the group can be seen accosting a driver during the protest of a police shooting that left 27-year-old Patrick Kimmons dead. Antifa representatives from the branch \"SmashRacismDC\" also gathered outside Fox News host Tucker Carlson's home in November 2018; a video taken by one observer shows them chanting \"We know where you sleep at night.\"\n\nThere is an ideological explanation for why Antifa members attack bystanders. Per the Rose City Antifa website FAQ, \"Failing to stop fascists from speaking - that is, giving them the opportunity to organize to impose their agenda on the rest of us - makes you as bad as them.\" Antifa's philosophy equates bystanders with fascists, marking anyone that does not overtly support them a threat and thus a target.\n\nWorse than a bystander, though, is a critic of Antifa.\n\nAndy Ngo is one such critic. He and the Rose City Antifa organization are familiar with one another. A resident of Portland, Ngo had previously described himself as \"hated by Antifa\" on his Twitter page, and has documented their activities in the past. In May, Ngo doxxed one of their members. \"Doxxing\" is a contemporary term that refers to publicly revealing someone's personal information online without their consent. Some have argued that Ngo did so with malicious intent; he claimed the member's identity was relevant to the story he was writing.\n\nAntifa's retaliation consisted of labeling Ngo, who is gay, a fascist. Ngo had been accused of promoting Islamophobia after contributing an article to The Wall Street Journal in August 2018. He was condemned for race-baiting by a London resident who disputed the claims he made in this op-ed. These claims, in conjunction with the doxxing of an Antifa member, led the group to identify him as a danger. Ngo was aware of this, announcing his intent to cover the demonstrations the night before on Twitter and noting that he had been singled out in Antifa's message for physical confrontation.\n\nNgo claimed that nearby police officers did not step in to help him. Portland police have come under fire in the past for leniency in dealing with Antifa; Mayor Wheeler, a Democrat who also holds the title of Police Commissioner, was accused of instructing Portland Police officials not to respond to ICE requests during the Occupy ICE protests that took place on June 17, 2018. Mayor Wheeler strongly denied the accusation, claiming he was expressing a desire for his department to not be drawn into an engagement on behalf of a federal agency he thought \"was on the wrong track.\"\n\nAs of writing, Mayor Wheeler has made no statement about the harassment of Andy Ngo or the protests that occurred in his city.\n\nNgo has become a national figure since the video of his assault went viral. Michelle Malkin, a friend of Ngo's, set up a GoFundMe crowdfunding page to raise money for Ngo's medical expenses and to replace his stolen equipment. At the time of writing, the page has raised $122,000 on Ngo's behalf. According to a statement from a legal representative, Ngo is currently recovering in the hospital after suffering from a brain hemorrhage.\n\nThe lack of action by Oregon's elected officials and police are a disappointingly - and dangerously - tepid response to Antifa's actions against Ngo. It remains to be seen if this violence will create a violent backlash by opposing forces or prompt the government, state-level or national, to address it.\n\nEvery once in a while, you run into something that...

However, Le Figro reported that eight members of the Antifa group were indicted on June 27th for alleged violence against a subway passenger.\n\nArnoult has also been accused of a \"violent attack\" by a young right-wing activist, who alleged that Arnault and another member of the Young Antifascist Guard \"beat\" him with a helmet.\n\nThe new member of the French National Assembly was also questioned by police for allegedly making a defence of terrorism, after reportedly describing Hamas as a \"resistance\" movement in the wake of the October 7th terror attacks on Israel.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "5 Ways Wikipedia Editors Support and Protect Antifa\n\nSome of the most extreme political bias on Wikipedia involves editors who support the violent left-wing group Antifa and protect the group's image on the site. This has included downplaying Antifa's far-left views and violence, even censoring major incidents and involvement in recent rioting. Many Antifa supporters, including self-identified anarchists and socialists, have taken to smearing the group's opponents to defend violence against those opponents and portray their concerns as paranoia.\n\nHere are five techniques many of these editors have used to exploit Wikipedia in furtherance of an agenda defending and supporting the political violence of Antifa:\n\n1. Downplaying violence and radical views\n\nEfforts to downplay Antifa violence started shortly after the group's article was created, particularly once President Donald Trump criticized Antifa for violence at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. At one point in the article's early history, violence was only mentioned in the headlines of sources the page cited. Later, editors minimized mention of the U.S. government considering Antifa actions terrorism. One discussion last year agreed at the time to remove the terrorism label, which has repeatedly been kept out of the article's intro. While criticism of Antifa involvement in riots following the death of George Floyd in police custody refocused attention on the group and prompted more terrorism allegations, editors have continued minimizing the label.\n\nThe radical nature of Antifa's views has also been downplayed with Antifa's description as \"militant\" and \"far-left\" strongly resisted by supporters of the group, such as one-time member of Wikipedia's \"Supreme Court\" Doug Weller, who has tried to water down its ideology as merely left-wing. Guy Chapman, an administrator with special privileges on Wikipedia, removed \"militant\" from the Antifa page intro after an Antifa supporter's Facebook request that he back getting the label removed, an apparent policy violation. Weller and Chapman since got Trump's condemnation of \"left-wing fascism\" at his Mount Rushmore speech, interpreted as partly referencing Antifa, removed from Wikipedia's article on the subject.\n\n2. Censoring most extreme acts of violence\n\nIn addition to generally downplaying Antifa violence, notable attacks have been outright censored by the far-left group's supporters. When Wikipedia editors mentioned Antifa viciously assaulting journalist Andy Ngo, others removed mention of the attack repeatedly . Supporters of Antifa argued the attack on Ngo was unrelated to the group and even that such \"protests\" were \"routine\" and thus made the attack trivial. One editor adding material about the attack to the page was subsequently banned from editing about Ngo. Antifa terrorist Willem van Spronsen's attack on a Tacoma ICE facility was also censored from the page repeatedly and mention of his self-identification as Antifa removed from the page on the attack. Weller argued Spronsen was unimportant to Antifa.\n\nOn the Wikipedia page for Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson, editor \"Volunteer Marek\" attempted to censor mention of Antifa's attack on Carlson's home, claiming it was trivial news. Though material on the attack was eventually restored, subsequent discussion and editing whittled it down to simply refer to a \"protest\" that included some graffiti and was dispersed \"within minutes\" by police, avoiding the more horrendous and violently threatening details such as the group pounding on the home's front door, the fact Carlson's wife was home alone at the time, or the group pledging to \"fight\" chanting \"We know where you sleep at night.\" Despite seeking to censor mention of such violence, some Antifa supporters openly praised the group's attacks on Wikipedia and mocked its victims .\n\n3. Accusing critics of lying\n\nSpecial effort is devoted by Antifa supporters to discredit critics as liars or conspiracy theorists. A socialist editor started a lengthy section for Antifa's Wikipedia page on \"smear campaigns\" due to two minor online hoaxes about the group and anarchist editor Davide King later added to the intro claims Trump officials and conservatives spread  \"conspiracy theories\" about Antifa, with the claims taking up nearly half the intro. Most harsh was Ngo's treatment after reporting last year on Antifa attacking opponents with a hammer. Critics noted opponents brought the hammer, arguing Ngo distorted facts to falsely paint Antifa as aggressors. While video showed opponents only used the hammer in self-defense, Antifa supporters vandalized Ngo's page to label him a propagandist and accused him of lying to \"wrongly\" paint \"fascists\" as victims with even established editors pushing the smear .\n\n4. Rationalizing attacks by smearing Antifa opponents\n\nSmears of Antifa critics have been used to rationalize or mitigate the group's violence. Aside from editors characterizing violent incidents as being to \"protect\" others from \"Fascists\" or \"white-supremacists\" in order to defend Antifa violence, Weller has argued any mention of violence must note the group's opponents generally being \"neo-Nazis\" as part of the \"context\" in the article. This rationalizing has included academic sources Antifa supporters use. Weller suggested citing an academic to water down material about Antifa. The academic self-identified as Antifa, claimed any violence against \"fascists\" was inherently self-defense, and defended the attack on Ngo by calling him a \"fascist videographer\" who exposed Antifa to danger by documenting their activities. Editors have also rejected any suggestion in the article's intro that Antifa falsely identifies targets as fascists.\n\nNgo has been variously smeared by vandals as a \" fascist \" or \" nazi \" and even a \" white nationalist \" despite being Asian, while established editors citing biased sources such as the socialist Jacobin outlet accuse Ngo of \"doxing\" Antifa members and getting journalists threatened by linking research about their closeness to Antifa. Davide King further smeared Ngo as a \"right-wing provocateur\" to disparage his lawsuit against the Antifa members who assaulted him last year.\n\nKing has also cited academics who defend Antifa violence by stating members perceive Trump as a \"fascist demagogue\" with one academic downplaying Antifa violence as \"spontaneous street brawls\" even. King further tried rationalizing the attack on Carlson's home by citing the Southern Poverty Law Center and Anti-Defamation League claiming Carlson's news commentary advances white supremacy. When an editor rejected those edits, King cited Carlson supporting Trump and his policies as an ostensible rationalization, one of many smears against Carlson on Wikipedia. Editors have also labeled the Proud Boys, frequent Antifa opponents, as \"neo-fascists\" who promote violence , though such violence was mostly responding to Antifa aggression.\n\n5. Minimizing role in Floyd riots\n\nAntifa's role in violent rioting over George Floyd's death has also been minimized as part of broader efforts on Wikipedia to spin the story on the riots. While originally most material in the Floyd protests article on extremist involvement in rioting concerned Antifa, the section was heavily expanded to shift focus primarily to various, sometimes dubious, claims of far-right involvement. Such material on alleged far-right involvement was further expanded to be several more than material on Antifa when the section was moved to a separate page specifically about violence at protests. Some details on Antifa involvement in rioting, such as arrests in Texas or Attorney General Bill Barr noting evidence of Antifa involvement, have been censored on the Antifa page.\n\nSpreading beyond Antifa\n\nMany editors defending Antifa on Wikipedia have explicitly shown support for the group and its violent tendencies, at one point even having an image displaying support for Antifa's political violence to include on their profile pages, yet continue to edit pages about Antifa to whitewash its actions. Such dedicated and virtually uninhibited pro-Antifa editing on Wikipedia has deeper implications regarding the site's left-wing bias, which is criticized by Wikipedia's own co-founder.\n\nEditors defending Antifa on Wikipedia are also involved in general efforts to advance the Black Lives Matter agenda on the site with Chapman having joined a Black Lives Matter group on the site by stating : \"You can be one of three things: ally, enemy, or collaborator.\" Antifa supporters have further been involved in smearing Trump and various conservative outlets, such as the Epoch Times , that they subsequently help get banned or downgraded with Fox News the latest target. Despite widespread political bias, Wikipedia is still relied on as an information source by media , academia , and Big Tech .\n\n(Disclosure: The author has previously been involved in disputes on Wikipedia with some parties referenced in this article)\n\nT.

And is focused on exposing Nazis and using the popular opposition and unpopularity of Nazis more broadly to make it so that being a Nazi publicly is impossible. But of course part of what they do, if necessary, is to confront far-right groups physically.\"\n\nBreitbart News reports that the radical anarchist group behind much of the unrest in American has brought chaos to the streets of Great Britain, joining thousands of Black Lives Matter activists to in shutting down much of London.\n\nWatch below:\n\nTeen Vogue 's bizarre dredging-up of this 2017 piece arrives in the wake of riots taking place across the country, which have involved looting, buildings being set on fire, businesses destroyed, and people being beaten and killed.\n\nThe riots that have unfolded across the nation prompted the mayors of several cities to issue curfews and call on their state's national guard for help with quelling what appears to be a perpetual state of violence and chaos seen in videos circulating on social media.\n\nDuring Monday night's nationwide riots, four police officers were shot in St. Louis , Missouri.\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated.

The president said just recently that he was going to designate KKK and Antifa as terrorist organizations.\"\n\nHe added, \"I was concerned when I listened to Joe Biden try to claim that Antifa was not a group. I don't know what's on the streets then.\"\n\nBiden said during the debate, referring to Trump, \"His own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization, not a militia. That's what his FBI Director said.\"\n\nTrump responded: \"Well, then you know what, he's wrong.\"\n\nBiden was referring to FBI Director Christopher Wray's remarks at a September 17, 2020, hearing where he said regarding Antifa, \"It's not a group or an organization. It's a movement or an ideology.\"\n\nTrump chastised Wray later that day, tweeting, \"And I look at them as a bunch of well funded ANARCHISTS & THUGS who are protected because the Comey/Mueller inspired FBI is simply unable, or unwilling, to find their funding source, and allows them to get away with 'murder'. LAW & ORDER!\"\n\nMcCarthy also criticized Biden's running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who has asked supporters to chip in for a fund bailing out protesters in Minnesota. At least $210,000 went to bailing out protesters and rioters who were arrested in the unrest immediately following Floyd's death, according to the fund's organizers.\n\nMcCarthy also slammed Harris for not visiting two sheriff's deputies in Los Angeles who were shot this month.\n\n\"She was the top cop, the attorney general. I have watched, in L.A., two sheriffs, walk up and get shot in the head by just sitting in a car. I have not seen any comments from Kamala Harris. I know she went to California right after that, I did not hear of her visiting those two,\" McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy said he supported Trump's plan to designate KKK and Antifa as terrorist organizations, announced earlier this week.\n\n\"The president's action by making KKK and Antifa terrorist organizations, I applaud,\" he said.\n\nFollow Breitbart News's Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook .\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "WATCH: German Far-Left Chant Antifa Slogans as They Enter Parliament\n\nRiding high off a surprisingly strong result in Germany's federal elections on Sunday, members of the far-left Die Linke party chanted Antifa slogans as they entered the Bundestag parliament in Berlin on Tuesday.\n\nAfter facing the prospect of near-complete political irrelevance just several weeks ago, Die Linke (The Left) saw a late surge in the federal election campaign that netted the party around 8.8 per cent of the vote, over double where the radical party was polling just a couple months ago.\n\nApparently emboldened by their strong showing, MPs gathered with Left leaders Jan van Aken and Ines Schwerdtner and former chancellor candidate Heidi Reichinnek for a group Bundestag photo in which they chanted the Antifa slogan \"alerta, alerta, antifascista!\"\n\nThe phrase - \"attention, attention, anti-fascists\" - originated in 1920s Italy among leftist opponents of the Mussolini regime before being picked up in the Weimar Republic by the German leftist-extremist Antifascist Action group, the predecessor of the modern Antifa movement. The phrase is often heard at Antifa rallies worldwide to this day.\n\nThe Left's relatively successful election campaign was driven in large part by young voters flocking to the radical party, a direct descendent of the Marxist-Leninist ruling party of the former Communist East Germany. Die Linke was the most popular party among voters between the ages of 18 and 24 at 25 per cent, beating out the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany at 21 per cent.\n\nThe late surge for the far-left party came amid widespread fear mongering from establishment politicians and the legacy media about the rise of the so-called \"far-right\" AfD.\n\nFollowing the move by centrist Christian Democrat leader and likely next chancellor Friedrich Merz to join forces with the AfD for a non-binding vote to step up border controls in the wake of a spate of migrant terror attacks, large-scale protests were organised across the country over the breach of the so-called \"firewall\" prohibiting establishment parties from working with the AfD.\n\nHowever, despite being painted as an utterly organic representation of opposition to the AfD, it was later reported that many of the protests were organised by groups funded at least in part by the government in Berlin. Die Linke's main political foundation, the Rosa-Luxembourg Foundation NGO is also reportedly financed by the state to the tune of tens of millions of euros.\n\nNevertheless, the spectre of the \"far-right\" was apparently a useful tool for The Left in coaxing young voters to their side, with chancellor candidate Heidi Reichinnek going viral on TikTok for a speech she gave in January criticising Merz for breaking the \"firewall\" against the AfD.\n\nThe resurgence of The Left appears to have come at the cost of former leader Sahra Wagenknecht, who broke away from Die Linke to form her own party last year over disagreements on issues such as mass migration and the war in Ukraine. Despite previous success at the EU elections last year, Wagenknecht's left-wing anti-mass migration party failed by less than a half per cent to reach the five per cent threshold needed to be awarded seats in the parliament. Wagenknecht has alleged voter irregularities and unfair treatment by the German media and has vowed to continue her party.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

Hatfield Courthouse.\n\nAn account associating itself with the dads has identified itself as Antifa and has sent messages of support to other members of Antifa in other cities.\n\nMeanwhile, Gluesenkamp Perez has tried to paint Kent as an \"extremist,\" calling him \"a radical right-wing extremist\" in numerous social media posts. She has not mentioned her support for Antifa or Black Lives Matter on her Twitter account.\n\nA spokesman for Gluesenkamp Perez told Breitbart News in a statement that it was an employee at her shop who made the Instagram post:\n\nThis is a disingenuous and ridiculously misleading attack. Any claim Marie or her husband have ever supported Antifa is a lie. In 2020, as tear gas and pepper spray were causing harm to Portland residents, an employee at Marie's shop once wrote an Instagram post offering to repair broken leaf blowers. That's it.\n\nNothing Marie or her husband said or did was in any way anti-law enforcement. Let's be absolutely clear on this: Marie's small business has suffered multiple break ins so she knows first hand the important work that police do to protect public safety and address crime. Marie supports fully-funding our police and opposes political violence in all its forms - unlike her extremist opponent Joe Kent, who claims 'we're at war' with federal law enforcement officers and wants to defund the FBI along with other federal law enforcement.\"\n\nKent's campaign responded to his opponent calling him \"extremist\" again.\n\n\"The ad from Marie's repair shop offering free repairs to those 'getting busy for human rights' is an undeniable offer of material support for Antifa during the height of their riots and attacks on the police,\" a campaign spokesman said.\n\n\"Marie pretends to support the police because she's running for Congress in a red district, but when it mattered, she turned her garage in Portland into an arsenal for Antifa,\" he said.\n\n\"Local law enforcement has been unanimous in their public endorsements of Joe Kent, and the people of the Washington's 3rd District know that Antifa belongs in prison, not in Congress.\"\n\nFollow Breitbart News's Kristina Wong on Twitter , Truth Social , or on Facebook .\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and \n\t\t\t\t\tjoining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n\t\t\t\t\tto marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n\t\t\t\t\tsenators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n\t\t\t\t\tto limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n\t\t\t\t\tindependence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our \n\t\t\t\t\thands, and it's intense.

We have \n\t\t\t\t\ttrained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n\t\t\t\t\tspectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN?

We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress.

      "text": "What is Antifa? Antifa is a left-wing political movement that has used criminal violence , threats, and vandalism to shut down events organized or hosted by conservative, libertarian, and right-wing personalities and groups.\n\nWhat does Antifa mean? Antifa is an abbreviated term for \"anti-fascist,\" though the group itself uses violent, fascistic practices to silence dissenting voices. Antifa pits itself against those they declare \"fascist,\" using that label to justify disruption and violence .\n\nWhat are Antifa's politics? Antifa markets itself as \"anti-fascist,\" \"anti-racist,\" and \"anti-homophobia.\" Though the ideology of its members is not unified, it is generally grounded in Marxism and social justice. Antifa activists are regularly seen with communist, socialist, anarchist, and neo-Marxist paraphernalia, symbols, and signage, including the Soviet hammer and sickle, the raised/clenched fist, and \"anti-capitalist\" messaging.\n\nIs Antifa violent? Antifa has been documented committing criminal violence and destroying property in shutting down conservative, libertarian or right-wing speakers and events, as has occurred in various cities and college campuses across the country. \"In the name of fighting for those ideals [of the social justice left] - and putting a stop to 'hate speech'-some antifa protestors will employ militant tactics or violent means such as vandalism,\" explains Time.\n\nIs Antifa anti-free speech? Antifa has used disruption and violent means to shut down events they deem \"fascist,\" which has included speakers and events espousing conservatism, libertarianism, and support for Donald Trump. Antifa borrows heavily from the social justice approach to speech, conflating speech with physical violence and promoting the idea that offensive rhetoric or \"hate speech\" must be silenced through extreme means, including physical assault and destruction of property."

Now, you've been hearing it. There's a lot of what-aboutism and spin going on. And it's kind of sickening to me. So, let's all agree on some common understandings. A protester uses their voice, song, slang, slurs, there's a huge range, but it is talk.\"\n\n\"But I argue to you tonight, all punches are not equal morally. In the eyes of the law, yes,\" Cuomo said. \"But in the eyes of good and evil, here's the argument: if you're a punk that comes to start trouble in a mask and hurt people, you're not about any virtuous cause. You're just somebody who's going to be held to the standard of doing something wrong.\"\n\n\"But when someone comes to call out bigots and it gets hot, even physical, are they equally wrong as the bigot they are fighting? I argue, no. Fighting against hate matters,\" Cuomo continued. \"Now, how you fight matters too. There's no question about that. But drawing a moral equivalency between those espousing hate and those fighting it because they both resort to violence emboldens hate, legitimizes hateful belief and elevates what should be stamped out.\"\n\n\"But fighting hate is right. And in a clash between hate and those who oppose it, those who oppose it are on the side of right. Think about: civil rights activist, were they the same morally as the bigots, as the racist with whom they exchanged blows,\" Cuomo stated. \"Are people who go to war against an evil regime on the same moral ground as those they seek to stop from oppressing the weak?\"\n\n\"That's why people who show up to fight against bigots are not to be judged the same as the bigots, even if they do resort to the same petty violence. The law will take care of that,\" Cuomo concluded. \"How you disagree matters. We should be our best. But I am arguing that Trump was wrong to create a moral equivalency between bigots and those who oppose them, making them equal wrongs.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "From Street To Studio: Tim Pool Fighting Antifa And Media Bias\n\nThe most accurate information always comes from a first-hand account. That's why commentator, journalist, and youtuber, Tim Pool started his journalism career on the ground. Traveling the streets, Pool captured the political upheavals that transpired overnight in Egypt, Ukraine, and Sweden.\n\nBut Pool's trip to Sweden was unlike his others.\n\nAt the time, Pool had just ended his contract with the newly \"wokified\" Fusion news-site and began an independent youtube channel with his own on-site reporting. He was vlogging on Sweden's crime and refugee crisis, when Trump made his now-famous \"look at Sweden\" remark during a Florida rally, causing the media to blow up. Pool then began receiving messages from journalist colleagues urging him not to investigate the story in Sweden.\n\n\"Don't do this one,\" they would read, \"Trump's lying.\"\n\nFrom this point on, Pool knew something was changing in the world of journalism. \"They got really, really mad at me and that was when I could see this weird split starting to emerge,\" Pool recalled.\n\nNow deep in the political media world as host of \"Timcast,\" Tim Pool is all too aware of the struggle for truth among the tangle of narratives spun by the legacy media. In last week's \"Sunday Special\" interview, Pool met with Editor Emeritus, Ben Shapiro, to talk about this ongoing tension and the hard-hitting facts about the election, Antifa, and the continued efforts of the mainstream media to obscure those facts.\n\nIt's challenging to put a political label on Pool, who acknowledged that he holds \"a weird position.\"\n\n\"I'm kind of this heterodox individual - don't really fit necessarily anywhere. Although I think I've been classified as like cultural right-wing, whatever that means. But my political positions are kind of just like where Democrats used to be,\" described Pool.\n\nBut with the rise of the cancel culture mob, Pool has found this works to his advantage as a commentator and journalist. \"It doesn't really work very well for the mainstream media to smear me as some kind of conspiracy theorist, when I don't make an assertion beyond 'here's a fact,'\" Pool told Shapiro.\n\nPool's journey from street to studio was not freely chosen. While reporting on a variety of movements, including Occupy Wall Street, Proud Boys, and Antifa, his desire was to purely \"cover what [was] happening on the ground.\"\n\nYet, Pool explained, \"by telling the truth, these extremists and Antifa-type people were attacking me and threatening me.\"\n\n\"So I slowly stopped doing it because it was getting more and more dangerous,\" Pool concluded.\n\nBut this hasn't stopped Pool from answering the hard questions about 2020 politics.\n\nThe election turmoil brewing in the nation was a major point of issue for Pool, who affirmed that we are witnessing a \"kind of millennial bias\" in the post-election processes.\n\n\"This is a really, really close race,\" Pool noted. \"It doesn't make sense to say, 'Joe Biden won,' when there's a legal process, you know, happening. Several states are too close to call still. The media has just decided this is it, 'Joe Biden won, it's over!'\"\n\nSo while Trump is fighting battle's in court, \"it's almost like they're trying to tell us 'Joe Biden won' to convince us,\" suggested Pool.\n\nOne of Pool's greatest fears is that the legitimacy of our election process could be threatened if the media continues to leave important questions unanswered.\n\n\"You're gonna find a bunch of people saying in a sworn affidavit, 'I saw this thing happen.' You can't just ignore that and say, 'we will do nothing,'\" urged Pool. \"You have to let people know we're doing everything in our power to clean up any potential errors so they view this election as legitimate. I mean, if Joe Biden really does get certified as the winner, he gets inaugurated, but they don't look into this stuff, it would undermine his presidency, because you've got 72.2 million people now who have voted for Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"I think everybody deserves to look at these affidavits or these whistleblowers and just say, 'you know, is it going to change the election? Maybe it won't. But we should investigate,'\" argued Pool.\n\nDespite Biden-favoring results, the uncertainty of the election has brought Trump supporters to the streets in recent days, along with opposition from Antifa.\n\n\"Apparently the media calling it for Joe Biden did nothing to change their minds,\" observed Pool.\n\n\"And in fact,\" Pool continued, \"I think it's only likely to escalate if we do enter a Joe Biden administration. Because certainly, Joe Biden won't be strong enough to deal with these groups that are pressuring him, and attacking him, and getting violent.\"\n\nAntifa has often been reduced to simply an idea and, while Pool agrees that it does encompass an idea, he also says there is much more to it.\n\n\"It's not necessarily wrong to say that they're a movement or an idea but it's the individual cells that we're talking about,\" said Pool. Antifa members, many of whom are authoritarian communists, he added, \"typically agree with each other on their cause and their means to the end.\"\n\n\"So you actually have a loose-knit group of various cells that coordinate with each other using violence against their political opponents - for the most part instigating it outright to win.\"\n\nThe difficulty, Pool alludes, is bringing these facts into the public light.\n\nBecause the Left is far more successful at \"street-level organizing than the Right,\" he told Shapiro, the media either cannot figure out what Antifa actually is or \"outright defends them on purpose.\"\n\n\"So long as you have these mainstream resistance-type Democrats who hate Trump, they won't call these groups out,\" maintained Pool.\n\nTheir actions, Pool claims, have been able to so easily slide under the radar because they claim they use a \"diversity of tactics.\" \"The reality is these groups say 'respect our diversity of tactics' because that's code for getting violent and hurting people.\"\n\nPool believes the key is not getting caught up in the semantics of the name Black Lives Matter or anti-fascist, the cloaks under which Antifa often hides, but rather focusing on the actions themselves.\n\n\"Most people just read the headline,\" Pool asserted. \"They just they don't actually investigate what the story is.\"\n\nBut those that Pool know who have made the political transition from liberal to conservative, no Trump to Trump, or those who just left the \"woke cult,\" did it \"because they started doing their own research.\"\n\nWatch Pool's full interview with Shapiro\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "MSNBC's Brian Williams Equates Antifa With D-Day Veterans\n\nOn the eve of the 77th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, MSNBC aired an ad from The Lincoln Project that called the soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy members of \"Antifa\" - the left-wing group responsible for mass political violence nationwide.\n\nBrian Williams closed Friday's edition of \"The 11th Hour\" by showing a portion of the ad, which opens by asking, \"Who is Antifa?\"\n\nWilliams presented the video as a patriotic homage to the Greatest Generation.\"Last thing before we go tonight, an important anniversary [is] coming up this weekend,\" Williams said. \"We hope you can take a moment and remember it.\"\n\nHe went on to call Operation Overlord \"beyond bold; it was outlandish. Over 150,000 men invad[ed] the French coastline under withering German fire to begin their march across Europe, where they would go on to win World War II 336 days later.\"\n\n\"While others will debate whether or not we could possibly mount such a thing today as broken as we are, there was a time when we saved the world from tyranny and fascism,\" Williams continued. \"If it wasn't our finest hour, it's hard to say what was. And the folks at The Lincoln Project are out with a reminder to all.\"\n\nA portion of the ad transcript praised by Williams reads as follows:\n\nThey stormed the beaches of Normandy, parachuted into the French countryside, and gave their lives to face down and fight back against fascism. They took down Nazi machine gun nests, tore apart the Third Reich strongholds, liberated concentration camps, liberated France, Italy, Belgium, Holland, anywhere Antifa saw fascism they fearlessly, and relentlessly, annihilated it. Fascism was defeated because of patriots like these - proud Americans who knew that the fight against fascists was not simply a battle between opposing nations, it was a war against humanity, a war that isn't nice but cannot be lost. A war we still fight today.\n\nAs the narrator says the word \"today,\" the ad abruptly switches to footage of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe ad then returns to scenes from liberated France and Germany as the narrator intones, \"Anti-fascism: It's not a cable news talking point. It's an American ideal that should be memorialized, because it was paid for in blood.\"\n\nThe ad closes with a picture of a U.S. military cemetery - and, of course, a link to donate to the scandal-plagued Lincoln Project .\n\nThe attempt to whitewash or sanitize Antifa, a violent group of anarchist street thugs, is not exactly new. Last year, National Public Radio's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson, retweeted a map of the D-Day invasion with the words , \"Biggest antifa rally in history.\"\n\nAfter the violent clashes in Charlottesville, CNN's Don Lemon defended Antifa on the basis of its name, rather than its actions. \"It says it right in the name: Antifa. Anti-fascism,\" he said . \"No organization's perfect. There was some violence. No one condones violence, but there were different reasons for Antifa and for these neo-Nazis to be there.\"\n\nLast month W. Kamau Bell, host of CNN's \"United Shades of America,\" interviewed two members of Antifa in Portland and seemingly excused their violence . \"Look, this fighting for democracy and against fascism thing has always been a messy business,\" he said. \"And, yes, people get hurt, property gets damaged, and things get confusing.\"\n\nWhen those on the Left aren't glorifying Antifa, they're busy denying its existence. At the first presidential debate last October, Joe Biden asserted that \"Antifa is an idea, not an organization.\"\n\nIn reality, Antifa exists in loosely organized groups, and \"their methods are often violent,\" according to CNN. \"Antifa leaders admit they're willing to physically attack anyone who ... condones racism,\" as Antifa defines it.\n\nOf course, violently attacking people for their thoughts are tactics employed by the actual fascists. The brown shirts physically broke up political meetings held by the Nazis' political enemies.\n\nA total of 2,501 Americans were killed and 10,000 wounded on D-Day itself, not counting our Allies.\n\nThere's a term for trying to equate Antifa street rioters with the young men who liberated Europe from the scourge of Nazism at the expense of their own lives: stolen valor .\n\nThe views expressed in this piece are the author's own and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire .\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "Portland's Black BLM Activists Say They're Done With 'White' Antifa, Want 'Separation'\n\nOregon Public Broadcasting reports Wednesday that black members of Portland's Black Lives Matter movement are tired of their anti-racism demonstrations being hijacked by the mostly white \"Antifa\" anarchists and are working to separate the two movements as protests continue.\n\n\"Tensions between Black activists fighting for racial justice and anti-establishment protesters have bubbled beneath the surface for months,\" the outlet says, noting that many of the anti-racism protests, now in their sixth month, began as peaceful demonstrations but became violent after nightfall, when anarchist groups, who organized on social media, appeared.\n\nThe riots, which made national headlines, tainted the Black Lives Matter protests, activists say, and confused commentators who often assumed the violence developed from the demonstrations. Instead, they say, the unrest was wholly separate - and now they want the groups to disentangle.\n\n\"This week marks six months since Floyd's death, and protests continue in Portland,\" OPB reports. \"But now, activists in the city are divided as to whether they are still fighting in a racial justice movement centered on Black lives, or if an unfocused, anti-establishment fight against capitalism and state power has usurped the initial cause that brought thousands of Portlanders into the streets.\"\n\nBLM activists also contend that the largely white \"Antifa\" group is \"privileged,\" noting that many of those arrested during the protests are middle- or upper-class, are quickly free on bail, and often escape prosecution - luxuries not often afforded to people of color who tangle with the same justice system.\n\n\"Most Black people in our community don't feel like they have the privilege to go straight to the police and yell in their face,\" one activist told OPB.  \"If you're privileged, if you're white, you care less about whether or not a protest is going to result in reforms that might save even just one life. And you have the ability to be a purist in a way that Black and brown communities really do not.\"\n\nThe privilege gap becomes an even bigger problem, BLM activists say, when the Anarchists push back against peaceful protesters who suggest less violent tactics might be more effective at achieving protest goals. In Portland, especially, the notorious, Antifa-aligned Pacific Northwest Youth Liberation Front excoriated more peaceful groups for \"pacifying the nightly justice center action,\" calling members of BLM \"police collaborators.\"\n\nThe breakup does go deeper. Antifa-aligned groups tried to \"cancel\" social justice organizers, dredging up old Tweets, accusing key BLM protest leaders of sexism and \"being disrespectful to women.\"\n\nInterestingly, the calls for \"separation,\" though, have surfaced only recently, as protests are dying down. BLM was largely silent over the summer, even as the unrest in Portland threatened lives and security, and the more \"peaceful\" elements of Portland's protest community said little when Antifa-aligned groups began marching through Portland's residential areas, confronting homeowners they deemed insufficiently supportive of their cause.\n\nIt could be that the election made a difference. The Los Angeles Times reports that things began to fall apart between the two groups just a month ago - the day after the presidential election - after Antifa-aligned groups tried to \"send a message\" to leftists about party politics and attacked the city's Democratic Party headquarters.\n\n\"The day after President-elect Joe Biden delivered his victory speech, telling the nation it was time to heal and unite, a clandestine Twitter account - @safePDXprotest - summoned Portland anarchists,\" the LA Times reported. \"Word spread through the group that the target tonight would be the local headquarters of the Democratic Party. Somebody started beating a drum as a chant broke out: 'F- Joe Biden!'\"\n\nBLM activists, satisfied that President Donald Trump had likely been defeated, pushed back, claiming they'd reached their goal. At that point, BLM began accusing the anarchists of \"hijacking the movement and undermining the push for racial justice by continuing to commit violence.\"\n\nProtests in Portland have died down considerably. Although unrest over the summer drew crowds of several hundred, a demonstration over the weekend drew just over a dozen individuals.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "The Media Outlets That Gave A Pass To Black Lives Matter And Antifa Violence\n\nAs riots broke out over the summer following the death of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police, many media organizations adopted a sympathetic approach toward covering the violence that wracked the nation's cities, effectively giving a pass to agitators who incited deadly demonstrations that leveled downtowns.\n\nNearly a year later, the nation's most prominent outlets have not corrected that narrative, even as last year's numerous deadly clashes and property destruction is projected to cost insurance companies up to $2 billion in an economy already groaning under the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe day after Floyd's death, rioters in Minneapolis took to the streets, shattering storefronts and burning police cars as they clashed with law enforcement. Similar violent demonstrations broke out in New York City, Portland, Dallas, Atlanta, Seattle, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and other cities across the country.\n\nMeanwhile, mainstream outlets published headline after headline declaring the demonstrations to be \"peaceful protests,\" even as the violence turned deadly and as marching and chanting turned to burning and looting.\n\nIn late July, CBS News described the details of violent demonstrations around the nation, some of them deadly, and blamed the descent into violence on then-President Trump's decision to send federal officers into some metropolitan areas.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable instance of the media narrative that the protests were largely peaceful came in May from MSNBC's Ali Velshi, who stood in front of a burning liquor store in Minneapolis and downplayed the destruction clearly visible behind him.\n\n\"I want to be clear in how I characterize this. This is mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly, but fires have been started and there's a crowd that is relishing that,\" Velshi told MSNBC anchor Brian Williams. \"There is a deep sense of grievance and complaint here, and that is the thing, that when you discount people who are doing things to public property that they shouldn't be doing, it does have to be understood that this city has got, for the last several years, an issue with police, and it's got a real sense of the deep sense of grievance of inequality.\"\n\nJust beforehand, Velshi said he could see \"at least four fires\" from where he was standing and pointed to the Third Precinct police station, which was set ablaze that night, May 28, when rioters decided to \"try and take that police station from the police,\" after which they started two liquor store fires. Velshi added, however, that \"for most of the day\" the demonstrations had looked \"a lot calmer\" than they had the previous day.\n\nTowards the end of August, CNN was ridiculed for an on-air graphic attempting to make a similar point, that the protests were largely peaceful even as a fire burned in the background of a live shot.\n\nThe network ran a chyron at the bottom of the screen reading, \"Fiery But Mostly Peaceful Protests After Police Shooting\" as CNN national correspondent Omar Jimenez stood in front of a large blaze in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where unrest erupted following the police shooting of Jacob Blake.\n\nABC was also mocked in July for publishing a report and a tweet stating that a \"peaceful demonstration intensified\" in Oakland, California when demonstrators set fire to a courthouse, damaged a police station, and assaulted police officers.\n\nOakland police declared the July 25 riot an \"unlawful assembly\" and said some in the crowd were throwing projectiles and pointing illegal lasers at officers.\n\nWhile the forgiving language might be less surprising from certain media organizations with a palpable political bent, even some outlets that purport to offer mostly unvarnished straight news handled the violence with a light touch.\n\nThe ABC report that prompted laughter from critics originally came from the more subtly biased Associated Press, which used the same language saying a \"peaceful demonstration intensified.\" ABC parroted the language in the network's tweet.\n\nThe AP dug its heels in a few months later at the end of September, when the AP Stylebook, whose guidelines are adhered to as gospel by outlets nationwide, instructed journalists to avoid using the term \"riot\" to describe the violent unrest sweeping the country.\n\n\"Focusing on rioting and property destruction rather than underlying grievance has been used in the past to stigmatize broad swaths of people protesting against lynching, police brutality, or for racial justice, going back to the urban uprisings of the 1960s,\" the AP stated in new guidelines.\n\nThe updated guidelines also advised that a \"protest\" can be either \"legal or illegal\" as well as \"peaceful or violent.\"\n\nAnother wire service that publishes ostensibly cut-and-dry news articles, Reuters, in September lamented the situation of anti-racism protesters calling for equal justice, saying that \"for all their peaceful protests, scenes of burning buildings will hand U.S. President Donald Trump the images he needs for his 'law and order' re-election campaign.\"\n\nNBC decried the characterization of the demonstrations as violent in a September article , declaring it \"all part of an effort to rewrite the history of peaceful movements, tarnishing legitimate protests with the specter of violence,\" adding that, \"in the case of Black Lives Matter, it is notably false.\"\n\nThat article also includes a lengthy section citing research backing up the claim that former President Trump's use of the word \"thug\" to describe violent demonstrators has racial implications. However, it acknowledges that former President Obama and Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake both also used the term in 2015 to describe demonstrators who rioted in the wake of Freddie Gray's death in police custody.\n\nAlong with the television news networks, The New York Times and The Washington Post also refrained from using language that evoked the idea of violence in their coverage of the riots.\n\n\"Protests, Mostly Peaceful, Continue Across the Country,\" read one Times headline on June 4, when Portland had been enveloped in nightly violence for a full week.\n\nMeanwhile, questions about members of Antifa, a militant anti-fascist movement, infiltrating protests and contributing to the violence went largely uninvestigated and unreported by mainstream outlets.\n\n\"Tangible evidence of Antifa's involvement is scant,\" read a June 22 fact-check by the Post, contrary to information provided by law enforcement officials. The difficulty in ascertaining Antifa's involvement is partly due to the fact that \"Antifa is a moniker, not a single group with a clear organizational structure or leader,\" the analysis said.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said on June 4 that \"anarchists like Antifa and other agitators\" are \"exploiting this situation to pursue violent, extremist agendas.\"\n\n\"These individuals have set out to sow discord and upheaval rather than join in the righteous pursuit of equality and justice,\" Wray said.\n\nPolice officials in New York and Pittsburgh also said they were fairly confident that \"anarchist\" elements had infiltrated protests in their cities and contributed to the violence.\n\nAt least 19 people died in the George Floyd protests nationwide, and more than 14,000 people were arrested.\n\nIn early June, two of Floyd's grieving brothers called for peace even as riots continued to swell in cities across the country.\n\n\"I'm outraged too. Sometimes I get angry, I want to bust some heads too,\" Terrence Floyd said on ABC. \"My brother wasn't about that. My brother was about peace. You'll hear a lot of people say he was a gentle giant.\"\n\n\"If his own family and blood is trying to deal with it and be positive about it and go another route to seek justice, then why are you out here tearing up your community?\" Floyd said, adding, \"Just relax. Justice will be served.\"\n\nFloyd's other brother, Rodney, said around the same time that peace is \"the best option we have to bring justice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, many powerful media outlets continued to insist that Black Lives Matter's actives were essentially peaceful. Eventually, some who dealt with the fallout of the summer's protests disagreed.\n\nIn late July, Daryl Breaux expressed to CBS his disgruntlement with Black Lives Matter after his car was seriously damaged during a demonstration in Seattle, saying the violence was obscuring the positive message.\n\n\"Almost 45 years I've been black. This is what Black Lives Matter does? I'm not with it,\" Breaux said.\n\n.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "TRUMP: Antifa Will Be Declared 'Terrorist Organization'\n\nPresident Trump on Sunday said Antifa, the anti-fascist group that has been involved in street protests for years and whom federal officials say is behind the violent clashes occurring in cities over the last several days, will be designated as a \"terrorist organization.\"\n\n\"The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. He offered no other details.\n\nThe United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2020\n\nThe move followed several Trump administration officials asserting that ANTIFA has been behind the mayhem that has followed the death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, at the hands of Minneapolis police.\n\n\"This is being driven by Antifa,\" national security adviser Robert O'Brien told CNN's \" State of the Union \" on Sunday. \"And they did it in Seattle. They have done it in Portland. They have done it in Berkeley. This is a destructive force of radical - I don't even know if we want to call them leftists. Whatever they are, they're - they're militants who are coming in and burning our cities, and we're going to get to the bottom of it.\"\n\nO'Brien repeated the assertion several times, including on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\n\"It's the violent ANTIFA radical militants that are coming out, under cover of night, traveling across state lines, using military-style tactics to burn down our cities. And they're especially targeting the most venerable parts of our cities, George. The minority section, the African-American sections, and Hispanic areas and burning down businesses of people that are trying to get a leg up. And - and the president's outraged by that. And we all are. And - and that has to stop.\n\n\"And we're calling on the FBI to investigate ANTIFA and - and get to the bottom of these - these violent rioters. And I don't want them confused with peaceful protesters that have every right to go out to the streets. That's - that's what makes America different from - from any other countries around the world,\" he said. \"I think the actual perpetrators of the violence, the ones that are on the street, that are burning down minority-owned businesses and restaurants, who have already suffered through this terrible COVID situation and - and are at risk of losing their business and now they're seeing them burn to the ground, those are ANTIFA radical militants. And we've seen them before in other protests and we need to get to the bottom of it.\"\n\nAfter his Sunday show appearances, O'Brien told reporters: \"I think the attorney general has already been in touch with (FBI) Director Wray, and I think the President wants to know what the FBI has been doing, and what their plan is going forward, and if they haven't been doing anything about Antifa.\"\n\nTrump has also declared the group as the main culprits behind protests that have raged in dozens of cities since Floyd's death \"It's ANTIFA and the Radical Left.

      "text": "WATCH: Mazie Hirono Walks Out When Cruz Hammers Home Dems Won't Condemn Antifa\n\nOn Monday, Senator Ted Cruz, chairing a hearing titled, \"Hearing on Protecting Free Speech and Preventing Violent Protests,\" triggered Hawaii Democrat Senator Mazie Hirono as he slammed the seven Democratic senators who refused to condemn Antifa at the hearing.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Hirono declared that Cruz was \"not listening\" and snapped, \"I hope ... we don't have to listen to any more of your rhetorical speeches\" before walking out. The move prompted Cruz to swipe back, \"Well, I appreciate as always, [the] kind and uplifting words of Senator Hirono, and I would note that throughout her remarks, she still did not say a negative word about Antifa, nor has any Democrat here.\"\n\nBefore that exchange (video below), Cruz noted, \"It's fairly striking that elected Democrats want to ignore the violence of Antifa; they want to ignore the violence on the Left and they just scream 'White supremacist, white supremacist,' rather than condemn violence from wherever it is coming. The 277 injuries of federal law enforcement officers in Portland are coming from the Left. And not a single Democrat on this committee acknowledges that.\"\n\nIn her next turn to speak, Hirono said, \"Senator, I have to say, sometimes I don't think you listen. How many times have I had to say that we all should be denouncing violent extremists of every stripe.\"\n\nCruz interjected, \"Does that include Antifa?\"\n\nHirono continued: \"By the way, the Republicans are constantly using - I have to say, you brought it up yourself, the deaths of these black police officers, Patrick Underwood and David Dorn, for making political points. And the fact that it was right-wing extremists who killed Officer Underwood, that seems to be lost in this argument. And now there are all these attacks about Black Lives Matter and what they're saying. I mean, how many of us even think that defunding police departments should be taken literally? I mean, I certainly don't.\"\n\nShe added, \"So, we have this pesky thing called freedom of speech. And I'd say that the people who support Black Lives Matter, and if they're calling for various boycotts and all that, that's called freedom of speech and that's what this hearing's title is. Protecting speech.\"\n\nHirono avoided naming Antifa yet again: \"So, all I can say is, look, we should all join hands in denouncing and whatever words you want to use about violent extremism of all stripes, and I think we can all agree on that. So to constantly accuse Democrats of not caring about that is really, I can only say that you aren't listening.\"\n\n\"So I hope this is the end of this hearing, Mr. Chairman, and that we don't have to listen to any more of your rhetorical speeches,\" said Hirono. \"Thank you very much. I'm leaving.\"\n\nAs Hirono got up to leave, Cruz said, \"Well, I appreciate, as always, [the] kind and uplifting words of Senator Hirono, and I would also note that throughout her remarks, she still did not say a negative word about Antifa, nor has any Democrat here. They instead engage in a political game where they depend-\" Cruz looked at Hirono as she stood up to leave and said, \"You're welcome to say something negative about Antifa right now.\"\n\n\"I think that I've covered the subject quite well. You were not listening,\" she replied before leaving the hearing.\n\n\"She declined to speak. So that is the position of the Democratic Party,\" Cruz concluded. \"I would note also that of the seven Democratic senators who spoke, not a one of them apologized for or denounced multiple Democrats calling law enforcement officers Nazis - 'stormtroopers' and 'Gestapo' - to be fair, I have not heard the word Nazi - but 'stormtrooper' was Nancy Pelosi and 'Gestapo' was another Democratic leader.

It's not a fiction,\" Wray admitted, despite Democrats and their media allies previously calling Antifa a \" myth .\"\n\nWhen pressed by Republican Rep.

We've seen them burning federal buildings, the self-professed members, claiming members of Antifa - do they or do they not have organized financial support?\" Turner asked. When Wray repeated that the FBI continues to investigate, the Republican questioned whether Antifa had the capability to coordinate and target specific locations.\n\n\"At the local level, in some cases, the regional level we have seen organized activity, people working together,\" Wray conceded.\n\nThe tense exchange comes as rioters, some of whom are reported to be \"self-identified Antifa members,\" made their way to the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center to cause destruction in response to the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright.\n\nDuring the hearing, Wray admitted that while these Antifa members may have traveled in from other cities to wreak havoc, he still might classify them as \"local.\" \"My definition of local doesn't mean people who just live in the same city,\" Wray said.\n\n\"So like, if you travel across the country to perpetrate violence, you become local where you perpetrate the violence?\" Turner asked.\n\n\"When I say local or regional, I'm including people from the surrounding area,\" Wray continued. \"And that may or may not include people from other parts of the state, for example.\"\n\nLISTEN: \"Inside Antifa with Andy Ngo\" on \"The Federalist Radio Hour\"\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Antifa Versus White Nationalists Is Political Performance Art\n\nThis weekend we were treated to the latest installment of a new kind of political performance art created by Antifa and their white nationalist rivals. It may seem strange to call it art, but really that's what it is. Neither of these groups is an actual political force in America with policies or representing large constituencies. Neither are they true revolutionaries who are engaged in some war they can win.\n\nBoth groups are, more than anything else, performers. They have costumes, they have painted signs, and they have scripts. Also, like any true artists, what they crave more than anything else is attention - not votes, not money, not even influence, mostly just to be looked at and admired, or even hated.\n\nI struggled over whether to write this article because I believe both groups represent such an insignificant threat to the country that they should probably just be ignored. Stop pointing cameras at them, and they might just go have dinner or watch Netflix or something. But obviously, for myriad reasons, that isn't going to happen. So if this weird new strain of performance art is something we have to deal with, we should try to understand it.\n\nThe connection between protest and art is easier to see on the left than the right, but it exists in both. It's easier to see on the left because progressive protest art, specifically songs, have often filtered into the mainstream culture. But sometimes it goes the other way, as with Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" a Southern response to leftist protest music.\n\nWhat is different here is that art is not just a component of the Antifa or Proud Boys protests. It's the whole thing. It is all the there that is there. Let's take each in their turn, starting with Antifa.\n\nOne thing that happened this weekend after the unpleasantness was an eyeroll-worthy attempt at gaslighting by many on the far-left saying that Antifa simply means anti-fascist, and if you are against that, you must be a fascist. To call this reductive is an insult to reductivists. In the common parlance, Antifa refers to mask-wearing, violent black bloc protesters who engage in and defend the use of violence.\n\nThe term does have a longer history, but this idea being floated by progressives that they have all been calling themselves Antifa for decades is nonsense, especially in the American context. What we think of today as Antifa goes back at least to the 1999 World Trade Organization protests, also in the Pacific Northwest, that time in Seattle. The enemy then was capitalism, not fascism, which it still is since Antifa believes the two ideas are synonymous.\n\nWhat emerged more than anything else was a style: a bandanna over the face, a helmet, some kind of makeshift weapon. Over time, the script developed. They would take over a public space, and insist they had the authority to permit or deny entrance to it. They began to fancy themselves the self-appointed state police of the progressive movement.\n\nOver time, the rituals became commonplace: shouting over reporters, physically pushing those they disagreeing with while chanting, \"This is not violence.\" Their frenzied fury became well rehearsed. It is now as predictable as the final scene in \"Hamlet.\" It's their show. They don't have another one, but that's okay, because we keep buying tickets.\n\nAs mentioned above, the artistic stylings of the white nationalist right are harder to spot, but they are there, and are in many ways very modern. There is of course the costuming, whether khakis or more dramatic outfits with Nazi or Roman overtones, a look steeped in some stereotype of the West. Then of course there are the memes, and characters like Pepe the frog.\n\nThe Internet provided these crackpots a safe space, and what emerged is full of artistic imagery, characters, and storylines. Just as with Antifa, these are essentially artistic direction choices meant to draw maximum attention.\n\nSo these are the players, one troupe on each side, both intimately aware that all the world is a stage. And they put on a show for us. Most of it is play violence, but occasionally it gets out of hand, especially for journalists and others caught in the middle who don't know stage combat choreography. The proof of this is something that you never see. You never see both sides go into total combat, a melee involving everyone, because they don't want that. It's just a show.\n\nSo if this is a show that entertains us, and more, one that absurdly lets us pretend that Antifa and the white nationalists are the logical conclusion of the ideologies we oppose, how should we watch it? We have to understand that it is farce. It is all exaggeration and absurdity. It is an entertainment steeped in ridiculous hyperbole.\n\nIn that sense, it should really make us feel a little better. These comical clowns on both sides, so ludicrously removed from anything even approaching reality, should remind us that they don't represent anyone except their attention-starved selves. We should laugh at them. They won't mind - attention is attention. So, if you must, then watch these poor fools humiliate themselves. Then turn off Twitter, remember it's not the real world, and move on with your life.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "In Hearing, Senate Democrats Continue To Deny Antifa Exists\n\nSenate Democrats continue to put their heads in the sand as Antifa violence wracks Portland.\n\nIn a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution hearing today, Department of Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli and U.S. Attorney Erin Healy Cox fielded questions about the use of federal agents to quell the riots that have beset Portland for the past two months. Democrats on the committee were committed to asking about anything other than the violence perpetrated by Antifa. Instead, they spent most of their time attacking the federal agents.\n\nDemocrats took every opportunity to condemn right-wing violence stretching back years but would not acknowledge even the existence of Antifa. Republicans, on the other hand, all condemned violence equally, including the violence of white supremacists, insisting that all violence against law enforcement and all anti-government violence must be equally prosecuted.\n\nWhile Sen. Ted Cruz focused his questions on Antifa violence, Democrat senators such as Mazie Hirono took their time to attack witnesses, while ignoring the issue at hand. At one point Hirono said she decried violence of all stripes. Cruz asked if that includes Antifa. Her answer? \"It's my time.\" That's a no. None of the other Democrats did much better.\n\nCuccinelli painted a brutal picture of violence against federal agents, including the use of mortar-style fireworks and lasers to blind federal agents. Unfortunately, Democrats on the committee showed little to no interest in these events. They insisted, as they always do, that the \"secret police,\" as they call our law enforcement officers, are simply infringing on the rights of peaceful protesters.\n\nThey also claimed that when the Trump administration reached a deal to have Oregon State Police handle the situation, the violence abated. In fact, Portland police declared a riot just last night, as reports emerged of a stabbing at the protests.\n\nThe Post Millennial's Andy Ngo testified that Antifa is very real and has targeted and viciously attacked him. Ngo alleges less-violent protesters are used as a kind of shield for the most violent of Antifa anarchists and that popular platforms like GoFundMe and Venmo are used to fund their dangerous actions. He detailed physical attacks from the rioters that landed him in the hospital.\n\nGeorge Washington law professor Jonathan Turley argued that Antifa is \"arguably the most successful anti-free-speech organization of this generation.\" Turley claimed Antifa is winning because the media and politicians, as well as universities, are essentially supporting them. Turley urged Congress to act to protect Americans' speech rights. He added, as did Ngo, that Antifa is no myth. He held up the \"Antifa Handbook\" as evidence.\n\nBrennan Center for Justice Fellow Michael German argued that Antifa is not an organization and insisted their violence is being overblown by the Trump administration. Nkenge Harmon Johnson, the president and CEO of the Portland Urban League, testified that her ancestors had been slaves and that she still does not have the full rights of an American citizen. She decried the actions of law enforcement.\n\nShe also claims white supremacists are marching through the streets of Portland. She offered no evidence to support this claim. She also claimed that police are not on the side of black Portlanders.\n\nKyle Shideler, a homeland security expert from the Center for Security Policy, outlined several loose organizations of Antifa including websites that help Antifa organize in 22 countries. He detailed an intricate funding system, quite a feat for an organization that Democrats say does not even exist.\n\nWhat became clear is that while Republicans decry all anti-government violence, Democrats kept their heads in the sand about Antifa. The double standard plays directly into the hands of the anarchists. The biggest takeaway from the hearing was that Antifa has no better or more important ally than the Democratic Party.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "How Writing A Federalist Article Put Me On Chardonnay Antifa's Cancel List\n\nIn October 2020, I wrote an opinion article for The Federalist entitled \"More Va. Public Schools Using Kids As Guinea Pigs For Critical Race Theory.\" As a parent in Loudoun County, Va., I had become extremely concerned that Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) is being hijacked by rabid radicals eager to spend taxpayer money to indoctrinate teachers and students with critical race theory concepts.\n\nAmong the many issues I highlighted included: (1) more than $400,000 in taxpayer money spent on \"equity consultants\"; (2) an unconstitutional speech code preventing school staff from speaking negatively - both at school and in private - about LCPS's \"action-oriented equity practices\"; and (3) unconstitutional discrimination in paying for an \"equity\" focus group, where participants were chosen based solely on race.\n\nAs a parent, a lawyer, and public affairs professional, I was exercising my First Amendment right to question my local government. Certainly, those in Loudoun County on the other side of this debate could have countered my opinion article with one of their own. That is the very essence of the First Amendment: the marketplace of ideas.\n\nBut that contrary opinion article never came. What did come, however, is highlighted in this horrifying story by The Daily Wire .\n\nIn short, a private Facebook group called \"Anti-Racist Parents of Loudoun County\" (hereinafter referred to as Chardonnay Antifa) solicited members to help \"expose\" other parents who had spoken out against the use of critical race theory and \"equity\" (as opposed to equality) at LCPS. As part of the call to action, one member asked for help in hacking the websites of fellow LCPS parents, spreading information about these targets publicly through mailings, and raising money for these dirty deeds.\n\nDozens of members of this group started listing their nonconformist neighbors. I was listed by someone I didn't know for speaking out at a school board meeting about my heartfelt concerns with the speech code. I was listed a second time for my October Federalist op-ed by a neighbor who frequently takes to social media to attack everyone who does not agree with her worldview.\n\nWhile those posts are certainly annoying to see, it is her constitutional right to express on social media or any other medium as many negative opinions about me as she wishes. But you don't need a J.D. from the Holiday Inn Express Law School to recognize that soliciting assistance to potentially commit cyber-crimes against people solely for exercising their right to speak -and providing targets for destruction - is not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nThese proposed dirty tricks may violate a bevy of laws, including Virginia's criminal solicitation law , the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act , and ironically a Reconstruction Era civil rights statute prohibiting a conspiracy to \"injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same.\"\n\nAs insane as this part of the story is, there is a larger concern here. It is important to understand that being \"anti-racist\" is not the same as being \"not racist.\"\n\nThe large majority of tolerant people, myself included, put themselves squarely in the latter category. They believe that the color of someone's skin is as relevant as the color of his eyes or hair. They have been raised to be color-blind and live by Martin Luther King Jr.'s maxim to judge a person by the content of his or her character, rather than skin color. These people believe in race-neutral policies that have the ultimate goal of equal opportunity for all.\n\nThose who pose as \"anti-racist\" claim that systemic racism is present in nearly every conversation, interaction, organization, and so forth. They aggressively advocate for race-based policies that inflame, divide, and deliberately destroy longstanding norms, language, and institutions.\n\nWhile many do not subscribe to the \"anti-racist\" mantra, that does not mean they are wrong or right. That is what civil debate in the marketplace of ideas is for.\n\nUnfortunately, the Loudoun story is an example of what happens when people become radicalized by non-stop gaslighting from nefarious leaders, cable news hosts, celebrities, and people who say things on social media they wouldn't dare say at a cookout. Throw in the social media algorithms and you've got an army of liberal lemmings willing to start secret cabals to bring down anyone who dares raise concern.\n\nSo what are parents to do? Well, I helped start a daily newsletter called the Daily Malarkey that frequently highlights the absurdity of cancel culture. Here is what we said about this the other day: \"The Cancel Culture war isn't limited to politics and the media. It's in your neighborhood, at your kids' schools, and on your social media channels. In the past, you could generally avoid drama by keeping your head down, but when you're dealing with a group that literally creates a blacklist, there is no safe space.\"\n\nThis cancel culture cancer is coming for you, whether you know it or not. It's not about your political affiliation. It's not about your worldview. It's about the radicalization of everyday people whose inner turmoil will be directed at you, for whatever innocuous thing you might do to offend. It's being fueled by Big Tech, irresponsible political leaders, and perhaps a dash of foreign influence campaigns.\n\nWhatever you do, don't back down. Go beyond the politics and read the work of James Lindsey , Chris Rufo , and Bari Weiss . If you are conservative, don't be afraid to read Matt Taiibi just because he is liberal. If you are a liberal, don't scoff at reading Andrew Sullivan because he is a conservative.\n\nSeek out information about critical race theory in schools and learn why it's unconstitutional and racist. Send open records requests, go to school board meetings and speak out, and substitute unproductive social media fights with letters to the editor at your local paper.\n\nUltimately, this is beyond a fight for the First Amendment, a fight for freedoms, or even a fight for the future of your country. This is a fight for you, your family, and the future. Go win it.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "This Radical 1960s Movement In India Helps Explain Antifa Today\n\nFBI Director Chris Wray recently explained in detail threats to the republic from a range of subversive forces, from purposefully vague terms like \"Russian efforts to influence American domestic polity\" to leaderless but growing white supremacist movements. One thing stood out. Wray claimed the Antifa network is an ideology, not an organization, and therefore cannot be designated as a terror group. That goes against the wishes of his own boss, the president of the United States.\n\nNow, it is understandable that the FBI cannot, by law, police ideologies. American law doesn't allow government agencies to designate ideologies as destructive, as long as they do not promote active violence. In that way, it is different than Europe.\n\nGermany, for example, can ban Nazi books, and Poland and Hungary can ban communism. But in the United States, ideas may be freely propagated, unless there's actual violence. \"We don't really think of threats in terms of left, right at the FBI. We're focused on the violence, not the ideology,\" Wray noted.\n\nThe FBI accordingly has undertaken an investigation into individual actors who encourage or participate in violence but is apparently incapable of tackling Antifa as an organization. As the Associated Press reported , Wray said Antifa \"is not a group or an organization. It's a movement or an ideology.\"\n\nThis is a flawed way to understand Antifa, as well as the threat it poses. It is easy to dismiss Antifa as a movement, not an organization, and therefore not subversive enough to threaten the existence of the republic. To do so is also historically flawed. Another movement, very similar in character, can provide a template to understand how Antifa operates and what it seeks. To understand Antifa, one needs to know about the Naxalite movement of the late 1960s.\n\nCommunism was once a minor social force in pre-independence-India, jumpstarted among Cambridge University-educated upper-middle-class students during the colonial British period. This helps explain why it never was popular among the common people.\n\nDuring the British period, socially successful Indians were all upper-middle-class and above, those who were either from princely or land-owning families or who had an educated background. They were the ones who worked in the imperial civil service, law, and other professional fields.\n\nAfter all, Britain was a tiny country that ruled all over the world, and a significant majority of the local population supported and ran the empire. Stories of them are not told anymore because it would ruin the narrative of an evil colonial power exploiting lands faraway.\n\nOf these people, who could afford to visit Britain for training and scholarship, a tiny subset was radicalized in Cambridge, a historically Marxist-dominated university. They then went back to India to start the vanguard party and lead the working class to revolution. They were not successful. The communist movement splintered into various factions, as communism is wont to do, and from that, the Communist Party of India was born.\n\nPost-independence, it was increasingly clear India wouldn't see the violent revolution Karl Marx predicted. India in the 1950s, while under the borderline Peronist rule of J. L. Nehru with some broad socialist leanings, was still mostly democratic, and followed the British-designed system, with a Parliament and rule of law.\n\nAfter some initial protests, therefore, the communist parties also started taking part in electoral politics and turned into Euro-style social-democratic parties favoring incremental electoral changes, not a violent overthrow of the democratic system. Most parties also changed their rhetoric after the Sino-Indian border war of 1962.\n\nNationalism was a much stronger social force than internationalism. While all the left parties retained their communist names and spoke in terms of workers' liberation, they were no different than the student movements in Europe, which were broadly anti-Western and pro-Soviet. All except one. For some well-educated students, the dream of a violent revolution did not die. From that, the Naxalite movement was born, in 1967.\n\nLike Antifa, the Naxalite movement was mostly a band of college and university students led by radical professors, mostly an upper-middle-class crowd who could afford university education in the 1960s. The hub of the student-led movement was Calcutta University, one of the oldest, most prestigious, and British-established universities in India.\n\nLike Antifa, the movement was not centrally organized, although a lot of students called themselves Marxist-Leninists and actively looked up to Mao Zedong for ideological guidance, even though they never got any genuine support from Beijing. It was comprised of different splintered student groups, with their own local grassroots organizations and chains of commands.\n\nLike Antifa, they had a medical unit, a scouting party, an intel-gathering movement, and \"armed struggle\" groups. The movement had different regional party structures with broad ideological overlap, while individual methods were dependent on local and regional politics.\n\nFor example, Antifa in Seattle and Portland might not be formally connected, but they broadly use the same tactics, study each other's failures and successes, have a similar command structure, and support each other over social media. That is exactly how it was in India in the early 1970s. Local Naxalites, whether in the east or south India, differed in rhetoric and local politics, which was catered to the specific region and state in question.\n\nYet they broadly shared a similar organizational set up as well as attack plans, of hit-and-runs, burning government properties, and killing policemen. Although policemen are working-class, just like with Antifa they were nonetheless deemed class enemies and part of the oppressive structure. The hypocrisy of university-educated upper-middle-class rebels committing violence that mostly affects working-class people doing their jobs is ever-present in any leftist armed movement.\n\nThe Naxalite movement did not succeed. Just like the internal contradiction of elites pretending to be rebels opposed to nationalism and religion, it withered away and never got mass support. Every form of leftism, whether liberalism or Marxism, has always been about a vanguard movement, by \"educated and enlightened elites\" who think they can decide what's good or bad for the hoi-polloi while pretending to be a mass movement.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being elites. Every society has some hierarchy, and both ancient aristocrats and Platonic epistocrats, for example, were openly elite-led. But the difference is in a left-winger pretending to be for the people while working against their interests and pressuring them to conform to his ideas. It ultimately becomes so blatant that it destroys any such left-wing movement from within.\n\nAlso, the republic of India cracked down brutally in the 1960s and '70s, in a way that is unthinkable these days in either the United States or even India. Hundreds of students were killed in conflicts with local police; thousands were jailed for life. Thousands more reformed once they realized what they signed up for, or left the movement the moment there was an armed pushback from the state. Others were sent abroad by their rich parents. Like most middle-class citizens, counter-violence broke the back of pretentious rebels.\n\nIt is important for Americans, especially Republican lawmakers, to understand and study the Naxalite movement, as it provides a template to understand what is happening now. To think that disintegrated rebel movements without a central organization are not a threat to the republic is simply ahistorical.\n\nIt is also idiotic to deem them a movement without a structure. The structure is organic. It spreads, copies, and connects at a grassroots level. And it withers away the moment it faces a concerted political pushback. Whether they face that pushback is contingent on political will.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Homeland Security Secretary Says Antifa 'Absolutely' Meets Definition Of Domestic Terrorist Group\n\nActing Homeland Security Chief Chad Wolf said in certain circumstances, the militant group Antifa 'absolutely' qualifies as a domestic terrorist group.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf offered a harsh evaluation of the anarchist group Antifa Wednesday, declaring that in certain capacities, the left-wing group \"absolutely\" meets the standards worthy of condemnation as a \"domestic terrorist group.\"\n\n\"I think what we see with them individually targeting law enforcement, individually targeting certain officials for certain reasons, that is the definition of domestic terrorism,\" Wolf told The Federalist, going on to explain, however, that the group's decentralized nature makes it difficult for law enforcement to offer effective surveillance and widespread prosecution.\n\n\"The issue with Antifa,\" Wolf explained, \"it's not just one singular group. It's a loosely knit organization that's very hard to define, very hard to define who's a part of it.\"\n\nWolf pointed to the FBI conducting several ongoing investigations into the group to greater understand its underpinnings. That could benefit law enforcement agencies nationwide grappling with intensifying violence as major U.S. cities suffer under a historic moment of civil unrest.\n\nWhile Wolf, who was officially nominated Tuesday to fill the post he currently serves in an \"acting\" capacity, characterized Antifa as a domestic terrorist group in some cases, the DHS's mission lies primarily with protecting federal agents and property. That includes Portland, where rioters held a federal courthouse under siege in skirmishes between militant anarchists firing mortar-style fireworks and the police defending government buildings. In July alone, Wolf told congressional lawmakers earlier this month, more than 100 federal law enforcement agents sustained 277 injuries in Portland, nearly half of which were eye injuries from lasers that can cause permanent blindness.\n\nAs the nation sees the beginning of a second wave of violent protests terrorizing its major cities in Kenosha and Minneapolis this week, Portland demonstrators surpassed their 90th day of consecutive domestic attacks Tuesday, three months after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Legal records recently surfaced showing Floyd had overdose levels of Fentanyl in his blood when he died.\n\nWolf emphasized Wednesday that while the Trump administration is offering support to state and local law enforcement agencies being overrun by the inner-city mobs, it's ultimately up to those state and local governments to restore public safety and keep the peace. In the meantime, Wolf said, \"individuals have a right to protect themselves and their businesses and what they've worked all their life to build.\"\n\n\"Fault lies with those local leaders and those local law enforcement of not doing their job,\" said the acting secretary. \"This country is about rule of law, and we need the police to step up any time we have criminal riots and looting occur. Law enforcement needs to step in, restore that rule of law so that private citizens don't have to do this or that, you don't have counter-protests that become violent. That only happens in the absence of rule of law.\"\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "If Antifa Isn't Checked, Beware The Backlash Against Their Violence\n\nOne of my colleagues, Andy Ngo, is recuperating in a hospital with his skull bashed and earlobe torn by Portland Antifa. For those not aware, Andy is a sub-editor for Quillette, where I am a contributing writer, and he has been documenting the viral spread of the anarchist group Antifa in the city of Portland.\n\nIn his last such reporting, he was targeted, assaulted, and hospitalized with a brain bleed, with his camera and video instruments stolen. From the outside, Portland appears to tolerate this kind of anarchy, and Andy's own work has highlighted that Portland is beset with a certain lawlessness. The city's progressive mayor has time for LGBT pride parades, but orders his police forces to stand down when a gay Asian-American has his head caved in by a privileged bunch of ultra-violent cosplayers .\n\nAntifa is short for \"anti-fascist,\" which is what these groups label themselves to excuse their crimes as a justified reaction to Donald Trump's presidency. Antifa and other far-left personalities and groups openly organize every single day on Twitter and Facebook without any bans or fear of law enforcement. Andy has been targeted often by such people, not just Antifa but also by a section of liberal activists, lobbyists, policy people, and even liberal journalists who have tried to justify the assault on him.\n\nIn a blatant display of partisanship, the \"fact-checker\" website Snopes twisted itself like a pretzel trying to justify or at least minimize the gravity of the assault, which the editor of Quillette Claire Lehmann instantly called out . Quillette's editorial also called this assault a wake-up call. CNN came up with a contorted tweet that almost made it sound like Ngo was simply caught in a cross-fire and is now blaming Antifa due to his personal biases.\n\nIncidentally, Quillette has been on the forefront at unmasking journalists with overt sympathy for Antifa, and published a thorough paper to that effect.\n\n\"We were pilloried by left-leaning media last month for publishing a piece which scrutinised the relationship between a handful of journalists and Antifa,\" Claire told me, \"But considering how the violence at Portland has been downplayed or at times even justified by those same journalists, it is clear that more scrutiny is needed, not less.\"\n\nThe assault finally caught the eyes of politicians as well, with the U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grennell being exceptionally vocal about it, as a prominent gay American leader: \"Andy is a friend of mine and he is one brave reporter. What has happened to him should never happen to anyone,\" Grennell told me.\n\nNgo's case is not unique, and it points to a dark history. Of course, the Portland kids are not the German Antifa of the 1930s, nor are the Proud Boys, the right-wing group that often brawls with them over free speech, comparable to Nazis. And the USA isn't facing an economic collapse like 1930s Germany.\n\nBoth groups are mostly Live Action Role Players trying to find meaning in their otherwise void, libertine, and undisciplined life, often by bashing skulls and destroying properties. They have never faced a concerted reaction, they have never had the state crack down with the full might of the law, and they have never seen a man burning alive next to them in a Molotov cocktail or riot police beating the hell out of rioters.\n\nI sincerely doubt many of these face-masked punks would be there on the streets the moment after they realize that punches, kicks, shields, and batons are not always one directional. But that does not mean it can never get worse. That also does not mean we can't apply lessons from larger epochs of history more locally.\n\nThere's a theory in Marxism known as \"heightening the contradictions.\" Karl Marx wrote a vague theory of economic history, with a flawed prediction about how society would develop and shape in future. But he didn't say anything about day to day organization, so it was up to future Marxists to design and interpret Marxism according to their cultural and historical background.\n\nIt was Vladimir Lenin who realized that in order to bring about a violent revolution, you need to move society to a point, often through external effort, where there's nothing but the enmity between two groups of people. Only in that chaos can true revolutionary communists take power.\n\nThe major flaw in this idea was that Lenin seemed to be certain that in chaos only the communists can win with power. Unfortunately for his side, in reality, the monopoly on violence is never one-sided. In that sense, violence is often Newtonian and follows natural laws: the reaction is often just as powerful as the action.\n\nIn the Weimar Republic in the Germany of the 1920s, this was displayed in full. Practically, there was no difference between the Nazis and communists in Berlin, which was, at that point, the \"reddest city in Europe after Moscow.\" Joseph Goebbels, for example, used the same rhetoric and organizational tactics that the German communists used in his speeches.\n\n\"The worker in a capitalist state-and that is his deepest misfortune-is no longer a living human being, a creator, a maker. He has become a machine. A number, a cog in the machine without sense or understanding. He is alienated from what he produces,\" Goebbels wrote in 1932, \"but a revolutionary achievement following from the radical carrying out of the basic life needs of the working class. A ruthless battle against corruption! A war against exploitation, freedom for the workers! The elimination of all economic-capitalist influences on national policy!\"\n\nThe battle in the streets of Weimar Germany, with massive inflation and poverty and national humiliation, was essentially, between two sets of authoritarian thugs, the Nazis and the Antifaschistische Aktion , the original German Antifa. Both the German imperial monarchist conservatives and the Weimar liberals failed, and refused, respectively, to bring about order.\n\nTo quote W. H. Auden, those to whom evil is done do evil in return. Violence almost always begets violence, and if liberals and conservatives refuse, or fail, to establish order, like their forefathers from 80 years back, someone else will. The majority of the common people throughout the Western world do not want a revolution or civil war or anything of that sort. All they want is peace, civilization, and lawful streets. They will support anyone who will provide them security amidst lawlessness.\n\nThroughout history, people support the establishment of peace and authority, often through force in extreme circumstances. It is a natural human instinct to form a social contract and establish a secured society amidst natural anarchy. If American liberals and conservatives both fail to bring about order in generic lawlessness and anarchy, they will pave the way for normal middle-class peaceful Americans to elect someone to bring about order.\n\nAnarchy is equal to, if not worse than, tyranny, and if history is a guide, unless governments come to their senses and govern, a Leviathan always rises . In between, a lot of people like Ngo will have their heads caved in.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Neither Antifa Nor The Alt-Right Matter Very Much\n\nIn the age of Donald Trump, two groups have emerged, one on each side of the political divide, to play the role of menacing bogeyman. On the right, the so called Alt-Right began to emerge during the last GOP presidential primary as Twitter bullies and obnoxious bloggers. They eventually held a gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia that tragically led to the murder of Heather Heyer.\n\nOn the left, Antifa, which was not created in response to the Alt-Right but has taken on, at least in many quarters of the media, a shine for fighting the Alt-Right, has engaged in violent counter protests, assaulted journalists, and had a member of its ranks implicated in a brutal murder at an ICE facility.\n\nNeither group is entirely insignificant and neither should be fully ignored. But at a certain point the media has to ask itself if it is giving too much oxygen and credit to these tiny groups that have little to no effect on most American lives outside of the social media outrage factories.\n\nBefore going on, I should admit the plank in my own eye, having spilled quite a bit of ink writing about and attacking both. But as the 2020 election cycle threatens to make an already divided America even more volatilely divided, we all need to be cautious about making these small, fringe groups the avatar for the millions of Americans with differing political views from our own.\n\nWhen I have suggested that the left makes too much of the Alt-Right and the right makes too much of Antifa, I have met balking objections from both sides. They typically run rather like this.\n\nFrom the right: \"But Antifa has institutional support in universities and a coddling mainstream media that encourages their actions. Moreover, in places such as Portland, Oregon, they operate with a degree of impunity from the police.\"\n\nThen I hear from the left. \"The Alt-Right was a driving force behind electing a president who has made excuses and apologies for it, it remains a policy force within the administration, and one of its members committed a heinous murder that could have killed far more people.\"\n\nThere are elements of truth to all of these claims, but also a pretty high degree of exaggeration. While police in many instances have handled Antifa rallies (riots?) badly, many Antifa members have been arrested. While it's true that many in the institutional left and the media have made excuses for Antifa, very, very few actually endorse their tactics or platform, to the extent they have one beyond \"make trouble.\"\n\nLikewise, the Alt-Right did have some influence on Trump's election, but it was nowhere near the driving force behind it. As far as policy goes, on issues like immigration and foreign policy, what many on the left see as Alt-Right influence is actually the influence of West Coast think tanks like Hoover and Claremont that have nothing at all to do with the Alt-Right, but make sincere and sometimes compelling arguments about the future of America.\n\nThe attraction to conflate these two groups, Antifa and the Alt-Right, with so little actual power to the broader movements they claim to represent is easy to understand. But it can also be lazy. Of course it's easier to attack the fringe and pretend it's the center of the other side than it is to address the legitimate concerns of reasonable people one disagrees with.\n\nBut small, militant fringe groups are nothing new in American history. On the left, the Weather Underground killed innocent people in the early 1970s while being somewhat coddled by the media, and its former members are sometimes feted by prominent liberals, but their actual agenda never took any serious hold.\n\nLikewise, right-wing militia groups have dotted the American landscape, especially in the west, now and then causing small conflagrations but never coming close to creating a wildfire. They too sporadically received overhyped media coverage warning they portended some larger, scary trend.\n\nSo what is the correct balance for journalists covering these groups, and what responsibility does each side have for policing their side of the political fence? These are different, but related, questions that need to be answered.\n\nCovering Charlottesville, the attack on the ICE facility, and the physical assault on journalist Andy Ngo is entirely appropriate. These are legitimate news stories. But they are also where the two separate questions above often blend together to create a toxic stew of accusation and whataboutism.\n\nWhere journalists, and other prominent writers and thinkers, go off the rails is in arguing that one side or the other is enabling these violent acts that are only the responsibility of the violent actors. It is wrong for progressives to blame a chant at a Trump rally for alleged death threats against members of Congress, just as it is wrong for conservatives to blame those Congress members' \"concentration camp\" rhetoric for the violent actions of an Antifa member.\n\nWhat needs to be stressed when covering these stories is that the actions and rhetoric of the Alt-Right and Antifa run counter to the beliefs of the vast, vast majority of the American people.\n\nShould the FBI and local enforcement be investigating and charging criminal activity by Antifa or the Alt-Right? Yes, of course, just as they should go after MS-13, gangs in Chicago, and the remnants of the Italian mafia. But just as we don't look at these latter examples as fomenting some doom to the American project, so too we should understand the former.\n\nAt the end of the day, even though we all want to score the points and get the clicks, we should be careful not to hand the lunatics of Antifa and the Alt-Right more power than they actually have. This emboldens both, and only makes all of us more distrustful of the other.\n\nThe best response when the other side shoves a microphone in your face and demands you disavow one of these groups is to say, \"Of course I disavow these idiots, but they are inconsequential clowns, not a powerful force that American discourse must put at the center of attention.\" If we can even just try to do that, even if we don't always succeed, we will all be a lot better off.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "No Arrests Made After Violent Antifa Attack Hospitalizes Pro-Free Speech Demonstrators In San Francisco\n\nSeveral hundred Antifa members began attacking protestors and police in San Fransisco. Despite the violence caught on camera, no arrests were made.\n\nA pro-free speech, pro-Trump, and pro-police demonstration turned violent at United Nations Plaza in San Francisco over the weekend when a group of several hundred so-called anti-fascists began attacking and throwing projectiles at protestors and police. Despite multiple attacks caught on camera, no arrests were made.\n\nThe protest, organized by \"Team Save America\" and Philip Anderson, was intended to \"protest Twitter which it said squelches conservative speech.\" Those who attended the protest in the name of free speech also expressed support for President Donald Trump and the police by wearing \"Make America Great Again\" hats and waving \"Thin Blue Line\" and U.S. flags.\n\nThe protest began peacefully, but as Anderson mounted the stage to begin his speech, anti-fascists dressed in black \"surged the area, outnumbering and attacking those gathered,\" according to the Associated Press. They also began throwing plastic and glass bottles at the pro-police Trump supporters.\n\nAmong those injured was Anderson, who suffered a knocked-out tooth from Antifa who attacked him \"for no reason,\" a Trump supporter, and at least three San Francisco police officers who were assaulted and injured with pepper spray and caustic chemicals. Multiple people were taken to the hospital.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=779495006218416\n\nDuring the attack on Anderson, people can be heard screaming \"pray about it\" and yelling racial expletives as he walks away holding his mouth.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2209454595864588\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Anderson said he \"called the counterprotesters hypocrites and said they are the reason why he's voting for President Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"I love America, I love this country, and I love free speech,\" he said.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department's response to these attacks looked drastically different compared to Phoenix law enforcement responding to a similar protest Saturday. AZ Central reports that nearly every attendee of a protest against police in downtown Phoenix was arrested \"after police say the group marched in the road, knocked barricades into the road, and threw smoke bombs at officers.\"\n\nEighteen people were arrested and were facing charges \"including aggravated assault on an officer, riot, criminal damage, unlawful assembly, hindering prosecution, resisting arrest, and obstructing a road.\"\n\nThe riot was first announced on social media, but only 30 minutes after it began, it was declared an unlawful assembly as protestors threw devices emitting smoke at officers.\n\n\"Phoenix PD underestimates the power of the people. March with us to occupy Washington Street and remind PD who they serve. We will not stay silent. Until we get justice, Phoenix will have no peace,\" the digital flyers advertising the event stated.\n\nPhoenix Police Department spokesperson Sgt. Ann Justus said that it was \"due to the ongoing criminal activity and assault, the Phoenix Police deployed less-lethal munitions in order to safely make arrests.\"\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

Alissa Eleanor Azar, 33 (b. Feb. 12, 1991), was charged with felony riot, disorderly conduct in the second degree and unlawful use of mace in the second degree. The jury of 10 women and two men found Azar guilty of felony riot and second-degree disorderly conduct. The unlawful use of mace charge resulted in a hung jury. The case stems from an Antifa riot in 2021 at a park in Clackamas County, Ore., and that's where the trial took place. Clackamas County is a politically moderate county adjacent to the left-wing stronghold of Multnomah County, where Portland is. It has both suburban and rural communities.\n\nAzar burst into tears as the verdict was read on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe 2021 Attack\n\nOn June 18, 2021, right-wing activists held a flag wave and voter registration drive in Clackamette Park in Oregon City. Defendant Azar, who self-identifies as an \"independent journalist,\" was captured on videos, which were key evidence in trial, rushing in to spray a woman with mace.\n\nAntifa and Azar, the prosecution argued, organized to violently disrupt the event hosted by a Republican state house candidate, who had reserved the park shelter that day. Members of the Proud Boys were also in attendance. Police later located explosive devices at the scene, according to evidence presented in court.\n\n\"Don't forget about the counter demonstration this afternoon,\" Azar posted on X along with a flyer featuring the Antifa red and black flags symbol the day of the riot. But it wasn't a counter-demonstration. Dozens of Antifa members in black masks and black clothing arrived carrying melee weapons, supplies and pepper spray. Alissa Azar urged Antifa members to mobilize to the park for a 'counter-demonstration.' They brought weapons. Video from multiple angles shows them confronting the right-wing side and launching an attack through pepper spray that led to a brawl. Clackamas County Deputy District Attorney Josh Cutino argued Antifa was looking for a fight. Azar, wearing all black but revealing her long dark hair, was recorded rushing up to a woman in a sundress and spraying her with a chemical weapon. Alissa Azar's defense tried repeatedly to get the judge to block the prosecution from entering videos of Azar as evidence. Video stills: News2Share \"Mace the female!\" one of Azar's comrades shouted in the video played to the court. Azar was then knocked to the ground by a man wearing Proud Boy symbols who was holding a shield and wearing a helmet. Cutino argued Azar was not acting as a journalist but was actively involved in the riot that \"caused grave public harm.\" Clackamas County Deputy District Attorney Josh Cutino was the lead prosecutor representing the State of Oregon Cutino described Azar to the jury as a \"leader\" and \"organizer\" within Antifa. He shared social media posts by Azar in which she repeatedly refers to Antifa in terms such as \"we\" and \"us\"-undermining her assertion she was reporting as a journalist. Five days following the June 18 riot, Azar claimed that she would participate in similar direct actions in the future, writing on X, \"It's us against badged and unbadged fascists\" and that she \"would\" do it again. Cutino told jurors that Azar's plans to continue carrying out violence were a serious cause of concern for public safety. The court saw many posts like this that demonstrated Alissa Azar was not merely a journalist documenting protests At the trial, an Oregon City Police officer was subpoenaed to testify about what he witnessed when responding to the riot. Officer Spencer Rohde said police found homemade explosive devices and riot shields in the area where Antifa had congregated. A bomb squad had to be called in. Azar was captured on Rohde's body cam footage. Some of the attendees at that 2021 riot on the right-wing side wore clothing with symbols of the Proud Boys, a group whose members have been involved in other violent brawls and protests against Antifa. The fact that some members of the Proud Boys nationally were convicted for being involved in the Jan. 6 US Capitol riot in 2021 was used by Azar's attorneys to claim that Azar's actions were in self-defense. The district attorney's office said both sides were armed with weapons, and both sides are being prosecuted. Law enforcement officers testified as witnesses for the prosecution and described the riot as \"chemical warfare\" accompanied by extreme acts of physical violence. Azar's defense at the trial, led by Lauren Regan, an Antifa activist attorney for the Civil Liberties Defense Center (CLDC), pursued a strategy of jury nullification by arguing that the victims of Antifa violence deserved it because they were connected to the US Capitol riot and are \"white supremacists.\" She also argued that Azar's actions were self-defense while she was on the alleged journalism assignment. Regan said that Azar maced the woman out of fear because a \"violent Proud Boy\" was standing next to the woman. She argued the woman had Azar's personal belongings but that claim was not corroborated. Police body camera footage also captured Azar admitting to owning six riot shields that were brought to the direct action. Regan compared Antifa's militant activism akin to those who historically stood up against Nazism in Germany.

Who is Alissa Eleanor Azar? The December 2021 indictment of Azar , a long-time regular at Antifa riots in Portland, sent shockwaves across Antifa cells and networks in the Pacific Northwest. Azar had been repeatedly arrested and charged at violent Antifa direct actions in Multnomah County, but was repeatedly not prosecuted. Alissa Azar was arrested at a violent Antifa riot in downtown Portland in March 2021. Photo: Portland Police Azar has risen to become one of the chief propagandists for the violent Antifa movement and maintains close ties with Rose City Antifa, a violent cell of Antifa in Portland. She claims to be a journalist and uses her social media following to help mainstream Antifa's message of political violence. For example, extremists who commit politically motivated attacks have fed responsibility claims to her for publication. Her extremism appears to be the reason Patreon pulled her account sometime in 2023, though Azar later publicized a second ban-evading account on the platform. Update: Following Azar's felony conviction, a Patreon spokesperson sent TPM a statement. \"While we do allow some creators to start new accounts following an account removal, they may not create an account focusing on the same violative works as their previous Patreon,\" the spokesperson wrote. Azar's last post was of content she made inside the Portland State Millar library while it was violently occupied and damaged in May. Azar has been charged with trespass over the incident. Azar's second Patreon account is now no longer active. Victims of Azar's violence have spoken to The Post Millennial about their frustration that she wasn't held accountable for her actions in Portland. Alissa Eleanor Azar In March 2021, Azar was charged with second-degree disorderly conduct and interfering with a peace officer at an Antifa riot in downtown Portland. Her case was dropped by Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt-in line with his 2020 policy of not prosecuting most leftist riot-related crimes. In December 2022, she was charged with felony robbery, felony assault, tampering with physical evidence, theft and other serious crimes stemming from an attack on a citizen journalist in August 2022 in downtown Portland. Schmidt's prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss the case entirely in 2023. In May 2024, she was charged over a pro-Hamas riot on the Portland State campus after far-left occupiers were evicted from a violent four-day occupation of the Millar Library that sustained over a million dollars in damage. Azar joins a long list of Antifa self-described journalists who have been accused or convicted of politically motivated violent crimes. In November 2022, Darrel Kimberlin , a secret Portland Antifa member who publicly identified as a \"gonzo journalist\" like Azar, became a convicted felon after pleading guilty to smashing up the Oregon Democrats headquarters and businesses in multiple attacks. DA Schmidt's office asked for no prison time as part of the sweetheart plea deal. In December last year, Renea Goddard , of Little Rock, Ark., was sentenced to federal prison over a 2020 firebombing attack on police. Goddard was a former journalist for a local NPR-affiliated station. Before Azar's involvement in militant Antifa extremism in Portland, she had a failed career in the entertainment industry. She has spoken about her family's Syrian background and her support of dictator and accused genocidaire Bashar al-Assad. She also previously posted about her concern that Jewish people in the \"entire industry\" might discriminate against her. Last October, Azar appeared to post in support of the Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel. \"Militant action is not for everyone, but it's how things get accomplished,\" she wrote on Oct. 7 in response to a post about Palestinians. Alissa Azar appears to justify the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attack in Israel Simultaneous to her involvement with Antifa in Portland, Azar has also grown a fanbase within that community for her sex work. She runs an OnlyFans account where she shows off nude photos of herself standing in front of Antifa print propaganda. In some of the photos, Azar dons a balaclava while brandishing an AR-15-style rifle. In November 2022, Azar lost custody of her only child after the boy's father told a family court that her involvement with Antifa and her sex work had created an unsafe environment for their child. A family court stripped Alissa Azar of shared custody of her only child The Defense's Star 'Expert' On the second day of the trial, the defense brought in its star witness: Shane Burley. Burley was presented as an expert on \"antifascism\" and the far-right. He has written two books and opinion articles in support of Antifa, including their use of political violence. Defense expert witness Shane Burley is a secret member of Rose City Antifa Burley testified that Antifa can be an organized group, but that it's rare. When asked about Rose City Antifa during cross-examination, he falsely said the group is \"not an organization.\" The prosecutor then pulled up Rose City Antifa's website, which has a section about queries for membership. The defense did not disclose to the court that Burley is a member of Rose City Antifa himself. In 2017, Burley was recorded in an undercover Project Veritas sting providing radicalization training to Rose City Antifa recruits. Another instructor was recorded telling the prospective members to gouge out the eyes of political opponents during fights. A Project Veritas sting revealed that Shane Burley was providing secret training to Rose City Antifa in 2017 During the cross-examination, prosecutor Cutino had Burley read from his own writings where he appeared to support militant pre-emptive confrontations and violent extremism. Burley struggled to answer the questions, prompting Judge Todd L. Van Rysselberghe to compel him to answer. When Cutino asked Burley if he believed in militant opposition to fascism, which was detailed in a book Burley authored titled, \"Why We Fight,\" Burley answered, \"Yes.\" In relation to the June 18 riot, Cutino asked Burley if Antifa's actions that day would have been an example of \"pushing fascists out of a public space,\" or \"militant antifascism.\" Looking flustered, Burley failed to provide a direct answer. The prosecutor asked if organizing could include distributing a flyer, which is what Azar did on June 18. Burley responded: \"Yes.\" Burley also testified that he considers himself to be part of Antifa and that violence is acceptable as long as it's for his cause of \"antifascism.\" He added that Antifa groups would \"broadly benefit by being more comfortable with guns.\" Following Burley's testimony on Friday, the defense canceled calling any more of its witnesses, which included at least three other Antifa affiliates. Alissa Azar Testifies On Monday, the third day of the trial, Azar took the stand. She cried at one point and denied that she had ever been involved in \"militant antifascism.\" This created an opportunity for the prosecutor to enter evidence revealing otherwise, such as her violent extremist posts and criminal history at Antifa events in Multnomah County. Alissa Azar was arraigned in 2022 in Multnomah County She testified that she was acting solely as a journalist on the day of the June 18 riot, but evidence shown by Cutino during cross-examination revealed she assisted in organizing Antifa's counter-direct action and participated in it. Antifa members and supporters of Alissa Azar wore masks in court and harassed journalists. Photo: Chelly Bouferrache During cross-examination, prosecutor Cutino presented to the court social media posts by Azar showing her promoting violent extremism. (Azar locked down her X account during the course of her trial.) Azar admitted that she felt it is a necessity to \"use violence\" and that \"disrupting fascist organizing is a positive thing.\" The prosecutor noted to the court that Azar fits well within the description of \"militant antifascism\" according to the defense's Antifa expert witness. He referenced Burley's testimony about Antifa's goal of \"occupying spaces\" through violent direct actions and asked Azar if she agreed with it. Azar answered, \"Yes.\" Alissa Azar hides her face after leaving court with her entourage following the guilty verdict. Photo: Chelly Bouferrache Azar testified that violence is permissible against any group whose political beliefs \"antifascists\" disagree with. Cutino then asked Azar, \"What does violence mean to you?\" She answered: \"I don't think defense of community members is violence.\" Azar's social media posts over the years indicate she views evangelical Christians, women activists who are critical of trans ideology, and Donald Trump supporters as \"fascists.\" Jurors were shown Azar's March 31, 2024 post on social media platform Mastodon, ahead of a Christian worship event in downtown Portland, in which she described the Christians as \"bloodthirsty\" and urged her comrades to reconnect with one another and organize a response. \"Fascists should always be confronted and prevented from organizing, recruiting, and spreading hate,\" Azar wrote. Rose City Antifa, a group whose direct actions Azar promotes, violently attacked a Christian worship event in downtown Portland in 2021 and has proceeded to disrupt similar annual events with violence since. Children and families were hurt in the summer 2021 waterfront attack. Another example shown to the jury included Azar discussing an upcoming Portland Antifa recruitment event called \"Fash Free Fest,\" where she celebrated her comrades' acts of political violence. \"Some of these events got insanely brutal but people continued to defend our community by any means necessary,\" wrote Azar. \"The refusal to back down regardless of how intense things got by antifascists has resulted in the violent fascists to virtually f-k off and leave Portland.\" Azar admitted to being part of the Antifa movement but stopped short of admitting to being part of an Antifa cell. Over the years, Azar has interacted closely with Rose City Antifa on social media. Under questioning, she conceded her postings and writings are \"biased\" because she is a radical leftist. The prosecutor presented evidence that even before the June 2021 riot, Azar had attended and promoted violent actions carried out by Antifa against a group of conservative flag-wavers in Clackamas County, and that group did not include members of the Proud Boys. Police witnesses had earlier testified that the flag-wavers were non-violent and had no involvement with the Proud Boys or other extremist groups. Azar posted from the scene of the surprise attack, showing Antifa vandalizing the public space with animal organs, blood, urine, oil and feces. In closing arguments on Tuesday, Cutino stated that Azar is actively involved in Antifa, and the Clackamette Park riot that endangered the public would never have happened if Antifa didn't show up to disrupt and attack the permitted event. He said that Azar's self-identity as a \"journalist\" was irrelevant in this case because she committed criminal acts. Alissa Azar was captured in 2021 CCTV footage meeting with violent Antifa rioters in downtown Portland following an assault on journalist Andy Ngo The prosecutor argued that many other journalists were standing off to the side, and they did not take any violent action during that event. \"Ms. Azar's actions were violent,\" Cutino said. \"They [Antifa and Azar] were all working together.\" Cutino also told the court that suspects from the right-wing side accused of rioting are also being prosecuted by the county. One accused Proud Boy suspect has a trial in the county scheduled in November. Defense attorney Lauren Regan argued that there is an immediate moral obligation to stand up against the far-right as a result of the riot at the US Capitol, including through the use of militant means. She likened the act of Antifa combating the Proud Boys to people who historically opposed Nazi Germany. Regan admitted that her client is not a typical journalist, but one that throws herself into dangerous situations for the story. Regan said Azar's actions at the park were self-defense measures. What's Next? The conclusion of the five-day trial wrapped up a tense security challenge for sheriff's deputies at the courthouse. On the second day of trial, TPM reporter Katie Daviscourt was assaulted by an Antifa associate of Azar. The Post Millennial was in attendance every day of the trial, beginning with jury selection. An unidentified woman repeatedly hit Daviscourt with a door, forcing officers to respond. The pink-haired woman who initiated the conflict had earlier met with Azar outside the courthouse. Before, during and after the trial, multiple Antifa accounts called for comrades to surge to the courthouse to support Azar. Antifa members stood outside the Clackamas County courthouse and stared at people and jurors as they walked out. Photos: Chelly Bouferrache Anitfa members and friends of Alissa Azar expressed aggressive hostility to media outside the courthouse. Photos: Chelly Bouferrache At the start of trial, Judge Van Rysselberghe banned the use of all electronic devices and prohibited media from photographing the trial over fears that jurors could be identified and targeted. Antifa members online have sometimes adopted a tactic of trying to identify jurors in cases involving their members to harass and intimidate them, or cause a mistrial. Tracy Molina, a woman associated with Azar through prior violent Portland Antifa direct actions, was chastised by the judge on the first day for using her mobile device. Molina was warned she could be held in contempt of court for violating his order. Chelly Bouferrache, a freelance photographer on assignment for TPM, was repeatedly harassed by Azar's close friend, John Hacker, at the courthouse. Law enforcement officers warned him to leave her alone and he was barred from attending the trial. Violent Portland antifa activist John Hacker was barred from the trial but stood outside the courthouse for five days. Photos: Chelly Bouferrache; Multnomah County Sheriff's Office Hacker, who also calls himself a journalist, was recorded on video participating in the riot with Azar in 2021. Ben West, a conservative county commissioner for Clackamas County who was at the trial, told TPM Hacker repeatedly confronted him. As revenge for West's posts critical of Azar, Antifa accounts put out a call for comrades to release personal details about his travel and movement. As Azar's guilt was read out in the courtroom, her Antifa supporters expressed rage and frustration. 10 sheriffs were on the scene to contain any possible rioting. Azar immediately burst into tears upon hearing that she is now a convicted felon. Some of her masked friends also cried. The judge sealed the jury roll to protect the identities of the jurors. Azar's attorney told the judge she intends to appeal. Her sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 9 at 11:30 a.m. Outside the courthouse, Antifa supporters of Azar nearly rioted. Hacker was observed beating and bloodying a man to the ground. He was arrested by sheriff's deputies and has been booked in the Clackamas County jail on a fourth-degree assault charge. Alissa Azar's close friend, John Hacker, was arrested over a violent assault outside the courthouse following the verdict Reporter Katie Daviscourt was confronted by John Hacker shortly before he beat a man to the ground outside the courthouse. Photo: Chelly Bouferrache Alissa Azar wept outside the courthouse as her masked friends tried to hide her from the cameras' view. Photo: Chelly Bouferrache After the conviction, the Clackamas County district attorney John Wentworth released a statement . \"Law enforcement officers and prosecutors worked diligently to bring this case to trial because families deserve to feel safe in our parks,\" DA Wentworth said. The office announced that two alleged \"Proud Boy affiliates\" are currently wanted by law enforcement and that a third has an upcoming trial in November.\n\n\"Don't forget about the counter demonstration this afternoon,\" Azar posted on X along with a flyer featuring the Antifa red and black flags symbol the day of the riot. But it wasn't a counter-demonstration. Dozens of Antifa members in black masks and black clothing arrived carrying melee weapons, supplies and pepper spray. Alissa Azar urged Antifa members to mobilize to the park for a 'counter-demonstration.' They brought weapons.\n\nVideo from multiple angles shows them confronting the right-wing side and launching an attack through pepper spray that led to a brawl. Clackamas County Deputy District Attorney Josh Cutino argued Antifa was looking for a fight. Azar, wearing all black but revealing her long dark hair, was recorded rushing up to a woman in a sundress and spraying her with a chemical weapon.\n\nAlissa Azar's defense tried repeatedly to get the judge to block the prosecution from entering videos of Azar as evidence.

She likened the act of Antifa combating the Proud Boys to people who historically opposed Nazi Germany. Regan admitted that her client is not a typical journalist, but one that throws herself into dangerous situations for the story. Regan said Azar's actions at the park were self-defense measures. What's Next? The conclusion of the five-day trial wrapped up a tense security challenge for sheriff's deputies at the courthouse. On the second day of trial, TPM reporter Katie Daviscourt was assaulted by an Antifa associate of Azar. The Post Millennial was in attendance every day of the trial, beginning with jury selection. An unidentified woman repeatedly hit Daviscourt with a door, forcing officers to respond. The pink-haired woman who initiated the conflict had earlier met with Azar outside the courthouse. Before, during and after the trial, multiple Antifa accounts called for comrades to surge to the courthouse to support Azar. Antifa members stood outside the Clackamas County courthouse and stared at people and jurors as they walked out.

Photos: Chelly Bouferrache At the start of trial, Judge Van Rysselberghe banned the use of all electronic devices and prohibited media from photographing the trial over fears that jurors could be identified and targeted. Antifa members online have sometimes adopted a tactic of trying to identify jurors in cases involving their members to harass and intimidate them, or cause a mistrial. Tracy Molina, a woman associated with Azar through prior violent Portland Antifa direct actions, was chastised by the judge on the first day for using her mobile device. Molina was warned she could be held in contempt of court for violating his order. Chelly Bouferrache, a freelance photographer on assignment for TPM, was repeatedly harassed by Azar's close friend, John Hacker, at the courthouse. Law enforcement officers warned him to leave her alone and he was barred from attending the trial. Violent Portland antifa activist John Hacker was barred from the trial but stood outside the courthouse for five days. Photos: Chelly Bouferrache; Multnomah County Sheriff's Office Hacker, who also calls himself a journalist, was recorded on video participating in the riot with Azar in 2021. Ben West, a conservative county commissioner for Clackamas County who was at the trial, told TPM Hacker repeatedly confronted him. As revenge for West's posts critical of Azar, Antifa accounts put out a call for comrades to release personal details about his travel and movement. As Azar's guilt was read out in the courtroom, her Antifa supporters expressed rage and frustration. 10 sheriffs were on the scene to contain any possible rioting. Azar immediately burst into tears upon hearing that she is now a convicted felon. Some of her masked friends also cried. The judge sealed the jury roll to protect the identities of the jurors. Azar's attorney told the judge she intends to appeal. Her sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 9 at 11:30 a.m. Outside the courthouse, Antifa supporters of Azar nearly rioted. Hacker was observed beating and bloodying a man to the ground. He was arrested by sheriff's deputies and has been booked in the Clackamas County jail on a fourth-degree assault charge. Alissa Azar's close friend, John Hacker, was arrested over a violent assault outside the courthouse following the verdict Reporter Katie Daviscourt was confronted by John Hacker shortly before he beat a man to the ground outside the courthouse. Photo: Chelly Bouferrache Alissa Azar wept outside the courthouse as her masked friends tried to hide her from the cameras' view. Photo: Chelly Bouferrache After the conviction, the Clackamas County district attorney John Wentworth released a statement . \"Law enforcement officers and prosecutors worked diligently to bring this case to trial because families deserve to feel safe in our parks,\" DA Wentworth said. The office announced that two alleged \"Proud Boy affiliates\" are currently wanted by law enforcement and that a third has an upcoming trial in November.\n\nSome of the attendees at that 2021 riot on the right-wing side wore clothing with symbols of the Proud Boys, a group whose members have been involved in other violent brawls and protests against Antifa. The fact that some members of the Proud Boys nationally were convicted for being involved in the Jan. 6 US Capitol riot in 2021 was used by Azar's attorneys to claim that Azar's actions were in self-defense.\n\nThe district attorney's office said both sides were armed with weapons, and both sides are being prosecuted. Law enforcement officers testified as witnesses for the prosecution and described the riot as \"chemical warfare\" accompanied by extreme acts of physical violence.\n\nAzar's defense at the trial, led by Lauren Regan, an Antifa activist attorney for the Civil Liberties Defense Center (CLDC), pursued a strategy of jury nullification by arguing that the victims of Antifa violence deserved it because they were connected to the US Capitol riot and are \"white supremacists.\" She also argued that Azar's actions were self-defense while she was on the alleged journalism assignment. Regan said that Azar maced the woman out of fear because a \"violent Proud Boy\" was standing next to the woman. She argued the woman had Azar's personal belongings but that claim was not corroborated.\n\nPolice body camera footage also captured Azar admitting to owning six riot shields that were brought to the direct action. Regan compared Antifa's militant activism akin to those who historically stood up against Nazism in Germany. A social media post from Alissa Azar Regan's Eugene-based nonprofit, the CLDC, infamously honored Eugene Antifa member Charlie Landeros after he was killed while carrying out a school shooting in 2019. The far-left group provides legal aid and counsel to violent far-left extremist suspects. The CLDC fashions itself as an Antifa group, even having one of its attorneys posing in propaganda.\n\nA Portland leftist charged over a serial knife attack on women was a supporter of Lauren Regan's CLDC Antifa group\n\nA CLDC attorney poses in Antifa propaganda Last year, TPM exclusively reported that Regan was photographed at a CLDC fundraiser with Portland leftist activist, Christopher Luchini, who has since been charged with carrying out a series of knife attacks targeting women.\n\nWho is Alissa Eleanor Azar?\n\nThe December 2021 indictment of Azar , a long-time regular at Antifa riots in Portland, sent shockwaves across Antifa cells and networks in the Pacific Northwest. Azar had been repeatedly arrested and charged at violent Antifa direct actions in Multnomah County, but was repeatedly not prosecuted.\n\nAlissa Azar was arrested at a violent Antifa riot in downtown Portland in March 2021. Photo: Portland Police Azar has risen to become one of the chief propagandists for the violent Antifa movement and maintains close ties with Rose City Antifa, a violent cell of Antifa in Portland. She claims to be a journalist and uses her social media following to help mainstream Antifa's message of political violence. For example, extremists who commit politically motivated attacks have fed responsibility claims to her for publication. Her extremism appears to be the reason Patreon pulled her account sometime in 2023, though Azar later publicized a second ban-evading account on the platform.\n\nUpdate: Following Azar's felony conviction, a Patreon spokesperson sent TPM a statement. \"While we do allow some creators to start new accounts following an account removal, they may not create an account focusing on the same violative works as their previous Patreon,\" the spokesperson wrote. Azar's last post was of content she made inside the Portland State Millar library while it was violently occupied and damaged in May. Azar has been charged with trespass over the incident. Azar's second Patreon account is now no longer active.\n\nVictims of Azar's violence have spoken to The Post Millennial about their frustration that she wasn't held accountable for her actions in Portland.\n\nAlissa Eleanor Azar In March 2021, Azar was charged with second-degree disorderly conduct and interfering with a peace officer at an Antifa riot in downtown Portland. Her case was dropped by Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt-in line with his 2020 policy of not prosecuting most leftist riot-related crimes.\n\nIn December 2022, she was charged with felony robbery, felony assault, tampering with physical evidence, theft and other serious crimes stemming from an attack on a citizen journalist in August 2022 in downtown Portland. Schmidt's prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss the case entirely in 2023.\n\nIn May 2024, she was charged over a pro-Hamas riot on the Portland State campus after far-left occupiers were evicted from a violent four-day occupation of the Millar Library that sustained over a million dollars in damage.\n\nAzar joins a long list of Antifa self-described journalists who have been accused or convicted of politically motivated violent crimes. In November 2022, Darrel Kimberlin , a secret Portland Antifa member who publicly identified as a \"gonzo journalist\" like Azar, became a convicted felon after pleading guilty to smashing up the Oregon Democrats headquarters and businesses in multiple attacks. DA Schmidt's office asked for no prison time as part of the sweetheart plea deal. In December last year, Renea Goddard , of Little Rock, Ark., was sentenced to federal prison over a 2020 firebombing attack on police. Goddard was a former journalist for a local NPR-affiliated station. Before Azar's involvement in militant Antifa extremism in Portland, she had a failed career in the entertainment industry. She has spoken about her family's Syrian background and her support of dictator and accused genocidaire Bashar al-Assad. She also previously posted about her concern that Jewish people in the \"entire industry\" might discriminate against her. Last October, Azar appeared to post in support of the Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel. \"Militant action is not for everyone, but it's how things get accomplished,\" she wrote on Oct. 7 in response to a post about Palestinians. Alissa Azar appears to justify the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attack in Israel Simultaneous to her involvement with Antifa in Portland, Azar has also grown a fanbase within that community for her sex work. She runs an OnlyFans account where she shows off nude photos of herself standing in front of Antifa print propaganda. In some of the photos, Azar dons a balaclava while brandishing an AR-15-style rifle. In November 2022, Azar lost custody of her only child after the boy's father told a family court that her involvement with Antifa and her sex work had created an unsafe environment for their child. A family court stripped Alissa Azar of shared custody of her only child The Defense's Star 'Expert' On the second day of the trial, the defense brought in its star witness: Shane Burley. Burley was presented as an expert on \"antifascism\" and the far-right. He has written two books and opinion articles in support of Antifa, including their use of political violence. Defense expert witness Shane Burley is a secret member of Rose City Antifa Burley testified that Antifa can be an organized group, but that it's rare. When asked about Rose City Antifa during cross-examination, he falsely said the group is \"not an organization.\" The prosecutor then pulled up Rose City Antifa's website, which has a section about queries for membership. The defense did not disclose to the court that Burley is a member of Rose City Antifa himself. In 2017, Burley was recorded in an undercover Project Veritas sting providing radicalization training to Rose City Antifa recruits. Another instructor was recorded telling the prospective members to gouge out the eyes of political opponents during fights. A Project Veritas sting revealed that Shane Burley was providing secret training to Rose City Antifa in 2017 During the cross-examination, prosecutor Cutino had Burley read from his own writings where he appeared to support militant pre-emptive confrontations and violent extremism. Burley struggled to answer the questions, prompting Judge Todd L. Van Rysselberghe to compel him to answer. When Cutino asked Burley if he believed in militant opposition to fascism, which was detailed in a book Burley authored titled, \"Why We Fight,\" Burley answered, \"Yes.\" In relation to the June 18 riot, Cutino asked Burley if Antifa's actions that day would have been an example of \"pushing fascists out of a public space,\" or \"militant antifascism.\" Looking flustered, Burley failed to provide a direct answer. The prosecutor asked if organizing could include distributing a flyer, which is what Azar did on June 18. Burley responded: \"Yes.\" Burley also testified that he considers himself to be part of Antifa and that violence is acceptable as long as it's for his cause of \"antifascism.\" He added that Antifa groups would \"broadly benefit by being more comfortable with guns.\" Following Burley's testimony on Friday, the defense canceled calling any more of its witnesses, which included at least three other Antifa affiliates. Alissa Azar Testifies On Monday, the third day of the trial, Azar took the stand. She cried at one point and denied that she had ever been involved in \"militant antifascism.\" This created an opportunity for the prosecutor to enter evidence revealing otherwise, such as her violent extremist posts and criminal history at Antifa events in Multnomah County. Alissa Azar was arraigned in 2022 in Multnomah County She testified that she was acting solely as a journalist on the day of the June 18 riot, but evidence shown by Cutino during cross-examination revealed she assisted in organizing Antifa's counter-direct action and participated in it. Antifa members and supporters of Alissa Azar wore masks in court and harassed journalists. Photo: Chelly Bouferrache During cross-examination, prosecutor Cutino presented to the court social media posts by Azar showing her promoting violent extremism. (Azar locked down her X account during the course of her trial.) Azar admitted that she felt it is a necessity to \"use violence\" and that \"disrupting fascist organizing is a positive thing.\" The prosecutor noted to the court that Azar fits well within the description of \"militant antifascism\" according to the defense's Antifa expert witness. He referenced Burley's testimony about Antifa's goal of \"occupying spaces\" through violent direct actions and asked Azar if she agreed with it. Azar answered, \"Yes.\" Alissa Azar hides her face after leaving court with her entourage following the guilty verdict. Photo: Chelly Bouferrache Azar testified that violence is permissible against any group whose political beliefs \"antifascists\" disagree with. Cutino then asked Azar, \"What does violence mean to you?\" She answered: \"I don't think defense of community members is violence.\" Azar's social media posts over the years indicate she views evangelical Christians, women activists who are critical of trans ideology, and Donald Trump supporters as \"fascists.\" Jurors were shown Azar's March 31, 2024 post on social media platform Mastodon, ahead of a Christian worship event in downtown Portland, in which she described the Christians as \"bloodthirsty\" and urged her comrades to reconnect with one another and organize a response. \"Fascists should always be confronted and prevented from organizing, recruiting, and spreading hate,\" Azar wrote. Rose City Antifa, a group whose direct actions Azar promotes, violently attacked a Christian worship event in downtown Portland in 2021 and has proceeded to disrupt similar annual events with violence since. Children and families were hurt in the summer 2021 waterfront attack. Another example shown to the jury included Azar discussing an upcoming Portland Antifa recruitment event called \"Fash Free Fest,\" where she celebrated her comrades' acts of political violence. \"Some of these events got insanely brutal but people continued to defend our community by any means necessary,\" wrote Azar. \"The refusal to back down regardless of how intense things got by antifascists has resulted in the violent fascists to virtually f-k off and leave Portland.\" Azar admitted to being part of the Antifa movement but stopped short of admitting to being part of an Antifa cell. Over the years, Azar has interacted closely with Rose City Antifa on social media. Under questioning, she conceded her postings and writings are \"biased\" because she is a radical leftist. The prosecutor presented evidence that even before the June 2021 riot, Azar had attended and promoted violent actions carried out by Antifa against a group of conservative flag-wavers in Clackamas County, and that group did not include members of the Proud Boys. Police witnesses had earlier testified that the flag-wavers were non-violent and had no involvement with the Proud Boys or other extremist groups. Azar posted from the scene of the surprise attack, showing Antifa vandalizing the public space with animal organs, blood, urine, oil and feces. In closing arguments on Tuesday, Cutino stated that Azar is actively involved in Antifa, and the Clackamette Park riot that endangered the public would never have happened if Antifa didn't show up to disrupt and attack the permitted event. He said that Azar's self-identity as a \"journalist\" was irrelevant in this case because she committed criminal acts. Alissa Azar was captured in 2021 CCTV footage meeting with violent Antifa rioters in downtown Portland following an assault on journalist Andy Ngo The prosecutor argued that many other journalists were standing off to the side, and they did not take any violent action during that event. \"Ms. Azar's actions were violent,\" Cutino said. \"They [Antifa and Azar] were all working together.\" Cutino also told the court that suspects from the right-wing side accused of rioting are also being prosecuted by the county. One accused Proud Boy suspect has a trial in the county scheduled in November.

Photo: Chelly Bouferrache\n\nDuring cross-examination, prosecutor Cutino presented to the court social media posts by Azar showing her promoting violent extremism. (Azar locked down her X account during the course of her trial.) Azar admitted that she felt it is a necessity to \"use violence\" and that \"disrupting fascist organizing is a positive thing.\" The prosecutor noted to the court that Azar fits well within the description of \"militant antifascism\" according to the defense's Antifa expert witness. He referenced Burley's testimony about Antifa's goal of \"occupying spaces\" through violent direct actions and asked Azar if she agreed with it. Azar answered, \"Yes.\"\n\nAlissa Azar hides her face after leaving court with her entourage following the guilty verdict. Photo: Chelly Bouferrache\n\nAzar testified that violence is permissible against any group whose political beliefs \"antifascists\" disagree with. Cutino then asked Azar, \"What does violence mean to you?\" She answered: \"I don't think defense of community members is violence.\"\n\nAzar's social media posts over the years indicate she views evangelical Christians, women activists who are critical of trans ideology, and Donald Trump supporters as \"fascists.\" Jurors were shown Azar's March 31, 2024 post on social media platform Mastodon, ahead of a Christian worship event in downtown Portland, in which she described the Christians as \"bloodthirsty\" and urged her comrades to reconnect with one another and organize a response. \"Fascists should always be confronted and prevented from organizing, recruiting, and spreading hate,\" Azar wrote.\n\nRose City Antifa, a group whose direct actions Azar promotes, violently attacked a Christian worship event in downtown Portland in 2021 and has proceeded to disrupt similar annual events with violence since. Children and families were hurt in the summer 2021 waterfront attack.\n\nAnother example shown to the jury included Azar discussing an upcoming Portland Antifa recruitment event called \"Fash Free Fest,\" where she celebrated her comrades' acts of political violence.\n\n\"Some of these events got insanely brutal but people continued to defend our community by any means necessary,\" wrote Azar. \"The refusal to back down regardless of how intense things got by antifascists has resulted in the violent fascists to virtually f-k off and leave Portland.\"\n\nAzar admitted to being part of the Antifa movement but stopped short of admitting to being part of an Antifa cell. Over the years, Azar has interacted closely with Rose City Antifa on social media. Under questioning, she conceded her postings and writings are \"biased\" because she is a radical leftist. The prosecutor presented evidence that even before the June 2021 riot, Azar had attended and promoted violent actions carried out by Antifa against a group of conservative flag-wavers in Clackamas County, and that group did not include members of the Proud Boys.\n\nPolice witnesses had earlier testified that the flag-wavers were non-violent and had no involvement with the Proud Boys or other extremist groups. Azar posted from the scene of the surprise attack, showing Antifa vandalizing the public space with animal organs, blood, urine, oil and feces.\n\nIn closing arguments on Tuesday, Cutino stated that Azar is actively involved in Antifa, and the Clackamette Park riot that endangered the public would never have happened if Antifa didn't show up to disrupt and attack the permitted event. He said that Azar's self-identity as a \"journalist\" was irrelevant in this case because she committed criminal acts. Alissa Azar was captured in 2021 CCTV footage meeting with violent Antifa rioters in downtown Portland following an assault on journalist Andy Ngo The prosecutor argued that many other journalists were standing off to the side, and they did not take any violent action during that event. \"Ms. Azar's actions were violent,\" Cutino said. \"They [Antifa and Azar] were all working together.\" Cutino also told the court that suspects from the right-wing side accused of rioting are also being prosecuted by the county. One accused Proud Boy suspect has a trial in the county scheduled in November. Defense attorney Lauren Regan argued that there is an immediate moral obligation to stand up against the far-right as a result of the riot at the US Capitol, including through the use of militant means. She likened the act of Antifa combating the Proud Boys to people who historically opposed Nazi Germany. Regan admitted that her client is not a typical journalist, but one that throws herself into dangerous situations for the story. Regan said Azar's actions at the park were self-defense measures. What's Next? The conclusion of the five-day trial wrapped up a tense security challenge for sheriff's deputies at the courthouse. On the second day of trial, TPM reporter Katie Daviscourt was assaulted by an Antifa associate of Azar. The Post Millennial was in attendance every day of the trial, beginning with jury selection. An unidentified woman repeatedly hit Daviscourt with a door, forcing officers to respond. The pink-haired woman who initiated the conflict had earlier met with Azar outside the courthouse. Before, during and after the trial, multiple Antifa accounts called for comrades to surge to the courthouse to support Azar. Antifa members stood outside the Clackamas County courthouse and stared at people and jurors as they walked out.

Tracy Molina, a woman associated with Azar through prior violent Portland Antifa direct actions, was chastised by the judge on the first day for using her mobile device. Molina was warned she could be held in contempt of court for violating his order.

      "text": "BREAKING: Fort Worth jury convicts Texas Antifa member Meghan Grant over violent attack outside children's drag show\n\nMeghan Grant, 39, of Dallas, was found guilty by a jury on Wednesday of resisting arrest and interfering with public duties.\n\nMeghan Grant, 39, of Dallas, was found guilty by a jury on Wednesday of resisting arrest and interfering with public duties.\n\nA Texas jury has convicted a violent Dallas Antifa member over her role in an attack outside a children's drag event in Fort Worth in April 2023. Meghan Grant, 39 (b. June 13, 1985), of Dallas, was found guilty by a jury on Wednesday of resisting arrest and interfering with public duties following a three-day criminal trial in Tarrant County, Texas. The judge sentenced Grant to one-year probation and a 180-day suspended jail sentence over the two misdemeanor charges. The conviction stems from an organized attack carried out by the anarchist group against protesters praying outside an all-ages \"family-friendly\" drag show at Fort Brewery and Pizza on April 23, 2023, in Fort Worth, Texas. Grant, who identifies as trans nonbinary, is a member of the terror-linked Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club, an Antifa militia whose members are frequently heavily armed at riots and protests. Grant arrived at the direct action organized by the EFJBGC, reportedly ready to kill. She was armed with a Smith & Wesson 9 mm handgun with a mounted Crimson Trace red dot sight when her militant group, decked out in tactical gear, helmets, and concealing their identities behind black bloc attire, launched an unprovoked attack on peaceful Christian protesters. The anarchists rushed in to pepper spray the protesters who had been quietly praying outside the restaurant, court documents allege. Dallas Antifa associate Meghan Grant, a member of the Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club, uses a deceptive photo of herself to ask for support According to a press release from the Fort Worth Police Department at the time, officers observing the protest witnessed the unprovoked attack and rushed in to make targeted arrests. Grant was accused of charging past officers multiple times to gain access to two individuals who police had arrested for alleged acts of violence. Police were attacked by the anarchists when officers responded to the scene. \"A FWPD officer attempted to stop Grant by pushing her back toward the sidewalk; however, Grant did not comply and was taken into custody,\" the press release said. The two individuals who Grant tried to de-arrest received felony charges over the attack. They are also members of the North Texas terror-linked Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club. Samuel Fowlkes, 21, of Parker County, was charged with assault on a peace officer, four counts of assault causing bodily injury, evading arrest/detention, and resisting arrest. He has an upcoming trial in Tarrant County. Christopher Guillott, 34, of Denton County, was charged with assault on a peace officer and interfering with public duties. Guillott was acquitted on all charges in August following a jury trial. Defendant Meghan Grant was booked into the Tarrant County Jail in April 2023 Shortly after the guilty verdict, Grant wrote on social media that she planned to appeal the conviction and asked for people to donate to her legal fees via Venmo and CashApp. She added a comment she claims was made by her attorney, mocking the charges: \"I mean, what kind of anarchist are you if you *don't* have resisting arrest?\"\n\nPayPal, which owns Venmo, has been reached for comment. Meghan Grant issued a request for court support using a heavily filtered and edited photograph of herself. This is not the end of Grant's legal woes. The victims of the Antifa attack filed a civil lawsuit against her and her comrades. In December 2023, a judge rejected Grant's appeal against a prior ruling, finding that the case had merit to proceed. Justice Dana Womack of the Texas Second District Court of Appeals concluded that the court had made the legally correct decision by not dismissing the lawsuit.

      "text": "Seattle Police arrest Antifa militants at 'Abolish ICE' direct action\n\nOne trans adult was taken into custody on assault charges, while another juvenile female was apprehended for obstructing police.\n\nOne trans adult was taken into custody on assault charges, while another juvenile female was apprehended for obstructing police.\n\nOn Saturday, the Seattle Police arrested two individuals associated with Antifa during a direct action advocating for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ). One trans adult was taken into custody on assault charges, while another juvenile female was apprehended for obstructing police, authorities said. The incident occurred around 4:30 pm at Alki Beach Park in West Seattle, where hundreds of demonstrators had gathered to \"Protest Against ICE\" in response to President Donald Trump's nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration following years of open border policies under the Biden administration. Janelle Gipaya Howard, 32, of Bellingham, was arrested and booked into King County Jail on assault charges. According to Seattle Police Detective Brian Pritchard, Howard allegedly assaulted another protester in front of officers. The defendant, who has a history of violence stemming from their involvement with Antifa , was released from custody the following day on $1,000 bail, jail records show. Seattle Police confirmed Howard as the suspect to The Post Millennial. The militant's identity was concealed behind a facial covering at the time of the attack. Video footage shows Seattle police officers performed a targeted arrest to take Howard into custody. Janelle Howard was arrested on criminal charges during an Antifa direct action to attack the police union building in September 2020. Molotov cocktails were brought to the demonstration by members of the group. The victim, identified as Bennett Haselton, wrote about the incident on X, saying he was \"shoved to the ground\" by Howard after 37-year-old Antifa militant, Christina Devitt, ordered him to be attacked. Haselton has been assaulted several times by Antifa members at demonstrations throughout the years in the Pacific Northwest due to his opposition to the left-wing extremist group hijacking protests to carry out criminal acts of violence. Additionally, Devitt, who has past ties to the MS-13 gang , has a history of arrests related to her activism with Antifa. She is currently the suspect in an assault that occurred in January, targeting individuals of the Jewish faith and an independent videographer. The other individual arrested has been identified only as a juvenile female. Seattle Police said that the suspect, who was dressed in Antifa's black bloc militant uniform, \"stood in front of a patrol vehicle that had lights activated to prevent it from moving.\" The individual was taken into custody and released to a parent, according to police . Authorities rushed in to make the targeted arrests roughly two hours into the \"Abolish ICE\" demonstration, which kicked off with music and speeches at the park before the group began its march to the pier, according to the Seattle Times. The protest was flooded with Mexican flags and pro-immigrant anti-ICE signage, photos show. It appears that only city police were present at the demonstration. The crowd temporarily blocked traffic on Alki Avenue to face off with police following the two arrests. In a livestream recorded by Devitt, the militant could be heard hurling verbal abuse at police during the short standoff. After officers left the scene, the crowd continued its march and later dispersed, per the paper. This was the second demonstration in a week in the same location. On February 2, the demonstration became chaotic after a car caught fire. Video footage shows the group chanting \"f*ck the police\" and \"f*ck ICE\" while waving Mexican flags in the air. The protest appeared to have a family-friendly atmosphere before agitators infiltrated the group, including Antifa. Seattle is one of several jurisdictions targeted by the Department of Justice for being a so-called \"sanctuary\" for illegal migrants. Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered DOJ prosecutors in a memo last week to investigate sanctuary jurisdictions that may be impeding federal immigration operations. King County (Seattle) sued the Trump administration on Friday, along with other sanctuary jurisdictions, alleging states' rights violations and illicit commandeering of local law enforcement.\n\nSince Trump reentered the White House on January 20, ICE ERO Seattle has made a series of arrests , capturing the \"worst of the worst\" illegal immigrants with criminal records across the Pacific Northwest as part of Trump's mass deportation operations. Some of the individuals arrested have been convicted of child rape, lewd acts with a minor, sexual assault, sexual battery, assault with sexual motivation, assault with a deadly weapon, theft, DUI, reckless driving, illicit drug manufacturing, and the list goes on . ICE said members of the public can report immigration crimes or suspicious activity by dialing 866-347-2423 or completing the online tip form .\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

Alissa Azar is the first Antifa member to be convicted at trial in Oregon.\n\nA violent Antifa \"ringleader\" who became the chief propagandist for the movement in Portland has been sentenced to 14 days in jail following a jury conviction for felony rioting and other crimes in Clackamas County. Alissa Azar is the first Antifa member to be convicted at trial in Oregon.\n\nAn Oregon judge has sentenced a violent Portland Antifa ringleader to jail time and probation following a trial last month . A jury of mostly women convicted Alissa Eleanor Azar, 33 (b. Feb. 12, 1991), of felony riot and disorderly conduct on Aug. 14 following a five-day criminal trial at the Clackamas County Courthouse in Oregon City. Azar, who became a self-styled chief propagandist for Antifa in the Portland area, was sentenced on Monday afternoon by Judge Todd L. Van Rysselberghe for the 5th Judicial District Circuit Court of Oregon. He sentenced her to 14 days in a local jail, followed by 36 months of supervised probation and GPS monitoring. This is over her criminal role in a 2021 riot against the Proud Boys at a community park. \"Azar misused a park to clash with fascists, placing innocent people at risk,\" Judge Van Rysselberghe said before handing down his sentence. \"Azar continued to deny being a participant in the riot and acknowledged only that she played a minor role in the incident. Like the Proud Boys, Ms. Azar demonstrated no empathy for the innocent people who were at the park on June 18, 2021.\"\n\nAzar was immediately cuffed and taken into custody while her masked supporters in the public gallery shouted, \"We love you.\" She will serve her short custodial sentence at the Clackamas County Jail.

Photo: Clackamas County Sheriff's Office\n\nClackamas County Deputy District Attorney Josh Cutino had asked the judge for a 30-day jail sentence, which was the maximum recommendation based on the state's sentencing guidelines . The jail stint, he said, would accompany 36 months of supervised probation that includes harsh restrictions, such as cooperating with GPS monitoring when deemed necessary by the probation officer. \"She [Azar] played a lead role in amplifying, promoting and organizing a violent brawl in a public park,\" Cutino argued. \"She admitted that she would do it again and the message from our community should be clear that violence of this sort should not be tolerated.\" Cutino explained to the judge that the county jail was at full capacity at the time of sentencing, but he had contacted Clackamas County jail commander Capt. Lee Eby to make special arrangements for Azar to be booked. The jail granted the prosecutor's request and told Cutino a cell would be made available to Azar for the duration of her sentence. The prosecutor argued, citing state law, that \"court sentences are given priority for space\" in jail, ensuring Judge Van Rysselberghe that Azar could be booked regardless of whether the facility was full.\n\nSince rioting in June 2021 in Clackamas County, Azar has been repeatedly arrested in Portland at violent Antifa direct actions. She currently has an open case for her involvement in the May 2024 violent pro-Gaza occupation at Portland State University. A separate indictment for a felony robbery case in Portland was dismissed in October 2023. Cutino said at sentencing that Azar was ordered to complete a restorative justice program for an unrelated case but didn't bother to complete it. This, he argued, demonstrates her reckless disregard for accountability. Clackamas County Deputy District Attorney Josh Cutino argues to the court that Azar should receive the maximum sentence. Photo: Chelly Bouferrache The courtroom was filled with many Antifa supporters of Azar. Most of them hid their identities by wearing masks, sunglasses and scarves. Azar's defense, headed by Lauren Regan, an Antifa activist attorney for the far-left Civil Liberties Defense Center (CLDC), told the court Azar's felony conviction should be downgraded to a misdemeanor and that she should get no jail time. \"She does not intend to give up her career in journalism,\" Regan said. She then argued that judicial systemic racism would unfairly impact Azar. \"Widespread racial and gender disparities exist in our courts. Azar is a woman of color and is Middle Eastern.\" Patreon and Venmo appear to have disagreed with allowing Azar to continue using their platforms for fundraising for her \"gonzo journalism,\" which the prosecution showed at trial was a front for violent criminal activities. Following Azar's conviction, both platforms suspended her. Alissa Azar and her far-left activist attorney, Lauren Regan. Photo: Chelly Bouferrache\n\nAhead of sentencing, Regan wrote to the court that it should ban this publication and its reporters because of \"false and inflammatory posts seeking to incite others to physically attack or kill her [Azar] and her family.\" The judge didn't buy it, and our reporters were in court. Additionally, The Post Millennial stands by our reporting on Azar and her trial. We have received no requests for corrections from Azar or Regan.\n\nAhead of sentencing, Alissa Azar's attorney, Lauren Regan, lobbied the court to ban reporting by The Post Millennial\n\nBackground\n\nAzar's conviction stems from her violent role in an Antifa riot in Oregon City on June 18, 2021. Azar claimed to be an \"independent journalist\" there to document a protest against the Proud Boys, but the court saw and heard evidence of her role in the violent conspiracy. She was captured on key video evidence launching a chemical attack on an unidentified woman in the park, and admitting to police to owning several riot shields that were brought to the attack. Additionally, Oregon City police testified that they found bombs at the park.\n\nThe 2021 event Antifa organized to attack was a voter registration and flag wave event hosted by Daniel Tooze, a former Republican candidate for the state House of Representatives who is also an associate of the right-wing Proud Boys group. The far-left extremists arrived in their black bloc uniform with melee weapons, supplies, canisters of mace, and other equipment to occupy a park pavilion that was permitted to be used by Tooze. Brawling broke out between Antifa militants and the Proud Boys, resulting in police declaring a riot. In addition to Azar, two Proud Boy affiliates, Gordon Cronk and Tommy Campbell, were indicted on felony riot charges. Their cases are ongoing and the court has issued arrest warrants. A third Proud Boy associate, Barry Johnson, has a trial set for Nov. 12. The Trial During the trial, prosecutor Cutino presented evidence to the jury that characterized Azar as a ringleader and organizer inside Antifa who actively participates in the group's violent direct actions, undermining her self-identity as a journalist. Evidence submitted to the court included a surfeit of Azar's social media posts, including a post where she issued a call to action to shut down the event at Clackamette Park that she later went to attack. Azar's defense argued she was on a journalism assignment. During cross-examination, Azar testified she would continue her extremist involvement with Antifa. Cutino told the jury that Azar's admission to continue with acts of violence raises significant public safety concerns. Alissa Azar's defense tried repeatedly to get the judge to block the prosecution from entering videos of Azar as evidence. Video stills: News2Share Azar testified that violence is permissible against any group whose political beliefs \"antifascists\" disagree with. Cutino then asked Azar: \"What does violence mean to you?\" She answered: \"I don't think defense of community members is violence.\" The Antifa movement, which is made up of many decentralized groups and cells, accuses any of their opposition, including conservatives, liberals, Christians, pro-Israel Jewish people and women rights campaigners, of being \"fascists\" who must be silenced through the use of violence and intimidation. Several members of the Antifa movement in the Portland area have been convicted of violent crimes, including attempted murder and a bombing , stemming from rioting since 2020. The jury in Azar's trial comprised 10 women and two men. They convicted Azar on two of the three charges: felony riot and misdemeanor disorderly conduct. The third charge, unlawful use of mace, resulted in a hung jury. The state filed not to retry that charge. The judge sealed the jury roll to protect the identities of the jurors due to fears of retribution from Antifa. Who is Alissa Eleanor Azar? The December 2021 indictment of Azar , a long-time regular at Antifa riots in Portland for years, sent shockwaves across Antifa cells and networks in the Pacific Northwest who felt invincible after few were prosecuted in Multnomah County, where Portland is. Azar had been repeatedly arrested and charged at violent Antifa direct actions in Multnomah County, but was repeatedly not prosecuted. Until she came to neighboring Clackamas County. Clackamas County is a politically moderate county adjacent to Multnomah County, a left-wing stronghold. It has both suburban and rural communities. Alissa Azar at a pre-trial court hearing in August 2024. Photo: Chelly Bouferrache Azar had risen to become one of the chief propagandists for the violent Antifa movement and maintains close ties with Rose City Antifa, a violent cell of Antifa in Portland. She claims to be a journalist and uses her social media following to help mainstream Antifa's message of political violence. For example, extremists who commit politically motivated attacks have fed responsibility claims to her for publication. Her extremism appears to be the reason Patreon pulled her account sometime in 2023. However, Azar later created a second ban-evading account on the platform, which was also banned following her conviction. Her work is also financed in part by her online sex work, which heavily mixes Antifa propaganda along with pornography. Alissa Azar was arrested at a violent Antifa riot in downtown Portland in March 2021. Photo: Portland Police Victims of Azar's violence have spoken to TPM about their frustration that she wasn't held accountable for her actions in Portland. In March 2021, Azar was charged with second-degree disorderly conduct and interfering with a peace officer at an Antifa riot in downtown Portland. Her case was dropped by Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt-in line with his 2020 policy of not prosecuting most leftist riot-related crimes. Alissa Azar was arraigned in 2022 in Multnomah County over other alleged violent crimes related to Antifa In December 2022, she was charged with felony robbery, felony assault, tampering with physical evidence, theft and other serious crimes stemming from an attack on a citizen journalist in August 2022 in downtown Portland. Schmidt's prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss the case entirely in 2023. In May 2024, she was charged over a pro-Hamas riot on the Portland State campus after far-left occupiers were evicted from a violent four-day occupation of the Millar Library that sustained over a million dollars in damage. Azar joins a long list of Antifa self-described journalists who have been accused or convicted of politically motivated violent crimes. In November 2022, Darrel Kimberlin , a secret Portland Antifa member who publicly identified as a \"gonzo journalist\" like Azar, became a convicted felon after pleading guilty to smashing up the Oregon Democrats headquarters and businesses in multiple attacks. DA Schmidt's office asked for no prison time as part of the sweetheart plea deal. In December last year, Renea Goddard , of Little Rock, Ark., was sentenced to federal prison over a 2020 firebombing attack on police. Goddard was a former journalist for a local NPR-affiliated station. Before Azar's involvement in militant Antifa extremism in Portland, she had a failed career in the entertainment industry. She has spoken about her family's Syrian background and her support of dictator and accused genocidaire Bashar al-Assad. She also previously posted about her concern that Jewish people in the \"entire industry\" might discriminate against her. Last October, Azar appeared to post in support of the Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel. \"Militant action is not for everyone, but it's how things get accomplished,\" she wrote on Oct. 7 in response to a post about Palestinians. Alissa Azar appears to justify the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack in Israel Simultaneous to her involvement with Antifa in Portland, Azar has also grown a fanbase within that community for her sex work. She runs an OnlyFans account where she shows off nude photos of herself standing in front of Antifa print propaganda. In some of the photos, Azar dons a balaclava while brandishing an AR-15-style rifle. In November 2022, Azar lost custody of her only child after the boy's father told a family court that her involvement with Antifa and her sex work had created an unsafe environment for their child. Antifa members stood outside the Clackamas County courthouse and stared at people and jurors as they walked out. Photos: Chelly Bouferrache Online reactions by Portland Antifa associates show them condemning the sentence. \"[A] small woman acted in self defense against a violent mob of far right extremists,\" far-left Portland radical Ronald Bernard Hickey wrote under an alias . \"ALWAYS RESIST FASCIST VIOLENCE. the [sic] courts are a right wing tool of political violence.\" More Violence Violence appears to regularly follow Azar. Outside of the courthouse at her trial last month, Antifa supporters of Azar nearly rioted. John Hacker , an Antifa member who also self-identifies as a journalist, was observed beating and bloodying a man to the ground. He was arrested by sheriff's deputies and was booked into the Clackamas County jail on a fourth-degree assault charge. He has pleaded not guilty and has an October court date. When Azar's guilt was read out in the courtroom at her trial, she burst into tears. Some of her masked friends also cried. However, she did not visibly respond when she was cuffed at sentencing on Monday. She grinned as she was walked out of the courtroom by a deputy. And similar to the violent attack last month by an associate of Azar, a woman who attended the sentencing in support of Azar was also arrested following a violent incident outside the courthouse involving a videographer. Update Sept. 10, 2024: Oregon City Police Capt. David Edwins told TPM that \"officers arrested 26-year-old Natalia Goudvis related to a disturbance that occurred near the courthouse.\" Natalia Leah Goudvis, originally from Massachusetts, was arrested on suspicion of harassment and second-degree disorderly conduct. She was released from jail on the same day on own recognizance. Natalia Leah Goudvis, Alissa Azar's friend, was arrested over a violent attack outside the Clackamas County courthouse following sentencing Goudvis has a long history of far-left activism in Portland. Her social media links to resources about Palestinian militancy, rioting and making homemade abortion pills.

The prosecutor suggested this move was \"gamesmanship\" in an attempt to further delay the jury trial for a case stemming from a violent Antifa riot more than three years ago. Background\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2021, roving mobs of black-clad So Cal Antifa members attacked supporters of Donald Trump and people walking on the boardwalk at Pacific Beach in San Diego County. Eleven people, about half from Los Angeles, were indicted in 2022 by a secret grand jury on a total of 29 felonies, including conspiracy to riot, assault and other violent crimes. Prosecutors alleged the defendants engaged in a coordinated plan to assault people with weapons.\n\nDA Stephan's prosecution is the first time Antifa rioters had been charged with a conspiracy in the U.S. Since then, the Attorney General in Georgia charged 61 Antifa-linked extremists with domestic terrorism , money laundering and other crimes for their alleged role in the \"Stop Cop City\" terrorist attacks. Not guilty by reason of insanity?\n\nIn reaction to Jeremy Jonathan White's insanity claim, Judge Daniel B. Goldstein noted that a plea of \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" is normally expected at arraignment, which would have been years ago when he first appeared in court. But the judge commented on the difficulty of denying an insanity plea and noted that it can be entered even as late as during trial if there is \"good cause.\"\n\nThe judge offered a compromise: White's guilt would be determined in the first jury trial, and if he is found guilty, there would be a second trial with a new jury to determine his sanity. Goldstein then spoke directly to the defendant and told him that if the jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity, he could be kept against his will in a mental hospital for \"the rest of your life.\"\n\nWhite's attorney suggested that his client's new insanity plea might be withdrawn at a later date, depending on what a mental health expert determines. White also submitted a report to the court written by a psychologist hired by him who defended his use going to the attack with riot gear and a weapon (bear spray).\n\nDr. Martin Williams wrote: \"In my professional opinion, the 'suit of armor,' Mr. White's carrying bear spray, as well as Mr. White's role of protecting others as a medic was a manifestation of Mr. White's PTSD.\" The psychologist said that any imprisonment would be \"life-threatening\" due to White's history of domestic abuse and depression.\n\nThe prosecution's suggestion that the insanity claim is an attempt to play the court may be backed by a prior failed last-ditch effort by White's attorney to get the case thrown out of San Diego County. Curtis Briggs, of Oakland, filed a motion in October 2023 to move the case to the California Attorney General's office, where he hoped the Democrat prosecutor would dismiss the entire case. Judge Goldstein rejected the motion for lack of merit.\n\nThough claiming to be insane, White is engaging in a media blitz with left-wing outlets, including It's Going Down . IGD is a propaganda site for Antifa extremists. In 2020, the site published a claim of responsibility for an attempted train derailment in Washington state that led to federal terrorism convictions. It also published posts telling readers to commit violent crimes and acts of vandalism. IGD was banned on Twitter, now X, for violent extremism.\n\nIn a separate interview on the Pod Damn America leftist podcast, White repeatedly slammed DA Summer Stephan, accusing her of being a \"right-wing Trump-supporting anti-antifa person.\" He claimed: \"So a Nazi went to the DA and demanded a case be built-and that's where all this came from...They're charging us with conspiracy, but I think the real conspiracy is the DA's case with these white supremacists - going after just leftists.\"\n\nWhite is also the beneficiary of a GoFundMe campaign which claims he is a \"human rights activist\" in need of financial support. GoFundMe's policies state that one is not allowed to fundraise for the legal defense of violent criminal suspects. As of Tuesday evening, White's campaign raised over $3,000. GoFundMe has been reached for comment. Update: GoFundMe told The Post Millennial the campaign violated its policies and had been removed. In response, Antifa accounts blame this reporting and opened up a fundraiser campaign on GiveButter, a similar crowdfunding site and accused the prosecutor, without evidence, of having \"cozy connections with white supremacist groups.\"\n\nA GoFundMe campaign for Jeremy White misleads donors about his trial and circumvents the platform's ban on fundraising for violent criminal suspects Ninth Antifa defendant pleads guilty at start of trial\n\nThough White's counsel took up most of the pre-trial motions, there remain two other co-defendants on trial. Luis Francisco Mora, 32, took a last-minute plea deal and admitted to the charge of conspiracy to commit a crime and assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury.\n\nMora, of Los Angeles, is expected to be sentenced to two years and eight months in California state prison on June 12. In pleading guilty, Mora admitted being part of the Antifa conspiracy to riot, and that he came to San Diego with his co-conspirators from Los Angeles to participate in violence.\n\nMora further admitted he was armed with a tear gas weapon and that he was part of a mob attack on victim \"E.H.,\" and that he attempted to punch victim \"J.C.,\" who identified himself previously to TPM as a photojournalist. Mora admitted being part of the group that attacked a middle-aged woman, identified as \"M.A.\", who was beaten and maced to the ground.\n\nThe third and final Antifa defendant on trial is Brian Cortez Lightfoot Jr. The 27-year-old continues to plead not-guilty to 16 felonies, the most charges of any remaining defendant. Prosecutors have alleged that Lightfoot was one of the ring leaders during the two-hours-long violence on the beach boardwalk that afternoon three years ago. Last year, his San Francisco pro-bono far-left attorney, John Hamasaki, tried and failed to get TPM's reporter Eva Knott banned from photographing and reporting on this case. The judge denied his motion.\n\nEight other Antifa co-defendants have already been convicted: Alexander Akridge-Jacobs , 33, Jesse Merel Cannon , 33, Joseph Austin Gaskins , 23, Christian Martinez, 25, Samuel Howard Ogden, 26, Bryan Rivera, 22, Faraz Martin Talab , 29, and Erich Yach , 40. (Gaskins was the only one who did not admit being part of the Antifa conspiracy to riot.)\n\nOne defendant, violent trans activist Erich \"Nikki\" Yach was taken into custody and held because he had multiple active felony cases when he committed new crimes during the Antifa riot. Yach was the first to be convicted in September 2022, and he was sentenced to nearly five years in state prison. He is eligible for early release as soon as this April 1.\n\nLast month, co-defendant Jesse Merel Cannon was sentenced to two years for the 2021 Antifa riot case, plus three more years for a separate violent felony assault case that was included in his plea deal. While out on bail on separate violent charges, Cannon assaulted a woman and a child at the Antifa riot on January 2021, leading to the sentencing enhancement.\n\nPre-trial motions are ongoing and jury selection is expected to begin on March 25.\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.
