      "text": "The Truth About Advertising: Selling the White WomanTM\n\nHank Willis Thomas's work examines the ways in which advertising has fabricated notions of gender and race, and then convinced us all to buy into them. \"I always talk about racism as the most successful advertising campaign of all time,\" Thomas says. His work serves as a sort of counter-campaign; one that aims to muddy the myths we've been marketed. \"I want to complicate the way that I'm seen and the way that I look at other people.\"\n\nHis latest exhibition is Unbranded: A Century of White Women, 1915-2015 , in New York. It follows Unbranded: Reflections in Black by Corporate America, 1968-2000, his 2007 exhibition that surveyed the branding of blackness. A Century of White Women examines how advertising has helped construct gender ideals over the last 100 years. If racism is the most successful advertising campaign of all time, then sexism, as the work illustrates, isn't far behind.\n\nThomas's work \"unbrands\" advertising: stripping away the commercial context, and leaving the exposed image to speak for itself. Without the text and taglines we would normally lean on to decipher the adverts, we are forced to read between the lines and think more deeply about what the images are actually selling - which, you begin to see, is an ideal of femininity encapsulated in AdLand's \"white woman\". While the specific product attributes of White WomanTM have diversified over time, there are certain characteristics a number of the images reinforce. So if you were to write new, more accurate, taglines for the ads, they might look something like this:\n\nA lot of the ads in the exhibition show women with their husbands, or their daughters, or their lovers. But there isn't a single ad that shows female friends together, enjoying each other's company while fully clothed. When groups of women are pictured together, they tend to be in bikinis and looking at the imaginary man behind the camera, not at each other. Indeed, women are often seen as a source of competition, not companionship. This is communicated with no great subtlety in an ad from 1960, which shows a coven of crouching, conservatively-dressed women, literally green with envy, pointing a cannon at a woman who is posing for the camera in her underwear.\n\n100% less black than black women\n\nMany of the earlier ads show white women attended by black servants; a large part of whiteness, these images imply, is being in a position of power over black people. As blatant racism gets less socially acceptable, the message becomes coded. An ad from 1974 shows a spectrum of female faces going from black at the bottom to white at the top: a hierarchy in which blacker is definitely not meant to be better. Female beauty means white female beauty. Darker bodies can be exotic, they can be erotic, but they are always \"other\". Thankfully, things are slowly changing and the whitewashing of beauty standards is on the wane. As Thomas notes, through \"the rise in appreciation to a large degree of Michelle Obama, the Williams sisters, BeyoncÃ© ... people have to face black women in a very different way.\" This shift is dramatised in a 2010 ad, where a white woman kneels in front of Serena Williams, offering up a gift. (It turns out to be a box of Tampax, but you know, it's the thought that counts.)\n\nIt's cool you have a job, but you still don't have a penis\n\nBetween 1915-2015, the role of women in society changed dramatically, and you can track the cultural developments in the adverts' visual shifts. In 1920, American women got the right to vote and suddenly they are pictured in ads driving cars. In the 40s, they are dressed as soldiers. Soon there are career women, working mothers, even lesbians! But as women become more empowered, advertising (largely the domain, even today, of white men) seems to punish them for it. Violence and objectification creep into the imagery; this is particularly evident in the 1960s where many of the ads show women decapitated, bruised, caged, or being pulled apart by men. You can count your freedoms, the images seem to say, but the sum of a woman still boils down to ageing skin and sexual orifices. This is perhaps best dramatised in the juxtaposition of two ads from 1952 and 1953. In the first you see a woman holding up her head in victory; she has just won an election. In the second, you see a woman with her head down; she is about to fellate a lipstick.\n\nHank Willis Thomas's Unbranded: A century of white women, 1915-2015, shows at the Jack Shainman Gallery in New York until 23 May"

      "text": "Why the Majority of White Women Voted for Trump\n\nThe following is adapted from the new book Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny by Kate Manne (Oxford University Press, November 2017), available for purchase from Amazon and IndieBound .\n\nCut now to Hillary Clinton, whom many people not only disliked and mistrusted but also expressed disgust for during her 2016 presidential campaign. One such was Donald Trump, who didn't want to \"even think\" about Clinton using the restroom during a debate commercial break in December 2015 (though he was the one to raise the subject).\n\nSome of this disgust involved a fixation with Clinton's health, which served as a pretext for misrepresenting her as weak, frail, aging if not dying, and lacking in the necessary presidential (read: masculine) stamina-in short, as an old lady, now presumptively useless except for providing caregiving labor. There was also a striking fixation with Hillary's bodily secretions, and the possibility of her contaminating others-for example, the risk of her infecting people she shook hands with during a bout of mild pneumonia in September 2016. Phlegm or no, her cough due to a dry throat and seasonal allergies was an outsize source of controversy. Even Clinton's signature laugh-she tilts her head back, and laughs with an abandon that ought to put to rest the myth that she isn't genuine-prompted disgust reactions. The \"envelope\" of her body seemed too loosely sealed for many people's comfort.\n\nA Trump supporter interviewed on Samantha Bee before the first presidential debate opined that he expected Clinton to be using a catheter on stage, because of her many health problems. I looked it up; somehow, this had become a popular Internet conspiracy theory. The interviewee added he was trying to be empathetic-to which the interviewer responded, aptly, that he might need to try harder. And, ironically, it was Trump who was rumored to have wet his pants at a debate back in February-an insinuation of Marco Rubio's that seemed almost too strange and socially awkward to be fabricated. But it was conveniently forgotten soon afterward. When it comes to structural amnesia, that is, collective forgetting mediated by social privilege and dominance, one could scarcely hope for a better example. We drag her name through the mud; we uphold his dignity almost primly.\n\nMeanwhile, a small dark patch on Clinton's jacket at the first debate was said to be a drool spot-another symptom of her inability to keep her mouth shut, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, given Trump's menacing stance and threat to throw her in prison for her emails. (In reality, the mark was a shadow cast by Clinton's lapel mic.)\n\nWhen people chanted of Clinton, \"lock her up,\" at Trump's rallies, it obviously expressed a desire to see her punished. But it also went beyond that and seemed to express a desire for her containment. When a Republican New Hampshire representative and Trump delegate called for Clinton to be shot for treason in July 2016 over her emails and Benghazi, he framed his remarks as follows: \"Something's wrong there. ... This whole thing disgusts me. Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason.\" Later, he also called her a \"piece of garbage.\"\n\nSo I don't think it's a stretch to suggest that Clinton was subject to a striking number and intensity of disgust reactions as her campaign wore on, just as the empirical evidence canvassed above would predict. And, as we've seen, this plausibly would have led to their mistrusting her, and may also have increased the severity of their moral disapproval of her actions. It might also have led to the conviction that Clinton was guilty of something, even absent specific charges, or strong counterevidence against charges previously leveled. The attempt to clear her of false accusations and poorly evidenced myths and rumors hence often resembled a game of whack-a-mole. This too can be explained in terms of general features of disgust I take up in next two sections: the way it sticks, and the way it makes us want to keep our distance from its object.\n\nHow Disgust Sticks\n\nTo be sure, not every female politician or prominent public figure is subject to such suspicion, condemnation, and the desire to see them punished. But, when the mud-slinging does begin, it quickly tends to escalate. And there tends to be not only a pile-on (common enough on the Internet), but an \"oozing\" effect-where the suspicion and criticism encompasses every possible grounds for doubt about her competence, character, and accomplishments. Clinton was suspected of myriad distinct offenses. And this suggests a conviction she's guilty of something.\n\nEven among those who don't share this conviction, it may have an impact on their thinking indirectly. My sense is that people in liberal and progressive circles were not generally as proud to vote for Clinton as President Obama, despite their very similar policies and politics, and the fact that each was or would have been (respectively) a history-making president, from the point of view of so-called identity politics. More than that, I think there was an atmosphere on the left that led to moral defensiveness about a vote for Clinton-as if voting for her meant complicity or complacency vis-Ã -vis the admittedly terrible effects of some of her (I agree) misguided foreign policies. But most of these policies were also Obama's. Yet, somehow, they often seemed to do less to damage his reputation-and didn't turn a vote for him into a moral liability on the left, was my impression.\n\nThe problem here is exacerbated by the way moral criticisms become personal and go to a woman's character especially quickly and cut especially deep. It also says something about the way misogyny works to disrupt female solidarity, especially among white women. In the next section, I'll take up these points in reverse order.\n\nKeeping One's Distance\n\nMisogyny often involves distinguishing between \"good\" and \"bad\" women, by the lights of their conformity to patriarchal norms and values. So, at the highest level of generality, it's not surprising that women who aspire to be \"good\" have social incentives to distance themselves from a woman deemed \"bad,\" as Clinton often was, and to publicly participate when she was ostracized and punished for supposed moral crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nAnother study coauthored by Madeline Heilman (Parks-Stamm, Heilman, and Hearns [2008]) sheds some light on why over half the white women who voted in the general in 2016 cast their ballots for Donald Trump over Clinton. It turns out that women penalize highly successful women just as much as men do, but for seemingly different reasons. The researchers had male and female participants rate a newly appointed female vice president, described in a personnel file, on measures of hostility, antisocial traits, and overall likability. Both male and female participants were prone to punish her, socially, by inferring norm violations-for example, manipulativeness, coldness, aggression-unless given specific information about her feminine virtues and good behavior. In which case, the \"social punishment\" effect was blocked for male and female participants. However, crucially, only the female participants then had more negative self-evaluations. This supported the researchers' hypothesis that penalizing successful women serves an ego-protective function (only) for other women. It defuses the threatening sense that a similar-and similarly good, decent, and/ or \"real\" woman-is more competent or accomplished than they are. And, tellingly, it appears that this is linked to a lack of self-belief that can be assuaged by positive feedback.\n\nIn the first experiment, the researchers blocked women's punishment of other women by describing the subject as having feminine-coded, prosocial tendencies. In the second experiment in the same research paper, they achieved a similar magnitude of the same effect by priming participants (all of whom were women) in the experimental condition with positive feedback about their own exceptional business acumen. They were no longer motivated to penalize the female high achiever.\n\nIn the days following the election, it was common for those of us grieving the result to judge the white women who voted for Donald Trump even more harshly than their white male counterparts. I was guilty of this myself. But, in view of these results, I subsequently came to redirect a good portion of my anger toward the patriarchal system that makes even young women believe-noting that, again, participants in this study were college undergraduates-that they are unlikely to succeed in high-powered, male-dominated roles. And, judging by both the outcome of the election, and the strength of the above mechanisms, they may very well be right. It is wrong but natural to protect oneself from the prospect of threatening others who challenge one's extant sense that one couldn't have been the president (say), notwithstanding one's best efforts. A way to do this is to hold that these women are different and in some way inferior or objectionable or otherwise suspect. They are, say, ruthless, callous, or uncaring. Or their success makes them witches; their power is black magic.\n\nAmong the questions to ask, following on from this research, is the effect of race. For almost no black women and relatively few Latina women voted for Trump over Clinton. Is racial difference part of what makes for psychological self-differentiation from Clinton? Or was the obvious fact that these women had more to lose in having a white supremacist-friendly president rather an overriding factor in blocking the underlying dispositions that might otherwise have been operative? Since the above study doesn't mention the race of participants, unfortunately, there's no indication of the answers. It's also not clear whether or not the subject of assessment in the above studies was envisaged as being white by the participants.\n\nWhatever the case, it seems plausible that white women had additional psychological and social incentives to support Trump and forgive him his misogyny (among other things). Such incentives are due to the fact that (1) on average, white women are considerably likelier than their nonwhite counterparts to be partnered with a Trump supporter, and (2) again, on average, relatedly in some cases, white women would generally have greater incentives, and hence corresponding dispositions, to try to get or stay on the good side of powerful white men of Trump's genre. The thought being that it is virtually only a white woman who stands a fighting chance of being regarded by men like Trump as a \"good girl,\" if she plays her cards right; whereas, such men's treatment of black and Latina women was frequently erasing or derogatory.\n\nKimberlÃ© W. Crenshaw's (2016) conversations with 16 social justice leaders in the wake of the election highlighted the need for intersectional thinking about social relations as well as social identities here. In dialogue with Crenshaw, critical race theorist and feminist Sumi Cho pointed out that \"instead of actually voting on the basis of the interest of individual [white] women ... instead, you heard this narrative of, 'But I'm concerned about what it will do to my son, my brother, my husband,' etc. You have this concept of family that's highly racialized, that overwhelmed and supplanted the common rational voter approach.\" Cho thereby shows how himpathy for the \"little guy\" may be part of the story as well. Within American society, where a nominally monogamous intimate relationship between one man and one woman is the statistical norm-and remains the more or less explicit moral norm in many communities, for example, many conservative ones-women's first loyalty is often to her male intimate partner, rather than other women. If there are subtle patterns of male dominance and other forms of misogynistic behavior on the part of the male partner, then there are also fairly powerful psychological incentives for the female partner to deny, minimize, and overlook their prevalence and importance. These include the possibility that, in voting for Trump, he was effectively shrugging about a counterpart's sexual misconduct and misogyny.\n\nThe point can be extended. As white women, we are habitually loyal to powerful white men in our vicinity (e.g., those who outrank us in our workplaces, communities, and other social institutions, including the academy). We keep dominant men's secrets as a default matter-including when it comes to their sexually predatory behavior. My choice of the inclusive plural pronoun here is deliberate. White liberal and progressive women are not reliably willing to break the habits of a lifetime in this respect either. Consider the amount of time it has taken for multiple credible reports of sexual harassment and assault in academia-philosophy included, which remains one of the least diverse disciplines-to lead to any action against certain prominent male perpetrators. This is a symptom of our collective tendency to keep silent, to be a \"good one.\" This requires being loyal to dominant men-and caring for anyone and everyone in the vicinity, additionally.\n\nWomen are supposed to give everyone around them personal care and attention, or else they risk seeming nasty, mean, unfair, and callous. But, of course, that's an impossible mandate when you're running for president. And, in general, the larger and more diverse a woman's audience or constituency, the more she will tend to be perceived as cold, distant, \"out of touch,\" negligent, careless, and selfish, in view of these norms of feminine attentiveness. No such listening skills need be demonstrated by her male counterparts, however. Indeed, when it came to Trump, they could hardly have been less so.\n\nThis suggests that we need to move beyond simply thinking about higher and lower standards for men and women. Rather, we often take men and women to have fundamentally different, and nominally complementary, responsibilities.\n\nGendered Splitperception\n\nThe common focus on gendered double standards may be unduly narrow in another respect as well. The notion encompasses cases where women are judged more harshly than their male counterparts on the basis of what we take to be the same actions, on the assumption that these perceptions are more or less morally neutral common ground here. But evidence suggests that the same actions performed by a man versus a woman may be viewed differently in the first place-where a lens of differential prior suspicion or a gendered division of labor makes the very same actions performed by her versus him seem different. His behavior seems normal, unremarkable, business as usual, nothing to see here. Her doing the same thing makes us wonder: what's she hiding?\n\nThis suggests it's not just a matter of gendered double standards, then; gender biases in politics encompass this \"split\" in social perception.\n\nThe evidence I refer to here comes from a recent study in social psychology, and it is still early days for this hypothesis. It is nonetheless so explanatory of otherwise bewildering impasses as to be worth canvassing with this caveat. Participants in the study read anecdotes about parents who left their young children home alone, for a variety of reasons. The participants were then asked to assess the degree of risk or danger to which the children had been exposed. The parents who left to play Pokemon Go were judged to have put their children at greater risk than those who left them to go to work. And crucially, for my purposes, the woman's behavior was judged riskier than the man's, all else being equal (i.e., holding fixed the reasons why they left, for how long, the children's age, etc.) (Thomas, Stanford, and Sarnecka 2016).\n\nThese results are admittedly preliminary (indeed, cutting edge at the time of writing-August 2016), and there's more work to be done on the effects of gender here in particular (as the researchers acknowledge). Still, they would explain a lot that cries out for explanation. It's natural to hypothesize a mechanism roughly like the following: we see people doing something that strikes us as morally better or worse, for example, more or less worthy of outrage, moral disgust, or indignation. We then match the description of what they did, for example, how risky their actions were, to the prior intensity and valence of our spontaneous moral reactions. Such moral reactions or judgments about someone may hence be a significant factor in how we view or describe their actions, at what is supposed to be a purely factual, non-moral, level. What one would have hoped is, of course, the opposite-that we assess the non-moral facts, and only then pass moral judgment on their actions. Now consider prejudice against women in certain social positions-those aspiring to masculine-coded power positions, as in politics. Part of what this may involve is moral prejudgment in line with widely disavowed, but not yet defunct, gendered social mores. Someone like Hillary Clinton is frequently cast in the moral role of usurper. And unsurprisingly so (which is of course not to say justifiably); she threatens to take men's historical place or steal their thunder. If she wins, the game is rigged. She could not have won it fairly. And her behavior and she herself seems to be careless, shady, and crooked (so the thought continues).\n\nWomen in positions of unprecedented political power, or right on its cusp, are also prone to be perceived as rule-breakers generally. They are not to be trusted to stay in line, or respect law and order. These perceptions are understandable, because they're not baseless so much as defunct: these women are breaking the rules of an unjust patriarchal system that is still in the process of being dismantled. Someone like Clinton was breaking rank; she was out of order relative to nominally passÃ©, but entrenched, social hierarchies wherein only men could aspire to highest political office. And women were expected to defer to and support, not compete with, them. Her defection from this role may hence seem like treason or betrayal-and reacted to in ways both bewildered and bewildering, both threatened and threatening.\n\nIn view of this, a woman who has done nothing wrong in moral and social reality (i.e., relative to fair and egalitarian standards) may be subject to moral suspicion and consternation for violating edicts of the patriarchal rulebook. And her behavior may then be cast as dangerous, suspicious, risky, or deceptive, in line with moral verdicts already rendered. The latter judgments drive the former, rather than the reverse. It just seems like she's up to something; what being a matter for discovery-or invention.\n\nThis may be all very well in theory, as a speculative hypothesis, but (how) does it work in practice? Is there evidence this actually happens? I believe so. Take the glut of news stories about Hillary's staffers destroying her electronic devices and what this might mean. Take-again, for an example outside of politics-the suspicion to which Alice Goffman was subject when she burned her field notes after publishing On the Run (2014). She was subsequently accused of fabricating much of her research by numerous pundits and scholars, on bases as thin as the fact that she documented police misconduct of a sort the author's lawyer friend in the relevant city (Philadelphia) happened not to have heard of. Numerous other allegations cast a long shadow over Goffman's achievements. There were allegations of academic misconduct, and even a fantastic bid to have her indicted for conspiring to commit homicide. This for offering a vivid account of briefly entering into a revenge fantasy with a friend after a close mutual friend was murdered.\n\nBut wasn't it fair to be suspicious when someone destroys evidence as Clinton and Goffman did? No; these were both completely standard practices in the relevant domains. The above description-and associated image of the furtive disposal of a blackberry, as if it were a dead body in a movie-is tendentious and misleading. In the case of Clinton's staff, they weren't destroying evidence; they were following a protocol for protecting classified information. And Goffman was similarly following ethnographic best practices.\n\nWhen men engage in these actions, it is unremarkable, and hence tends to go unremarked on. But when a woman encroaching on men's turf does the same thing, her actions-and she-may seem deceptive or negligent.\n\nConsider then FBI director James Comey's remark that Clinton was \"extremely careless\" in her handling of her emails, and that she exposed the American people to serious risks from \"hostile actors\" while traveling overseas. Both the description itself and its subsequent uptake were clearly inflated. The idea that Clinton was so careless as compared to other politicians seems driven by a tacit moral judgment, a prior conviction that she was guilty, rather than an unbiased assessment of the evidence.\n\nWhen it came to Bernie Sanders's controversial remarks about Clinton's being unqualified he ascribed to her \"bad judgment,\" in reference to her voting for the war in Iraq. And Trump echoed the phrase repeatedly in subsequently debating Clinton. Donald Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, also voted for the war in Iraq. But according to Trump, Pence was entitled to make such mistakes \"every once in a while.\" \"She's not?\" CBS's Lesley Stahl asked Trump, of Clinton. \"No. She's not,\" was Trump's full answer. \"Got it,\" Stahl blinked, and proceeded with the interview.\n\nFaking It\n\nA final valuable source of evidence of the gender biases that may have been in play in the election is an interactive database of a huge number of student evaluations (some fourteen million) from ratemyprofessor.com, designed by Benjamin Schmidt, which shows the frequency of word use therein, broken down by subject area and the gender of the professor. Not all gendered descriptions are as obvious as \"witch\" and \"bitch.\" On a hunch, I typed in the word \"fake,\" and the results were striking.\n\nThe results suggest that female professors were more often described as \"fake\"-sometimes by many orders of magnitude-in all but two subjects. On the flipside, male professors were likelier to inspire students to use the word \"genuine,\" although by a somewhat smaller margin. (This time, in all but one subject; a different one, not obviously suggestive of a pattern.) The results for \"cold,\" \"mean,\" \"nasty,\" and-again, strikingly-\"unfair\" also showed dramatic gender distributions. Namely, women appear to be perceived as mean, nasty, cold, unfair, and above all fake as opposed to genuine, much more often than their male colleagues.\n\nYou might wonder whether male and female professors just have different teaching styles and so are subject to different kinds of assessment and criticism. Fortunately, Sprague and Massoni address this point in the aforementioned paper (2005), and argue this is unlikely: male teachers often receive comments along the same dimensions, but with the opposite polarity. This suggests they are not evincing incommensurably different qualities, so much as being held to more or less stringent standards.\n\nAssume (as I think is safe-though, again, defeasibly) that it's not that female professors deserve these unflattering perceptions-by genuinely seeming \"fake,\" somehow, whatever that might look like. This suggests that people are more inclined to see women in positions of authority as posers and imposters compared with their male counterparts.\n\nSuppose that this is true: that so-called imposter syndrome is sometimes in the eye of the beholder of female as compared with male professors, in their positions as moral and intellectual authority figures. This hypothesis could help to explain why Bernie Sanders was preferred by many millennials to Hillary Clinton by such a large margin, in no small part due to differential perceptions of their integrity, sincerity, and authenticity, and seemingly in excess of the political and moral differences between the two of them-especially after it was clear that the insinuations about Clinton's dishonesty and untrustworthiness came to essentially nothing (Abramson 2016).\n\nIt would also help to explain some of the bizarre conspiracy theories to the effect that Hillary's health concerns were much more serious than was reported-which resulted, two months out from the election, in the preposterous rumor that Hillary had a \"body double.\" Or, alternatively, that Clinton had died and been replaced by this doppelganger-cum-puppet. (Weekend at Bernie's, meet Hillary's September.)\n\nClinton is not the first to suffer from these kinds of perceptions among female politicians, either. Julia Gillard was slated as inauthentic to the point where her first election campaign tried to undo the damage by presenting the Australian public with \"the real Julia.\" This effort was, however, spectacularly unsuccessful: Gillard was mercilessly mocked and depicted as a Russian-doll-like figure-layer on superficial layer, with no substantial core of values.\n\nThe belief in female leaders in politics seems to founder even at the level of visual perception. They look hollow, stiff, wooden, robotic, as well as fake and inauthentic. Their energy doesn't appear to come from inside them; nor, it appears, do their values-which are subsequently held to be merely a product of mercurial, outward social forces. When Clinton called Trump a puppet of Putin during the third debate, Trump's immediate instincts were interesting to behold: \"No ... no puppet ... You're the puppet!\" he spluttered. Unusually for him, he seemed to believe what he was saying. She was the marionette; he was the master.\n\nTrump's supporters were wont to say, approvingly, that he tells it like it is. I think it's fair to say that the power of the man's ability to convey the impression of authenticity without its substance was underestimated by many liberals-on the grounds that much of what Trump says is false, indeed an outrageous lie, incoherent, self-contradictory, or a reversal of previous statements made by him. But we should ask ourselves if ascriptions of authenticity or genuineness to prospective leaders in politics and beyond has much if anything to do with the belief that they tell truths as opposed to falsehoods, versus their seeming right for the role somehow, perhaps by dint of telling a good story while looking like a natural, unlike Clinton, for reasons that may have had little to do with her in particular, when it came down to it. (Compare the fundamental attribution error of preferring explanations that cite particular over general information.)\n\nPartly in view of that, I believe there were serious grounds to worry about Trump's winning the election, and in particular to fear that low voter turn-out for Clinton might cost her dearly, given a small but predictable and potentially significant turn-off effect mediated in large part by gender. Or at any rate, rightly or wrongly (i.e., justifiably or no), I am on the record as having fretted about that beforehand. And whatever the case, the politics of authenticity and the aesthetics of truthfulness of character can and do work strongly against women in politics inter alia. When she doesn't seem as if she quite belongs up there on the podium, or behind the desk of the oval office, she may seem untrustworthy, dishonest, an impostor, and even viscerally and then morally disgusting. We tend to be much too quick to trust our feelings of being unsettled as probative evidence of bad character. Meanwhile, Trump seemed like the sort of man you expect to be in a position of power, a leader, if not in politics, then in something. So many were prepared to follow him on Twitter and beyond that-and now to where, at what cost, heaven help us.\n\nFrom Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny by Kate Manne.

My second grade teacher had walked us through where to write our names in capital letters and what bubbles to fill in for our sex, our birth date and ethnicity. But in the days before \"biracial\" or \"multiracial\" or \"choose two or more of the following,\" I was confronted with rigid boxes of \"white\" or \"black\" - a space that my white father and black-Italian mother had navigated for some time.\n\nBut even at 8 years old, I knew I could mark \"white\" on the form without a teacher's assistant telling me to do the form over with my No. 2 pencil. I could sometimes be \"exotic\" on the playground to the grown-ups who watched us for skinned knees and bad words. But with hair that had yet to curl and a white-sounding last name, I was at first glance - and many after - a dark-haired white girl with a white father who collected her after school.\n\nThat girl came with me to junior high and even high school. Even as my hair became wiry with puberty, the frizziness soon a universal topic in the girls' bathroom as girls began their marriages to the straight iron, I became aware that I read no differently. Another curly-haired white girl who wished that her hair was straight.\n\nSchool records could be curiously inconsistent, occasionally marking me as \"white\" and sometimes \"other,\" my recorded ethnicity changing year to year as I would pass and then suddenly not.\n\nWhite parents of school friends would never fail to comment on how I was \"striking\" or \"foreign-looking.\" Distant relatives on the white side of my family would remark that I could easily pass for Israeli, for Spanish, for Italian, and other nationalities that can be filed under \"pan-ethnic.\" But they always equated me with the culturally sanctioned \"chic\" identities, like an exoticized princess you could encounter on a distant beach or in a novel. Compound that with my Hawaiian name (I was born there) and I was the problematic backdrop to any movie. The pretty prop to a white, male protagonist's discovery. Somebody's \"Pocahontas.\"\n\nThe first time I read Nella Larson's 1929 novel \"Passing,\" in which a black light-skinned protagonist is passing as white during the Harlem renaissance, the following passage eerily resonated with me: \"They always took her for an Italian, a Spaniard, a Mexican, or a gipsy. Never, when she was alone, had they even remotely seemed to suspect that she was a Negro.\"\n\nThis at times was even more perplexing to my white peers when they would encounter my mother, who although much darker than I, was still relatively light-skinned. But the disconnect became fully realized when I was asked by a friend in the seventhgrade why my mother \"talked like she was black.\"\n\nThat's when I learned that my mother was passing too.\n\nYears later, I had to be interviewed by a New York University Langone administrator before being admitted for surgery. The personal questions ranged from my address to an emergency contact to allergies. When he printed out the forms for me to sign, I noticed that he had marked my ethnicity as \"white\" - and without asking me.  I politely asked him to correct it.\n\n* * *\n\nAs an adult, I learned that my white doppelgÃ¤nger was also straight.\n\nI started dating women at age 17 - but with my conventionally feminine personal aesthetic, I once again had an identity that went unread. Even though I was out from a relatively young age, the high heels and dresses made acquaintances ask about \"boyfriends.\" Even as my female partners sat right next to me.\n\nWhen I got to college in the liberal Bay Area in California, the term \"partner\" offered a more veiled inquiry from strangers. But words I volunteered like \"girlfriend\" or the female pronoun still visibly cracked features, still framed a very visible pause.\n\nThese pauses have become even longer since I became engaged to a woman, as with deciding to have my relationship sanctioned by the institution of marriage have come the fairly predictable heterosexist assumptions.\n\nBut with every question about \"my soon-to-be husband\" and \"your fiancÃ©, what does he do?\" I see that my straight white doppelgÃ¤nger is present even in the most intimate and far away encounters. Recently on a trip to Italy, an American woman I had newly met asked how my fiancÃ©e proposed to me. As I began recounting the story, dotting my story with many \"she's,\" my acquaintance appeared confused and asked if my male fiancÃ©'s mother was in attendance.\n\nOnce, I told a new white male acquaintance where I used to live in Brooklyn, a neighborhood that now is completely gentrified, but wasn't when I started living there.\n\n\"What's that area like for a white girl?\" he asked.\n\nI nearly turned around to look for her.\n\nBecause with my invisibility has come her privilege, an experience that has undeniably marked most of my life.  Due to my passing, I have the W.E.B. Du Bois-patented \"double consciousness\" for the opportunities that have been placed before me, scholastic and professional, from generally white and hetero establishments that look at me and always see their own. Is it the presumed commonality that garnered me those interviews? Those smiles? Those callbacks? Those firm handshakes?\n\nWhen I read statistics about how employers are more likely to hire white people than people of color, I know that I can count myself in the former, despite the fact that I identify as the latter. I'm hyper-aware that when a bank, a company or any public office hears the sound of my voice and reads my legal first name (under which this article does not appear), they assume that they're talking to a white woman, and therefore give me better service.\n\nWhite and straight co-workers, employers and acquaintances don't outwardly shun me when they find out I'm of color or queer (due to the city I live in). There's no dilemma of being \"discovered\" (another privilege). But there's an embarrassment that crosses their face, a shuffle of papers, a reach for a pen - a social clumsiness in that they assume I'm not.  And there we both are, between a directly racist homophobic past and a more subtly racist and homophobic present.\n\nMy privilege in passing reflects a racism and heterosexism that continues to flourish, despite romantic notions that racial mixing and gay marriage will create a utopian future free of prejudices.\n\nPolice officers don't suspect me. Store owners like me. White strangers don't feel threatened by me. Racists get too comfortable with me. Homophobes unknowingly befriend me. My straight white doppelgÃ¤nger and I ride the subway together as I try to lose her in crowds and leave her behind at parties. I dispel her with the perpetual coming-out, the casual \"I'm not white,\" the introduction of my partner.\n\nI've spent most of my adult life actively trying to evade her. But every time I sit down with new people, I know that she sits down first."

      "text": "It's Not as Simple as White Trumping Black or Man Trumping Woman\n\nIt was delightful, those early days when Republicans were in fractious disarray and the Democratic field bloomed with interesting candidates like a pasture full of daffodils -- any of them! All of them! Bluebirds sang. We were rolling in good will. Now, however, John McCain has unified the right with a lizardy, smothering oil of \"my friend,\" \"my friends\" and \"hey listen, pal.\" And Democrats are chewing each other's legs off. Instead of discussion about substantive positions, a distressingly large proportion of the debate is epitomized by an e-mail I received from a good friend: \"In my state, a black man trumps a white woman and that's that. So what do you suggest?\" Here's what I suggest. 1. Black Jack does not always trump White Queen and vice versa. The problem with the formulation of race-gender \"trumping\" is that it flattens Obama's and Clinton's complexities -- their relative eloquence, her vote on the war, whether some voters love him because he's \"so un-black a black man,\" their stances on civil liberties. It's the kind of bad logic that led some people to expect that then-nominee Clarence Thomas wouldn't be all that conservative because he's a black man. It's just bad algebra. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton are black men, but it's hard to imagine them \"trumping\" Clinton. Similarly, it's not at all clear that Obama would fare as well against a more nimble and oratorically endowed female opponent, like the late Ann Richards, for example. 2. There is no profit in styling a competition of oppression. One ubiquitous subtext of the black man-trumps-white-woman calculus is that it's easier to be a black man than it is to be a white woman or, even more reductively, that sexism is worse than racism. It works alongside right-wing claims that racism isn't a problem anymore. That in turn fuels the not-so-coded diminishments asserting that Obama is getting \"preferential\" treatment in the media; that he's simultaneously \"entitled\" and \"elite\" yet \"unqualified\" and \"not ready.\" Here's an alternative way to think about it. Take the unnecessarily polarizing comparative out and stop this inanity of ranking. We can all acknowledge that Clinton has been drubbed with the foulest sexist stereotypes since Anita Hill. It is true that Hillary nutcrackers are sold in airports and that there is not yet an accompanying Stepin Fetchit version of a Barack Obama doll. But that hardly means we live a country in which racist imagery is ipso facto kinder and gentler than gender stereotypes. Turn on the TV and watch Flavor Flav perform goggle-eyed minstrelsy more demeaning than in the Jim Crow era. Pick up the newspaper and read that one in every fifteen black adults is incarcerated. So cheer up: from sex trafficking to the disaster in New Orleans, there's sufficient suffering to go around. 3. There are multiple narratives of sexism and racism. Stereotypes are malleable. They can be hybridized, coded, shifted across demographics, conjoined with other isms like class or ethnic prejudice, foregrounded or backgrounded. The \"trumped white woman\" version of sexism, for example, ignores the degree to which Michelle Obama is often described in terms depressingly similar to those of Hillary Clinton: she's too outspoken, not domestic enough, going to tank her husband's candidacy by not knowing her place. Similarly, if few are openly hurling the N-word at Obama, what to make of Bill O'Reilly's hankering to \"lynch\" the missus instead? And why would anyone think that Barack Hussein \"Osama -- oops, I mean Obama\" is getting a free pass from our new-age profiles in prejudice? There's also the complication of how we inject class into narratives of race and sex. Any black person not categorizable as \"underclass\" has historically been sorted into one of two categories: (a) an upper-class person whose blackness is eliminated or (b) an uppity black whose personhood is eliminated. A large shadow of that anxiety-provoking split hangs over Obama: he's the \"articulate, clean\" exception washed of all relation to race. And he's also the daring \"race man,\" the opener-of-doors for whose physical safety the community prays. 4. \"If he were/if she were\" has become the new \"he said/she said.\" Recently, Geraldine Ferraro declared that \"if Barack Obama were a woman, we'd be saying, Are you kidding?\" By that she apparently meant that we wouldn't be taking him seriously. It made me sag with utter dejection -- even without trying to imagine what kind of silly, unserious woman she was imagining him to be: Indonesian-raised white? Harvard Law Review-credentialed black? Or perhaps she was speaking out of pure transference, so that he-as-a-she would look a lot like her. That same day Newsweek published a cover story asking if Obama might become our first woman President. By that it meant he listens, he negotiates, he plays well with others. Again my head began to throb: Bill Clinton is cast as our first black President because he's such a bad boy, while Obama has to be our first female President because he's too nice to be a black man? If we are going to play this pernicious game of projection, why not pull out all the vulgar stops: If John McCain were a woman, we'd call him a girly-man. If John Edwards were Latina, we'd love his healthy head of hair. But this is patent nonsense. Why don't we try \"he is/she is\" for a change? Both Democratic candidates represent diversely layered demographics -- ones that describe our future. Clinton is a strong, determined, immensely resilient woman; Obama is a culturally amalgamous, quietly brilliant, elegantly intellectual man. They are both tremendously well educated, making all of us the lucky beneficiaries of affirmative action policies that have reconfigured the playing field to include the two of them. Now we need to direct our attention where it belongs. As President, McCain would do away with what's left of affirmative action, Roe and habeas corpus. He has been schooled for war and more war. He is committed to and implicated in almost all the domestic and economic lunacies of the Bush Administration. It would be tragic if he strolled in for a touchdown while the rest of us were playing card games in the end zone."

      "text": "Why It Was So Easy For Rachel Dolezal to Slip Into Black Skin\n\nSo let's talk about Rachel Dolezal. You may already know the basics of Dolezal's case: she's the 37-year-old head of the NAACP chapter in Spokane, Washington; a professor of Africana studies at Eastern Washington University; and-here's where it gets kinda bananas-a white woman who has been passing as a black woman for years.\n\nWe know this not because of any misstep Dolezal made-she was essentially flawless in executing her ruse-but because her biological parents, from whom she's been estranged for years, decided to go on television and announce it. Dolezal, as it turns out, isn't actually African American at all, but German, Czech and Swedish, with a hint of Native American in there somewhere. In other words, the Rachel Dolezal story is a lot like Black Like Me , brought to actual 2015 life.\n\nThe whole thing might be a non-story if our long and twisted history of passing, which has roots that can be traced back to our country's very foundation, weren't understood to operate in only one direction. Some very fair black people, as a refuge from racism and persecution, have passed for a long time. Theophilus John McKee lived as a white man for four decades before his blackness was uncovered in 1948. This discovery may have helped kill him, considering he died of heart failure around five months after word got out. Writer Anatole Broyard only revealed his years of passing to his children on his deathbed. James Meredith had to have the National Guard protect him when he integrated Ole Miss in 1962, but the joke was on those dumb racists: Harry S. Murphy (who briefly passed for white and enrolled in the school from 1945-'46) had already attended the college undetected.\n\nBut Dolezal confounds our understanding of how passing is supposed to work. How many white people, given anonymity, would take the opportunity to become black? For the most part, even peddlers of the most bullshit \"post-racial\" and \"colorblind\" philosophies would opt to remain white, if they answered honestly. White privilege is a precious commodity.\n\nWhich is why Dolezal fascinates us. She flipped the script, and instead was committed to being black, going to great pains to make it so. This is a woman who attended Howard University, a historically black college, on full scholarship to earn her MFA. (Though new reports suggest she hadn't yet begun passing during her time there.) Her art, if her blog offers any insight into her larger body of work, is almost singularly focused on representations of blackness and messages of anti-racism.\n\nI don't doubt that Dolezal loved her black ex-husband (you would have to love someone to forgive them for writing you this love song ), but their marriage definitely fit neatly with the rest of the package. She adopted her African-American brothers, who had originally been adopted by her parents, and began calling them her sons. She kept up her tan unfailingly. And as Kara Brown noted at Jezebel , she must've spent a small fortune making her hair into a flawless version of every natural hairstyle known to black womanhood.\n\nAnd it worked, at least for a few years. Dolezal, like Black Like Me 's John Howard Griffin, couldn't change her blue eyes, but it actually didn't matter. She presented as a convincing fair-skinned African-American woman because there are plenty of bonafide black Americans who look like Dolezal. Our nation's legacy of slave rape, of hidden miscegenation that produced babies who looked an awful lot like the master, of secret relationships that ended with black men strung from trees-you know, the things so many of us like to pretend never happened just because we have a black president-all of these things have yielded African Americans of every hue and skin tone. Dolezal knew that racism requires whiteness be fragile, rendering anything that deviates even slightly from white-that falls under the one drop rule -non-white. Turning black was easy, a skin she could slip into, because the signage of blackness is so easily acquired. White supremacy couldn't maintain itself without exclusivity. A deep tan and a perm (and on a few occasions, locs and braids) was enough to get herself pitched out of the most elite club.\n\nDolezal has spent the last few years performing blackness, a role to which she was welcomed by unknowing members of the black community. (If black privilege or even reverse racism were real, entry would have eluded her.) Ask anyone who believes in respectability politics-the absurd idea that if (mostly) black people would just do the work of being whiter, racism would disappear-if that magic trick would work for the majority of African Americans.\n\nOr better yet, ask any black millionaire if racism has ceased to exist. You cannot \"whiten up\" because real whiteness is only for white people in this country. A key part of our history of passing for white is that it could get you killed; it was a very high-risk, high-yield investment. Playing at being white, gaming the system to take advantage of privilege that was meant to be off limits to you, was tremendously dangerous. To make extra certain that no people with even one drop of black blood were able to access that privilege, a number of states passed laws narrowing the definition of whiteness, including the Virginia Racial Integrity Act in 1924. The effects of those laws are still with us today. I am a \"light-skinned\" black woman and I guarantee you, were I to suddenly declare myself white tomorrow, an awful lot of (white) people would have serious problems with the idea, and possibly consider me insane.\n\nWhich is why this notion of transracialism, a made-up term that's surfaced in the wake of Dolezal's story, is so ridiculous. Social media is currently full of attempts to equate Dolezal's situation with that of Caitlyn Jenner. Conservatives, who never bought into this whole \"trans\" thing anyway, have wondered aloud (mostly to be provocative) why, if Caitlyn Jenner is a woman, Rachel Dolezal can't be black. But Caitlyn Jenner didn't just become a woman; as a trans person, she has been a woman for as long as she can remember. She's finally taken the step of having her exterior self correlate with who she always knew she was inside. Rachel Dolezal, until some number of years ago, was white: a person who identified as white, with a strong appreciation for blackness and black culture. But you cannot translate a love of a culture into a completely revamped identity. To pretend that one can merely snap her fingers and become black is silly.\n\nNot to mention audacious. And a sign of privilege itself. How ballsy is it not only to pretend to be black, but to wield it as part of what makes you ideal to head up your local NAACP? (For the record, the NAACP is an interracial organization; Dolezal could have held the position without the whole performance.) There's been a lot of writing on cultural appropriation and cooptation over the last few years, but Dolezal's story is a version of both that sounds so outlandish on its face it would be funny if the whole thing weren't so troubling. You cannot just make someone else's oppression your own because you are a passionate ally (that's actually doing the ally thing all wrong).\n\nPart of what led to the investigation of Dolezal's background were her repeated claims of racial har assment over the years. I would never, ever wish that anyone be subjected to racism, but I will say that I deeply and sincerely hope Dolezal didn't make up those claims to bolster her claims to black authenticity. That would do a tremendous disservice to us all, especially those of us who live with the real, unchosen-and often disbelieved-consequences of racism.\n\nI believe Rachel Dolezal started off as a white woman who had a deep and real interest in African-American arts and culture, in social justice, in being a principled adherent to the tenets of civil rights. And then something went off the rails. I cannot speak to the ruptures that seem to have occurred alongside her decision to \"become black\"-her refusal to speak to her family, and her continued insistence that she wants nothing to with them. For all any of us know, they could be wonderful parents who have done nothing wrong, or monsters with a daughter who made a terribly misguided attempt to escape her past. I do not know Dolezal's mental state, and I'm pretty sure the publications I've seen speculating about it should probably just stop it right there.\n\nBut what we can say is that Dolezal's advocacy for black people and black culture didn't have to be done from within black skin. And the assumption that it could be so easily forged, that she could speak to the experience of life as a black person (and here I mean literally; Dolezal often lectured on this stuff as if it were taken from her own background) without ever actually having had it, is offensive. And ironically, able to do less good. The sad reality of race in this country is that many white people tend to listen to and believe other white people more on matters of race and anti-racism than they do people of color. Rachel Dolezal would actually be a more effective voice against racism in her own white, privileged skin.\n\nI'm not sure what Rachel Dolezal's next steps are, but hopefully, they involve becoming herself again, and sharing the ideals she seems to believe in, which so many people could benefit from learning about. Only this time, as her real, authentic self."

      "text": "White men have controlled women's reproductive rights throughout American history\n\nMore than a year after the Supreme Court ended federal protection for abortion rights in the United States, disagreements over abortion bans continue to reverberate around the country. Candidates sparred over the idea of a federal abortion ban during the Aug. 23, 2023, Republican presidential debate. And abortion is likely to figure prominently in the November 2023 contest for a seat on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court .\n\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, removing women's federal constitutional right to get abortions and giving states the power to pass laws about the legality of the procedure, the 6-3 vote was by a four white men, one Black man and a white woman majority.\n\nSince that decision - Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization - more than 1,500 state legislators, who are overwhelmingly white men , have voted for full or partial abortion bans.\n\nThis is not the first period in U.S. history when white men have exercised control over women's right to bear - or not bear - children, including during slavery. Then, it was a matter of numbers. The more people they enslaved, the more money white male enslavers could earn either from selling the enslaved or from the forced labor of the enslaved. White men controlled people's reproductive rights during the 20th century , too, with the American eugenics movement .\n\nFrom the late 1800s until the 2000s, white proponents of eugenics - the selective breeding of people - tried to determine who was fit or unfit to have children. While the American eugenics movement affected people of other races and ethnic backgrounds, as well as men, it was particularly harmful to Black women who, data from 1950 to 1966 shows, were sterilized at \" three times the rate of white women and more than 12 times the rate of white men .\"\n\nDuring both periods, Black women and their health bore the brunt of the consequences of white men's control.\n\nAs a researcher who specializes in the history of race and racism in the U.S. , I study historical issues related to race, gender and social justice.\n\nAfrican midwives , imported and enslaved as early as the 1600s, attended to the birthing needs of the enslaved and enslavers until the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nBut, after 1808, enslavers in the United States could no longer legally import enslaved people. With this shift, enslavers stepped up the forced breeding of enslaved women . White men raped the Black women and girls they enslaved , and then enslaved the children born from those rapes. White men also forced the Black women and Black men they enslaved to have sex with one another to generate more babies, who would be born into slavery.\n\nThis was a systemic way of ensuring enslaved women bore more children, which would increase profits for their enslavers.\n\nBecause the Black midwives and enslaved women often were blamed for or suspected of using birth control and abortions to resist forced pregnancy and the enslavement of their offspring, enslavers turned increasingly away from midwives and to white male doctors to figure out why nearly half of enslaved infants were stillborn or died within their first year of life and why so many enslaved women were infertile. These doctors also helped with difficult births .\n\nIn the two decades after 1810, the population growth rate of the enslaved averaged about 30% , despite the ban on slave importation. This was just under the 1800 to 1809 average of 31.6% which was a century high.\n\nIn the 1800s, as the slave population increased, profits in cotton did too . And after the legal importation of slaves ended, the value of Black women of childbearing age increased significantly. The forced breeding of these enslaved women was linked to the profitability of southern economies .\n\nEugenicists believed that increased breeding by white people , whom they assumed had high IQs, would benefit American society. But people who did not embody their idea of racial perfection, such as Black people, Native Americans, certain immigrants, poor white people and people with disabilities, should be sterilized - typically via tubal ligation and vasectomy .\n\nElaine Riddick, pictured at her home in Marietta, Ga., on July 15, 2022, was sterilized without her consent when she was 14, in North Carolina.\n\nTami Chappell for The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nIn this debunked pseudo-science , eugenicists often used intelligence tests to determine who was fit or unfit to reproduce and to predict who would commit crimes, end up in poverty or have children who were mentally ill or intellectually disabled. And they worked to incorporate their ideas into state laws.\n\nThirty-two states , between 1907 and 1937, enacted forced sterilization mandates to prevent births by people eugenicists considered socially inadequate.\n\nState-mandated procedures resulted in the coerced sterilization of women , particularly African American, Native American and Hispanic American women , and those from Southern and Eastern Europe .\n\nBeginning in 1948 with President Harry Truman's executive order to integrate the military, which extended to other areas, including education, employment and commerce, sterilization rates for Black women increased . For example, in North Carolina, which had the country's third-highest sterilization rate, far more women than men were forcibly sterilized. And in the 1960s, Black women in the state made up 65% of the women sterilized , while only making up 25% of the population.\n\nAbortion-rights activists counter-demonstrate as anti-abortion demonstrators gather for a rally in Federal Building Plaza on June 24, 2023, in Chicago to mark the first anniversary of the Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization Supreme Court decision.\n\nScott Olson/Getty Images\n\nBetween 1930 and 1970 , close to 33% of the women in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, were forcibly sterilized. In California, between 1997 and 2003, 1,400 female inmates, mostly Black, were forcibly sterilized .\n\nWhite nationalists and some right-wing politicians in the U.S. see the nation's demographic changes as dangerous. The Census Bureau projects that in the 2040s , non-Hispanic white people will no longer make up a majority of the U.S. population. The nation's racial and ethnic makeup will then be what some call \" majority-minority .\" Those projections scare racists, who believe in a conspiracy about white people being destroyed , which they label the great replacement theory because they fear losing social, political and economic power.\n\nThere is no way to know if this theory factored into the majority's votes in the Dobbs decision, but the argument that not enough white people are being born has been a common historical thread in the American anti-abortion movement.\n\nBut, while believers in the great replacement conspiracy want white women to have more babies, actual anti-abortion decisions like the Dobbs ruling harm Black women more than any other group. Black women represent 39% of the country's abortion patients , but many live in communities that have limited access to family planning clinics . And they have disproportionately higher rates of complications during pregnancy.\n\nAs a result, Black women - who experience higher maternal complications and mortality rates - will be forced to give birth to more babies .\n\nThis is another period in the country in which the reproductive health decisions made by mostly white men will harm Black women.\n\nRodney Coates , Professor of Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, Miami University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "A political scientist explains how a bunch of dangerous myths brought us the 'president for white people'\n\nToday's Republican Party is the largest, most powerful and most dangerous white racist organization in the United States -- if not the world. Donald Trump, the president of the United States, is its leader. These are plain if not understated facts. No embellishment is needed. The examples are many. Over the last few days Donald Trump has repeatedly dug into his bucket of racist political scatology, saying on Twitter and elsewhere that four nonwhite members of Congress (\"Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen,\" as he mockingly put it) should leave America and go back to their own \"crime infested\" and \"totally broken\" countries.\n\nReps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib were all born in the United States. Rep. Ilhan Omar is a naturalized citizen who was born in Somalia. This is not the first time that Donald Trump has said such vile things, which are almost word-for-word white supremacist or white nationalist talking points about how being a \"real American\" means one must first and foremost be \"white\" - and that nonwhites should be removed from the United States if they do not submit to white rule and authority.\n\nTrump's racism is part of a much larger pattern of white supremacist behavior by his administration: Interning nonwhite migrants and immigrants in concentration camps, seeking to ban Muslims from entering the United States, suggesting that black athletes who oppose police brutality are traitors, changing the country's immigration laws with the aim of maintaining a white majority, and disenfranchising nonwhite people through gerrymandering, voter suppression, voter intimidation and other tactics, legal and otherwise.\n\nRepublican elected officials almost unanimously support Trump's racist agenda. To wit: only four Republicans voted \"yes\" in support of Tuesday's House resolution condemning Donald Trump's gross and obvious racism.\n\nSenior Republican leaders such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Sen. Mitt Romney have either stated support for Trump's racist comments or avoided answering questions about them.\n\nTrump's White House spokespeople and the right-wing media have of course enthusiastically supported Donald Trump's most recent example of public white supremacy. Public opinion polls show that support for Donald Trump has grown among Republican voters because of his racist attacks.\n\nDonald Trump and the Republican Party's racist agenda is in service to white identity politics and a foundational assumption that white people should always and forever be the most privileged  and dominant group in the United States. But what are the specific contours of white identity politics, and why has it been so politically effective and personally seductive for Trump, the Republican Party and their voters? Is white identity politics an existential threat to America's multiracial democracy? What does it mean to be \"white\" in post-civil rights America? Are white men and white women invested in white identity in the same way?\n\nIn an effort to answer these questions I recently spoke with Ashley Jardina, a professor of political science at Duke University and author of the new book \"White Identity Politics.\"\n\nThis conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nHow did America arrive at a moment where it would elect a person like Donald Trump as president? Was this disaster caused by an inevitable white backlash against Barack Obama?\n\nI would not say that Donald Trump's presidency was inevitable. But I do think there is a confluence of events which took place. For the entire history of the United States, white people have had the majority of social, economic and political power. There have been different periods of time in which that power has seemed less secure or it's been chipped away at. This is especially true at present and over the last decade. This has been partly caused by immigration.\n\nOf course there is the symbolic power which came from the election of the nation's first African-American president Barack Obama. As a result of these factors, many whites in the United States are starting to feel like their place at the top of the pyramid is no longer guaranteed and that the United States no longer looks like a \"white nation\" which is dominated by white Anglo-Saxon Protestant culture. This arrangement looks like it may be in jeopardy to many white people. Donald Trump is very much a response to the feelings of threat and insecurity that many whites in the United States are experiencing.\n\nThese narratives about the \"browning of America\" are very problematic. Historically in America, groups formerly viewed as \"nonwhite\" are eventually included in the category of who is \"white\" so that white people as a group can remain numerically superior over blacks and other people of color. Why wouldn't \"white\" Hispanics - such as some Cubans, for example - simply not be grandfathered into whiteness?\n\nLatinos have not been subsumed by whiteness yet. There is an argument that eventually, just as took place with the Irish and Italians in the late 19th and mid-20th century, where those groups transitioned into whiteness, that this will happen with Latinos too. But such a crossing over into whiteness has not happened yet for them. There are pressures against that happening quickly. For example, there is a big push to get Latinos in the United States to develop a pan-ethnic Latino identity because it's politically strategic, particularly for Democrats.\n\nThere are these common criticisms that \"identity politics\" is bad. What is so problematic with such a complaint is that \"identity politics\" for people of color and for underrepresented groups like women is often the consequence of shared experiences of oppression and subordination. \"Identity politics\" is a way for marginalized groups to achieve political power and political representation of their interests.\n\nIn many ways this is a story of perception versus reality. It's certainly true that whites still have the majority of power and resources in America. There is not a great deal of evidence to suggest that has been dramatically chipped away at. After the 2010 census there were all these grand predictions being made about America's changing racial demographics. There were all these articles appearing about how whites as a group were going to lose their numerical majority.\n\nThen you've got the major symbolism of Barack Obama and the fact that Barack Obama won his second term - but not with the white vote. Obama had the lowest share of white voters of any successful presidential candidate. Obama won because of a coalition of people of color. Taken in total, all of these dynamics lead to a misperception that the power and privilege of whites in America is somehow being threatened.\n\nThis obsession by the mainstream corporate  media with chronicling the \"Lost Americans\" in TrumpLandia - meaning \"white working class\" red-state denizens - is a tedious new subgenre of writing. One of the themes has been white Trump voters saying that \"Well, the blacks had Obama now we've got a white man to do something for white people.\" Such claims are detached from any sense of reality, yet the sentiment resonates across White America.\n\nThere is a sense of white group identity and racial animus prefaced on a belief, however incorrect, that Barack Obama was going to do things just for black people and other nonwhites. Of course we know that was not true. Nonetheless, Donald Trump is very much seen as the response to Barack Obama. Trump is the person who is going to come in and help white people.\n\nIn my new book \"White Identity Politics,\" I examine public opinion data and other research which demonstrates that there really is this feeling among a certain subset of white people who believe the government is not doing things for them. These white people want benefits for their group. This helps to explain why Donald Trump was a successful candidate, even though he is an unconventional Republican.\n\nTrump went against the traditional Republican platform by promising to expand government, to protect Social Security, to protect Medicare and basically to provide government benefits that white people wanted. It's not just about \"small government\" or taking power away from people of color. Trump's appeal is about whites wanting to feel like they're getting some share of government benefits and support. This is of course wrong: White Americans receive a disproportionate share of resources whether that's from the government or just the overall economic, social and political resources in the United States.\n\nHow do these working-class Trump voters reconcile the fact that he and the Republican party are actually enacting policies which make their lives materially worse? Is this just the old story of the \"wages of whiteness,\" where Trump's racism gives his white voters a sense of power over and against nonwhites, even if they are being hurt economically?\n\nAmerican voters are not that sophisticated. These white voters see Trump as the candidate that's for the white person. They might not actually be getting the resources that they want, but they're not really thinking about it in a narrow, material way. What these white people are thinking is, \"Hey, Trump is there for my group. He's going to help white people. He's the president for white people.\"\n\nMotivated reasoning is very important here too. This is the psychological process through which people are going to believe things that are consistent with their prior beliefs, and they're going to reject information that's inconsistent with them. Trump might not be doing a good job helping this particular subset of voters. He might not be delivering on his promises. But his supporters are going to want to believe that he is. Trump's voters and other supporters are going to be highly resistant to being disappointed.\n\nHow do you define the oft-used and often vague phrase and concept \"white identity politics\"?\n\nThe idea behind \"white identity politics\" is that there is a subset of white voters and/or white Americans in general who feel a sense of attachment to their group. They feel a sense of solidarity. They think that their race and their racial identity is important to who they are. Their \"white identity\" influences how they see and view the political world. Tied up in that sense of identity is a belief that whites are losing out in the United States, their status and power is somehow under threat. Subsequently those white people who manifest white identity politics are responding to that perception in a political way by supporting policies and candidates who they view as protecting their racial group and preserving its status.\n\nDonald Trump is a candidate who campaigned on limiting nonwhite immigration, building a wall and doing things that were going to preserve America's literal \"whiteness.\" Trump also promised to provide and support policies such as Social Security and Medicare. These programs disproportionately benefit white people. Donald Trump is an isolationist. \"America First\" and \"Make America Great Again\" are also isolationist slogans.  Donald Trump is very much the candidate of white identity - but white identity mattered before Trump came on the scene.\n\nEmpirical data shows that whites who felt a sense of solidarity with their racial group were far less likely to vote for Barack Obama in 2012. This did not just suddenly appear in 2016. There has been evidence of this type of racially motivated voting and other political behavior for some time.\n\nAmerica was founded as a racialized democracy. Denying nonwhites their human and civil rights was not generally viewed by white elites and the white mass public as being incompatible with \"freedom\" and \"democracy.\" How do we reconcile your research on white identity politics with America's history and present as a racialized democracy?\n\nWhat we are seeing at present is the maintenance of a system of white supremacy. I want to be clear when I use the term \"white supremacy.\" People tend to recoil from that term because they think of white supremacy as the Ku Klux Klan. I'm not talking about those people exclusively. They are a very small subset of white people who show overt, explicit racial prejudice.\n\nThere is a much larger percentage of whites in United States who are not particularly high on racial prejudice. I would not call them bigots, but they still want to preserve and protect the privileges of their group. In doing so they are ultimately preserving a system and system of racial hierarchy in which white people are at the top.\n\nFor a long time whiteness was associated with mainstream America. Whites had the privilege of not having to think about their race. Nonwhites have their life outcomes overdetermined by their race. Race impacts how nonwhites navigate the world and think about political and the social reality. It is not until whites start to feel some threat or anxiety that white identity politics is activated. Whiteness is very salient in the Age of Trump.\n\nBut of course we can go back in time and consider other moments when white identity mattered more, such as the civil rights movement, and debates in the early part of the 20th century about immigration and preserving the \"Nordic stock\" and \"Anglo-Saxon heritage\" of the nation.\n\nThese moments were very explicit about the idea that America was a white country and \"we\" had to protect this particular flavor or idea of whiteness and a \"White America.\" But in between these periods of time, whites have had the luxury of not having to think about their race because they got to define what it means to be an \"American\" and what constitutes \"mainstream America.\"\n\nHow do experts who study and write about race and racial inequality understand and use terms such as \"racism\" and \"whiteness\" in a way that the general public does not?\n\nFirst of all, \"white identity\" is not the same thing as overt racism or overt prejudice. Now, they're certainly related in important ways. We often think about racism in two ways. One is learned dislike or antipathy for an out-group. For whites we often talk about whites just disliking people of color generally. And often, when we discuss racism we consider how whites dislike blacks in particular which manifests through a particular set of negative stereotypes that they associate with black people and blackness.\n\nAnother way of thinking about racism is a denial of structural inequality - and this can be ignorance or willful - and how nonwhites experience discrimination in the United States. This racist logic proceeds from an assumption that everyone has a type of equal opportunity and to the extent to which there is racial inequality, it is caused by people of color not working hard enough or not abiding by particular cherished \"American values\" such as \"hard work\" and \"patriotism.\" This is symbolic racism. The difference with white identity is that it is an in-group attitude; it is about wanting to protect and preserve white identity.\n\nYes, white identity is still part of the system of racism because it's about wanting to maintain their power at the top. By implication, this means that people of color necessarily cannot be equal with white people. This type of white identity is about maintaining a system of inequality. But from a psychological perspective, this is not the same thing as just disliking or having negative attitudes towards a racial out-group.\n\nWhat do we know about the road from the Tea Party to Donald Trump's Republican Party and the racialization of white group identity?\n\nOver the period of time in which the Tea Party got its momentum, there was a  very clear shift in support towards white people who measure very high on indicators of symbolic racism and racial resentment.\n\nLooking at the data from 2012 to the present I do not see a strong relationship between white identity and Tea Party support.  instead I see a really strong relationship between racial resentment and Tea Party support, which should not be surprising.\n\nThe Tea Party was very much latching on to an idea that \"big government\" was just giving \"handouts\" to people and that we needed to reduce the size of government. Such an argument is closely tied to symbolic racism and the idea that \"undeserving\" groups in the United States are \"taking advantage\" of government and that whites are paying too much into the system and not getting enough back. In total, the Tea Party and racial prejudice are tightly linked together.\n\nHow does gender interact with white identity?\n\nThere are gender differences with respects to levels of white identity. I often find that a slightly higher percentage of white women identify as being white as compared relative to white men. In some ways this runs counter to a narrative that I have never found very compelling. There is this argument that the most disgruntled and aggrieved person in the United States is the working-class white man. From that premise one would expect such a person to measure high on indicators of white identity. In fact it is white women who identify as being white, more so than do white men.\n\nOne potential hypothesis is that people tend to want to  identify with higher status groups. If you're a white woman and you have a choice between identifying with your gender or your race you are likely going to pick your race because it is the higher status identity.\n\nHistorically and through to the present, white women have been deeply involved with supporting, enforcing and benefiting from white supremacy. How does this complicate alliances across the color line between women?\n\nThere are several things going on here. Many people think that white women are really aligned with the Democratic Party. They are not. Most white women in the United States have voted for Republican candidates. There have only been two elections since the 1950s in which the majority of white women have not voted for Republican presidential candidates.\n\nWhy is this? Married white women tend to adopt the partisanship of their husbands. White women are moved to vote for Republicans in part because of the influence of their husbands. I can imagine a response where someone says, \"That's so disappointing.\" Most people do not realize that white women in the United States are not very progressive when it comes to their views about gender roles. We have the sense that women are vastly more supportive of egalitarian gender roles in the United States, and that's not actually true. In fact, women in general, and white women in particular, are pretty supportive of more traditional gender roles.\n\nThis is not very surprising. Women have traditionally been more excluded from the political world. As such, it is less likely that they are  going to develop their own separate sorts of political interests or political views from their husbands. That is just the reality of gender dynamics in the United States. There have also been some interesting patterns when we look at the 2016 presidential election. There was a really big educational divide that has not been observed in previous elections. If you look back to 2012 and compare white women with a college degree and those without a college degree, the two groups did not vote that differently.\n\nBy comparison, in 2016 white women with a college degree who were not happy about Trump were much more likely to vote for Clinton.\n\nWhat of the obvious and overt white supremacy increasingly advocated for by Republicans such as Steve King and, of course, Donald Trump? How does that fit into your findings about white identity politics?\n\nI've asked people on surveys the extent to which they think that whites have made greater contributions to human civilization than people of color. A huge percentage of white Americans agree that whites have made greater contributions.\n\nOne of the dangers of white identity politics is that white people as a group definitely do not want to associate themselves with the Ku Klux Klan. They do not want to be seen as white supremacists. Nevertheless many white Americans do hold such attitudes. And these attitudes do start to look a lot like those which are espoused by bonafide members of white supremacist hate organizations.\n\nThis is where we really need to start worrying as a country: These arguments by white extremist groups are starting to sound pretty persuasive to a sizable group of white people. If these dangerous messages are being delivered by politicians who are not wearing white Klan robes, but instead who seem like they have some degree of decorum, then that racism seems reasonable. I believe that many white people are willing to openly adopt the views of white hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and others.\n\nWhat does whiteness and white identity mean for white voters in Trump's America, versus white people who supported Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton?\n\nMany of the white voters who supported Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton do not really think about their racial identity or feel a strong attachment to it. And there is a subset of these white voters for Obama and Clinton who do possess a more progressive type of white identity where they recognize the privileges or advantages that they have as a result of being white in this country and would prefer a more racially egalitarian society.\n\nWhat are you most worried about regarding America's future? Does anything give you hope?\n\nI'm worried about going backwards and away from the racial progress we have made as a society here in the United States. I'm also worried about the increasing legitimacy of racialized language and racism.\n\nIf we look at public opinion data, Donald Trump is not doing well. There is some hope: A sizable percentage of both white Americans and Americans of color are angry about our current political moment with Donald Trump and all that he has done to the country."

      "text": "Watch: White Arizona 'Karen' gets a literal slap in the face after grabbing Hispanic woman and telling her she's 'going back to Mexico'\n\nDuring the Trump era, one has seen a pattern of racists telling people of color to go back to the country they came from - even if they were born and raised in the United States. One such incident, according to TMZ, occurred at a gas station/convenience store in Phoenix on June 6, when an older white woman got into a heated argument with a young dark-skinned woman. And the younger woman, the video shows, was not shy about defending herself.\n\nThe older woman, who was described as a \"Karen\" by the man who filmed the incident with his cell phone, was upset because the gas pump outside wasn't working - and when she got into an argument with the younger woman inside the convenience store, she told her to go back to her country. The older woman demanded to know, \"Where were you born?\"; the younger non-white woman responded, \"Where were you born, bitch? I was born in America, bitch. Where are you ancestors from? They're not from this country.\"\n\nThe older woman insisted, \"You're going back to Mexico\" before shoving the younger woman - who responded by slapping the older woman in the face after being shoved.\n\nAnd the older woman was also upset with the man who called her a \"Karen\" and was filming the incident, telling him, \"You will leave too.\"\n\nThe \"Karen\" meme has been inspiring a lot of debate on the left. According to the meme - which has become popular among some liberal Millennials and members of Generation Z - a \"Karen\" is a demanding, entitled middle age white woman or suburban soccer mom who makes life hell for underpaid workers in the service sector. Typically, the meme says, \"Karen\" demands to speak to the manager.\n\nSome feminists consider the meme sexist and ageist, but others on the left - including the Washington Post's Karen Attiah , who is African-American - have defended it as a perfectly legitimate attack on white privilege and class privilege."

      "text": "Inclusive DNC Chooses White Man To Save Party - And Gun-Grabber Hogg As Vice Chair\n\nIn the wake of its general election beatdown, the party that's dedicated to smashing America's \"white heteronormative patriarchy\" has elected a lily-white, heterosexual man to its top position . Hitherto unheard-of Minnesota Democratic Party chair Ken Martin will be the new national \"chairperson,\" while skinny 24-year-old gun-grabber and general-purpose ignoramus David Hogg is among three vice chairs .\n\nIn a bold move, Democrats elect a strong black woman to be the new head of the DNC and not the whitest guy you've ever seen. pic.twitter.com/bJNofpC9Sf\n\nEvidencing a party that's still in denial, the DNC leadership race didn't center on why the party has lost control of the House, Senate and White House. Martin has, however, promised to lead a \"post-election review.\" He better get on it quickly: Only 31% of US voters view Democratic Party favorably .\n\nIn his campaign, Martin positioned himself a \"pro-labor progressive,\" however, some progressives were put off by his willingness to embrace donations from \"good billionaires.\" To hardcore progressives, that's an oxymoron . He's also rankled some progressives with his establishmentarian support of a strong US-Israel relationship -- an issue that caused major 2024 divisions in the Democratic Party and sapped leftist enthusiasm for the Harris campaign . In that context, he's been known to play an identity card of his own: Raised as a Catholic, Martin has used the fact that his mother is Jewish to try shutting down his challengers on the topic.\n\nIf Democrats were seeking to infuse a trace of genuine masculinity into the party's brand, it couldn't have chosen a worse duo than Martin and Hogg. For starters, the married-with-two-kids, mild-mannered Martin comes from the same is-that-guy-really-straight mold as Tim Walz, the Dems' exceedingly cringy 2024 veep candidate:\n\nNow, it all makes sense! Ken \"Kenergy\" Martin was Tampon Tim's life coach and advisor 😂😂😂 I couldn't imagine a more perfect fit for the new DNC chair pic.twitter.com/Lp1CkhROBC\n\nThen there's Hogg, the noodle-armed leftist and perpetual meme-target who deftly exploited his status as a student at school victimized by a mass shooter, becoming a gun control activist and snagging a Harvard University acceptance letter. On Saturday, he persuaded delegates that he's just the man to win back the many young men and women who abandoned the Democratic nuthouse in November.\n\nDavid Hogg is the Dylan Mulvaney of Greta Thunbergs. https://t.co/NzoAuEmF6B\n\nHere's Hogg last year, being nicely eviscerated on his core issue by a Chinese immigrant who escaped Communism and understands why the Constitution protects the human right of armed self-defense:\n\nDavid Hogg torched by a Chinese immigrant warning against gun control. This is what happens when liberals do an open mic. They get wrecked. They can't defend their positions. pic.twitter.com/aeUGq0ff0c\n\nAs incoming chair, Martin takes over from a black man, Jaime Harrison. Despite being the first non-woman or \"person of color\" in 14 years to lead the party, some Democrats see Martin's election as a cause for sorrow. \"Black women have always been the backbone of our party. We show up our communities, our party and our party in every election,\" former DNC staffer Marilyn Davis told Politico . \" Yet time and time again, we are overlooked when it comes to the top leadership positions in our party.\"\n\nAs for the black female candidates who were \"overlooked\" in favor of Martin, here's the unorthodox campaign speech of Dr (PhD) Quintessa Hathaway :\n\nWHAT THE!?️... During a forum for candidates running for DNC Chair, one of the candidates broke out INTO SONG. pic.twitter.com/v0tSVdKCMR\n\nApparently, that was just a warm-up...\n\nThe DNC is in shambles... SO LET'S SING!!! pic.twitter.com/TirfGCMZlD\n\nAnd here's a vice-chair also-ran demanding that delegates shut up and listen to her -- not out of courtesy, of course, but out of deference to her position on the identity-politics totem pole:\n\nI'm watching the @DNC Vice Chair candidate speeches live right now so you don't have to and I'm laughing so hard. Every other words is about race, gender and sexuality 🤣🤣 They've learned absolutely NOTHING. Every single speech is like this lmaoooo 👇 pic.twitter.com/k1yT14Da2H\n\nSpeaking of gender and sexuality, the identify-politics madness of the American left was hilariously illustrated when \"gender-balancing\" rules threw a monkey wrench in the officer elections, leaving everyone in the room baffled about how in the flying &%$# to apply them:\n\nNEW: DNC chair gets confused by his own party's rules for their \"gender balance provisions,\" has to hand over the mic to someone else who also can't explain it during leadership voting. This is absolutely insane. This party has learned nothing. pic.twitter.com/mK456Gljof\n\nThere was plenty more to laugh at -- and plenty of reasons for Republicans to think the Democrats are still drowning in Marxist identity politics, and completely detached from what most American normies want out of their government:\n\nI had a spare moment this morning, so I turned on the DNC election. This is the first thing I saw, a nerdy unmarried white woman putting on black affect and cursing - a perfect epitomization of the party. Chef's Kiss. pic.twitter.com/cedv2Ntd2Q\n\nEvery DNC Chair candidate just blamed Kamala's loss on \"racism and misogyny.\" The party's learned nothing & refuses to take any accountability for how their neoliberal corporatist policies have contributed to the very inequality they pretend to care about. pic.twitter.com/O1iRSnNGe5\n\nThis is DNC headquarters: one noticeable thing here is the lack of young fervent men in the room. And you wonder why male voters shifted away from dems last election. pic.twitter.com/I6E0uYh5jT\n\nThe party that whines endlessly about DEI just elected two white, straight (allegedly), privileged, males, Ken Martin and David Hogg, to be DNC chair and vice chair. Rules for thee but not for me? At least they don't seem to be tired of losing yet. pic.twitter.com/TDE3tkA2My\n\nDNC's Got Talent, Can Dr. Quintessa Hathaway Impress The Judges? 🎤🎵 pic.twitter.com/PZu1VdzeOO\n\nFirst Kamala, now David Hogg. I can't stop laughing 😆 pic.twitter.com/nChD35M1al\n\nIf the DNC thinks that David Hogg is the way to appeal to voters under 30, they are even more out of touch than I thought.

      "text": "In The Jan 6 Killing Of Ashli Babbitt, A Leftist Double-Standard On Cop Misconduct\n\nVia Brian McGlinchey at Stark Realities\n\nContrary to exaggerated, partisan rhetoric that frames the Jan 6, 2021 Capitol Hill riot as a \"deadly insurrection,\" the truth is that only one homicide occurred that day. The victim, an unarmed Trump supporter, was shot and killed by a police officer with a history of irresponsible handling of firearms, who opted against a nonlethal response to an act of trespassing , and who fired his weapon in the absence of any imminent threat of death or serious injury to himself or others in his vicinity.\n\nUS Capitol Police (USCP) Lieutenant Michael Byrd's killing of Ashli Babbitt came just six months after George Floyd's death under the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, an incident that sparked outrage, widespread calls for police reform, and nationwide rioting. In the case of Babbitt's killing, however, the collective reaction from the American left and major media at best amounted to an indifferent shrug . Worse, many reflexively heralded Byrd as a hero and viewed Babbitt as a deserving recipient of the bullet that perforated her trachea and lung.\n\nThe contrast illustrates how partisan framing short-circuits people's ability to uniformly and objectively apply principles to the facts before them . Put another way, an intellectually honest person can reject Babbitt's politics, condemn her unlawful conduct on Jan. 6 and rightly conclude that she was the victim of an unjustified police shooting.\n\nIn 2021, the Department of Justice announced it had completed an investigation of the shooting and found \"insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution.\" The DOJ did not, however, assert that Byrd's use of deadly force was warranted . Last year, Babbitt's husband filed a civil suit against the federal government, seeking $30 million in damages; the trial is slated to commence in July 2026 .\n\nBabbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from San Diego who operated a pool business with her husband, attended the \"Save America\" rally in Washington on Jan. 6 before joining others who proceeded to the Capitol grounds. After things escalated and rioters breached the Capitol building, she entered it, and a female police officer reportedly instructed her to walk toward the House side of the complex.\n\nHere's how the DOJ described what happened next; I've bolded three words I'll address shortly:\n\nMs. Babbitt was among a mob of people that...gained access to a hallway outside \"Speaker's Lobby,\" which leads to the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives. At the time, the USCP was evacuating Members from the Chamber, which the mob was trying to enter from multiple doorways. USCP officers used furniture to barricade a set of glass doors separating the hallway and Speaker's Lobby to try and stop the mob from entering the Speaker's Lobby and the Chamber, and three officers positioned themselves between the doors and the mob.\n\nMembers of the mob attempted to break through the doors by striking them and breaking the glass with their hands, flagpoles, helmets, and other objects. Eventually, the three USCP officers positioned outside the doors were forced to evacuate . As members of the mob continued to strike the glass doors, Ms. Babbitt attempted to climb through one of the doors where glass was broken out. An officer inside the Speaker's Lobby fired one round from his service pistol, striking Ms. Babbitt in the left shoulder, causing her to fall back from the doorway and onto the floor.\n\nThough it's not narrowly relevant to Byrd's decision to pull the trigger, the DOJ's passive-tense claim that the three officers on Babbitt's side of the doors \"were forced to evacuate\" is important because it indicates an extreme inclination to put the best spin possible on officers' decisions . Video shows those three officers failing to make any meaningful effort to stop those who were hammering the glass doors. After enduring mounting verbal abuse and violations of their personal space, they simply walked away from the doors, clearing the way for the rioters to remove the glass from a side window and for Babbitt to proceed through the opening.\n\nAccording to the 32-page complaint filed in the civil suit, one of those three officers later told investigators, \"I grapple with this, you know, if I should've stayed.\" More pointedly, one of the members of the Containment and Emergency Response Team (CERT) who ascended the stairs from behind the mob told investigators, \"I was thinking why, why the fuck did they leave?\"\n\nSome of the most damning information in the civil complaint comes from Byrd's own mouth. In a 2021 NBC interview conducted by an excessively sympathetic Lester Holt, Byrd said:\n\n\"I could not see exactly what was happening [on the other side of] the door...it's impossible for me to see what's on the other side because we had created such a barricade - it was high enough that the visibility was impossible.\"\n\n\"[Babbitt's] failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers.\"\n\n\"It was later [that] I found out that the subject did not have a weapon, but there was no way to know that at that time , and I could not fully see her hands or what was in the backpack or what the intentions [were].\"\n\n\"Of course we had our weapons drawn as part of our training. You had [false reports of] shots fired onto the House floor, you're trained to take a tactical defensive position and prepare for the threat.\"\n\nThere are many unsettling things about Byrd's statements, chief among them his admission that he saw no weapon in Babbitt's hands, and had \"no way to know\" if she was armed or what her intentions were. \"Without additional information indicating that a person is likely armed, officers cannot conclude that someone has a weapon just because they cannot see definitively that the person does not have a weapon,\" wrote Geoffrey Alpert, Jeff Noble, Seth Stoughton at Lawfare .\n\nAmong other incriminating elements of Byrd's NBC interview:\n\nByrd asserts that Babbitt's mere failure to comply with orders not to proceed through the door justified the use of lethal force.\n\nHe implies that (false) reports of shots fired somewhere else in the Capitol gave him a green light to start shooting noncompliant people in his vicinity; in other words, he seems to have made a blanket assessment that every trespasser in the building posed an imminent danger justifying deadly force.\n\n\"Officers cannot rely on generalized assumptions. They must base their conclusions on specific and individualized facts,\" the Lawfare authors note.\n\nUnsatisfied with merely defending his killing of Babbitt, Byrd used the NBC interview to declare himself as a hero , telling Holt, \"I showed the utmost courage on January 6... I know that day I saved countless lives.\" That latter boast is truly extraordinary, especially considering it was made with the benefit of hindsight. It would be one thing for Byrd to try attributing his deadly decision to a reliance on bad information amid the chaos of Jan. 6; it's another to lionize himself with a baseless claim of rioters' murderous intent.\n\nUnder USCP policy, lethal force is only authorized when \"the officer perceives that the subject poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.\" As Babbitt rose to awkwardly enter through the open window - where she would next have to awkwardly navigate a furniture barricade on the other side - there was no indication that she had the ability to seriously injure or kill anyone.\n\nAs seen in video of the shooting , Byrd's positioning was problematic; the civil complaint characterizes it as an \"ambush.\" From the perspective of the rioters, Byrd was positioned on the far left, at an angle some 160 degrees from Babbitt, who was on the right side of the doors. Before stepping forward and killing Babbitt, Byrd was tucked inside another doorway, with only his pistol extending past the opening.\n\nIt's very unlikely Babbitt saw his raised pistol and knew she was being threatened with death if she went through the window. Indeed, one of those three officers who inexplicably abandoned the doorway on Babbitt's side told investigators, \"I saw him . . . there was no way that woman would've seen that .\" What's more, Byrd told Holt that he repeatedly screamed \"get back..stop...get back...no,\" but made no claim that he verbally warned Babbitt that she was on the verge of being shot.\n\nBy all indications, Babbitt's unarmed ascent to the window was a circumstance that called for the use of nonlethal force . That could have taken many forms - a firm shove back through the window, yanking her forward to the floor, or perhaps using pepper spray or a taser. While not clear how the various officers were equipped, note that police aren't justified in resorting to deadly force just because it's all they have available. It's telling that, among multiple armed officers on that side of the doorway, Byrd was the only one who opened fire.\n\nThe civil complaint also credibly accuses Byrd of failing to handle his firearm in accordance with USCP policy, by:\n\nUnholstering it before any imminent threat had emerged to justify doing so\n\nFailing to hold his pistol at a \"low ready\" position and instead pointed it at people who posed no imminent threat\n\nPutting his finger inside the pistol's trigger guard, \"tapping it on and off the trigger for at least 14 seconds before he shot and killed Ashli.\" Across law enforcement, the military and in civilian self-defense, it's a universally-embraced principle that one's finger shouldn't be put inside the trigger guard until a decision to fire has been made.\n\nAfter shooting Babbitt, Byrd took to his radio, his voice filled with panic - and a self-serving falsehood . \"We got shots fired in the lobby. We got shots, shots fired in the lobby of the House chamber. Shots are being fired at us and we're sh... uhh, prepared to fire back at them,\" he said, seemingly so desperate to justify his action that he falsely reported coming under fire himself.\n\nIn the aftermath of incidents involving excessive use of force, we often find the officer in question has a blemished service record. That's the case with Byrd, whose checkered past includes irresponsible handling of firearms. In 2019, Byrd was suspended for 33 days after he left his loaded weapon in a Capitol Visitor Center complex bathroom for nearly an hour; it was discovered by another officer.\n\nEven more concerning was a 2004 off-duty incident. Byrd fired his service weapon at a stolen car fleeing his neighborhood - hitting it from behind . Investigators said Byrd's claim that he fired at the car in self-defense as the driver attempted to hit him was \"inaccurate.\"\n\nThey also determined that Byrd put his innocent neighbor in the line of fire as he pulled the trigger. Stray rounds hit nearby homes, according to the Babbitt civil complaint. Foreshadowing Byrd's decision-making on Jan. 6, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) concluded he'd fired in a \"careless and imprudent manner. \" That finding was overruled, however, via an appeal to the Disciplinary Review Board.\n\nIn another off-duty incident, Byrd was given a seven-day suspension without pay in 2015 after accosting a police officer providing security at a high school football game, showering him with profanities and reportedly calling him \"a piece of shit, asshole and racist\" who was only concerned with policing the \"black side\" of the football field.\n\nFurther underscoring the double-standards at play in the Babbitt case, imagine the response from the left if there were a controversial shooting in which a white male police officer had demonstrated a similar, racially-charged loss of composure years before killing an unarmed black female trespasser.\n\n\"The ironies of Babbitt's death abound-and not just because in this case the cop with the quick trigger finger was black and his victim was a white woman, \" wrote Jonathan Tobin. \"Both those who are supporting Byrd and those who consider the pass he got from his superiors an injustice have probably been on the opposite side of similar controversies in the past year. Some of those who think Babbitt was the victim of a police murder have defended officers accused of killing unarmed black persons. And many who are lauding Byrd as a defender of democracy were outraged by the same killings.\"\n\nStark Realities undermines official narratives, demolishes conventional wisdom and exposes fundamental myths across the political spectrum.

      "text": "Biden Picked His Cabinet Based on DEI. How Did That Work Out for Him? Not well.\n\nF our years ago, when then-President-elect Joe Biden was selecting members of his Cabinet, one concern dominated: diversity.\n\nThe pressure to choose candidates for top offices who were either women or from minority races was immense. Politico reported in November 2020 that Democrats \"expect[ed] him to nominate the most diverse Cabinet in history.\" Luckily for DEI-obsessed Democrats, Biden was happy to comply. After all, the president had promised to create a government that \" looks like America .\" In the end, the president's administration was judged by numerous media outlets to be \"the most diverse ever.\" CNN totaled in January 2021 that 50 percent of Biden's nominees for Cabinet positions and Cabinet-level positions were \"people of color.\" Biden had also named the most-ever women as Cabinet secretaries.\n\nIn rolling out his picks, Biden repeatedly framed the selections through the lens of diversity. For instance, when Biden announced his senior communications staff, he led with the fact that they were all female. \"I am proud to announce today,\" he said , \"the first senior White House communications team comprised entirely of women.\"\n\nUltimately, the selection of the most racially diverse Cabinet ever did not lead to a desirable outcome for Biden. A major shift to the right among minority groups, a growing recognition that DEI is toxic and unfair, and electoral defeat soon followed.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has strongly rejected Biden's strategy of picking Cabinet appointees based on race, even though his proposed Cabinet is diverse in gender and race. As Alex Stroman, a former South Carolina GOP state party executive director, explained last week: \"I think that's where the country is at: we want a Cabinet that is diverse based on many different experiences and backgrounds, be it sexual or racial, economic, or cultural.... But the American people don't want diversity for the sake of diversity.\" Indeed, Americans are done with officials being chosen for what they represent over what they can provide to the country.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth looking back on just how utterly race dominated Biden's Cabinet selection process, and how this reaped a whole-of-government obsession with race. Repeatedly, Cabinet members who were selected for diversity, equity, and inclusion reasons went on to obsess over DEI in their own leadership - to the extent that the administration became a giant conglomerate of DEI.\n\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin (Alexandros Michailidis/Shutterstock)\n\nVirtually everyone in the liberal media sphere was convinced that Michèle A. Flournoy, who had been the highest-ranking woman at the Pentagon under Barack Obama, would be nominated by Biden as the next defense secretary. NBC News even referred to her as \"Biden's probable pick to run the Pentagon.\" But then the Congressional Black Caucus decided to wage a campaign to get Biden to select a black defense secretary. It was reported that the Biden transition was indeed \"concerned about the optics of the top four Cabinet officials - State, Defense, Treasury and Justice - being white,\" and thus the search for a black defense secretary began. Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson was seen as the frontrunner among the black choices, but ultimately Lloyd Austin, a retired four-star general who had previously been the commander of U.S. Central Command, won the role.\n\nAustin went on to implement DEI into all levels of the military. In fact, for fiscal year 2024, the Pentagon asked for $114.7 million in DEI funding. All the while, Austin presided over a time when most branches of the military repeatedly failed to reach their recruiting targets.\n\nFormer HUD Director Marcia Fudge\n\nDemocratic Rep. Marcia Fudge pushed publicly to be named secretary of agriculture because of her race and loyalty to Joe Biden. \"As this country becomes more and more diverse, we're going to have to stop looking at only certain agencies as those that people like me fit in,\" she said . \"You know, it's always 'we want to put the Black person in labor or HUD.'\" Fudge further asserted that the Biden administration should elevate her because of the role black women played in the election: \"When you look at what African American women did in particular in this election, you will see that a major part of the reason that this Biden-Harris team won was because of African American women.\"\n\nDespite her dismissal of the position, Fudge was ultimately nominated to be secretary of Housing and Urban Development. In her role, Fudge elevated racial equity in housing policy. For example, she revived an Obama-era rule that required local governments to \"proactively take meaningful actions to overcome patterns of segregation, promote fair housing choice, eliminate disparities in opportunities, and foster inclusive communities free from discrimination.\" Nevertheless, homelessness increased markedly under her tenure.\n\nAmbassador to the UN Linda Greenfield-Thomas (Alexandros Michailidis/Shutterstock)\n\nWhen Linda Thomas-Greenfield was picked to be ambassador to the United Nations, her appointment was widely seen as a statement for diversity, as some on the the Left had viewed her firing during the Trump administration as racially motivated. (For her part, Thomas-Greenfield said upon her firing, \"I don't feel targeted as an African-American. I feel targeted as a professional.\") Upon her elevation to the ambassador role, a senior diplomat told CNN that Thomas-Greenfield's selection was a \"statement\": \"Just having a Black woman heading the transition and likely heading the US mission in New York is a big deal.... And to have it be a Black woman who was fired by Trump, that's even more of a statement.\"\n\nDuring her tenure, Thomas-Greenfield has repeatedly injected claims about systemic racism into her foreign policy and diminished the U.S. on the world stage in the name of atoning for past injustices. At a speech in March 2021 at the UN General Assembly, for instance, she said , \"Because Black Lives Matter, we need to dismantle white supremacy at every turn.\" She further said in that speech that America has \"deep, serious flaws,\" and that Biden would seek to address them through such policies as \"ending private prisons that warehouse young black and brown men\" and \"combatting xenophobia and discrimination against Asians, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders.\"\n\nAt another time, Thomas-Greenfield claimed , \"[S]lavery weaved white supremacy into our founding documents and principles.\" The Washington Examiner noted that China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran have \"used the U.N. to propagandize against the U.S. on human rights,\" and that Thomas-Greenfield's comments would be used to delegitimize the U.S.'s role on human rights.\n\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland (Romie Miller/Shutterstock)\n\nFreshman Rep. Deb Haaland was picked to be interior secretary because of her Native American heritage. Her selection generated an explosion of puff pieces that lauded how poetic it was that a Native American would be heading a department that has \" mistreated and neglected Indigenous Americans .\" Retiring New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall, a white man who had been seen as a frontrunner for the position, praised Halaand's selection as a \"watershed moment for Native communities, and for our nation.\"\n\nHaaland went on to make woke posturing her top priority. She went on a \" healing tour \" to apologize for Native American boarding schools. She focused on \"Indigenous Led, Nature-Based Solutions to Climate Change.\" She authorized a \"Derogatory Geographic Names Task Force\" that sought to change the names of 660 geographic features that had the word \" squaw \" in their names. And she launched a \"Strategic Plan to Advance Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility\" that worked to \"root the agency's work in equity and justice.\"\n\nSecretary of Education Miguel Cardona\n\nMiguel Cardona, who had been commissioner of the Connecticut State Department of Education, was selected as the third Latino candidate for the Biden Cabinet. After he was selected for the role, Cardona spoke about how his experience arriving in kindergarten only speaking Spanish inspired him to focus on \"making schools more equitable\" and \"closing achievement gaps between students of color and their white peers.\"\n\nDuring Cardona's tenure, student test scores have slipped markedly as social agendas have taken on a greater role. Cardona has prioritized \" educational equity ,\" and schools have focused on topics such as gender ideology and DEI.\n\nIn his capacity as education secretary, Cardona contributed significantly to keeping children out of the classroom following the COVID pandemic. He aligned with teachers unions, who developed ideological opposition to returning to the classroom, at the expense of students. This included his issuance of a school reopening guidance that was allegedly heavily influenced by teachers unions.\n\nEPA Administrator Michael Regan\n\nMichael Regan, a black man, was Biden's pick for EPA administrator. The pick followed another pressure campaign that called on Biden to choose someone who would prioritize \" environmental justice \" for minorities. The pressure campaign forced Biden to go with Regan over Mary D. Nichols , his first choice for the role, who is a white woman.\n\nIn his first speech as EPA administrator, Regan emphasized an agenda built on \"environmental justice,\" saying, \"We will move with a sense of urgency on climate change, protecting our drinking water, and enact an environmental justice framework that empowers people in all communities.\" The EPA under Regan sought to claim that it was discriminatory for neighborhoods with greater minority populations to have more pollution, even if there was no discriminatory intent. After the agency began a civil rights investigation of Louisiana's permitting process on this basis, Louisiana's attorney general sued , and won. Regan went on to aggressively regulate power plants to such an extent that Republicans warned it would lead to an electric grid reliability crisis.\n\nHHS Secretary Xavier Becerra (Alexandros Michailidis/Shutterstock)\n\nBiden selected Xavier Becerra as his HHS secretary despite the fact that Becerra, then the attorney general of California, had virtually no experience in health. A major reason for the unconventional pick - Becarra's race - can be found in a Washington Post article explaining Becarra's selection:\n\nThe job running the sprawling department often has gone to governors, and public health officials have been urging the Biden transition team to select someone with expertise in medicine, given that the raging pandemic will remain front and center for many months.\n\nBut Biden had also been under pressure to select more Latinos in his Cabinet.\n\nBecerra's background in liberal ideological advocacy, rather than public health, resulted in a pandemic response that prioritized imposing maximum restrictions. Beyond this, he advanced a range of other ideologically driven policies. For example, HHS published a report recommending that federal funding be rescinded from hospitals that do not perform so-called \"gender-affirming\" surgeries. The agency also asserted that \"Gender affirmation, including social transition, and gender-affirming medical care are appropriate and beneficial for many gender minority youth.\" Becerra additionally put forward a guidance document warning pharmacies in states where abortion in illegal that they could be violating federal civil rights law if they refused to fill prescriptions for abortion pills.\n\nBecerra has also placed a major emphasis on wokeness. This year, on \"Transgender Day of Remembrance,\" Becerra put out a statement thanking \"transgender, nonbinary, and two-spirit leaders and trailblazers who epitomize resilience, progress, and joy.\" Becerra has also said that DEI is \"one of our Department's highest strategic priorities.\"\n\n*****\n\nBiden's decision to prioritize race in selecting his Cabinet resulted in an administration fixated on identity politics. As Cabinet members were chosen largely for their alignment with woke ideology and their status within its hierarchy of favored identities, they sought to advance these ideological goals above practical governance - to the detriment of voters' actual priorities.\n\nIn rejecting Kamala Harris - yet another Biden pick who was chosen for her race - voters have rejected this whole racial project.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

That's one of the reasons I've been so lucky with my career,\" Adele said, before adding, \"on top of the obvious of me being a white woman in music.\"\n\nAdele's claim that being white somehow assures success does not exactly square with the list of top female singers in today's music world. Only a few of the most played singers are white, including Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande, and Katy Perry. But many others are not white, including Lizzo, Shakira, Beyonce, Rihanna, Mariah Carey, Alicia Keys, Selena Gomez, Jennifer Lopez, and more.\n\nAdele and Lizzo pose during the 65th GRAMMY Awards at Crypto.com Arena on February 05, 2023 in Los Angeles, California.

Leftists scolded her for not being \"inclusive\" enough and for being \"transphobic\" with her comment.\n\nShe also didn't score any points with the woke left days later when she turned away from transgender contestants and chose a woman as the winner of a striptease contest, insisting, \"But we love being females, but we love being a fucking female, don't we?\"\n\nTwo years before that, she was the target of the left-wing mob for \"cultural appropriation\" by wearing a Jamaican flag bikini and Bantu knots in her hair.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston , or Truth Social @WarnerToddHuston\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

Melanie Stansbury as its candidate for the June 1 special election for the U.S. House seat vacated by former Rep. Deb Haaland (D-NM), who was confirmed last month as President Joe Biden's secretary of the interior.\n\nStansbury defeated state Sen. Antoinette Sedillo López in a remote runoff vote conducted by Democrat State Central Committee members after coming in second in the Democrats' first round of voting.\n\nIn the first round, Stansbury was bested by López, 43 votes to 74 votes, but beat out several minority candidates including Acoma Pueblo member Georgene Louis and multiple Hispanic candidates.\n\nDemocrats have occupied the seat - in the First Congressional District - since 2009 and are now seeking to fill the vacancy left by Haaland, a Native American, in the \"heavily Latino\" district; choosing Stansbury over the several minority candidates may therefore put the race \"in play\" for Republicans, Axios suggested .\n\n\"The selection of state Rep. Melanie Stansbury to replace one of the nation's first Native American female U.S. House members could put a relatively safe Democratic seat in play for a special election in the heavily Latino central New Mexico district,\" the outlet reported, adding that Hispanic Democrat political leaders and activists have indicated state Democrats are \"failing to recruit and develop more candidates of color in the state's rural areas at a time when Republicans are making gains with Latinos nationwide.\"\n\nNew Mexico Republican Party chair Steve Pearce has concurred the seat is winnable for Republicans, telling Breitbart News in an interview in March that, despite the district leaning Democrat, his party is \"all in\" on electing its candidate, and described the seat as a \"pickup opportunity.\"\n\nNew Mexico Republican Party leaders on Saturday chose Hispanic state Sen. Mark Moores in a virtual meeting after considering seven candidates.\n\nPearce issued a statement on behalf of the state GOP after Democrats announced their selection of Stansbury, torching the New Mexico Democrat as an \"out of touch\" progressive.\n\n\"It's imperative that voters understand that her views are anti-New Mexico. She wants to ban fracking, supports anti-law enforcement legislation, and consistently pushes for more spending and higher taxes on our constituents,\" Pearce stated. \"In Washington Stansbury would vote for similar radical policies that align with the most extreme elements of the Democratic Party, and this will cause irreparable damage to our great state.\"\n\nHe added, \"Our economy and way of life will be threatened.

      "text": "Nolte: White Woman Not Woke Enough After Forcing Kids to Worship Black Women\n\nAfter a white mother named Justine Champion forced her four young sons to worship black women, a woke backlash forced her to pull the video.\n\nShe then tried to stop being \"problematic\" with a second video, but was attacked by the Woke Nazis over that one, as well.\n\nObviously, I have no sympathy for Ms. Champion. Using your children like that is grotesque in the extreme. But this is a lesson in how white people can never grovel enough to our Woke Fascist Overlords, which is all part of the plan. The simplest and most effective way to terrorize fools like Mother Champion is to forever change the rules, or better yet, to have no rules at all.\n\nSo on December 30, Champion published a Tik Tok video of her four young sons worshiping black women. \"Me teaching my white boys how to behave,\" the text on the video explained.\n\n\"Black women are the reason [President] Donald Trump is no longer gonna be our president,\" she says as the boys bow in reverence and then march around chanting \"all hail black women.\"\n\nThis humiliation required five takes , according to the Worst Mom Ever.\n\nThe Woke Nazis went right after her for making these \"videos just for clout and not because they genuinely agreed.\"\n\n\"I'm a woman of color and agreed,\" one commenter said on the Tik Tok video. \"But it's annoying when people make these videos just for clout and not because they genuinely agreed.\"\n\nSo Champion responded with this mewling reply:\n\nI know the type you're talking about, so I'm not upset or anything, but I just wanted to clarify that that's not why I made this video. If you want to go onto my page and see some of my content, you can see some of the things [I] regularly do, the actions that I take to help the communities that are marginalized in the United States.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, she added in her defense that she's gone viral before for posting videos of \"women and people of color and the history that's left out of our textbooks.\"\n\nNevertheless, late last week she took the video down, explaining in a new video that \"the LAST thing I wanted to do was put WOC I danger.\"\n\nSo she then replaced the original video with a new video the Post described as \"a snippet of the original followed by a black woman speaking straight to camera, explaining this kind of language is 'putting a target on our back.'\"\n\nAfter the Woke Nazis went after her again, this time on Twitter - including Taylor Lorenz, who works for the New York Times - Champion chastised herself again:\n\nOn Friday, Champion responded to Lorenz's tweet to say that, on reflection, she should have asked herself \"what would black women do?\"\n\n\"I took it down after listening to some black women and their concerns,\" she wrote. \"Others want me to put it back up because they loved it. Either way I'm grateful they helped get rid of trump.\"\n\nThe only thing I learned from this experience is that people on the left have no self-respect.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC .

There was so much pertinent cultural commentary to be made here. I don't get why you have to be in a white woman cosplay to make - (what's really folk/bluegrass/adult contemporary) facsimile \"country\" music. Like you had a phonetics coach, and aced the vowel placements and twang to the lyrical and melodic phrasing that is the backbone of contemporary confederate romanticism in a song.\n\n\"You're reinforcing the false rhetoric that country music is a post civil war white art form. And subsequently reinforcing the idea that there is no racism, segregation, slavery, violence, theft, massacres, plagues, manifest destiny craziness that form the bedrock of epithets like 'proud to be an American,' or 'god bless the usa,'\" Banks claimed.\n\nThe \"Luxury\" rapper also took a shot at Beyoncé's album title, writing, \"Wow, we didn't even try to put even a little effort into a more artistic title?\"\n\nErykah Badu also reacted to Beyoncé's album, calling on the pop star's husband, rapper Jay Z, to intervene.\n\n\"To Jay Z. Say somethin Jay. You gone let this woman and these bees do this to me?\" Badu wrote in a Wednesday X post.\n\nIt remains unclear exactly what Badu was referring to.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and X/Twitter at @ARmastrangelo , and on Instagram .\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

That's the highest share of non-white voter support for a GOP presidential candidate since Richard Nixon, who won 32 percent of the non-white vote in 1960. Trump won 21 percent of the non-white vote in 2016.\n\nIn fact, 18 percent of black men voted for Trump this year compared to 16 percent in 2016, according to the Edison exit poll. Black women backed Trump at a 4 percent clip in 2016. In 2020, 8 percent of black women backed his re-election.

And let me just say this because this congresswoman is a wonderful human being. But when you disrespect Kamala Harris by saying you will call her whatever you want, I know you don't intend it to be that way.

Terri Collins (R) and signed into law by Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R), both of whom are women. And those women, according to Anne Hathaway, and the state's new law will result in the death of poor women, many of whom will be black.\n\n\"As we're resisting, let us also call out the complicity of the white women who made this awful moment possible, and which - make no mistake - WILL lead to the unnecessary and avoidable deaths of women, a disproportionate number of whom will be poor and/or black,\" the Ocean's Eight star said, before urging her 14 million followers to \"Speak up.

Together, we are aligned, a beautiful kind made by god,\" that didn't stop hostility directed at her win.\n\nA post shared by Brooke Bruk-Jackson (@brooke_brukjackson)\n\n\"A White woman can be Miss Zimbabwe in the real world, but a Black girl playing a fictional mermaid character was a bridge too far for some,\" an X user wrote.\n\nCalling the win \"tragic,\" one X user wrote, \"All those beautiful melanted women and you telling me the European woman won a contest for black people!!??\"\n\nAnother user lashed out at Bruk-Jackson for having the \"audacity\" to say she's a pure-bred Zimbabwean.\n\n\"A white girl winning miss zimbabwe is like a transgender winning miss universe,\" another wrote.\n\n\"Pana Miss Universe Zimbabwe I don't want to be racist but It's not giving Zimbabwe ,\" one social media influencer wrote, to which a user replied, \"Haaa for real I don't know which criteria they used but there's a black girl who deserved it.\"\n\n\"And Zimbabwe is letting that other girl represent them for miss universe,\" one X user wrote, insisting, \"Africans need to know we've not gotten to that level of equality don't be fooled We will still be the one to suffer.\"\n\n\"I think my only thing is Miss 'Universe' Zimbabwe should be 'universally' representative of the population, and it's a bit of a shame that she isn't,\" another argued.\n\nAnother described the fact that Miss Universe Zimbabwe was given to a white woman as a \"damn shame.\"\n\n\"Can 95% of Zimbabwean girls identify with this miss universe Zimbabwe, no,\" another claimed.\n\n\"Get well soon Africa!\" a user wrote .\n\n\"Miss Universe should truly represent the heart and soul of her nation. My sister, my mother, they don't mirror this girl. She may hold a Zimbabwean ID, but she resonates British vibes,\" another wrote. \"When we talk about Miss Zimbabwe, it should be about a woman radiating authentic Zimbabwean spirit.\"\n\n\"As the saying goes. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Its a no for me on 2023 Miss Universe Zimbabwe,\" an X user wrote. \"I do not find her representative of the Zimbabwean woman at all.\"\n\n\"This idea of a Barbie beauty has gone on too long without a challenge,\" the user added. \"This is an assualt on Zim women.\"\n\n\"So Miss Universe Zimbabwe has not been a pageant for 22 years. Then when it comes back it has a Coloniser as it's face,\" another user wrote.\n\n\"MUGABE RISE,\" the user added, an apparent reference to Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's former leftist dictator known for his hostility towards whites and crimes against humanity.\n\nMeanwhile, some users highlighted the hypocrisy evident in the negative reactions.\n\n\"If white people are 1% of the population in Zimbabwe. By the lefts definition, they are marginalized & oppressed. Why aren't they celebrating diversity & equity?\" one X user wrote. \"Isn't Brooke Bruk-Jackson stunning & brave?\"\n\n\"This is a classic example of the left's hypocrisy. They claim to promote equality, Inclusivity & empowerment of minority persons. Yet, a white woman being crowned Miss Zimbabwe is somehow an 'injustice' without mentioning that 'whites' are a minority in Zimbabwe,\" wrote another X user.\n\n\"They make up less than a percent of the country's population. So, by their standards, they should be celebrating this, instead they are outraged,\" the user added. \"Then you realise they aren't fighting for equality - but for the reverse engineering of all the injustices of past.\"\n\n\" I'm hearing an outrage is brewing after a Zimbabwe model Brooke Bruk-Jackson, a white woman, was crowned the winner of the Miss Universe Zimbabwe 2023. Does it matter really what colour is the winner? Was it a colour competition?\" another user asked.\n\n\"Oh, the hypocrisy- a black #MissIreland is fine, but a white #MissUniverseZimbabwe isn't? Explain it to me like I'm 5,\" yet another X user wrote.\n\n\"The shoe on the other foot exposes the true reality of the lies when promoting diversity,\" wrote another.\n\nThe matter comes as the progressive left continues to push racial double standards.\n\nIn May, award-winning author and University of Baltimore professor Dwight \"D\" Watkins slammed Disney's newest Little Mermaid , questioning the \"point of having a Black little mermaid if she's just going to be thrown into a center of a white world,\" as he fantasized over a means to \"turn all of the white characters Black.\"\n\nMeanwhile, anti-white sentiment continues to be pushed by the \"woke\" left and mainstream media - which Tesla CEO Elon Musk has accused of being \"racist against whites & Asians.\"\n\nIn March, White Fragility author Robin DiAngelo lauded racially segregated \"spaces\" during a discussion about promoting \"racial justice,\" claiming that people of color \"need to get away from white people and have some community with each other.\"\n\nJoshua Klein is a reporter for Breitbart News.

      "text": "Soros PAC Bets Big On White Women To Deliver 2024 Victory For Democrats\n\nFABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA PAC funded by George Soros is bankrolling a political committee that is trying to convince moderate white women to vote for Democrats.\n\nDemocracy PAC donated $1 million to the One For All Committee, which produces and runs advertisements aimed at persuading \"moderate white women\" to vote for Democrats in \"key battleground states,\" according to a campaign finance disclosure. One For All has, in its past campaigns , supported President Joe Biden, Democratic Senate candidates and Janet Protasiewicz, a Democrat-endorsed Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate.\n\nAll of Democracy PAC's funds have come either from Soros himself or the Fund for Policy Reform, a political advocacy organization founded and financed by Soros, Federal Election Commission (FEC) records show .\n\nThough FEC records indicate that One For All Committee has spent no money on federal political advertisements this election cycle, the organization spent millions between 2020 and 2022 supporting Democrats and opposing Republicans.\n\nPast ads produced by One for All have focused on topics like access to abortion , the child tax credit , COVID-19 and racial justice , among other things. (RELATED: The Soros Empire Is Quietly Targeting A Key Voting Bloc)\n\nOne ad, produced to support 2022 Wisconsin Democratic Senate nominee Mandela Barnes features a white female nurse who says she \"never thought the right to abortion would be overturned.\"\n\n\"That's just wrong,\" she continued. \"This is America, the land of the free.\"\n\nIn another ad, this time supporting the 2022 Senate candidacy of Pennsylvania Democrat John Fetterman, a different white woman argued that voters should put aside their economic concerns and vote on social issues.\n\n\"We're not loaded or anything, but I know that we're going to be okay,\" she said. \"We need to vote not just on the economy but on other issues that are really important to us right now, like reproductive freedom and the environment.\"\n\nAn April Wall Street Journal Poll found that abortion is the most important issue for 39% of suburban women living in swing states, with the majority of them saying that former President Donald Trump's approach to the issue is \"too restrictive.\" Democrats are seeking to make access to abortion a key issue in the 2024 election.\n\nA third ad, this time supporting Biden's 2020 presidential campaign, accused Trump of mishandling the pandemic and reacting too harshly to rioters following the death of George Floyd.\n\nThe ads frequently present white women in suburban homes living with a husband and children.\n\nLiberal megadonor and tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman also supports One For All, giving the organization $500,000 in February, according to a campaign finance filing.\n\nWhite women aren't the only demographic group Soros is targeting to give Democrats a boost.\n\nDemocracy PAC's most recent campaign finance filing also reported contributions to committees focused on mobilizing black and Asian voters. Soros' philanthropic network has also poured tens of millions of dollars into left-of-center Latino advocacy and voter mobilization efforts.\n\nOne For All and a Soros spokesperson did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's requests for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Former CNN Panelist Invokes Cancel Culture, Racism To Defend Himself Against Alleged Flirty Texts To Nancy Mace\n\n[Screenshot/The View]\n\nVanderbilt University professor Michael Eric Dyson invoked cancel culture and racism on Tuesday to defend himself against Republican South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace's accusations that he sent her flirty text messages.\n\nMace alleged Thursday that Dyson sent her text messages commenting on her \"gorgeousness,\" begged him for photos of herself and sent her a kissy face emoji following an argument they had over how to pronounce Vice President Kamala Harris' name during an Aug. 15 CNN segment. The professor said on \"The View\" that Mace entered the alleged messages into Congress' record due to the \"toxic culture\" in modern politics.\n\n\"What you could say 20 years ago, you can't say today. Not because you're suddenly wrong, but the temper of the times have changed. So, if you acknowledge a woman's beauty that adds a power imbalance, there's a problem there. But peer to peer, a different story ... And thirdly, let's look at the politics, we're living in a toxic culture where there's a cancel culture gotcha. We're not trying to elevate, we're trying to eviscerate.\"\n\nDyson said Mace is depending on a \"racist trope\" to accuse him of coming for her in a sexual manner. (RELATED: Rep. Nancy Mace Calls Fellow Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib 'Useful Idiot' For Demonstration During World Leader's Speech)\n\n\"So when it comes to Nancy Mace, you see I tried to be nice to the woman. I said 'you're a wonderful woman,' I lied,\" Dyson said. \"But I tried to be nice to her. And even when I pointed out to her what the repetition of the misnaming of Kamala Harris would do, she got defensive, 'oh, you're calling me a racist.' No, I never did ... The point is that this woman has now depended upon, like her inspiration Donald Trump, a racist trope. The black brute seeks the innocent white woman and now I'm seeking lasciviously to approach her.\"\n\nThe professor, who is also a pastor, further claimed that white Christians still feel guilty about the wrongs done to racial minorities in the past. He called on them to \"grapple\" with the brutal past and forgive themselves.\n\nDyson got into a heated exchange with Mace as he accused her of disregarding Vice President Kamala Harris' humanity by mispronouncing her name during an Aug. 15 CNN panel. During the CNN segment, the South Carolina congresswoman said she will pronounce Harris' name in any way she prefers, and called Dyson's criticisms of her mispronunciations \"BS.\"\n\n\"Now let me just say this, because this congresswoman is a wonderful human being, but when you disrespect Kamala Harris by saying you will call her anything you want, I know you don't intend it to be that way. That's the history and legacy of white disregard for the humanity of black people,\" Dyson said.\n\n\"Oh, so now you're calling me racist? ... That is BS. That is complete BS,\" Mace shot back.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Supreme Court Finds 'Radical Agreement' In Case Of Woman Claiming Anti-Straight Discrimination\n\nMarlean Ames alleges that she was denied promotion and later demoted in favor of far-less qualified gay candidates.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court justices found what Justice Neil Gorsuch called \"radical agreement\" in a case involving a straight white woman who claimed she was denied promotion in favor of less-qualified gay candidates.\n\nThe justices heard arguments from plaintiff Marlean Ames, who alleges that her homosexual supervisor at the time denied her a promotion and later demoted her in favor of far less qualified gay candidates at the Ohio Department of Youth Services, per ABC News .\n\nAt issue was the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals dismissing Ames's case out of hand, claiming that a straight, white plaintiff such as Ames does not meet the \"background circumstances\" required for a discrimination case.\n\nAmes argued that the qualification of \"background circumstances\" is an unfair burden placed on her simply for being straight and should not affect the enforcement of Title VII.\n\nAt the conclusion of oral arguments on Wednesday, the court seemed in near-unanimous agreement to reverse the lower court ruling.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh said, \"discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, whether it's because you're gay or because you're straight, is prohibited, and the rules are the same whichever way that goes.\"\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, one of the court's most liberal justices, called the circumstances behind Ames's demotion \"suspicious,\" more than warranting a chance to present her case in lower courts.\n\n\"We're in radical agreement today on that, it seems to me,\" Justice Neil Gorsuch said regarding the need for the court to equally apply Title VII protections.\n\nThe anticipated decision would not only allow Ames to present her discrimination but potentially set a precedent that makes courts much more likely to take similar cases in the future.\n\nJonathan Segal, an employment lawyer and partner at Duane Morris LLP, suggested the decision \"will reinforce to the public that the law prohibits discrimination equally against majority and minority groups alike.\" He added, \"This likely will increase in all circuits the already increasing number of claims by members of so-called majority groups.\"\n\nAdditionally, Segal said, \"Of course, the Ames decision cannot be viewed in isolation ... A finding of 'reverse discrimination' may subject an employer's DEI programs to federal and state investigations.\"\n\nA final decision is expected by the end of June.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Larry Elder After Attack From White Woman In Gorilla Mask: 'If I Were A Democrat ... This Would Be Called Systemic Racism. They'd Call It A Hate Crime.'\n\nAppearing on Fox News with host Jesse Watters, California GOP gubernatorial candidate Larry Elder, who is the leading GOP candidate to replace California Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom should he be recalled on September 14,  was asked about the incident earlier this week in which a white woman in a gorilla mask fired an egg at him. He responded, \"Well, she might be one of the 20,000 people that were released early from our prisons, felons, many of whom were violent offenders under this governor,\" adding, \"If I were a Democrat, obviously, this would be called systemic racism; they'd call it a hate crime.\"\n\nWatters prompted, \"So you see the white lady in the gorilla mask, throwing eggs. What exactly happened there, Larry?\"\n\n\"Well, she might be one of the 20,000 people that were released early from our prisons, felons, many of whom were violent offenders under this governor; I don't know,\" Elder replied. \"We have too-soft-on-crimes DAs; I consider this to be one of the many intersections in California, intersections between lawlessness and homelessness. I was at a homeless encampment in Venice and a lot of people are angry; homeowners are angry; families are angry children have to go past these people to and from school, and the homeless population is endangered and it's also a health hazard. Nothing's being done about it; that's one of the many failures of this governor.\"\n\n\"So it was a very angry, ugly scene; if I were a Democrat, obviously, this would be called systemic racism; they'd call it a hate crime,\" he asserted. \"I don't like to play that game. I do know this: There was a big article about me, a negative in The New York Times; it never mentioned once that I'm black; never mentioned that I would be the first black governor of California. I've never made a big deal out of that; I don't want people to vote for or against me because I'm black, but on the very same page of The New York Times was an article about the 'first female governor of New York,' even though she didn't get elected; she was basically appointed because the other governor resigned. So they cared about the first when it was a female Democrat but couldn't give a rip about the first when it was a black Republican.\"\n\nWatters said Fox had reached out to Newsom's office as well as the offices of Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Vice President Kamala Harris but got no response. He asked, \"How does that make you feel?\"\n\n\"Crickets. Crickets,\" Elder remarked. \"And when Gavin Newsom's children were criticized because Gavin Newsom mandated that you wear masks outdoors, and his kids were in summer camp not wearing face masks, we put out a statement saying leave Gavin Newsom's children out of this. But the governor has not put out a statement about this woman, apparently, a white woman wearing a gorilla mask threw an egg at me.\"\n\nElder turned to the high-powered Democrats who had campaigned against Newsom's recall: \"I don't expect that, because look, all of these people have come in; Joe Biden has made a statement; Bernie Sanders has made a statement; Barack Obama's cut a commercial, and nobody uttered the following words, Jesse: Gavin Newsom's done a good job for the people of California. You won't hear that because he hasn't. Not on crime, not on homelessness, not on the decline in the quality of public education.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Twitter Users Dunk On Social Justice Warrior For Complaining About 'White Woman' Who Published Dumplings Cookbook\n\nA social justice warrior and culture writer complained on Twitter about the alleged problematic nature of a white chef publishing a cookbook about dumplings and noodles.\n\nRoslyn Talusan insinuated in a tweet that she found the idea of a white woman writing a cookbook about traditional Asian food to be a form of cultural appropriation. Talusan tweeted, \"Why did a white woman write a cookbook about dumplings and noodles.\"\n\nTwitter/@roslyntalusan\n\nTalusan is a freelancer at outlets such as The AV Club, B*tch Media, Refinery29, and Vice. She has posted a slew of controversial takes against white women online, including one that dubbed white women as \"a plague.\"\n\nHer tweet was directed at BBC recipe writer Pippa Middlehurst, a former cancer research scientist turned winner of Britain's Best Home Cook. She studied Chinese cookery at Lanzhou Noodle School and created a cookbook to help people create her favorite dumpling and noodle recipes at home.\n\nTwitter users opted to dunk on Talusan for trying to call out someone so well-versed in Chinese food culture.

In my experience, tweets like this don't challenge the systemic issue, or instigate any change. It just serves to temporarily make me the poster child for that system of injustice - that no doubt I am part of - and simply leads to dog piling and mounds of threatening DMs telling me for .e.g to \"go and drown,\" \"you deserve to fail\" and it ends there.\n\nFollowing the online blowback, Talusan posted her PayPal account to her Twitter feed in hopes of raising funds for her alleged $130 therapy sessions.\n\n\"Anyway, therapy costs me $130/session and I'm gonna need it after almost 48 hours of harassment from nazis.

      "text": "BOOK REVIEW: Proof That Wokeness Is Projection By Nervous, Racist White Women Who Can't Talk To Minorities Without Elaborate Codes\n\nEvidence is mounting that \"wokeness\" is a creation of abnormally anxious and prejudiced white women who feel that elaborate rituals are necessary to interact with people of other races - something that most people, who simply treat them as peers, have no need for.\n\nMatt Taibbi made such a case about Robin DiAngelo this month, highlighting a passage from the \"White Fragility\" author's latest book in which she describes not knowing what to do when having dinner with a black person. She compensates by spouting racial and political bromides in an attempt to prove that she wasn't racist, instead of simply enjoying a dinner with a potential friend.\n\nBut there is an entire class of timid white women who have made a profession out of instructing others in racial matters. And there is an unmistakable pattern suggesting that the racial tensions they sense everywhere are projection - that they are exceptionally sheltered, fragile people who have hang-ups about race and make the faulty assumption that others do, too. In short, what has spawned an industry imposing speech codes and bizarre rituals on society at large might be better worked out by the handful of people it affects in a therapist's office.\n\nDebby Irving has been on the paid race-relations speech circuit since before \"White Privilege,\" writing a book in 2014 called \"Waking Up White.\" Both women draw from the same influences, such as 1980s college academic Peggy McIntosh. Irving has 75 speaking dates this year, bringing her expertise from places like the Martha's Vineyard Nonprofit Collaborative to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Blues Alliance to the Heuvelton School District.\n\nHere - as part of an occasional Daily Wire series called \"We Read It So You Don't Have To\" examining leftist influencers through the words of their own books - we bring you insight into the mind of a white, female race expert.\n\n***\n\nDebby Irving might be the whitest person you have ever met.\n\nHer family came over in the Mayflower era and became major New England landowners. In 1807, it received a land grant in northern Maine.\n\nShe was born in 1960 and grew up in \"an almost exclusively white Boston suburb\" called Winchester, where she attended private schools and spent her free time at the Winchester Country Club and the Winchester Boat Club.\n\n\"I identified 100 percent as a New England WASP, with parents and an extended family who bore all the trappings of the social elite and an extensive network of like-looking and like-minded family and friends with whom to preserve our Anglicized, Yankee culture,\" she writes.\n\nGrowing up, \"I moved about in a world where CEOs were just dads and board chairs just friends and family,\" she wrote. Even if her life was nearly as different from the average white person as it was from the average black person, she ascribes this to race: \"now I can see they were white children with white homemaker mothers and white commuting fathers.\"\n\nEstablishing one's place in the cultural hierarchy of WASP elites meant mastering elaborate social codes for everything, and her early life was largely dedicated to this art. When in the south, she knew to say \"ma'am.\" Among Protestant New Englanders, emotions should always be restrained.\n\nShe was so intent on mastering such protocols that the prospect of a faux pas wracked her with anxiety. If she said the wrong thing at a dinner party, there could be \"tension, silence, or swift change of topic.\" She later suffered from depression and hypochondria.\n\nAfter college, she used her family's connections to \"Boston's corporate and foundation gatekeepers\" to work in the arts, for a dance company.  After one prospective donor said it wanted to help poor people, she gained access to the money by deciding the dance company would rescue children from the \"inner city\" by bringing 500 of them to watch a recital at the Boston Shakespeare Theater.\n\nShe soon realized that there was one set of social codes she'd never been taught: How to interact with such a foreign group. When she was around \"people of color,\" she was like a \"bull in a china shop.\"  She got \"so jumpy when talking to a person of color.\" Dealing with minorities was so strange that she had a name for it: the \"zap,\" similar to a dog running into an invisible fence.\n\nShe married a man who worked in real estate in Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of the most expensive markets in the country, and who produced the TV series \"This Old House,\" and who helped support her volunteer and creative endeavors.\n\nThe professional diversity trainer now splits her time between Cambridge, where 4% of the population in her neighborhood is black, and a lake cabin on the Maine property passed down from the Mayflower era, where according to Census data, there are only 16 blacks in the surrounding 194 square miles.\n\nLikely more than the average person, she was neurotic, oriented around rules and social conventions, and filled with racist thoughts. When she went to a chiropractor, she was \"caught off guard\" to find that he was black, and \"my subconscious began spewing forth feelings of being unsafe.\" When he suggested that she get X-rays, \"a suspicion flashed into my mind that he was somehow in cahoots with the X-ray business and scamming me.\"\n\nEventually, she had a revelation: Her racism wasn't her fault! It was America's. \"How could I live in a racially organized society and not have filed away racial stereotypes?\" She became obsessed with racial dynamics to the point where they overshadowed normal human interaction.\n\nTo try to get a black friend, she thrust herself in front of a teenage boy who was walking down the street. \"Hi there. Isn't this a beautiful spring day,\" she said. The boy ignored her. She knew why he didn't seem to like her: it must have been the \"deep and traumatic history of black men being tortured or killed for speaking to a white woman.\"\n\nWhen she met a Harvard Law graduate who was from Trinidad and therefore had black skin, she was so in awe that she was able to have a normal conversation with her that she wanted to write an article \"exploring our connection across racial and cultural differences.\"\n\nWhen she had children of her own, there were minorities in the school, so she joined \"diversity committees.\" But \"the persistent worrying about doing or saying something wrong perplexed me.\"\n\nShe decided to learn about blacks the way any WASP obsessed with rules and order would: by taking an expensive college course about them.\n\nIn her class, she expressed enthusiasm about the election of Barack Obama, but a black classmate was not happy. \"I don't think that's right, you calling him 'Obama,'\" the classmate said, insisting that he should be called President Obama.  Irving knew that she always called all presidents by just their last name - except for George Bush, who she called \"something much worse.\" But when the stranger said \"Doubt it,\" Irving felt her \"insides churn.\" She didn't know who to believe: herself, or a stranger.\n\nThen she had a discovery. She learned that some of the attributes of \"white culture\" were \"defensiveness\" and valuing \"facts\" rather than \"intuition.\" That was her!\n\nShe was elated that there were more formal classes one could take to teach them the intricate art of speaking with a black person.\n\n\"It excited me to know that there were professionals in the world, 'diversity trainers,' who could help people like me navigate the complex world of cross-race relations,\" she writes.\n\nShe learned \"tips\" one needed to interact with blacks. For example, she learned not to say \"shhh!\" to them at a movie theater. She was fascinated to learn that you should not call a black person articulate.\n\nBut the necessary code was so complex! \"Every workshop I went to left me feeling increasingly aware of how easy it was to say something offensive,\" she writes.\n\nThough she was unemployed, she paid to attend a conference for professionals of color. She also attended the \"White Privilege Conference,\" with 1,500 people, about 85% of whom were white. There, she learned more about the complex behavior that must be followed to properly interface with minorities; for example, you should not ask them what they do for work.\n\nEventually, she went through a transformation. She still had her nerve-wracking anxiety, but this time, it seemed more moral.\n\nWhen she saw herself in the mirror, she \"jumped back in horror. There in the mirror were two bright blue eyes set against dead-fish white skin and unkempt hair the color of the sun... A montage of scary white faces streamed in opaquely over my own. First Hitler, they Yul Brynner in Westworld, and then a stream of white men in business suits.\"\n\nShe concluded that she and other whites were perpetuating racism through such actions as being involved in their children's education, volunteering as \"committee members and room parents.\"\n\n\"I assumed the low involvement of families of color [was] a result of parents working long hours. I had no idea that the more white parents like me-already comfortable in America's public spaces-bonded and took over, the more uncomfortable the school culture became for families of color.\"\n\nBut there were still more tips to learn. And if you, too, are struggling with severe anxiety, a need to organize life into a set of rules that can be taught, and an inability to have authentic friendships with people who don't hail from similarly privileged backgrounds, you can learn them too, from the expert herself.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "A Black Woman Accused A White Woman Of Threatening Protesters. That's Not What Happened, Report Says.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, amidst the COVID lockdowns and Black Lives Matter protests, a white student at the University of Virginia was accused of threatening black protesters and was punished.\n\nBut the account given by the black protester who accused the student wasn't backed up by evidence or witnesses, according to a report from Reason magazine. In fact, the university's student judicial system apparently accepted the white girl's version of events, yet punished her anyway.\n\nIt all began on the evening of July 17, 2020. Then-19-year-old Zyahna Bryant, one of the Black Women Matter protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, that evening, claimed on social media that a white woman in a vehicle approached protesters and told them they would make \"good speed bumps.\"\n\n\"She then called the police and started crying saying we were attacking her,\" Bryant claimed, according to Reason.\n\nTo support her claims, Bryant posted several videos showing an SUV reversing down a street as she and other protesters followed it. Bryant can be heard saying \"It's a Karen, it's a Karen.\" The videos don't show the vehicle's driver saying anything about speed bumps, Reason reported.\n\nIn a Medium post shortly after the incident, the group behind the protest, Charlottesville Beyond Policing, claimed that the woman \"drove around the public works truck blocking the street that demonstrators were convened on, and felt compelled to say, not just once, but twice, that protesters would 'make good speed bumps.'\"\n\n\"The second time she repeated it loudly to a Black protester and added 'good f***ing speed bumps,'\" the group claimed, according to Reason.\n\nOne local news outlet appeared to believe the claim, commenting, \"The threat is especially chilling and violent given that Heather Heyer was murdered by a driver just a few blocks from where the protest took place.\"\n\nA student-run website also said it could \"confirm\" that the white woman \"refused to leave the scene even though protesters were asking her to, and at no point were protesters blocking her car.\"\n\nBecause the vehicle's license plate was featured in Bryant's videos, people quickly identified the driver as Morgan Bettinger, a senior at UVA.\n\nBryant started a campaign to get mass complaints sent to UVA administrators in an effort to get Bettinger expelled, according to Reason. Bryant also filed her own complaint with the University Judiciary Committee (UJC), a student-run disciplinary system that took up the case. The university also said it would investigate the matter.\n\nBettinger's version of events is much different than Bryant's. Bettinger told Reason that she was returning home from work when she saw a dump truck partially blocking the road ahead. She kept driving toward it before realizing that the road was completely blocked. She claimed she had no room to turn around, so she parked her car and stepped out to see why the road was blocked.\n\nShe said that when she did so, the driver of the dump truck started a conversation with her. It was brief and casual, Bettinger claimed, and at some point, she said she told the driver something like, \"It's a good thing that you are here, because otherwise these people would have been speed bumps,\" Reason reported.\n\nBettinger told the outlet that, after speaking to the truck driver, she walked around the truck to see the protest, took a photo, and went back to her car. She said some protesters then started recording and following her, so she jumped back in her car and called her mom. She claimed the crowd became aggressive and some started shouting at her, with one pounding on her windows.\n\n\"With the one woman hitting on my car and other people shouting and starting to threaten me, I didn't know what was going to happen,\" Bettinger told Reason.\n\nAt her trial before the UJC, Bettinger faced Bryant for the first time. After each woman told her story, the UJC found Bettinger guilty, even though it seemed to accept that her version of events was the truth. Reason Magazine reported it could not find any rationale behind the panel's decision, except for a paragraph that was read to Bettinger after she was found guilty.\n\n\"We the judges of this trial panel find that your actions on July 17th were shameful and put members of the community at risk,\" the jury read, according to Reason. \"You yourself acknowledged saying 'it's a good thing you are here because, otherwise, these people would have been speed bumps.' Given the tragic events of August 12 and the context in which you uttered these words, you disregarded Charlottesville's violent history. A history you should have been cognizant of as a UVA student and resident of Charlottesville. During these proceedings you have shown no understanding of the risk this statement posed.\"\n\nThe panel referenced the August 12, 2017, Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, which involved white supremacists and the death of a white counter-protester, Heather Heyer.\n\nBettinger was sentenced on September 28, 2020, to 50 hours of community service at a social justice organization, three meetings with a professor to teach her about \"police community relations,\" an apology letter to Bryant, and she was expelled in abeyance, meaning she would be expelled if she committed a second offense similar to this one.\n\nBettinger graduated but had a mark on her record preventing her from moving on with her life, as well as the notoriety that came from the assault on her reputation.\n\nA year later, UVA's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) completed its own investigation based on a separate complaint filed by Bryant, which claimed Bettinger harassed her based on her race.\n\nThe EOCR investigation, completed in June 2021, found that Bettinger didn't legally harass Bryant and provided more detail on Bryant's original complaint, according to Reason.\n\nReason obtained a copy of the EOCR report, which it said showed that individuals interviewed by the office claimed Bettinger made the \"speed bumps\" remark five times, but only one had actual evidence supporting it: The same one Bettinger admitted to making and said wasn't a threat.\n\nThis was also the only allegation made by other witnesses and not by Bryant.\n\nThree of Bryant's four allegations weren't corroborated by other witnesses, even though they occurred in front of a large crowd, according to Reason's review of the report. In two of her allegations, Bryant changed her story, Reason reported. The fourth allegation - that Bettinger allegedly made a \"speed bump\" threat over the top of her car - had a witness to back up Bryant's claim, but that witness contradicted themselves and Bryant when interviewed. Bryant also later told investigators she wasn't sure if she heard Bettinger make this particular threat, according to Reason.\n\nVideo evidence also supported the idea that Bryant never heard Bettinger say anything about \"speed bumps.\" Instead, another protester makes the claim while Bryant is filming, to which Bryant responded with surprise, the EOCR report said.\n\n\"Based on Bryant's immediate and surprised tone following the second third party's reply, EOCR finds it more likely than not that it was at that moment Bryant first learned that [Bettinger] made a statement about protestors making speed bumps,\" the report said according to Reason.\n\nEven though Bettinger's outside lawyer argued that the EOCR report exonerated Bettinger, UVA's president refused to overturn her sanction, saying it had been \"properly adjudicated,\" Reason reported.\n\nSince the ordeal, Bryant has continued to participate as a social justice activist, while Bettinger reportedly lives in a state of limbo, unable to move forward.\n\n\"This whole situation has had a huge impact on my life,\" Bettinger told Reason. \"The university has never had to answer for what their actions have done.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "WALSH: 'Karen' Is An Anti-White Racial Slur\n\nAn \"Instagram influencer\" (i.e. a rich woman who takes a lot of selfies) was at the center of controversy this week when she got into a heated argument with Lebron James during a Los Angeles Lakers vs. Atlanta Hawks game in Atlanta. Juliana Carlos, who had courtside seats next to her husband, claimed in a video after the spat that Lebron called her a \"f***ing b*tch.\" Carlos returned the favor, calling Lebron a \"f***ing p***y\" along with a host of other choice terms. There is no evidence that the NBA star actually said what he is accused of saying, and Carlos has since issued an apology and claimed full responsibility for the episode.\n\nLebron has had little to say about all of this publicly, except to tweet: \"Courtside Karen was MAD MAD!!\" The Courtside Karen moniker quickly caught on, started trending on Twitter, and now most of the media headlines about the story use that nickname in reference to Carlos. This has been the trend for the past year or so. Obnoxious white women - or white women who are labeled obnoxious, fairly or not - are called \"Karen,\" sometimes with an additional identifier like \"Courtside\" or \" Soho .\" A culture that finds nearly everything \"problematic\" has somehow found no problems with this.\n\nAdmittedly, in Juliana Carlos's case, the charge of obnoxiousness certainly applies. I have no interest in defending her on a personal level. Wealthy Instagram influencers who make fools of themselves in public are not widely viewed as sympathetic characters, and I have no intention of trying to change that. But what I loathe even more than spoiled brats like Carlos are double standards, and the \"Karen\" meme represents a rather massive one. \"Karen\" is in fact a racial slur, both in its common usage and its original intent, and I can find no compelling reason to give it a pass. A racial slur is a racial slur. They are all bad - even when used against white people, believe it or not.\n\nAnyone who doubts the racial connotation of \"Karen\" need only listen to the people who originated and popularized it. Articles like Time Magazine's \"The 'Karen Meme' Confronts the Violent History of White Womanhood\" and Teen Vogue's \"Karen Is Being Used by White Women - Here's Why They Need to Stop\" make it clear not only that \"the archetypal Karen is a white woman\" but that those who came up with this slur are very possessive and protective of it. As the Teen Vogue piece clarifies, the \"Karen\" meme is \"an inside joke within communities of color.\" White people who adopt it or try to erase its racial connotation are guilty of a kind of slur-appropriation.\n\nA Daily Beast essay from earlier this month says that \"'Karen,' like the once-popular phrase 'Becky,' became a moniker to describe white women who were problematic.\" The author expresses a desire to abandon usage of the term, but not because it's racist. He fears instead that Karens are being dangerously \"normalized.\"\n\n﻿\n\nIf you prefer to go to Wikipedia for your information, here's what that site says about the origins of \"Karen\":\n\nThere are several possible origins of the term. One theory is that it is an evolution of an African-American Vernacular English term of referring to \"unreasonable white women.\" The term may have originated on Black twitter as a meme used to describe white women who \"tattle on Black kids' lemonade stands\". Bitch [magazine] described it as a term that originated with Black women but was co-opted by white men.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a racial term. That is not a question. The question is whether, though it is a racial term, it qualifies as a racist term, a slur. To answer that question we can try a very simple thought experiment. Let us imagine an exactly analogous situation. What if white people on Twitter started to refer to obnoxious black women using a stereotypical black woman name? In order to properly frame this, let's consult an ABC News article from a few years ago listing what they call \"The Top 20 'Whitest' and 'Blackest' Names.\" Near the top of the \"blackest\" female names list, according to ABC News, is \"Shanice.\" As a hypothetical example, what if there were an \"inside joke among white communities\" where unpleasant black women were  called \"Shanices\"? Imagine: \"Oh man, I was at the grocery store and this Shanice comes up to me and... etc.\"\n\nWould there be any doubt about whether that qualifies as racist? Would anyone dare suggest that it isn't racist? I certainly wouldn't. It would be absolutely clear to me that using a stereotypical black female name as a pejorative to refer to black women you don't like is extremely bigoted, in just about every conceivable way. Everyone would be on the same page. We all would agree that \"Shanice\" is a slur, and obviously so. Many thinkpieces would be written with titles like \"The Shanice Meme is An Attack On Black Womanhood\" and \"'Shanice' Proves Racism Is Still Alive,\" and so on. The excuses offered for \"Karen\" wouldn't pass muster in the case of \"Shanice.\" Just think:\n\n\"It's okay because the women we call 'Shanice' actually are annoying and obnoxious!\"\n\n\"'Shanice' isn't racist. Sometimes the word is applied to white people, too!\"\n\n\"Black women call each other 'Shanice' sometimes. That must mean it's not racist!\"\n\nAll of these justifications are offered for \"Karen.\" They would not work in the \"Shanice\" hypothetical. And they shouldn't, because they're weak, silly, and beside the point.\n\nIf it is so obvious that \"Karen\" originates as a racial slur, is intended to be a slur, is often used as a slur, and this exact kind of slur would never fly when applied to people of other races, then why do so few white people object to it? I think it is because white people in modern American culture don't think they're allowed to object to this kind of thing. They have come to believe, after years of brainwashing, that it would be racist for them to recoil from racism targeted at them. Or else they believe that racism towards other groups is a deep moral evil while racism towards them is, at worst, a frivolous concern. This is all wrong, of course. Racism is racism is racism. It is all bad. It is all worthy of condemnation. And we should not make exceptions in this case.\n\nThe views expressed in this piece are the author's own and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

An anonymous letter from members of the organization and others accused Saraswati of \"cultural vulturism\" and asked that she resign.\n\nThe Intercept spoke with family members of Saraswati who said that she was misrepresenting her identity. \"I call her Rachel,\" Carol Perone, Saraswati's mother, said. \"I don't know why she's doing what she's doing.\"\n\nPerone told the outlet that her daughter is not Latina, South Asian, or Arab as previously portrayed, but instead has a family background originating in Britain, Germany, and Italy. \"I'm as white as the driven snow and so is she,\" Perone said. \"She's chosen to live a lie, and I find that very, very sad.\"\n\nOskar Castro, a human resource professional with a focus on DEI who helped to bring Saraswati to the AFSC, told The Intercept that he felt \"deceived\" because he believed that she wasn't white, and checked a variety of diversity boxes.\n\n\"In my mind, it was, 'Great, a person of color, a queer person of color, who happens to be a Muslim, it's a woman,' all these things, and someone who seemed to get it. I definitely feel conned,\" he said.\n\nSaraswati also faced criticism for past appearances on outlets like Fox News.\n\n\"People are concerned,\" a member of AFSC's leadership told The Intercept. \"There's a fear that she could be an agent, because she started her career right-wing. She was a token Muslim voice in that milieu. She never publicly apologized.\"\n\nLayne Mullett, a spokesperson for the AFSC, said that it does not require its team members to \"prove\" their ethnic identity.\n\n\"We are in receipt of the documentation alleging that our Chief Equity, Inclusion, and Culture Officer, Raquel Saraswati, has been misrepresenting her identity. AFSC has given Raquel the opportunity to address the allegations against her, and Raquel stands by her identity. Raquel also assures us that she remains loyal to AFSC's mission, which we firmly believe,\" Mullet said.\n\nSaraswati would not be the first person to mislead the public about an ethnic identity for apparent career advancement. Rachel Dolezal, the former NAACP Spokane chapter president, made headlines in 2015 when she was revealed to be a white woman pretending to be black.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Why The Hysterical Left Wants To Keep A White Woman From Painting A Black Man\n\nBack in March, protests erupted over a painting displayed at the New York City Whitney Museum's biennial. Some activists stood in front of the picture, trying to block others from viewing it. Others called for it to be taken down, and some even called for the work to be destroyed. But it wasn't Jesse Helms, Rudy Giuliani, or any other conservative upset about offensive art. It was progressives who were offended. The offense? Cultural appropriation.\n\nThe painting in question was \"Open Casket,\" a portrait of Emmett Till. Till, an African-American boy, was brutally murdered in 1955 for allegedly flirting with a white woman. His somber legacy still haunts an America struggling to come to terms with racial division. The controversy over the painting was not about its content, however, but its creator. Artist Dana Schutz is a white woman, and for some that makes her a person who should not paint a picture of Till.\n\nThis week in Boston, tempers over Schutz's work flared again as a solo show of hers went up at the Institute for Contemporary Art (ICA). The painting of Till, her most famous work, was not included in the exhibition, but that didn't stop progressive activists from protesting the platform given to a woman who had given such grave offense.\n\nAs the Daily Beast reported, a group of artists and activists sent a letter to ICA which said, \"Please pull the show. This is not about censorship. This is about institutional accountability, as the institutions working with the artist are even now not acknowledging that this nation is not an even playing field... [\"Open Casket's\"] absence from the exhibition does not excuse the institution from engaging with the harm caused by the work by holding Dana Schutz accountable.\"\n\nWhile it is easy and correct to call this censorious letter a hodgepodge of dangerous and silly hokum, we must understand why such calls to ban art are increasingly emerging. In this case, the casus belli is the fact that a white woman painted an image of Till. According to Schutz's detractors, since a white woman's lies about Till's actions half a century ago led to his death, no white woman should treat the incident in this way.\n\nIt is a struggle to understand how people arrive at these determinations about who is allowed to create art about a given subject. In this case Schutz clearly meant her painting to call attention to the dangers of racism, yet for this is called racist. Importantly, it is not the art that is deemed offensive, but the artist. This is why protesting one painting is not enough; Schutz must be denied any platform.\n\nThese protests are attacking the very concepts of empathy and understanding. Till's murder shook and still shakes the nation precisely because people of all ethnicities shudder at its horror. It is right and just that any artists meditate on Till and share their works he has inspired. If the piece makes one uncomfortable, maybe it should. If it makes people want to ban it, they should think again.\n\nA strong hint that somebody is about to advocate for censorship is when he or she begins a statement by saying, \"This is not about censorship.\" They will often say that only government can censor art, and when individuals get together to stop art from being displayed it is simply an example of the marketplace of ideas. But this attitude suggests that nothing is real unless the government does it. While it is true that individuals calling for an art ban does not violate the First Amendment, it doesn't mean they aren't intolerant and censorious.\n\nCalling on institutions to punish artists by refusing to show their work is in itself an act of censorship. If one has a justification for such censorship, by all means he should say so, but he shouldn't hide from the true nature of his actions. If you want to censor art, own it and tell us why your beliefs should determine what art other people get to see.\n\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about these protests is how utterly sexist they are. Central to the claim that Schutz is a racist who needs to be held accountable is the fact that it was a white woman who lied about Till. What shocking misogyny it is to force Schutz, like a modern Eve, to bear the sins of all women on her back. Quite frankly, had a white man painted the very same picture, we would very likely not be having this conversation, at the very least not in the same way.\n\nSchutz is a white woman, a precarious thing these days. White women, we are told, are responsible for electing Donald Trump, notwithstanding the almost 30 percent of the Hispanic vote that he received. White women, it seems, should have known better, because they are women, or something. White women are bad feminists who need to do less talking and more listening to marginalized voices. White women just don't know their place.\n\nBut all of us only live once. We have one stretch of precious time where our minds explore reality. Nobody should pay the slightest bit of heed to calls for limiting our expression based on our race or sex. The idea that Schutz shouldn't paint an image that is meaningful, respectful, and striking merely because of her skin color is abhorrent.\n\nThere are two main concerns to an artist: beauty and truth. As Keats put it:  \"'Beauty is Truth, truth beauty,'- that is all / Ye know on earth, and all you need to know.\"\n\nTruth and beauty are often hard to marry. When the truth being explored is the brutal murder of a child, beauty seems quite remote. Yet this is the meaningful struggle of existing in a world that can crush us with its horrors and inhumanities. Artists can't be like my grandmother, who whispered when she said the word \"cancer,\" for fear saying it too loudly might make her get it.\n\nDiscovering truth and beauty requires delving deeply into our minds and souls, searches that make artists different from those who do not practice art. That exploration cannot be encumbered by the assertion that some phenomena are off limits because of what you look like.\n\nA cynic might say that this controversy is good for Schutz for spreading her fame. Perhaps. But I suspect that is little consolation for her. She has been accused of doing harm to people by painting a picture of Till. Nobody wants her legacy to be, \"Was she a racist or not?\"\n\nThese protests need to stop. Schutz did nothing wrong. Every artist, and indeed all of us, needs to stand firm and tell those who would engage in censorship that we will not have it.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "White Impersonators Of Minorities Are Not Racist, They're Grifters\n\nSome white people are pretending to be 'persons of color' because it is professionally and monetarily beneficial to do so.\n\nLast month, Raquel Saraswati resigned her position as chief equity, inclusion, and culture officer for a Philadelphia-based advocacy organization after it was revealed she was not who she had claimed to be. Saraswati, who worked for the the American Friends Service Committee, presented herself as not only Muslim, but also Latina, South Asian, and of Arab descent. But a Feb. 10 letter written by friends of AFSC claims she was misrepresenting herself and her family lineage.\n\nThe Intercept tracked down her mother , Carol Perone, who claimed she was born Rachel Elizabeth Seidel. \"I don't know why she's doing what she's doing. I'm as white as the driven snow and so is she,\" declared Perone. The Daily Mail published a gallery of photographs depicting Saraswati's transformation from childhood to adulthood.\n\nCue the leftist outrage. \"There could be the feeling of estrangement or disassociation with all the baggage that comes with white colonialism,\" African American studies professor Deborah Whaley told USA Today . Racial grievance Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah bemoaned that \"white women deploy racial cosplay - and get away with it.\"\n\nAttiah approvingly cited sociology professor Robyn Autry, who in 2020 claimed this was a \"twisted attempt to be seen and heard.\" Attiah in turn claimed that \"non-white cultures, physical features and clothing styles are frequently seen as ripe for appropriation, things to be tried on and discarded as if they were costumes on sale at Party City.\" She even accused Saraswati of doing it to perpetuate \"White power structures.\"\n\nThese takes couldn't be more wrong.\n\nWhite people such as Saraswati, Rachel Dolezal, and Jess La Bombalera do not appropriate other cultures and races in order to be seen and heard. The whole \"Karen\" phenomenon demonstrates white women are perfectly capable of soliciting attention by doing stupid things without impersonating another race.\n\nNor do they do this because they view other races or cultures as \"things to be tried on and discarded,\" as if they have no respect or appreciation for what they appropriate. In truth, they have an obsession with the races and cultures they appropriate, desperately (and embarrassingly) trying to be something they're not.\n\nIt's like that suburban white high-schooler who in everything he does - hobbies, clothes, mannerisms - tries to act black. \"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,\" wrote Oscar Wilde.\n\nNo, what most deeply motivates these racial impostors is far less sinister or Freudian: it's all about money and power. Saraswati achieved notoriety and a cushy - if also a uselessly woke - job as an \"equity, inclusion, and culture officer\" through her fabricated identity. She represented moderate Muslims on national television (including Fox News!) and appeared as a hijab-wearing activist in the documentary \"Honor Diaries.\"\n\nDolezal - a white woman from Montana who claims to be \"transracial\" - was the former head of the Spokane, Washington chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. La Bombera - who is actually Jessica Krug, a Jewish girl from suburban Kansas City - leveraged her fake identity as a North African and Caribbean black person to acquire a position as a professor of African history at George Washington University.\n\nIn short, white people are pretending to be \"persons of color\" - an incoherent designation if ever there was one - because it is professionally and monetarily beneficial to do so.\n\nThis should not be surprising to Attiah or anyone else benefiting from the billion-dollar racial grievance industry. Many thousands of people are pulling lucrative salaries \"working\" in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) offices at universities, corporations, and federal offices across the country. Corporate media employ journalists and pundits to gin up new stories related to the racial grievance industry, or pen predictable, whiney thousand-word op-eds ensuring no stone lies unturned in identifying racism in America.\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones has achieved incredible success as a leader in this industry, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars for public appearances, while her 1619 Project curriculum has been sold to schools across the nation . Anti-racist ideologue Ibram X. Kendi has also made hundreds of thousands of dollars - sometimes $300 per minute - for his presence at such events.\n\nRobin DiAngelo has made millions selling her wares to corporations and organizations as an anti-racism expert. In a victimhood economy like ours, there will always be people who will identify whatever means they can to acquire that victimhood capital and make a buck.\n\nThe racial grievance industry, operating under names that are curiously antithetical to what they actually practice - DEI is quite emphatic in its exclusion; anti-racism is quite vocally racist - is big business, as I've argued elsewhere . And wherever there is money to be made, con artists, hucksters, and grifters are likely to show up to get in on the take.\n\nIndeed, Attiah's complaints are not a little ironic given that she is just such a grifter. Just take a cursory look at the content she writes for The Washington Post , and you'll get an idea of how effective she is at exploiting racial grievance to advance her career.\n\nThis is what we get in a culture that tells people the most important thing about them is their race or sex. Those who can claim the mantle of a victimized racial, sexual, or gender class are the ones today most capable of gaining cultural, professional, and financial capital.\n\nIt should be little surprise, then, that some unethical (if also enterprising) white people take advantage of the system by impersonating victimized people. The proliferation of transgenderism is simply another manifestation of this attempt to get attention by claiming victimhood status. Our culture, and especially our elite institutions, are overrun with victimhood narratives.\n\nAmateur psychoanalysis of white women as being unparalleled in their malice towards racial minorities is flatly disingenuous and absurd. You can see that in the simple fact that no one is impersonating black people in thankless jobs at McDonald's or driving a commuter bus.\n\nLeftist accusations against these deceitful fools are as shallow and reductionist as you can get. Then again, given the attacks are made by other racial grievance grifters, we shouldn't be surprised. Their industry is at stake.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Why Do So Many White Women Hate Themselves?\n\nSome might find it odd that so many seemingly middle-class, young, white women are taking up street theater with a vengeance. We've seen the woke white woman spitting harangues into the faces of police officers, including black officers , trying to lecture and shame them into obedience.\n\nTwo women are screaming at the cops outside the White House. pic.twitter.com/V9wTsoFDzf\n\n- Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) June 23, 2020\n\nWe saw many of them acting up in the \"autonomous zone\" of CHAZ or CHOP in Seattle, condescendingly guarding a \"blacks only\" area. We've also seen these women physically attacking those they deem the enemy, including a Democrat state legislator in Wisconsin. A 29-year-old white woman was arrested for setting fire to the Wendy's restaurant in Atlanta after the police altercation and shooting there last month. Another was filmed setting fire to police cars. The list goes on.\n\nSome observers see all of this as a contradiction. Since the \"woke white woman\" tends to be college-educated, many think she must be smart. Since she comes from a middle- or even upper-class suburban background, people assume she must be emotionally stable. Because she is socially aware, she must be interested in trying to understand people as individual human beings. How is it that such a woman can so easily become an arsonist, a terrorist, a mobster, and a taunter of black police officers?\n\nShe shows none of the positive traits expected of her. Her commitment to identity politics demands she reject people as unique human beings. Since she insists racism is \"systemic,\" she is forever guilty and therefore cannot be emotionally stable. In her obedience to the coercive thought reform of the education establishment, she has surrendered the right to think independently.\n\nOther observers don't see contradictions, but a catty and spoiled girl whose main pursuit is the collection of status points - of which the latest method is to pose as an ally of the Marxist Black Lives Matter movement. She could be the one giving you the finger as she cuts you off in her Mercedes, and her natural habitat is the public middle school where she is forever stuck scanning the landscape for winners and losers.\n\nThe woke white woman seems to come from the ranks of both the conflicted and the narcissistic. Even a woman without these problems, however, can be seduced into the wokeness cult mindset.\n\nWhat caused the woke white woman to break onto the scene? For the sake of illustration, let's revisit an extreme case of initiation, the case of Patty Hearst . Aside from being a newspaper heiress, Hearst was an average 19-year-old college undergrad looking forward to marrying her boyfriend. Within a couple months, however, she took part in a bank robbery while wielding an assault rifle. What happened in the interim?\n\nHearst was kidnapped by terrorists of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in February 1974. They isolated her in a closet and put her through Maoist-style indoctrination sessions, schooling her in \"white privilege\" and \"systemic racism\" even though those terms were not yet in wide circulation. They explained to her that \"Amerikkka\" was a racist and evil society. Day after day, they called her a privileged \"bourgeoise bitch\" and her father a \"pig of the corporate fascist state.\" She duly memorized the propaganda they assigned her, and though she was harassed and even raped, she was also fed and sheltered.\n\nIsolation and predatory alienation were key to Hearst's transformation. Separated from any familiar influences, she became totally dependent on her captors and bonded with them. Once cemented, that Stockholm Syndrome bond is not easily broken. When Hearst agreed to join the SLA after six weeks in captivity, she emerged with the new identity \"Tania\" and publicly disavowed her family.\n\nAfter most of the active SLA members were killed weeks later in a shootout with police, Hearst had countless opportunities to simply walk away. Instead, she remained a fugitive with a small SLA remnant for the next 16 months. She later said her brainwashing was so thorough that she had no free will, no sense of self, and couldn't think her own thoughts.\n\nGranted, the typical woke white woman today is not Patty Hearst. But we ought to ask about similar forms of persuasion that are common in the constant propaganda that grooms her in K-12 and higher education, and from media and celebrities. After years of constant messaging - particularly with the vilification of the enemy \"other\" - certain psychological patterns and scripts are bound to sink in.\n\nWe should be able to discern several parallels between the indoctrination of Hearst and today's woke white woman. For example, although not literally locked in a closet, the woke white woman is exposed to various types of diversity training and white privilege workshops. Similar gaslighting and guilt-mongering are common elements of struggle sessions , and themes such as \"racist!\" and \"America is evil!\" are common. Stark accusations against self and homeland are psychologically manipulative and destabilizing to one's sense of identity.\n\nHearst's experience included memorization and other indoctrination exercises typical of Chinese brainwashing of American prisoners during the Korean War. The \"White Fragility\" craze constantly imposes such exercises in academia, the media, and pop culture. The woke white woman even experiences a similar sense of isolation because exploring any different viewpoint could get her shunned and smeared. As with Hearst, the woke white woman is more likely to disown any friends and family who don't get with the program.\n\nFinally, she becomes a deployable agent for the cause, willing to engage in out-of-character activities once she crosses the Rubicon and joins up with the Marxist Black Lives Matter cult.\n\nShe cannot seem to find any outlets that allow any alternative view. Big Tech and media propaganda constantly threaten her with social isolation and guilt by association if she dares go off script. Cultural trash such as Teen Vogue tells her exactly what she must say, think, and do to qualify as an \"ally,\" her only hope for social acceptance.\n\nShe must endlessly address \"systemic racism\" and identify as socialist to be woke. Her emotional to-do list seems as endless and exhausting as the to-do list for the residents of Jonestown .\n\nThe woke white woman is a chameleon when facing the threat of social rejection. This sensitivity, as well as her newfound social consciousness, positions her as an effective influencer. Out she goes to engage in mayhem and commit emotional blackmail on behalf of the wokeness cult.\n\nThere's nothing new about emotional blackmail, but there is something new in how it is being used so blatantly to force people to support the Marxist Black Lives Matter chaos. Many are cutting off friends and family if they don't agree that racism is systemic (and therefore unsolvable). The woke daughter of a candidate for office in Michigan recently tweeted , \"[D]o not vote for my dad,\" and collected many \"you go, girl\" status points in response.\n\nAs such women sniff the wind for signs of wokeness, they compromise all principles of objective morality. Not too long ago, these same women may well have shuddered at the prospect of injecting their children with puberty blockers, but now that transgenderism is de rigueur in K-12 and pop culture, these same women will pat themselves on the back as they march their kids into gender clinics and surgeries.\n\nThe problem with following the zeitgeist winds is that they can blow in horrific directions. The psychological mechanism that drives the woke white woman of 2020 into Black Lives Matter obedience is the same mechanism that would have driven her into the National Socialist Women's League of Nazi Germany in 1941. It might sound weird, but both appeal to the same forces: craving for status, the need for belonging, obedience to overwhelming propaganda, hatred of a common perceived enemy, terror of being lumped in with the \"unfit,\" fear of shunning by the in-group, and rejection of objective morality.\n\nA final critical question is an unsettling one: Where does the woke white woman draw the line? If she can be an arsonist, a provocateur of black police officers, and an easy fit for a mob, then what else would she do? Would she be a kindred spirit with Charles Dickens' character Madame Defarge and support mass executions of her perceived enemies? If executions turn out to be the woke thing, widely propagandized as the only solution for systemic racism, should we be the least bit surprised if she were?\n\nMany more of us must challenge the menace of this psychological weaponry embedded in today's turmoil. If we don't, the agitprop machine of Big Tech, the education system, and the media will continue to manufacture these manipulations in an endless feedback loop, with ever more catastrophic consequences.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "How To Have A Normal, Friendly Conversation: A Guide For Race-Obsessed White Leftists\n\nThis New York Times advice column is truly a case study in how delusional, narcissistic, and anti-social the mind of the modern left really is.\n\nThe New York Times recently introduced a monthly advice column wherein a woman named Jenée Desmond-Harris answers questions by white leftists racked with anxiety about being white and interacting with minorities.\n\nIt's truly a case study in how delusional, narcissistic, and anti-social the mind of the modern left really is.\n\nThis month's column is headlined , \"How Should I Respond to Creepy Questions About My Friend's Race?\" and the submission is centered on the troubles of a white lady who doesn't know what to do when white men inquire about her female friend, who is of Asian descent.\n\n\"On several occasions,\" wrote the poor woman, \"I've been at a bar or party with an Asian-American friend and when my friend is getting a drink or off to the bathroom, a man (it's always a man) will ask me, 'Where is she from' or 'What type of Asian is she?'\"\n\nYou can almost see her sweating now, unsure whether to lecture the offending party or start flipping over tables.\n\n\"I really don't know how to deal with this situation productively as an ally,\" she continued. \"I usually don't mention it to my friend both because I feel it's my responsibility to deal with it and because we'll probably never see the offending person again.\"\n\nNote that \"as an ally,\" this white leftist carries the weight of the world on her shoulders in such high-stakes moments. This is her responsibility and she desperately needs answers.\n\n\"How should I handle these sorts of perpetual-foreigner questions?\" she asked. \"Should I tell my friend when it happens?\"\n\nIf you aren't suspended in awe by this scenario all too common for white leftists, the advice Desmond-Harris offers should really get your gears turning.\n\nDesmond-Harris answers the reader by first explaining that the men asking about her friend are \"at least to some extent fetishizing your friend's ethnicity,\" suffering from a thing called \"yellow fever.\"\n\nShe advises the reader to \"find out how your friend sees these kinds of questions,\" but cautions her not to \"act as if you're breaking news when you share what's been happening.\" She further suggests asking the friend if a response to the curious men along the lines of, \"My friend doesn't like it when guys fixate on her ethnicity, so I'm not going to talk about it with you\" would be sufficient.\n\nNone of this is a joke. This reader question and the accompanying advice actually appeared in our country's most important newspaper. And that helpful tip from Desmond-Harris is precisely why the left is so anti-social. They don't know how to have normal encounters because everything to them is a fight, usually over race or gender or sexual identity or some other trivial matter.\n\nHere's some real advice for people like this fraught white woman: Your friend is probably attractive and that's why men are curious about her. If you're the ugly friend, don't take the overtures as opportunities to quash the potential for love. Nobody likes a cock block.\n\nInstead, consider telling the men that they should ask your friend about her background themselves. Or perhaps simply tell them that she's from whatever American city but that her past relatives immigrated from whatever Asiatic country. When your friend returns, let her know that you and the gentleman were just discussing her upbringing. Everyone likes talking about themselves to some degree. This is called socializing.\n\nOne last piece of advice for white leftists: Relax. It's not your job to rescue your minority friends from people who find them interesting.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Montreal Jazz Festival Bans Musical For Allowing White Woman To Sing Slave Songs\n\nOver the past several decades, an important and much-needed effort has been made to expand the Western canon to reflect the contributions of non-white artists and writers. This brings a richer, deeper understanding of our cultural history to the fore and helps us to better understand our society. Last week a terrible step backwards away from these efforts was taken by the Montreal Jazz Festival, when it abruptly cancelled its production of the musical \"SLAV,\" in which slave songs from the nineteenth century played the central role.\n\nAnyone paying slight attention to the art world in recent years will easily guess what the controversy was. White artists were singing songs that black American slaves originated. As the kids like to say, this was \"cultural appropriation.\" After a few dozen protesters shouted at attendees at an early performance of the work, the festival bowed to the pressure and cancelled the show.\n\nThe star of the show, Betty Bonafassi, who is best known for her work in the film \"The Triplets of Belleville,\" has a history of exploring the songs of slavery. In fact, the title, \"SLAV\" instead of \"slave,\" is a nod to her Serbian heritage and the centuries of slavery her people endured. This kind of cultural connection is essential to understanding how art and history intermingle, and how both can point the way to all our shared humanity.\n\nIn one of the most famous (and readable) sections of James Joyce's \"Ulysses,\" a book at heart about cultural mixing, an Irish nationalist gives a speech in which he compares the Irish to the Israelite slaves in Egypt. He is arguing both for self-rule and for rejecting the English language in favor of Irish. The former wins, the latter loses. He imagines Moses as a boy being told how powerful Egypt was, how futile it would be for the Jews to defy it. Then he writes:\n\n\"But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition, he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai's mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw.\"\n\nThe language of the outlaw becomes the law. The songs of the oppressed become the anthems of equality. Not only were black slave songs also steeped in the stories of the Old Testament, they were also in many cases illegal. Many of the songs contained codes to help slaves escape, a grave crime at that time. Others helped to educate a group of people for whom education was forbidden.\n\nThe idea that all men are created equal is mentioned by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence, but it is enshrined in the blood and courage of black Americans who refused to be enslaved. Their songs played a powerful role in that fight, and as such are a profound and essential cultural legacy, not just for all Americans but also for all human beings.\n\nThe irony of the insistence that only black artists should perform artwork created by black people is that through this segregation black cultural achievement is decentralized and denied its deserved place in the common cultural canon. While artists of any kind are free to engage the work of Ludwig van Beethoven and Francis Poulenc, most artists are being told not to engage with slave songs or Chuck Berry.\n\nThis is folly. In its most literal sense, \"canon\" means a collection of sacred books or works, widely accepted as important and genuine. When a work enters the canon, not only is it immortalized (or the closest thing to it) it also becomes universal. The idea that black people have a proprietary right to the artistic contributions of people who lived more than a century ago has become almost unquestioned in the art world. But what a disservice that is to the creators of these works, which speak to us through time, and have earned the right to be a part of all of us.\n\nEvery culture is eventually subsumed by new ones, but the question is, how much influence does it have over the new ones? The contributions of black Americans, including their refusal to accept slavery, a central story of all Western culture, should play a central role in all Americans' understanding of themselves. That can't fully happen when those contributions are siloed behind cultural border walls.\n\nOver the past few years in the academy, organizations like Heterodox Academy and outlets like Quillette have begun to fight back against a campus culture they find illiberal and stifling. It is time for the right-minded people in the arts to find ways to challenge norms that restrict the ability to engage in the cultural output of ethnic groups.\n\nTellingly,  had this show had an all-black cast and crew, there would be no objection to its content. The 8,000 or so theater-goers who are now getting refunds would have experienced these powerful songs and their stories. There would have been reviews, perhaps recordings, and the knowledge and awareness of these vital songs would have been greatly expanded.\n\nThat spreading of the word is how the canon is established. Those who seek to deny artists the ability to do that important work based on the color of their skin are working at cross-purposes. On the one hand they rightfully want the contributions of black Americans to sit equally alongside the Old Testament and \"Ulysses,\" but on the other they are silencing attempts to do that very thing. It almost seems as if these protestors are profoundly more interested in what they have to say about today's world than what the great black artists of the past had to say about theirs.\n\nArtists and audiences need to explicitly reject these attempts to silence past voices, even if arts organizations fold under the pressure. They must pursue and support a truly diverse view of the arts in which every artist is not only free, but urged to take on the stories of any culture, to better understand them and bring them into the fold of the cultural canon.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "It's Time For The Conversation About Black Lives To Stop Focusing On White People\n\nThe tragic deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd have led to riots, civil unrest, and protests against police brutality, systemic racism, white supremacy, and what many see as a disregard for black life in America. Many protesters link the deaths of Abrey, Taylor, and Floyd to past injustices, asserting that racist whites and police pose the same threat, or worse, to black Americans today.\n\nThese passionate claims have met broad agreement from leftist elected officials, media outlets, and entertainers. The ubiquity of the claims, combined with their general lack of relevant supporting evidence, highlights a distinct peculiarity within black political culture: black leaders fight harder against white supremacy than they do for black progress.\n\nThis phenomenon manifests itself in the tendency for the black leadership class to elevate the values, beliefs, and behaviors of white people above those of black people. That is why public discourse about the obstacles facing blacks in America is dominated by things white people must fix - like \"systemic racism\" or \"unconscious bias\" - rather than things black people can control, such as their culture and values. This perverse line of thinking gives the impression that black problems only matter when white people cause them, and that white thoughts are more important than black actions.\n\nBy and large, the more a story can be tied to systemic racism or white supremacy, the more it will be amplified in popular culture. For instance, what started as a white woman trying to harness racial stereotypes to get a black birdwatcher in trouble with the police turned into prominent people wildly overreaching and comparing the incident to Emmett Till's murder. What followed was a predictable chorus of columns, cable news appearances, and Twitter history lessons about how white women pose a critical threat to black men.\n\nActual threats to black life, by contrast, attract much less national outrage. Shootings and homicides have risen dramatically this year in large urban cities across the country, yet there seems to be more concern for performative public art projects than protecting the lives of the black people being gunned down in the bloody hellhole of Brooklyn.\n\nProbably no one epitomizes everything wrong with the black intelligentsia more perfectly than Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson. A frequent media presence on matters of race, Dyson participated in an MSNBC panel discussion that mocked people who express concern about the impact of absent fathers on young black men, going so far as accusing them of engaging what he called the \" magical black father \" myth.\n\nAs a social scientist, Dyson should be supremely aware of research that shows children raised by their married biological parents do better across numerous social and economic indicators than children raised in other family arrangements. Yet, for some curious reason, he never mentioned that.\n\nDyson's appearance on Fox News a few years later showed what he actually believes would improve the condition of black people. He suggested white people could set up individual reparations accounts to offset the systemic injustices they believe blacks still face in America today.\n\nThese two appearances embody the essence of this destructive worldview that is rooted this odd brand of white superiority propagated by leftists - any action by whites that appears to expose or address systemic racism, regardless of how trivial, is to be prioritized over any initiative black people take to improve our own lives, regardless of how important.\n\nIt may be difficult to determine the exact motivations of the individuals who engage in this behavior, but its effects on the black community are clear. Rhetoric from black leaders about black Americans being hunted down because of their race is unsupported by evidence, but the vicious cycle of misinformation, hyperbole, and social media amplification increases fear, anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness.\n\nThat is why it is so important to ground any analysis of social problems in objective facts. For instance, the percentage of black-on-white homicides in 2018 was twice as high as white-on-black murders, a statistic that has been consistent for decades .\n\nIt's also easy to debunk claims that \"murderous police\" and mass incarceration constitute an ongoing genocide against black people . In the past five years, about 25 percent of those shot and killed by police were black, and only 2 percent were unarmed. Yet the truth distortion caused by the media gives the impression that police only shoot unarmed black men.\n\nIn reality, nearly half of the people killed by police in the last five years have been white, including whites who have died under the weight of an officer's knee , during a no-knock warrant operation, shot in the back , shot in their doorway with their hands up , and shot after calling the police to report a crime.\n\nThe mass incarceration narrative also crumbles under any scrutiny. Contrary to popular books like The New Jim Crow and documentaries like 13th , racist drug enforcement is not what is behind the large population of black Americans behind bars. The truth is that 61 percent of black inmates in state prisons - by far the largest part of the prison system - are there for violent crimes. Drug possession accounts for just 3 percent of the black prison population, and all drug offenses account for 13 percent of the black prison population, a rate lower than white or Hispanic offenders (16 and 14 percent, respectively).\n\nThe power of the white superiority complex held by black leaders doesn't just come from distorting racism, but also from minimizing any issue that requires self-examination and self-correction within black culture. There is no greater example of this than the reluctance of black leaders to publicly address the decades-long disappearance of the black nuclear family . We black Americans may talk about the importance of family structure amongst ourselves, but any leader who addresses it publicly - including President Obama - is denounced by leftists and accused of engaging in \"respectability politics.\"\n\nViolent crime against blacks is another issue that only inspires national attention or outrage when a white perpetrator is involved. The sad truth is that, despite being 13 percent of the population, blacks make up more than half of the nation's homicide victims each year.\n\nWhere the race of the offender is known , blacks are also the offenders in more than 90 percent of black murder cases. While intra-racial violence is the rule for every demographic group, the homicide victimization rate for blacks is six times higher than whites, a fact that explains why, at 39 percent, homicide is the leading cause of death for black males ages 15-34.\n\nThe prioritization of white beliefs and values over black ones also extends into popular culture. That is why a video of two men being arrested in Starbucks for not buying anything and ill-considered ad campaigns from H&M and Gucci inspire nationwide calls for boycotts, while a hip hop icon like Snoop Dogg can be a brand ambassador even after showing up to an award show with two women on dog leashes , bragging about his time as a pimp , and referring to a veteran black female journalist as a \" funky dog head b-- .\"\n\nThe black intelligentsia should have forcefully denounced these behaviors. Yet degrading black women, much like when black men are killed, is only seen as a problem when white people do it.\n\nA black leadership class that claims to care about black lives should be spending the majority of its time trying to address the issues facing the black family and working to positively shape black culture. A venerable organization like the NAACP should be using its political capital, clout, and moral force to promote the \"success sequence\" while imploring black artists to stop polluting black culture instead of getting white Hollywood stars to \"take responsibility\" for racism. Unfortunately, many of the people claiming to care about black lives will dismiss any discussion of black culture and behavior in the black community as a diversion tactic pushed by racists to perpetuate stereotypes about black pathology.\n\nAny political philosophy that says black people are powerless victims of society's institutions and systems who require white people to use their autonomy, agency, and privilege to uplift blacks is held down by the black intelligentsia's unique view of white supremacy. Suggesting whites have a greater capacity for moral reasoning, emotional regulation, and reasoned decision-making than blacks is a paternalistic and infantilizing impulse that should be rejected completely.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the people pushing it are grievance grifters targeting guilty white liberals, anointed prophets of anti-racism who promote sophomoric ideas , or people who would trade the solid substance of black self-sufficiency for the thin gruel of white benevolence . Any social, cultural, economic, or political phenomenon that affects other groups can affect black people as well.\n\nIf out-of-wedlock births, drug abuse, and violence hurt the life prospects of white people, why wouldn't the same be true for black people? Black activists and intellectuals frequently criticize whites about their fragility and demand they confront their values and behaviors. It's time for them to take their own advice.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Viral, Out-Of-Context Clips Make Victims Like Pregnant Citi Bike Woman Into Villains Because They're White\n\nManufactured racial animosity is only made possible by out-of-context clips and willing accomplices in Big Tech and corporate media.\n\nWhat happens when a white, pregnant physician assistant who just left a 12-hour shift in a New York City hospital is accosted and has her Citi Bike hijacked by a group of troublemakers who are black? The woman is put on leave by her hospital.\n\nThat's not a bad joke. It's yet another real-life example that proves viral out-of-context videos, manufactured racial animosity, and Big Tech and corporate media's willingness to amplify it pose a grave danger to society.\n\nOn May 12, five people surrounded a woman who had just paid for and mounted a bike rental.\n\n\"This is not your bike,\" the group insisted between laughs.\n\nDespite the woman's repeated calls for \"help,\" onlookers can be seen standing idly by as the throng closed in around the pregnant lady. At one point, the woman grabbed the man's phone and yelled for him to get off of her because \"you're hurting my fetus.\" Instead, he kept his hands wrapped around her body and on the bike's handlebars while his friends heckled her.\n\n\"I'm not touching you! You're putting your stomach on my hand,\" the man said.\n\nThe woman was reduced to tears, which the group claimed were \"fake,\" before eventually taking the advice of a man in scrubs and choosing a different rental to ride home.\n\nIt's safe to say that in an upstanding, civilized society, this scenario never should have occurred, much less been publicized. But this is 2023 in America. Everyone is equipped with handheld cameras with widespread access to social media, and the radical belief that people should be punished for believing or acting outside of the preferred narrative is alive and well.\n\nIdeally, the men at the bike station should have acted chivalrously and assisted the pregnant woman on her journey home, rather than hampering it. Instead, they turned the video over to the increasingly turbulent public square and chronic race hustlers who smeared the woman as a \"Karen,\" a \"suspected white supremacist,\" and a thief who tried to \"weaponize her tears\" and \"endangered\" black men in the process.\n\nA suspected white supremacist woman tried to steal a Citi Bike from a Black kid after he paid for it, and when him and his friends wouldn't allow her to steal it, she went thru all the Karen tactics to try to get the Black youths hemmed up: *Screaming for help *Fake crying *Mayo... pic.twitter.com/dlAxSCQArh\n\nCorporate media outlets similarly framed their coverage of the event around the men being the victims, not the woman, who is six months pregnant.\n\n\"The roughly two-minute video starts with a white woman wearing hospital scrubs straddling a Citi Bike screaming for help even though she doesn't appear to be in danger,\" NBC News claimed in its segment titled \"WATCH: New York hospital worker criticized after viral Citi Bike dispute.\"\n\nReceipts released less than one week after the incident prove the woman at the center of the chaotic clip was, in fact, the one who initially purchased the contested bike. Further context provided by the woman's lawyer suggests she was completely blocked in by the men who deliberately hid the bike's QR code to prevent her from leaving with it.\n\nUnfortunately, the damage to this woman's reputation was already done. In the eyes of the online jury, which failed to consult the woman as a witness, she was guilty of everything they alleged.\n\nAs a result, the woman and her husband were sentenced to a days-long deluge of profanity, racism, and hate which inevitably fueled NYC Health + Hospitals' decision to dub the video \"disturbing\" and force the woman on leave \"pending review.\"\n\nTo clarify, this woman committed no crime during the commotion. In fact, police were never called to the scene . Yet, this expectant mom who spent the better part of her life \"focused on helping others, irrespective of their background\" is suffering punishment by her hospital and by the cruel world of Twitter trolls because the default assumption in these out-of-context videos is that she's wrong just because she's white.\n\nFrom its beginnings on May 12, the case of the white pregnant woman and the black men who harassed her wasn't a free and fair trial. It was rigged to make the victim into the perpetrator based on skin color, not facts. We saw a similar story play out with white men like Daniel Penny , we saw it with white kids like the Covington student, and now, we are seeing it with white, pregnant women like this hospital worker.\n\nIt's no secret that race baiters wanted this woman to be the next Amy Cooper, the white woman who was publicly shamed and fired for calling the police on a black birdwatcher in 2020. Yet, even in that case, Cooper agreed that the mob went too far in its quest to destroy the white woman's life.\n\n\"It's a little bit of a frenzy, and I am uncomfortable with that,\" he said .\n\nSmears like the ones against the pregnant physician assistant are often painted as an effort to acquire justice. Yet, time and time again they prove that the pain that stems from a public smear campaign is the point.\n\nFor the people who put skin color above all, the degradation of an upstanding American citizen who cares for the sick and is growing a member of the next generation is a small price to pay.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "How The Progressive-Or-Bigot Binary Changed Culture Quickly\n\n\"If you voted for Donald Trump, you are a racist. You have no wiggle room,\" tweeted Jemele Hill on July 19. Hill is a writer at The Atlantic and the daughter of a Trump voter. While her contention might puzzle the average American, it would raise few eyebrows on college campuses, where racism and bigotry have been defined differently for years.\n\nThose expanded definitions, so broad they implicate almost everyone, now operate in the institutions populated by graduates of those schools. As a consequence, we are increasingly beholden to a binary system that relies on these broad definitions to categorize people either as progressives or bigots. There is, to borrow a phrase from Hill, \"no wiggle room.\"\n\nThis-the progressive-or-bigot binary-explains our head-spinning summer of \"cultural insanity,\" from the resignation of a Boeing executive over an innocuous 30-year-old op-ed to the resignation of a New York Times editor over publishing an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). It explains why the ultra-leftist mayor of Minneapolis was booed out of a protest for disagreeing with calls to defund the police, and why a white woman in expensive yoga pants shouted in the face of a black female cop.\n\nFernando Martinez is an immigrant and the owner of a Cuban restaurant in Louisville, Ky. When a local Black Lives Matter group sent a threatening letter with a list of demands, Martinez had questions. \"How can I be called a bigot and a racist when my family is Black? When my son is gay?\" he inquired . \"I'm the proud father of a gay son, and I'm gonna fight for him against anybody.\"\n\nIf you're scratching your head, wondering how our culture spiraled so quickly, look to the binary. This has been brewing for decades in academia, which has now exported enough graduates into the professional world that cultural arbiters in newsrooms and boardrooms are either intimidated or persuaded into cooperation.\n\nPopular texts written by theorists like Peggy McIntosh, Judith Butler, and bell hooks have been assigned to college students en masse for years. \"White Fragility,\" a bestseller in the wake of the George Floyd protests, is an obvious extension of this work.\n\nTake McIntosh's immensely popular 1989 essay, \"White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack,\" a common assignment in American classrooms. \"My schooling,\" lamented McIntosh, \"gave me no training in seeing myself as an oppressor, as an unfairly advantaged person, or as a participant in a damaged culture. I was taught to see myself as an individual whose moral state depended on her individual moral will.\" (A horrifying prospect, indeed.)\n\n\"As a white person, I realized I had been taught about racism as something that puts others at a disadvantage,\" she writes in the essay, \"but had been taught not to see one of its corollary aspects, white privilege, which puts me at an advantage.\"\n\nIn 2000, bell hooks's popular \"Feminism Is For Everybody\" reinforced the same binary. \"For example, let's take the issue of abortion,\" wrote hooks. \"If feminism is a movement to end sexist oppression, and depriving females of reproductive rights is a form of sexist oppression, then one cannot be anti-choice and be feminist.\" Thus if one is anti-abortion, she is anti-feminist, and pro-\"sexist oppression.\" In this logical formulation, the stakes are much higher than partisan disagreements. Disagreement is oppression.\n\nFor hooks, this categorization even extends to her fellow travelers. \"Just because they participated in anti-racist struggle did not mean that they had divested of white supremacy,\" she insisted. White supremacy, according to this argument, is not merely the noxious ideology of fringe skinheads, it must be unlearned by even the farthest left activists. The definition her work taught millions of students to accept is one that implicates just about everyone. To escape it, you have to accept hooks's philosophy.\n\nJudith Butler, who's been applying her work to the Trump era, is also a critical source of academic argumentation for the binary, especially for expanding the definition of violence. Asked by The New Yorker to define the boundaries of violence in February, Butler replied , \"The physical blow cannot be the only model for thinking about what violence is. Anything that jeopardizes the lives of others through explicit policy or through negligence-and that would include all kinds of public policies or state policies-are practices of institutional or systemic violence.\"\n\nThis contention-\"Anything that jeopardizes the lives of others through explicit policy or through negligence... are practices of institutional or systemic violence\"-explains the ubiquitous \"Silence is Violence\" signs at recent protests. By this logic, one is either vocal or one is violent. Again, there is \"no wiggle room.\"\n\nCritical race theory is an important driver of the binary. Here's a helpful description of the popular academic ideology from The Atlantic:\n\nThe school of critical race theory, championed by scholars such as bell hooks, has been around in academic circles for at least 30 years, and its definition of white supremacy has long animated black activism. To quote scholar Frances Lee Ansley (taken here from a passage from David Gillborn, also, a critical-race-theory scholar):\n\n'By 'white supremacy' I do not mean to allude only to the self-conscious racism of white supremacist hate groups. I refer instead to a political, economic and cultural system in which whites overwhelmingly control power and material resources, conscious and unconscious ideas of white superiority and entitlement are widespread, and relations of white dominance and non-white subordination are daily reenacted across a broad array of institutions and social settings.'\n\nThose \"daily reenact[ments],\" then, are necessarily acts of white supremacy that perpetuate the oppressive system. This is clearly an intentional expansion of the definition, but it also functions as a contribution to the binary, because anyone on the wrong side of the equation is perpetuating oppression, as hooks argued.\n\n\"White Fragility\" is explicitly predicated on the notion that racism is not restricted to \"bad people.\" Otherwise decent individuals can perpetuate racism, and are consequently racist. That may seem less insidious, but it encourages the smearing of anti-racist people who happen to disagree with these broad definitions.\n\nWhen activists Regina Jackson and Saira Rao sought to peddle this ideology on an episode of \"The Femsplainers\" podcast , their electric clash with hosts Christina Hoff Sommers and Danielle Crittenden progressed into a perfect encapsulation of our tortured racial discourse.\n\n\"Dear white women,\" Jackson and Rao write on their website, \"You cause immeasurable pain and damage to Black, Indigenous and brown women. We are here to sit down with you to candidly discuss how *exactly* you cause this pain and damage. The dinners are a starting point. A place to start thinking through how you actively uphold white supremacy every minute of every day.\"\n\nSommers and Crittenden politely refused to accept the predicate that they uphold white supremacy. Jackson and Rao refused to continue the conversation after discovering this. They hung up. Again, it all comes down to definitions, which insist on a binary that overtly implicates decent people in white supremacy. To people like Sommers and Crittenden and likely most of the country, white supremacy means something very different than Jackson and Rao's definition, which operates on most campuses and among many of their graduates.\n\nLike \"White Fragility,\" Ibram X. Kendi's 2019 book \"How To Be An Antiracist\" has been a bestseller in the wake of Floyd's tragic killing. \"The opposite of 'racist' isn't 'not racist,'\" Kendi explains, \"It is 'antiracist.'\" Consider this passage:\n\nOne endorses either the idea of a racial hierarchy as a racist, or racial equality as an antiracist. One either believes problems are rooted in groups of people, as a racist, or locates the roots of problems in power and policies, as an antiracist. One either allows racial inequities to persevere, as a racist, or confronts racial inequities, as an antiracist.\n\nThere can be \"no neutrality,\" Kendi writes . There is \"no wiggle room.\" Here, again, we see the binary. If people are only racist or antiracist, your ideology is easy to enforce after a certain point of proliferation because corporations, public figures, and average people believe it's bad for business to be on the side of alleged racism. Academia took care of the proliferation part, now corporations and media are handling enforcement.\n\nKendi's rejection of neutrality is a clear articulation of the binary. While his latest book is only one year old, revisiting popular texts from thinkers like hooks, Butler, and McIntosh shows students have been learning to categorize society in the same way for decades. The fruits of that process are now manifest.\n\nThe progressive-or-bigot binary, importantly, is even narrower than the title suggests. As the texts above argue, even good progressives can be bigots. To absolve oneself of bigotry, however, every radical aspect of leftist dogma must be embraced.\n\nInterestingly, the binary is fueled by something positive. Individuals accept it because they believe society punishes racism and rewards antiracism. Corporations accept it because they believe markets do the same. This, of course, enables the left's efforts to redefine these concepts.\n\nIt does at least suggest that racism is broadly stigmatized, defined narrowly or otherwise. Implicating decent people in racism and white supremacy, however, could change that, driving confusion, resentment, and discord, all of which are easily exploited by actual bigots.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

She apparently scolded him saying, \"We don't drive this way in Oregon. We're f*cking kind and we make space.\"\n\nThe heavyset man's bellows of racial injustice began almost immediately with \"She told me to go back to where I came from,\" followed by a halfhearted, \"I'm Native American.\"\n\n\"I'm talking about your driving habits,\" she corrected, \"I'm so tired of people driving like you just did.\" She then confronted the man about bringing race into the issue saying, \"Admit that you're f*cking wrong and that it's not a race thing!\"\n\nThe man avoided addressing the traffic incident and instead doubled-down on his issues with the woman's skin color \"Admit you're white. You have a colonizer mindset.\"\n\n\"It's not about race\" she pleaded, along with \"Don't pull the race card,\" and \"You're taking out your pain and aggression on me right now.\"\n\nBut the man was still discontent with her pleadings, telling her to \"shut up\" and that the racial justice work to be done was not his responsibility.  He mocked her pleas and eventually erupted with, \"It's not on me to change it's on you and your colonizer mindset so get the f*ck out of my face now. The man continued screaming, \"NOW, YOU WHITE LADY! YOU WHITE LADY!\"\n\nUsing \"white\" as an insult has escalated as activism and education depicting whiteness as evil has grown exponentially in recent years.\n\n\"I'm as angry as you are,\" she said in sympathy to the man's woke sentiments. Dismissive, the man continued in his rage, \"Then get out of my face because I'm done with conversation, you f*cking colonizer,\" and \"I'm not taking any f*cking directions from a white lady.\"\n\nThe woman attempted to signal her liberal racial sympathies again saying, \"Everyone needs to hear how angry you are but it's not about this,\" but was only met with more screaming from the man.\n\nIn a second video, the man can be seen finally getting back into his car and ending the heated exchange with, \"You don't know the pain of my people,\" and \"I hope you go back to Europe, you b*tch.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/gRr2lAT1jb\n\nThe woman returned to her car that was adorned with bumper stickers such as one that read \"visualize world peace.\"\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

Viewer discretion advised,\" ( emphasis added).\n\nWhy is Hulu warning me about \"an unlikeable female protagonist\"? Do unlikeable male protagonists need content warnings? pic.twitter.com/gHTmzgJaIW\n\nSpoilers follow.\n\nThe film is centered around the portrayal of a \"Karen\" type of woman named Danni who becomes famous by taking advantage of a victim narrative from a terrorist attack that she pretended to have been in.\n\nThroughout the film, Danni is repeatedly characterized as a \"white woman\" in a derogatory way. This \"unlikeable female protagonist\" is contrasted by the likable Rowan, a black activist school shooting survivor. There was no redemption arc for the unlikeable Danni, whose scheme was eventually found out.

Though the content warning may seem like a joke, Director Quinn Shepard admits that the warning \"was inspired by some very real concerns\" that she hopes her film can \"crack open.\"\n\n\"The content warning was borne out of, to be honest, our test screenings,\" she said during a recent interview with IndieWire .\n\n\"We un-ironically and consistently got responses from - I'm not going to say what demographic, but you might be able to guess - people who were quite literally like, 'Why would someone make a movie with an unlikable woman?'

If you portray flawed women or women who reflect societal flaws, you get notes like, 'I literally don't understand why you tell a story about this character.'\"\n\nKate Erbland for IndieWire reports that \"Shepard sought to provide a heads up about the themes of trauma and PTSD that run through the film - the 'unlikable female protagonist' is intended to provoke.\"\n\n\"It was interesting to me that a large chunk of the audience seemed genuinely upset by the fact that the film was about Danni, and so I just wanted to kind of poke at it a little,\" Shepard added.\n\n\"I wanted to see could I trick people into thinking that it was going to be a safe and funny watch, and then keep dialing down on what, at its core, this character is doing,\" she said.\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

      "text": "'MISSING WHITE WOMAN SYNDROME': Don Lemon, Joy Reid criticize Gabby Petito story over race\n\nJoy Reid argued that the Petito case is an example of \"missing white woman syndrome.\"\n\nDuring Monday night's broadcasting of popular CNN and MSNBC shows, hosts Joy Reid and Don Lemon argued that the case of Gabby Petito , and the subsequent national attention the case has garnered, is evidence of widespread racism in the United States.\n\nDuring The Reidout with Joy Reid, she argued that the Petito case is an example of \"missing white woman syndrome,\" a term reportedly coined by the late PBS host Gwen Ifill.\n\nPetito, who has been missing since late August after going on a cross country van trip with her fiancé, is presumed dead after remains were found in the Bridger-Teton National Forest that were \"consistent with\" the description of missing 22-year-old Petito.\n\n\"Now it goes without saying that no family should ever have to endure that kind of pain, and the Petito family certainly deserve answers and justice,\" said Reid. \"But the way this story has captivated the nation has many wondering, why not the same media attention when people of color go missing?\"\n\n\"Well, the answer actually has a name, missing white woman syndrome, the term coined by the late and great Gwen Eiffel, to describe the media and public fascination with missing white women like Laci Peterson or Natalee Holloway, all ignoring cases involving missing people of color,\" Reid continued.\n\nReid, talking with guests on her show Derrica Wilson, co founder and CEO of the Black and Missing Foundation, and Lynette gray bull, founder of Not Our Native Daughters, pointed to the case of Daniel Robinson, who went missing in Arizona after last being seen leaving his job site in June, as an example of what she's talking about.\n\nOn Don Lemon Tonight , host Don Lemon argued with fellow CNN host Chris Cuomo about the Laundrie family's ability to hire a lawyer, and how many poor Americans and people of color cannot afford such a service.\n\nCuomo said that the Laundrie family is not talking to authorities because an attorney has advised them not to.\n\n\"No, they have a lawyer who has said to them, the police are trying to make a case. If they talk to you, they can use whatever you say, against you. And against Brian, even if you didn't mean it that way,\" said Cuomo.\n\n\"Yes. I don't disagree with that. But to have - to be able to have an attorney and do that. And you ask any person of color? You ask a black man if they have that sort of privilege? Ask a poor white person?\" said Lemon.\n\n\"It's not a privilege, it's a right,\" Cuomo stated.\n\n\"I know that. I know,\" Lemon responded. \"But most people don't know that. They're not treated that way by law enforcement. Even if you think that, you know, cops are the good guys. Yeah, many times they are. But many times they aren't.\n\nEspecially when it comes to people of color and poor people in this society, who don't have the means to be able to stand behind a lawyer and not and not go to speak.\n\nLemon went on to say that if he wasn't the national news anchor that he is, the police would tell him \"Hey, get your butt in here. What do you know about the disappearance of such and such? Why won't you talk? Or do you need a lawyer because you're guilty?\"\n\n\"Yeah they do that to black people, white people, they do that to a lot of people,\" Cuomo argued.\n\n\"That's what I said,\" said Lemon. \"This is about black people and poor people meaning because all people are poor, I mean, not all people, but there are people of all different ethnicities who are poor, and they don't have the privilege of being able to afford an attorney who will tell them that they can't go in.\"\n\n\"What did you say to me today using you until you're arrested that's when you are assigned an attorney for free if you otherwise before then you got to shell out some dough,\" Lemon continued.\n\n\"You have to shell out some dough. But you don't need a lawyer just need to know your rights,\" said Cuomo.\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

The basketball star, however, is facing criticism after saying that the league has \"been built on\" black players and that \"as a white person, there is privilege.\"\n\n\"I want to say I've earned every single thing, but as a white person, there is privilege,\" Clark said in the interview . \"A lot of those players in the league that have been really good have been [b]lack players. This league has kind of been built on them. The more we can appreciate that, highlight that, talk about that, and then continue to have brands and companies invest in those players that have made this league incredible, I think it's very important. I have to continue to try to change that. The more we can elevate [b]lack women, that's going to be a beautiful thing.\"\n\nAmong those criticizing Clark was Megyn Kelly, who wrote, \"Look at this.

It means I'm not going to teach Spanish. Accountability is ongoing because there is not end to the process.\"\n\nAs part of the session, white teacher Jessica Bridges shares that she stopped teaching Spanish to K-12 because it wasn't right for a white woman to teach Spanish. She had this revelation after taking a course she found on Instagram about how to become a better \"white ally\" and \"anti-racist coconspirator.\"\n\n\"White isn't right,\" she said. In essence, Bridges resigned for diversity .\n\nToday, Oklahoma State University educator's statements at a virtual conference of educators: -\"White people aren't right\" -\"Racism originates with and is perpetuated by white people\" -\"Mourning her white morality\" This is what Critical Race Theory looks like in the classroom. pic.twitter.com/hH4u2f5idR\n\n\"Racism originates with, and is perpetuated by white people,\" Bridges said.\n\nShe decried the horror that children she taught had to \"learn Spanish from a white woman. I wish I could go back and tell my students not to learn power or correctness from this white woman. I would tell them to stand in their own power. White isn't right,\" she said.\n\n\"We're deconstructing our emotions around acknowledging our whiteness and white privilege through the lens of grief and the process of grief,\" Bridges said regarding the course she took that thrust her headlong into this journey.\n\n\"We talked about mourning our white morality. I'm holding myself accountable to this journey. Part of my accountability is to continue to struggle and grapple with my internalized white supremacy. Dismantling white supremacy in society looks like dismantling in my heart, first. It means I'm not going to teach Spanish. Accountability is ongoing because there is not end to the process.\"\n\nBridges' testimony about how awful her whiteness is was part of Southern Connecticut State University's Virtual Women's and Gender Studies Conference , which happened over two days in April. The conference focus was on \"Gender, Race, Community & Conflict: Pursuing Peace and Justice.\"\n\nBridges , a PhD candidate in the college of arts and sciences at Oklahoma State University, spoke about \"white women's complicity,\" the complicity of white women in white supremacy and \"the work that white women have to do to address this issue.\" Bridges has worked primarily in education, and the pandemic inspired her to make \"anti-racism and white women's complicity and anti-racist work\" her dissertation topic.\n\nHer testimony was what she called the \"autho-ethnographic\" portion of that work with the assembled Zoomers at the conference. This section was all about Bridges lived experiences as a white woman who has worked in education, primarily in K-12 education and feels really badly about her privilege.\n\nBridges work was about \"examining her whiteness, complicity, and activism.\" She said that as a K-12 teacher in the US, she has been \"embedded in a system that some scholars have identified as reproducing social injustice. Consciously, or unconsciously,\" she said, \"I have been complicit as a part of the educational system and as a white woman benefitting from white privilege.\"\n\nBridges then verbally flogs herself for not being anti-racist enough, and explained her journey to \"becoming an antiracist white woman.\" Basically, this was her journey to becoming Marxist.\n\nShe learned about Marxism in a masters class, and from that day on, she became an anti-racist activist. Part of her education in Marxism was her realization that she \"was a colonizer.\" It made her nauseous. She talked about a white man who was brought to tears by realizing that he was a \"racist colonizer.\"\n\nShe felt guilty about having taught Spanish, because as a white woman, she was necessarily also teaching a power structure and upholding white supremacy. That's right, white ladies should not teach Spanish. This despite the fact that Spanish is a European language.\n\nShe questioned her \"Latinx\" students for their use of the identifier \"Hispanic.\" They told her that was the term she used, and she told them it was \"the colonizers' term,\" and that they shouldn't use it because they weren't from Spain.\n\n\"They were middle schoolers,\" she said, \"and not sure what to make of my words at the time.\" Then she stopped teaching Spanish. It was more important to Bridges that the right race of person teach Spanish than she retain the job she had spent so much time getting qualified to do .\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.
