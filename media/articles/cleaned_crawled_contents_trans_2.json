They're not judges. They're just pretending to be judges. They're just politicians wearing judges' robes,\" Musk said during a livestreamed event with his super PAC, America PAC, in which he responded to questions from callers.\n\n\"These judges are undermining faith in the legal system because they're supposed to be objective, but they're clearly not being objective. They're being just politicians, and this is not right,\" Musk said, without naming any specific judges.\n\n\"We should have an independent judicial system, where it's not a matter of politics,\" he added.\n\nMusk has called for judges who have ruled against or slowed elements of his agenda to be impeached , prompting the American Bar Association to issue a statement this month opposing efforts to \"cow our country's judges, our country's courts and our legal profession.\"\n\nNBC News reported today that America PAC had funneled $12.2 million so far to boost conservative judge Brad Schimel's bid in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election tomorrow against Susan Crawford. Trump today criticized Crawford and said she would be \"very bad\" if she wins.\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nMore than 31⁄2 hours after he began, Sen. Cory Booker is still speaking on the Senate floor to bring attention to what he says is the \"grave and urgent\" threat Americans face from the Trump administration.\n\nBooker, D-N.J., was at one point briefly joined by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., who asked him questions to give him a brief rest from speaking nonstop, but he retained control of the floor and has been speaking ever since.\n\nDespite his marathon speech, Booker is not affecting floor consideration of any bill or nomination. Still, it's not clear when he will stop. The record for longest speech by a senator was set in 1957, when Strom Thurmond, D-S.C., spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes in opposition to the Civil Rights Act.\n\nBooker has never led such a speech in the past, his office said, but he has participated in one before when he joined Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., in his 14-hour, 50-minute speech advocating for gun control legislation in 2016.\n\nLong speeches on the Senate floor have been known to put senators on the national map. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, gave a 21-hour, 18-minute speech in 2013 against Obamacare, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., gave an 81⁄2-hour long speech in 2010 that many say contributed to his elevated profile on the political stage.\n\nBooker will cede control of the Senate floor if he leaves his desk or sits down.\n\nThe next piece of business set to happen on the Senate floor is a confirmation vote tomorrow on Matthew Whitaker's nomination to be U.S. Permanent Representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. When that happens is likely to on whether Booker's speech pushes past when the Senate typically comes in for the day, at 10 a.m.\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn court filings tonight, representatives from the State and Defense departments, the National Intelligence Director's Office and the CIA submitted sworn declarations about the status of Signal messages recovered from the group chat about U.S. military strikes that inadvertently included a journalist.\n\nThe State Department representative said, \"Images of the Signal chat in the possession of the Office of the Secretary have been captured and will be preserved.\"\n\nThe Defense Department rep said, \"A search of Secretary of Defense Hegseth's mobile device has been conducted, and available Signal application messages that are at issue in this case have been preserved.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the National Intelligence Director's Office said it has \"taken screenshots of messages currently in existence and transferred said screen shots to an ODNI email address.\"\n\nThe CIA representative said that \"residual administrative content from 'the Signal chat' was retrievable from\" Director John Ratcliffe's personal account on the messaging app \"and that that content has since been transferred to Agency systems.\"\n\nThe agencies and departments are being sued by a government watchdog group, which cited the Federal Records Act on preserving government communications. The judge overseeing the case ordered the preservation of Signal group chat records from early to mid-March.\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., took to the Senate floor tonight with the intention of \"disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able.\"\n\n\"I rise tonight because I believe sincerely our nation is in crisis,\" he said at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nAccording to his prepared remarks, he plans to keep going \"by sharing just a few of the letters I have received from my constituents in recent weeks about what is at stake right now.\"\n\nIt's not clear exactly how long Booker intends to speak.\n\nZoë Richards\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nDemocratic leaders sued tonight to block an executive order that Trump signed last week aimed at elections.\n\nTrump's order says proof of citizenship must be required to register to vote and calls on the Department of Homeland Security to work with the Department of Government Efficiency to look over states' \"publicly available voter registration list and available records concerning voter list maintenance activities,\" then assess them against federal and state records to uncover rarely occurring and illegal voter fraud by noncitizens.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., argues that the Constitution empowers the states and Congress, not the president, to regulate elections. It also says the order \"attempts to mandate new burdens\" on those trying to register to vote in its requirements for proof of citizenship.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, Democratic Governors Association Chair Laura Kelly, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called the order \"an unconstitutional power grab from Donald Trump that attacks vote by mail, gives DOGE sensitive personal information and makes it harder for states to run their own free and fair elections.\"\n\n\"It's anti-American and Democrats are using every tool at our disposal - including taking Trump to court - to stop this illegal overreach that undermines our democracy,\" they said in a statement.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment tonight.\n\nKyle Stewart\n\nScott Wong\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., one of a handful of female members of the House Freedom Caucus, confirmed tonight that she is quitting the group of conservative hard-liners over their efforts to derail her push to allow remote voting for lawmakers who become new parents .\n\nShe accused her Freedom Caucus colleagues of threatening to \"shut down\" and halt all legislative business from moving on the floor unless her push to force a vote on her plan is not stopped.\n\n\"There's some great people that are still members of the Freedom Caucus, but there's a small faction that's disingenuous, and I'm not going to play that game,\" Luna told reporters at the Capitol. \"This speaker is being held hostage. You had a small group of the Freedom Caucus that threatened to shut down the House floor regardless of what agenda was being placed - whether it was the president's or not - and that's not right.\"\n\nLuna has secured the 218 signatures needed to bypass GOP leadership and force a vote on bipartisan legislation that would allow members who become new parents to vote by proxy for up to 12 weeks. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his leadership team are opposed to proxy voting, as are many other Republicans. They also don't like Luna using's the process, known as the discharge petition.\n\nLuna has not said when she plans to file her motion, which would kick-start the process.\n\n\"There's some great members of the Freedom Caucus, but I'm not going to be treated like that,\" Luna said. \"I don't play to lose.\"\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nDareh Gregorian\n\nA federal judge in California today issued an order blocking the Department of Homeland Security from ending Temporary Protected Status for more than 350,000 Venezuelan nationals.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had ordered those protections - which allows qualified Venezuelan national to reside and work temporarily in the United States - to be yanked April 7. In the final days of the Biden administration, Noem's predecessor, Alejandro Mayorkas, had extended the protections until October 2026.\n\nU.S. District Judge Edward Chen said that Noem's action was \"unprecedented\" and that it threatened to \"inflict irreparable harm on hundreds of thousands of persons whose lives, families, and livelihoods will be severely disrupted, cost the United States billions in economic activity, and injure public health and safety in communities throughout the United States.\"\n\nHe also took aim at Noem's public claims that the majority of the TPS holders are criminals as \"entirely unsubstantiated\" and noted that people are ineligible for TPS if they have \"been convicted of any felony or 2 or more misdemeanors committed in the United States.\"\n\n\"To the extent the government contends that there is a threat from the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua,\" he wrote, \"it has made no showing that any Venezuelan TPS holders are members of the gang or otherwise have ties to the gang.\"\n\nChen directed DHS to let him know whether it plans to appeal and acknowledged in the ruling that the extra protections are likely to end at some point.\n\n\"Although the TPS designations for Venezuela are only temporary, they still afford TPS holders with concrete, meaningful relief: for a fixed period of time, TPS holders have both the right to work and the right to be free from removal, which give not only stability but also security in their lives and time with their families otherwise threatened by Secretary Noem's actions. In short, time matters, even if that time is limited,\" he wrote.\n\nZoë Richards\n\nTrump told reporters at the White House today that \"there is communication\" between him and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nTrump spoke fondly of his relationship with Kim, saying they get along \"fantastically.\"\n\n\"He's a big nuclear nation, and he's a very smart guy. I got to know him very well,\" he added.\n\nTrump referred to an exchange with Kim during his first term, which he said \"started off very rough, very nasty,\" with Trump calling Kim a \"rocket man\" in an address to the United Nations in 2017 and the two leaders subsequently meeting three times from 2018-19. In 2019, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to step across the 1953 armistice line dividing North and South Korea during his visit.\n\nKatherine Doyle\n\nTrump appeared to confirm that the first overseas trip of his second term will be to Saudi Arabia, as well as Qatar and maybe the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"It could be next month, maybe a little bit later,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"And we're going to Qatar also, and also we're going to, possibly, a couple of other countries. UAE is very important.\"\n\nHe added: \"So we'll probably stop at UAE and Qatar.\"\n\nAxios reported yesterday that Trump is set to visit Saudi Arabia in May.\n\nTrump, who made his first overseas visit to Saudi Arabia during his first term, said today that he did so because the kingdom followed through on an agreement to buy $450 billion worth of American goods, \"military and otherwise.\"\n\nKatherine Doyle\n\nSpeaking with reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said \"a lot of people\" are interested in replacing Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nAmong those interested, he said, are former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Richard Grenell, whom Trump named as his envoy for special missions and as the Kennedy Center's interim executive director. Grenell was U.S. ambassador to Germany during Trump's first term.\n\n\"We have a lot of good people that want it,\" Trump said, adding that \"maybe 30 other people\" had asked about serving in the post.\n\n\"Everyone loves that position. That's a star-making position,\" he added.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, his first U.N. ambassador was former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who went on to challenge Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primaries.\n\nZoë Richards\n\nTrump was asked today about Musk's tenure in the federal government and what will happen to his Department of Government Efficiency when he returns to the private sector.\n\n\"Well, I think he's amazing, but I also think he's got a big company to run, and so at some point he's going to be going back,\" Trump said, adding that he'd keep Musk \"as long as I could keep him.\"\n\nTrump was also asked whether DOGE would continue operating after Musk leaves.\n\n\"I can't tell you that. I can say this, that a lot of the people that are working with DOGE are these secretaries, you know, the heads of the various agencies, and they've learned a lot, and they're dealing with the DOGE people. I think some of them may try and keep the DOGE people with them,\" Trump said.\n\n\"At a certain point, I think it will end, but they have also gotten a big education, and they're doing a really good job. There'll be a point at which the secretaries will be able to do this work and do it very, you know, as we say, with the scalpel, and that's what we want,\" he added.\n\nMusk is classified as a special government employee . People in those posts are expected to take on duties temporarily for no more than 130 days over the course of a year.\n\nZoë Richards\n\nTrump today criticized Susan Crawford, a state judge campaigning in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race , and urged support for her opponent, conservative judge Brad Schimel.\n\n\"I hope you get out and vote for the Republican,\" Trump told reporters at the White House, referring to the technically nonpartisan race. \"Let's see who wins, but the woman will be very bad.\"\n\nTomorrow's election will decide the ideological tilt on the seven-judge court. It also could play a role in cases tied to abortion rights, unions and congressional maps.\n\nTrump also repeated false claims that he won Wisconsin three times in his campaigns for president.\n\n\"I won it three times. We had a rigged election the second time,\" he said, referring to his election loss in 2020.\n\nBiden defeated Trump in Wisconsin in 2020, winning 49.4% of the vote to Trump's 48.8%.\n\nKatherine Doyle\n\nTrump reiterated his promise to impose \"reciprocal\" tariffs on other nations starting Wednesday but said they \"will be lower than what they've been charging us.\"\n\n\"You're going to see in two days,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"They're reciprocal. So whatever they charge us, we charge them, but we're being nicer than they were.\"\n\nHe added: \"The numbers will be lower than what they've been charging us, and in some cases, maybe substantially lower. But we sort of have a world obligation, perhaps.\"\n\nTrump said he was not concerned that tariffs could drive some U.S. allies closer to China, even as Japan and South Korea announced plans to work together to respond to his tariffs.\n\nZoë Richards\n\nTrump said this evening that people have been asking him to run for a third term and repeated claims that there is a method to do so, but he said he hasn't explored it.\n\n\"Now people are asking me to run,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office for an executive order signing. \"They do say there's a way you can do it, but I don't know about that - but I have not looked into it.\"\n\nTrump was asked about running for a third term and whether Democrats might try to run former President Obama against him.\n\n\"I'd love that,\" Trump said, adding the match-up \"would be a good one.\"\n\nTrump told NBC News in an exclusive interview over the weekend that he was \"not joking\" about potentially trying to seek a third term, which the Constitution's 22nd Amendment prohibits.\n\nKatherine Doyle\n\nTrump was joined in the Oval Office today by Robert Ritchie, better known as Kid Rock, to sign an executive order to address ticket scalping.\n\n\"It doesn't matter your politics,\" Ritchie said. \"I'm a capitalist and a deregulation guy, but they've tried this in some places in Europe, and it seems to be the only thing that allows us, as artists, to be able to get the tickets into the hands of the fans at the prices we set.\"\n\nTrump said, \"I think this is a big step.\"\n\nHe had teased a visit by Kid Rock, a prominent Trump surrogate and supporter, on social media over the weekend.\n\nElyse Perlmutter-Gumbiner\n\nZoë Richards\n\nTrump is set to sign an executive order today that focuses on protecting fans from ticket scalping, a White House official said.\n\nThe order directs the Federal Trade Commission to review and take steps to address any wrongful or unfair conduct in the secondary ticketing market and work with the attorney general to ensure the enforcement of competition laws. It also directs the FTC to ensure price transparency for ticket sales and enforce legislation signed into law in 2016 that prohibits circumventing ticket issuers' online security measures.\n\nThe Treasury, the Justice Department and the FTC will be expected to file a report within 180 days summarizing actions and recommendations to address unfair ticketing practices, according to the order.\n\nThe Biden administration sought to tackle the ticketing industry when President Joe Biden banned junk fees on concert tickets.\n\nRyan J. Reilly\n\nSydney Carruth Sydney Carruth is a digital assistant for NBC News.\n\nLess than two weeks after DOGE staffers visited the headquarters of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, government employees there have been informed that they're now on administrative leave and their email accounts have been shut down, according to a statement from a labor union representing many of the employees.\n\n\"Earlier today, the Institute of Museum and Library Services notified the entire staff that they are being placed on administrative leave immediately. The notification followed a brief meeting between DOGE staff and IMLS leadership. Employees were required to turn in all government property prior to exiting the building, and email accounts are being disabled today,\" the American Federation of Government Employees said in a statement.\n\nThe Institute of Museum and Library Services is a small federal agency responsible for awarding the grant funding that allows many museums and libraries across the country to operate.\n\nDOGE visited the agency's headquarters in Washington this month shortly after Trump ordered that the agency be downsized to only what is statutorily required, a move museum advocates worry could cost the country its cultural and public institutions as the agency all but shuts down.\n\n\"Museums and libraries will no longer be able to contact IMLS staff for updates about the funding they rely upon,\" AFGE said in its statement. \"In the absence of staff, all work processing 2025 applications has ended. The status of previously awarded grants is unclear. Without staff to administer the programs, it is likely that most grants will be terminated.\"\n\nSydney Carruth Sydney Carruth is a digital assistant for NBC News.\n\nMegan Shannon\n\nRepublican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley said talk of Trump's possibly seeking a constitutionally prohibited third term in office is not a \"serious conversation.\"\n\n\"I don't think that's a real serious conversation at this point in time,\" Whatley told Fox News host Jacqui Heinrich this afternoon. \"Right now, what the president is focused on is delivering for the American people every single day.\"\n\nWhatley, a Trump loyalist who has been leading the RNC alongside Lara Trump since last year, declined to say whether he would support him if he sought a third term.\n\nTrump told NBC News over the weekend that he was \"not joking\" about the prospect of seeking a third term, which would require a constitutional amendment. He added that there are \"methods\" to circumvent the 22nd Amendment, which bars presidents from serving more than two terms. He did not provide details.\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., says Trump cannot serve a third term as president without a change in the Constitution, telling reporters just now, \"I think he's probably having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, would barely engage on the subject, saying just: \"I shouldn't have to answer that. Read the Constitution.\"\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nALEXANDRIA, Va. - A federal judge in Virginia blocked the Trump administration from firing dozens of intelligence officers who were set for removal from their jobs because they had been temporarily assigned to diversity initiatives.\n\nU.S. District Judge Anthony Trenga barred the administration from \"effectuating termination of these plaintiffs\" and ordered that they remain on \"administrative leave\" with full pay and benefits while the legal process plays out.\n\nTrenga also ordered the administration to provide all affected employee opportunities to appeal their terminations and ordered the CIA and the National Intelligence Director's Office to consider all affected employees' requests for internal reassignment to jobs for which they'd be qualified.\n\nTheir lawyer, Kevin Carroll, had told Trenga, \"This is not an ordinary employment law case.\" He said his clients were \"defamed\" by Trump's executive order ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which alleged they were doing \"illegal\" and \"immoral\" work.\n\nTrenga agreed with the potential for reputational harm, saying plaintiffs were \"being penalized for being in the wrong place at the wrong time\" when Trump signed his order.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump used contentiousness around transgender people's access to sports and bathrooms to fire up conservative voters and sway undecideds. And in his first months back in office, Trump has pushed the issue further, erasing mention of transgender people on government websites and passports and trying to remove them from the military.\n\nIt's a contradiction of numbers that reveals a deep cultural divide: Transgender people make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, but they have become a major piece on the political chess board - particularly Trump's.\n\nFor transgender people and their allies - along with several judges who have ruled against Trump in response to legal challenges - it's a matter of civil rights for a small group. But many Americans believe those rights had grown too expansive.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nHenry J. Gomez\n\nVice President JD Vance's first fundraiser as the Republican National Committee's finance chair is set for tonight in Manhattan, according to an invitation obtained by NBC News.\n\nVance is listed as the headliner for the dinner, with tickets starting at $100,000 per couple and going up to $250,000 per couple for spots on the \"host committee.\"\n\nTrump and the RNC announced this month that Vance would be the national party's finance chair - an unusual arrangement for a sitting vice president. The idea came from RNC leadership, which raised the idea with senior members of Trump's team, a source familiar with the discussions said at the time. Those advisers then ran the idea by Trump, who signed off, and by Vance, who agreed to do it.\n\nMelanie Zanona Melanie Zanona is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News.\n\nRyan Nobles\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., dismissed the idea of  Trump actively seeking a third term during an interview today with NBC News. Scalise suggested that Trump floats ideas and concepts not necessarily with the hope of achieving those goals, but in an effort to get a discussion going on the topic.\n\n\"I don't know what he was referring to. I never saw it,\" Scalise said when asked about Trump's interview with NBC's Kristen Welker in which he said he was \"not joking\" about a third term. \"But you know, you see it like with Greenland, like with Panama Canal. There's a lot of things the president talks about. Ultimately, it gets people talking and addresses some other issues too.\"\n\nWhen pressed if he would support changing the Constitution to allow Trump to run for a third term, Scalise quickly dismissed the idea.\n\n\"There's no proposal to change the Constitution right now,\" he said.\n\nKyle Stewart\n\nAs we await the return of the House and Senate tonight to ask about Trump's comments to NBC News that he is \"not joking\" about a third term, here is a look back at what Republicans have said in the past about the matter.\n\nAt the House Republicans' issue conference in Doral, Florida, in late January, House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Trump was \"having sport with the media\" by suggesting a third term. Johnson said it \"was clearly tongue in cheek.\"\n\nAlso at the issues conference, Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., told NBC News that it was \"just a dumb question\" to ask about Trump seeking a third term.\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said in early February that the third term idea was a joke, telling NBC News, \"Learn how to take a joke, man.\"\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said in late January that he hasn't \"seen any wiggle room\" to allow for a third term and that he \"can't imagine that that's, that he's actually pushing for that.\"\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nOne of the two people Elon Musk awarded a $1 million prize to at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, last night is the head of the Wisconsin College Republicans, a spokesman for Musk's PAC confirmed.\n\nAndrew Romeo, the public affairs representative for America PAC, confirmed that the recipient, Nicholas Jacobs, is the Wisconsin College Republicans' chair. NBC News has reached out to the Wisconsin College Republicans for comment.\n\nWisconsin Public Radio was first to report on the connection.\n\nAsked how Musk's team determined who got the checks, Romeo declined to comment.\n\nThe check was made out to Nicholas Jacobs. A person with the same name and appearance is listed as the chair of the Wisconsin College Republicans on the group's website and Jacobs' X profile.\n\nKatherine Doyle\n\nAsked about the status of the investigation into how a journalist was added to a high-level group chat about U.S. military plans in Yemen, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated that the president was moving on.\n\n\"Mike Waltz continues to be an important part of his national security team and this case has been closed here at the White House,\" Leavitt told reporters, adding that steps had been taken to ensure the situation is not repeated.\n\n\"They've been working very well,\" she said.\n\nLast week, the National Security Council said in a statement that it was \"reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.\" Lawmakers , including some Republicans , have called for an inspector general probe into the matter.\n\nWisconsin is preparing for what could be the most expensive state judge election in U.S. history. Money has been pouring into the campaigns of both the conservative and liberal candidates from top donors in an effort to sway the critical decisions the state's Supreme Court will decide. Julia Jester reports on how this state election could have national implications.\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nThe daughter of the late Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., announced this morning that she is running for her father's vacant seat.\n\n\"I'm Adelita Grijalva and I am running for Congress because Arizona deserves a progressive champion that will stand up to Donald Trump and fight for working families,\" she said on X.\n\nThe elder Grijalva, a progressive, died from \"complications of his cancer treatment,\" according to his office.\n\nThe younger Grijalva currently serves as a Pima County supervisor, and she told the Arizona Republic that she would submit her resignation today ahead of a listening tour.\n\n\"My dad gave me some really great shoes to fill, but I stand on my own two feet, and I have a record of serving my community in southern Arizona,\" she told the outlet.\n\nAdam Edelman\n\nTrump waded further into Wisconsin politics, endorsing a proposed amendment down the ballot on Tuesday that would enshrine in the state constitution an existing voter ID law.\n\n\"There is a very important Referendum (Question 1) on the April 1st Ballot to amend the State Constitution to require VOTER ID. This, and other Election Integrity measures, including banning Drop Boxes, and Same Day Voting with Paper Ballots, can only happen if you GET OUT AND VOTE!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nSo-called voter integrity measures have been a major talking point for Trump and Trump-aligned Republicans in recent years.\n\nIf passed, the proposed amendment would enshrine in the state constitution a 2011 law requiring voters to provide a photo ID when they vote or when they are requesting an absentee ballot.\n\nConservatives have said they sought to have it enshrined in the state constitution because doing so would make it far more difficult to strike the law down if a liberal-majority state Supreme Court were to invalidate the law with a ruling - though Republican strategists in the state have acknowledged in interviews with NBC News that the more likely motivation to have it placed on the April ballot, in particular, was to try to juice conservative turnout in the state Supreme Court race.\n\nThe big election on Tuesday in Wisconsin is a state Supreme Court contest that will determine the ideological balance on the bench for at least another year.\n\nLawrence Hurley\n\nDelving into the latest in a series of religious rights cases, the Supreme Court appeared sympathetic this morning to a claim brought by Catholic-affiliated charitable groups that they were wrongly denied a religious exemption from a state tax that funds unemployment benefits.\n\nBoth conservative and liberal justices seemed concerned that the state's test for determining whether a group could get the exemption unlawfully discriminates against different entities based on their religious beliefs under the Constitution's First Amendment.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nReuters\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Monday the U.S. would receive a strong blow if it acts on Trump's threat to bomb Tehran unless it reaches a new nuclear deal with Washington.\n\nYesterday, Trump reiterated his threat that Iran would be bombed if it does not accept his offer for talks outlined in a letter sent to Iran's leadership in early March, giving Tehran a two-month window to make a decision.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., urged Trump to stop treating Russian President Vladimir Putin with \"velvet gloves\" in an op-ed in The New York Times today encouraging him and other Republicans to stand up to Putin.\n\n\"In recent weeks, too many of my fellow Republicans - including Mr. Trump - have treated Russia with velvet gloves, shying away from calling out Mr. Putin's flatly illegal war and even blaming Ukraine for starting it,\" Bacon wrote.\n\nBacon, a retired Air Force general, accused Putin of purposely delaying a ceasefire deal with Ukraine as a tactic to get the U.S. to acquiesce to demands to stop military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine.\n\n\"Failing to stand up to bullies only leads to larger and costlier conflicts,\" Bacon added.\n\nStill, Trump struck a different note over the weekend. During an exclusive interview with NBC News , Trump said he was \"very angry\" and \"pissed off\" at Putin for calling for regime change in Ukraine, and said he would consider imposing secondary tariffs on Russian oil if Russia does not reach an agreement with the U.S. on a ceasefire deal.\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nTrump said on his social media platform last night that he is willing to meet with comedian and talk show host Bill Maher and Kid Rock over dinner after the musician requested the get-together at the White House.\n\n\"I really didn't like the idea much, and don't like it much now, but thought it would be interesting,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\n\"It might be fun or, it might not, but you will be the first to know!\" the president wrote .\n\nMaher addressed the dinner in an interview with Chris Cuomo on his NewsNation show.\n\n\"Let's talk to each other face to face. Let's stop shouting from 3,000 miles away,\" Maher said. \"If they expect me to be leaving in a MAGA hat, they're going to be very disappointed.

      "text": "State education chief defends trans athletes, claiming it's 'inaccurate' to say there's only 2 genders\n\nWashington state Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal spoke in defense of transgender athletes in girls sports in an address Thursday, claiming it was \"inaccurate\" to say there are only two genders.\n\n\"It is quite simply inaccurate to say, biologically, that there are only boys and there are only girls,\" Reykdal said.\n\n\"There's a continuum. There's a science to this. There are children who are born intersex. There are children whose hormones and whose chromosomes are not consistent with their sex at birth.\"\n\n\"That's not a debate we're going to have today. I just want to remind you of our civil rights obligations. Our state laws make clear that children get to identify and participate based on the gender in which they identify. We're going to uphold that law.\"\n\nReykdal served three terms as a Democratic member of the Washington House of Representatives from the 22nd district.\n\nWhile criticizing President Donald Trump's recent executive order that prohibits schools from allowing trans athletes to compete in girls' sports , Reykdal cited a statistic of how many transgender athletes there are in his state.\n\n\"Out of nearly a quarter million kids participating in interscholastic athletics and activities in the state of Washington, roughly five to 10 youth have identified themselves as trans participating in those activities,\" Reykdal said.\n\n\"If we can't accommodate the needs of five or 10 people - whether there's privacy access for and a privacy opportunity for all students, that's what our laws and rules say - if we can't do that then who are we?\"\n\nReykdal insisted Trump did not have the authority as president to issue a ban on trans athletes in girls sports but conceded the U.S. Congress does.\n\nThe Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act is a bill in Congress that would carry out similar requirements as Trump's order and has already passed in the House of Representatives.\n\nIt hasn't gone to a vote in the Senate yet.\n\n\"Until Congress changes the law or our state legislature changes the law, we're going to follow the current law and the current civil rights framework of this state, and that's what it tells us to do,\" Reykdal said.\n\nWashington's high school athletes are allowed to compete based on their gender identity rather than their biological sex.\n\nWashington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) policy states that each athlete will participate in programs \"consistent with their gender identity or the gender most consistently expressed,\" and there are no medical or legal requirements.\n\nBills that would prohibit transgender girls from participating in girls and women's sports have been introduced but not passed.\n\nHowever, the issue became so concerning for residents, that in December the WIAA announced a proposal to create a separate open division for transgender athletes to compete in.\n\n\"In order to maintain fair and equitable competition, participation in girls' sports and girls' divisions of sports is restricted to students who were assigned female at birth. The purpose of this policy is to offer clarity with respect to the participation of trans and gender-diverse student-athletes. Additionally, this policy encourages a culture in which student-athletes can compete in a safe and supportive environment, free of discrimination,\" the proposal said.\n\nThat proposal came weeks after the Central Valley School Board, which oversees schools in Spokane Valley and Liberty Lake, Washington, voted to send a message to the WIAA over the issue after debate at a school board meeting.\n\nThe resolution, \"Supporting Equity and Safety in Female Sports,\" claims the entire board is comprised of female members who have either competed in athletics themselves or have daughters who competed in athletics.\n\nOne of the women, an unidentified current cross-country runner, shared her experience during that hearing.\n\n\"When I ran cross-country for Greenacres Middle School, a boy who was biologically male but identified as female competed on the girls team,\" she said.\"\n\nWhile I respect everyone's right to participate in sports, the situation made me question the fairness of competing (with) someone who had the physical advantage associated with male biology.\"\n\nIn May, a trans athlete competed in a girls cross-country championship and won.\n\nThe athlete won the 400-meter heat race in the girls division with a time of 55.59 seconds.\n\nStay up on the very latest with Evening Update.\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nThe second-place runner finished at 58.83 seconds.\n\nIn the finals, the trans athlete won with a time of 55.75 seconds, a full second ahead of the second-place runner, who finished with 56.75.\n\nThis week, a civil rights complaint was filed with the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights on behalf of a teenage girl in Washington state who was allegedly punished for refusing to play a basketball game against a trans athlete.\n\nThe complaint alleged that the Tumwater School District in Washington is investigating 15-year-old Frances Staudt for \"misgendering\" the opponent and violating the district's policies against bullying and harassment.\n\nAccording to the document, prior to a game, Staudt asked the school's principal and athletic director whether a player was a biological male.\n\nThe administrators then allegedly confirmed they were notified the player was transgender but denied her pleas to have the player removed.\n\nStaudt removed herself from the game.\n\nPresident Trump's Department of Education has already launched Title IX investigations into the state high school athletic conferences in California, Minnesota and Maine for their refusal to comply with his executive order."

I was just so honored to even be there as a guest of the president and first lady, that's just unreal - such a surreal moment I'll never forget,\" said McNabb, 19, she still suffers cognitive issues and persistent headaches even two years after her injury.\n\n\"Not only getting to be there, but him actually shouting me out and sharing my story was just amazing. It really fills me up because I'm so thankful we finally have a president that is willing to do that and take this issue for what it is.\"\n\nThe Democrats - who used the joint session as an opportunity to grandstand, including one rep who was escorted out - gave an icy reception to McNabb, sitting stoically in their seats while Republicans and those in the galley cheered.\n\nFrom her vantage point, she could see the Democrats, who remained seated and stone-faced as the House chamber erupted with applause upon hearing her story.\n\n\"I think that was the best speech he's ever given, it was so pro-American and you could really feel it on one side. The Democrats were really unprofessional and embarrassing yesterday in their actions.\"\n\nMcNabb was just 17 when her injury forced her to stop competing at a high level in sports, to which she had dedicated her entire life until that fateful day. Since then, she's become a powerful and persistent voice in advocating for fair, safe competition for female athletes.\n\nA day before Trump's address to Congress, the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act - which would have enshrined Title IX protections \"based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth,\" was blocked by a united front of Democrats.\n\nThe timing of the vote, coupled with congressional Democrats' performative antics during Tuesday's joint session, were not lost on the Western Carolina University sophomore.\n\n\"I think it was so ironic that last night all of the Democrats came together and wore pink and claimed they're the party of women, and literally the day before none of them voted to protect women and girls,\" she said, calling them out for their \"hypocrisy\" on the heated issue.\n\n\"They really showed their hands last night. They can't get over it - 80% of the country agrees on this and they're willing to die on this hill. It was really disappointing seeing none of them take a stand for women, because some of them have daughters, and if they don't they know at least one woman in their lives and voted against them,\" she said.\n\n\"The Democratic party has failed women.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

Aimee says she then approached the school athletic director, who allegedly responded that the school will not discriminate based on sexual identity in accordance with Washington state law.\n\n\"When [Frances] was leaving, she was so mad, she felt like she had been exposed, and it was just a terrible situation,\" Aimee said. \"She walked by and said that 'you're a man.' She was so frustrated in the situation, and that is why she has been now charged with bullying, harassment, and intimidation for misgendering this person.\"\n\nThen, per the complaint, a school employee allegedly confronted Staudt's younger brother about taking a video of the game, saying, \"You better think twice about what you're doing right now.\"\n\nShortly after the incident, Frances spoke out about the situation on social media, which was reportedly met with discrimination allegations and threats.\n\nThe trans athlete involved in the incident later stated in an interview that she would have sat out the game if anyone had expressed an issue.\n\nStay up on the very latest with Evening Update.\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\n\"If any other person or player I'm playing against is like, 'I don't feel comfortable with this,' I don't mind sitting out,\" she said on the YouTube series \"[un]Divided with Brandie Kruse.\"\n\nAimee believes that if the families had been notified of the situation beforehand and given players the option to sit out of the game, it could have yielded a different outcome.\n\n\"But they didn't do that,\" she said. \"They put the kids on the spot, and my daughter was the one that actually stood up in this situation, and... she was exposed... It was awful the way they handled it.\"\n\nThe Tumwater School District released a statement on the controversy: \"We recognize that students and families hold diverse perspectives on various topics, including participation in athletics, and we respect the rights of individual students to make their personal decisions regarding their participation in athletic events.\"\n\n\"As a district, we remain committed to fostering an inclusive environment where all students feel safe, supported, and valued,\" it read.\n\nDespite President Donald Trump's recent executive order banning biological males from women's sports, Washington is one of the many Democrat-run states, including California, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Maine, that have pushed back on the mandate .\n\nWashington's high school athletes are currently allowed to compete based on their gender identity rather than their biological sex.\n\nThe Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) policy states that each athlete will participate in programs \"consistent with their gender identity or the gender most consistently expressed,\" and there are not even any medical or legal requirements. Bills that would prohibit transgender girls from participating in girls' and women's sports have been introduced but not passed.\n\n\"We did get a letter late Friday that they have found that... she has violated WIAA policy. She hasn't violated Tumwater School policy, so now they've placed her on what they're saying is, if there's any further incidents, she can be charged with further discipline,\" Aimee said.\n\n\"So it's basically like they're holding this over her head.\""

Tom Suozzi is coming under fire for voting against a bill that would ban transgender women from competing against female athletes.\n\nRepublicans now plan to use Suozzi's no vote as ammo against his re-election next year.\n\n\"Spineless Tom Suozzi lied to voters, blatantly flip-flopped his position, and abandoned his district when he sided with [House Democratic minority leader] Hakeem Jeffries and [Gov.]Kathy Hochul by voting to allow boys to compete in girls' sports,\"  charged National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee spokeswoman Maureen O'Toole.\n\nSuozzi's home base of Nassau County last year approved one of the nation's first laws barring biological men who identify as transgender women from competing in female sports in county facilities.\n\nAfter narrowly winning re-election in November, Suozzi had said, \"The Democrats have to stop pandering to the far left.\n\n\"I don't want to discriminate against anybody, but I don't think biological boys should be playing in girls' sports. Democrats aren't saying that, and they should be,\" he said.\n\nBut he then voted against the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act in the US House on Jan. 14, when it was passed along partisan lines 216-206, with two Texas Democrats breaking ranks to support it.\n\nAnother Long Island Democratic House member, first-term Rep. Laura Gillen, also voted against the trans-ban bill.\n\n\"I am disappointed that our [Long Island] Congressional Delegation chose to support their Democrat Party bosses rather than their constituents,\" said Republican Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman.\n\n\"The girls and women who only want fair competition and a safe environment to compete.\"\n\nSuozzi won re-election over Republican Mike LiPetri by a narrow 4 percentage points in the third House District covering parts of Nassau County and Queens in November. President Trump carried the district at the top of the ticket by 4 percentage points over Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nThe congressman defended his anti-trans-ban vote to The Post on Sunday.\n\n\"This is a typical political attack and gotcha game,\" Suozzi said. \"I do not believe transgender women should compete in competitive women's sports, but this poorly written, partisan bill would subject young girls to invasive exams and encourage bullying based on appearance.\n\n\"Instead, we should rely on sports governing bodies to establish fair rules for competitive women's sports and education experts to develop appropriate guidelines for elementary and high schools,\" he said.\n\nThe GOP is hopeful that the measure will also pass the Republican-controlled Senate and head to President Trump's desk for his signature. The Senate bill was introduced by Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a former Auburn University football coach.\n\nDemocrats in control of the Senate blocked the bill there last year, but Republicans are now in charge.\n\nAdvertisement"

Exclusion of views that do not conform to one particular ideology.\"\n\nAuthor Joan Smith told the outlet that the university is \"creating problems where they don't exist.\"\n\n\"[It's] using language that can only be described as fear-mongering,\" she told The Telegraph.\n\nShe also said the guidelines \"demonizes those of us who know that human beings can't change sex, and I feel sorry for staff at any venue that adopts it.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

Now I don't get to be a woman, fully, and I will never know what it's like.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old is transitioning back to being a woman after, she said, she was failed by medical professionals who led her down the path to testosterone injections and a double mastectomy by age 18.\n\nPrisha said she was rushed through gender transition after being convinced - by activists and therapists - that being born in the wrong body was at the root of all her problems.\n\n\"I don't think people should be allowed to take this experimental medicine and do these experimental surgeries until they're 25, when the brain is fully developed,\" Prisha said\n\nHer upbringing, in Maryland and North Carolina, was a difficult one.\n\nSo Prisha turned to the internet for solace, and found a transgender activist community online.\n\n\"I was dealing with very, very adult things ... and therefore I wasn't able to make any friends my age,\" Prisha, who now lives in Michigan, told The Post. \"So I started being online a lot and talking to adults online. I got preyed upon.\"\n\nAt the onset of puberty, at age 12, Prisha said she experienced Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria - a controversial term used to describe a sudden and urgent feeling of being the wrong gender .\n\n\"I literally hated every aspect of who I was and what I was and what I looked like,\" Prisha said. \"I spent some time being a girly girl and being a tomboy and being a smart girl and being this [other] girl, but none of those different hats fit me. And so I was like, I guess I'm just not a girl.\"\n\nThat sense became overwhelming at age 14, when, Prisha said, she was sexually assaulted by a 20-year-old friend of a friend.\n\nBeing violated made her further reject her womanhood.\n\n\"I thought that that only happened to girls,\" she said. \"And I thought that that was just the beginning.\"\n\nAt 15, she socially transitioned, presenting as male, and came out to her parents, who tried to support her.\n\nAt first, the experience was hugely affirming, especially with her online friends cheering her on.\n\n\"I was getting tons of attention,\" she recalled. \"And that felt wonderful ... which is why it was so addicting. I was being love-bombed.\"\n\nThe online activists helped connect Prisha to a transgender specialist. She brought her parents to the appointment, which lasted less than an hour.\n\nFor Prisha, meeting with the specialist was affirming: \"She looked me in my eyes and she said, 'You are a boy.'\"\n\nFor her parents, she added, the experience was terrifying.\n\n\"My parents were bullied. [The specialist] said, 'Do you want a dead daughter or a living son? Do you want to pick up your daughter's hormones or her body from the morgue?'\" Prisha recalled. \"They were manipulated.\"\n\nShe left the appointment with a referral for hormone replacement therapy that she brought to a hospital - an institution that, she now says, should have pumped the brakes given her medical history.\n\nOn top of struggling with depression and anxiety, Prisha had suicidal ideation and self-harmed throughout her teen years; she'd even had wounds of her own creation stitched up at the very same hospital.\n\nShe was also being treated by a nutritionist there for severe anorexia. On top of all of that, she had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.\n\n\"I was an impressionable, documented mentally ill child,\" Prisha told The Post.\n\nNonetheless, she claimed, doctors began administering testosterone treatment when she was only 15.\n\nRight after her 18th birthday, Prisha had a double mastectomy to masculinize her chest.\n\n\"I was under the impression that I was a boy - that I was born in the wrong body - and this medicine and surgery is what I needed and not being aligned is why I was suicidal,\" she recalled.\n\nAfter her surgery, Prisha said, she was lured to Florida to live with a group of people she online who told her she was unsafe living with her conservative, Chrisian family.\n\n\"When trans adults told me that there was gonna be a trans genocide in a few years and that conservatives wanted to kill us,\" she explained. \"I could not distinguish reality from fiction.\"\n\nPrisha lived with her online friends for three years, until having a positive experience while in therapy for her other mental health issues.\n\n\"I felt a tremendous amount of relief - and realized the transition didn't help the underlying issues,\" she said. \"I was like, 'Oh my God, I could have gotten this feeling and stopped being suicidal without mutilating my body.'\"\n\nThat's when she stopped taking her hormones.\n\n\"The biggest feeling was probably shame,\" Prisha recalled. \"I was really realizing that I had made such a fuss over having found what was going to cure me ... and then been wrong about the cure.\"\n\nShe moved to Michigan to start a new life, but the scars of her transition still haunt her.\n\nPrisha suffers vocal cord pain and severe vaginal atrophy from the testosterone treatment. She also, she said, lost part of her nipples after they were grafted back on during her mastectomy. Because of her mastectomy she will never be able to breastfeed, and Prisha doesn't even know whether she is still fertile.\n\nBut she is in a happy relationship now and talking to her family. Prisha also enrolled in Ferris State University to become a therapist and help other people who are struggling.\n\n\"I actually have a huge deal of empathy for trans people or trans identifying people,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement"

It was filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, based in Seattle.\n\n\"This discriminatory ban is a threat to our national security, wastes years of training and financial investments, and is unconstitutional,\" said Sarah Warbelow, Vice President of Legal, Human Rights Campaign Foundation. \"Thousands of transgender servicemembers have already met the military's rigorous standards and more than proven themselves. Our military must be able to recruit the best candidates, retain the highly-trained servicemembers, and every qualified patriot should be able to serve free of discrimination.\"\n\nThere are roughly 1.3 million active-duty personnel. Officials say the number of trans service members is in the low thousands, according to Reuters ."

      "text": "Trump seeks to curtail trans procedures for minors with new executive order\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order aimed at curtailing gender transition procedures for people under the age of 19.\n\nTitled \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" the order directs federal agencies to defund and oppose medical interventions Trump called \"irreversible and destructive.\"\n\n\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" the White House's readout of the action states.\n\nThe executive order directs federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, to withdraw funding for any institution that provides transgender procedures to minors. Specifically, the order defines \"chemical and surgical mutilation\" as the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries to alter a child's physical appearance or reproductive anatomy.\n\nThe directive requires HHS to immediately begin rescinding policies based on guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which Trump's administration criticized as lacking \"scientific integrity.\" Within 90 days, the department must publish a review of medical literature on treating gender dysphoria in minors and issue new guidance aimed at ending the practice.\n\nFederally run insurance programs, such as TRICARE and Medicaid, are also ordered to exclude coverage for these procedures. The order further directs the Office of Personnel Management to ensure federal employee health plans eliminate coverage for pediatric transgender surgeries and hormone treatments by 2026.\n\nThe order tasks the Justice Department with enforcing existing laws, including prioritizing prosecutions under laws against female genital mutilation, which the administration says align with the broader goal of protecting children from harmful medical practices. It also calls for investigations into alleged fraud and deception by medical providers regarding the long-term effects of transgender procedures for minors.\n\nAdditionally, the Justice Department is directed to draft legislation allowing children and parents to sue healthcare providers for damages resulting from gender transition procedures, with the inclusion of a lengthy statute of limitations.\n\nThe order also takes aim at so-called \"sanctuary states\" that allow custody changes to facilitate access to transgender procedures, calling for enforcement of federal laws such as the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act.\n\nThe executive order follows recent Supreme Court arguments in United States v. Skrmetti , where the justices appeared poised to uphold a Tennessee law banning puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for minors, with supporters arguing it protects children from unproven and harmful treatments."

However, more Democrats believe it is \"morally acceptable,\" increasing from 67% to 70% since 2021.\n\nThose who personally know people who identify as transgender are more likely to find it morally acceptable, but nevertheless, the numbers fell from 60% to 56% since 2021. Acceptability among those who do not know a transgender person shrank from 40% to 33%.\n\nThere has been a dramatic increase in younger people identifying as transgender. While transgender activists say some of the explanation could be due to the broader societal acceptability around transgender issues, those who are more skeptical of the rise believe it is artificial and look to public messaging, popularity trends, and social media influence for the explanation.\n\nCountries such as France have viewed the dramatic increase in identification as \"epidemic-like,\" with its National Academy of Medicine writing that the issue is \"primarily social\" and can be rooted in \"excessive consultation of social networks, greater social acceptability, or example in the [group].\"\n\nAligned with the trend on transgender identification among younger generations, Gallup found younger people were more likely to say that changing genders was morally acceptable.\n\nAmong 18-29-year-olds, 60% found it morally acceptable to identify as transgender, whereas 48% of 30-49-year-olds thought the same. Only 32% over the age of 50 agreed.\n\nGallup notes that while older people's views on the moral acceptability of changing genders shrank from 39% in 2021, the other age demographics have remained about the same.\n\nThe general decrease in acceptability comes as transgender athletes competing in women's sports has put the spotlight on the biological differences between the sexes.\n\nGallup's poll also shows the country souring on the idea of transgender people participating in women's sports. While 62% already believed this was unfair in 2021, 69% now agree it is wrong. Those who believe transgender athletes should be able to play on a team that matches their professed gender also shrank by 8 points, from 34% in 2021 to 26% in 2023.\n\n\"The American people understand that it's a biological fact that girls' and boys' bodies are built differently,\" Mercer said. \"When looking at sports, this reality becomes undeniable. We're thankful for courageous athletes like Riley Gaines who have spoken out about this. They've done so much to change public opinion.\""

      "text": "Biden administration spent millions creating transgender animals to experiment on\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, under President Joe Biden, has spent millions of dollars funding experiments where animals are given sex-change procedures and studied for the benefit of the transgender community.\n\nTaxpayers have footed the bill for roughly $10 million in transgender animal experiments in recent years, according to a selection of grants compiled by the White Coat Waste Project and obtained exclusively by the Washington Examiner . The federal spending supported research ranging from studying the cardiovascular effect of giving \"feminizing hormone therapy\" to male rats to providing animals injected with sex hormones, a \"popular drug of abuse utilized at raves,\" to investigate overdose in \"vulnerable female and transgender populations.\"\n\n\"Taxpayers don't want their hard-earned money wasted by the NIH to make monkeys and mice transgender through invasive surgeries and hormone therapies or to give animals overdoses of sex party drugs,\" Anthony Bellotti, president and founder of White Coat Waste Project, told the Washington Examiner . \"This is low-hanging fruit for DOGE and the incoming Administration that we're proud to have uncovered and exposed. The solution is simple: Stop the money. Stop the madness.\"\n\nElon Musk, who President-elect Donald Trump has tasked with cutting government costs and improving outputs through the Department of Government Efficiency, has signaled openness to cutting federally funded animal testing. Musk's medical device company, Neuralink, however, faced a federal investigation in late 2022 following complaints from employees that its animal testing was causing unnecessary suffering and death among monkeys at his labs.\n\nOne of the most expensive publicly-funded transgender animal studies seeks to understand \"the effects of feminizing hormone therapy with estrogen in the lungs of trans women\" by giving mice female sex hormones and then irritating their respiratory systems with mites to record information about their reactions. To date, the study has cost roughly $3.1 million, according to federal records. A similarly expensive grant, costing the public about $2.6 million since its inception, funded research where female mice were given male sex hormones and then monitored for changes in fertility. The mice suffered \"defects in ovarian architecture,\" according to federal records.\n\n\"Of course, the Biden-Harris administration wasted millions of tax dollars on DEI grants to create transgender lab mice,\" Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) told the Washington Examiner . \"DOGE should tackle this woke animal testing on Day 1.\"\n\nSome of the publicly funded studies involved testing how transgender sex hormones affected animals after they were harmed. Research at Brigham and Women's Hospital that has cost the public $442,444, for instance, looked at how sex hormones altered the healing of wounds in \"large animals.\" NIH funded a second study researching the effect of cross-sex hormones on wound healing in mice. Another lab, funded by about $1.2 million in public grants, saw animals injected with testosterone to test if they have an increased risk of overdose when exposed to a party drug popular with transgender people.\n\nWhile it is common scientific practice to use animals as models for people to test the effects of different medical interventions, organizations such as the White Coat Waste Project have long opposed taxpayer funding for such studies. The organization has characterized the studies as abusive and aims to \"retire survivors [of animal testing] as pets.\"\n\nOther publicly funded research on transgender animals included injecting female mice with testosterone to investigate how hormone replacement therapy affects the development of bre ast cancer , testing an HIV vaccine on mice exposed to cross-sex hormones, and monitoring how \"gender-affirming hormone therapy\" affects the gut health of rodents.\n\n\"Egregious government waste like tax-funded transgender animal tests is Exhibit A for why we need spending bills that Congress can actually read, debate, and defend to the American people,\" Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) said in a statement to the Washington Examiner .\n\nIn addition to funding research that saw animals subjected to sex-change treatments, the federal government also funded studies arguing for the importance of such experiments.\n\n\"We believe that animal models of [Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy] can help fill this gap by allowing researchers to conduct studies not possible in humans to better understand the specific biological systems affected by GAHT,\" says one publicly funded paper. A study funded by the same grant argued that mice could be used as a \"model\" for \"peripubertal transmasculine youth.\"\n\nTransgender research funded by the NIH recently came under fire from lawmakers, with six Republican senators demanding answers from the agency in early December after a researcher working on a taxpayer-funded study on transgender children opted to withhold its results.\n\n\"The NIH has taken the cheese and fell victim to the DEI trap,\" Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) told the Washington Examiner . \"While I've spent years fighting for more research and expanding treatment options for those with metastatic breast cancer, the leading 'health' agency in Washington has been mousing around and spending millions on rodent sex changes. These silly science projects will be DOA in the DOGE era.\"\n\nNIH did not respond to the Washington Examiner 's request for comment."

      "text": "The real way to protect 'trans kids'\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Wednesday in United States v. Skrmetti , a case dealing with a Tennessee ban on transgender medical interventions for minors. The claim is that the ban qualifies as discrimination under the 14th Amendment and its equal protection clause. State Solicitor General J. Matthew Rice and ACLU attorney Chase Strangio, a biological woman and first transgender lawyer to appear before the Supreme Court, argued their respective sides before the justices.\n\nThe decision will likely be handed down in June. Whatever the outcome, it will greatly affect the nation as 26 states have banned such treatments. It is one thing to allow unrestricted access to adults who seek to transition. Americans may disagree but do not bar them from making these and other adult-sized decisions. But when minors are involved, it is a different story entirely.\n\nDuring an appearance on CNN before the Supreme Court arguments, Strangio said of minors receiving gender-affirming care, \"These are young people who may have known since they were two years old exactly who they are. Who suffered for six or seven years before they had any relief.\"\n\nStrangio goes on to say, \"It's not the kids who are consenting to this treatment. It's the parents who are consenting to this treatment.\"\n\nStrangio's explanations are absurd but illuminating. Two-year-olds do not have the physical, mental, or emotional maturity to understand anything related to gender or sex. Looking to toddlers, young children, or adolescents as their own guides in this or any major life-altering decision is, frankly, child endangerment. And by saying parents are responsible for consenting to an actual course of treatment, Strangio admits the pursuit of so-called \"gender-affirming care\" is thrust upon minors by their guardians.\n\nIn a guest essay at the New York Times earlier this week, Strangio declared , \"Trans health saved my life.\" But the piece details how Strangio didn't even transition until early adulthood. Children and young people deserve much better.\n\nThe Cass report by Dr. Hilary Cass, published in April, resulted in the U.K. banning puberty blockers for minors. The evidence in the report overwhelmingly encourages a cautious approach when it comes to children and gender dysphoria. According to Do No Harm, \"Dr. Cass rightfully acknowledges that the medical pathway is not the best way to manage gender-related distress in young people and that it is impossible to identify which children might persist in their feeling of gender dysphoria. Preventing children from accessing these irreversible interventions is the only sensible path forward.\"\n\nAt the Supreme Court, Strangio admitted during a discussion of the Cass report with Justice Samuel Alito that gender-affirming care \"does not reduce completed suicides.\" In another exchange, Alito powerfully pointed out that transgenderism is not an immutable characteristic and, therefore, the Tennessee ban is not discrimination.\n\nIn August 2020, the American Journal of Psychiatry published a correction of a paper on sex reassignment released less than a year before. Despite what had previously been published, the correction of the study concluded that surgery did not improve mood or anxiety. The original paper had already found the same thing when it came to hormone treatments.\n\nIn a piece for the Heritage Foundation titled \"'Transitioning' Procedures Don't Help Mental Health, Largest Dataset Shows,\" Ryan Anderson concluded, \"Now the world's largest relevant dataset reveals hormones and surgeries don't bring wholeness and happiness. We need to find better, more humane, and effective responses to those who experience dysphoria.\"\n\nA fast-track approach to \"solving\" problems of gender dysphoria in children is dangerous and does not improve long-term mental health. Women such as Nikita Teran , who transitioned and detransitioned in adulthood, and Chloe Cole , who did both as a minor, are proof that transitioning is a life-altering decision anyone of any age may come to regret.\n\nDecisions of such consequence should not be taken lightly. And they should not be shoved onto children even if they feel they don't belong in their own bodies. Banning minors from participating in and receiving these procedures and medical therapies is not discrimination. It's safeguarding individual lives and futures from major regret and protecting mental health along the way.\n\nKimberly Ross ( @SouthernKeeks ) is a contributor to the Washington Examiner's Beltway Confidential blog and a contributing freelance columnist at the Freemen News-Letter."

John Fetterman (D-PA) said he is an ally of transgender athletes on Monday after a vote in the Senate on proposed legislation that would prevent transgender women from competing in women's sports .\n\nThe Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act failed to obtain more than the 60 votes necessary to avoid a Senate filibuster.\n\n\"To provide that for purposes of determining compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 in athletics, sex shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth,\" the legislation reads.\n\nIt was defeated in a party-line vote, with 51 Republicans voting to support it and 46 Democrats voting against it. Fetterman voted against the bill and criticized the measure in a social media post on Monday. He said transgender athletes deserved \"an ally\" and that he was one.\n\n\"The small handful of trans athletes in PA in a political maelstrom deserve an ally and I am one,\" Fetterman posted . \"Depersonalized as 'they/them' in a political ad, but are just schoolchildren.\"\n\nThe small handful of trans athletes in PA in a political maelstrom deserve an ally and I am one. Depersonalized as \"they/them\" in a political ad, but are just schoolchildren. Empty show votes or cruelty on social media aren't part of a thoughtful, dignified solution.\n\nFetterman referred to legislative action and criticism of transgender women participating in female sports as cruel and not a \"dignified solution.\"\n\n\"Empty show votes or cruelty on social media aren't part of a thoughtful, dignified solution,\" Fetterman added.\n\nFetterman did not provide any commentary about female schoolchildren who would be forced to compete against transgender athletes despite claims to the contrary when citing gender identity.\n\nThe bill was particularly important to Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL). He introduced the legislation, along with 39 other co-sponsors. Before the vote, he commented on the bill's history and the challenges of getting it passed because of the lack of Democratic support.\n\n\"This is the third time that I've had a vote on this bill,\" Tuberville said . \"The other two times have failed because we have had almost zero Democrats help to support women and girls in sports.\"\n\nFETTERMAN CONDEMNS ATTACK AGAINST NANCY MACE\n\nMeanwhile, Fetterman's comments and vote on the bill reinforce his commitment to issues and values that align with his left-wing politics. Previously, it was suggested that Fetterman might be straying from his political party's beliefs, given his comments regarding Hamas, co-sponsoring and voting for the Laken Riley Act, and meeting President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago .\n\nThere is hope among some that the spirit of the bill and the declarations made in the legislation will still be implemented nationwide. In February, Trump issued the \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order, which made it U.S. policy \"to oppose male competitive participation in women's sports more broadly, as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.\""

As the series progresses, it also explores the other impacts the transgender movement has had, including the convincing of minors to undergo extensive surgeries.\n\n\"What I've realized about the gender ideology movement, yes, female athletes are certainly at risk, but what we are seeing on the transing of minors, how minors are being chemically and surgically castrated. They are the victims in this story,\" Gaines told the Washington Examiner . \"And so we talk to many families with children who have transitioned, some who have been de-transitioned, parents who have lost their children. We talked to de-transitioners themselves about the process that they went through, how they called themselves 'medical experiments.'\"\n\nGaines added that the docuseries is \"all encompassing\" on how the transgender movement has impacted lives and that the \"heartbreaking\" stories told in the series represent a small portion of those happening throughout the country. As such, she stressed how people \"need to hear\" these stories.\n\nOne is told by a family after their child chose to transition without their consent claiming the government \"obtained their child.\" The family, who is \"rooted\" in biblical values, chose not to affirm their child's gender identity, prompting Child Protective Services to get involved.\n\n\"This family, they never thought they were going to have to go through this,\" Gaines said. \"They thought, 'This wouldn't affect us, we're a family, we've got multiple kids - this won't happen to our family.' Yet it did, which, again, is the fear that I think a lot of families possess today.\"\n\nAnother story explored in this series is that of Prisha Mosley, who became pregnant following her de-transition. Mosley stated that she underwent three \"medical experiments\" in her life, which include transitioning, de-transitioning, and her pregnancy.\n\nLast month, Gaines said she plans to vote for former President Donald Trump despite the fact that some are voting for Vice President Kamala Harris since she is a woman. \"I am voting for Donald J. Trump BECAUSE I am a woman,\" Gaines said at a Trump rally in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nTrump has called to protect women's sports from transgender athletes and has also vowed to ban transgender surgeries for minors should he win the 2024 election."

      "text": "A new look at trans in America\n\nA NEW LOOK AT TRANS IN AMERICA. The Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation have done a study on American adults classified as trans. The headline of the Washington Post write-up of the study is: \"Most trans adults say transitioning made them more satisfied with their lives.\" That's the story the Washington Post wants to emphasize. But some of the information in the study might also help inform the political debate about how to handle the issue in U.S. schools, businesses, and elsewhere.\n\nFirst, the study cites the number of adults classified as trans in the United States. The figure is actually not from the study but from one last year done by the UCLA Williams Institute , which said that 1.6 million people in the U.S. age 13 and above call themselves trans. With a U.S. population of 333 million, that works out to slightly below one-half of 1% of Americans above the age of 13 who call themselves trans.\n\nThis is, in other words, a very small group. And the number, 1.6 million, includes the significant number of young Americans, between the ages of 13 and 17, who are increasingly calling themselves trans. To the degree that that reflects a certain amount of social contagion and not some new, never-before-seen biological reality, the total estimate of trans people in America, 1.6 million, might actually shrink in the next few years as some of those 13-17-year-olds age.\n\nSubscribe today to the Washington Examiner magazine that will keep you up to date with what's going on in Washington. SUBSCRIBE NOW: Just $1.00 an issue!\n\nThe survey covers some of the basic facts of the lives of people who call themselves trans. For example, it reveals that a large majority - 69% - of people who call themselves trans have not used hormone treatments. An even larger majority - 84% - have not had surgery. Most of them, 77%, told researchers they simply changed the types of clothes they wear and/or their hairstyle.\n\nNow, remember the headline: \"Most trans adults say transitioning made them more satisfied with their lives.\" The study's results make clear that, in most cases, increased life satisfaction came without hormone treatments or surgery. And yet today, there is an alliance of activists on the left - ideologues, interest groups, for-profit medical enterprises, and the Biden administration's public health departments - that promote life-altering, irreversible procedures for young Americans. They have given it a euphemistic name, \"gender-affirming care,\" and have established medical facilities that specialize in drastic treatments. They have castigated Republicans who disapprove of such procedures for people under the age of 18 as if that were a hateful and bigoted, rather than a well-considered and entirely reasonable, position.\n\nThe survey also looked into the everyday behavior of people who call themselves trans. It found that a large majority - 70% - do not present themselves as trans in public all the time. Some never do. \"Trans people don't always present as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth,\" the Washington Post said. \"Three in ten trans people physically present as a different gender all the time, while 20 percent do so 'most of the time.' Another 34 percent present as a different gender some of the time, and a small but significant share (16 percent) say they 'never' physically present as a gender different from their sex assigned at birth.\"\n\nFinally, the survey found that a majority of people characterized as trans actually prefer to be referred to as something else. The researchers found that 62% of those surveyed preferred to be called \"nonbinary\" or \"gender non-conforming,\" while only 22% preferred to be called a \"trans woman\" and 12% a \"trans man.\"\n\nWhat does it all mean? The first and most important thing is that the growing trans industry needs to hit the brakes on performing life-altering, irreversible procedures - surgery and puberty-blocking hormone treatments - on minors. People are capable of deciding to have such procedures once they are old enough to choose for themselves, and the evidence in the survey shows that a large majority ultimately do not choose hormones or surgery. If the issue were less political, and less impassioned, and if there were not big money at stake for the medical institutions that have gone all-in on trans as a business, if all that were true, the situation would be much, much better.\n\nFor a deeper dive into many of the topics covered in the Daily Memo, please listen to my podcast, The Byron York Show - available on the Ricochet Audio Network and everywhere else podcasts can be found.

Burgess Owens (R-UT), along with more than a dozen other Republicans, signed off on the letter to the IOC.\n\n\"Future Olympians are counting on the IOC to protect the opportunities of women and girls to contribute to this proud tradition,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"To do so, the IOC must base eligibility for women's athletic competitions on biological sex.

Under the 2004 consensus, individuals who have undergone sex reassignment surgery are allowed to compete among the gender they've transitioned to.\n\nThe letter comes ahead of the IOC's March 17 meeting, the agenda of which includes electing its next president and preparing for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nThe lawmakers referenced in the letter President Donald Trump's Feb. 5 executive order , which prohibited biological men from competing in women's sports.\n\nLIST: THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT\n\nControversy arose during the 2024 Paris Olympics over the gender of Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who won gold in women's boxing.\n\nKhelif was diagnosed with differences in sexual development.

She was disqualified from the female International Boxing Association championship in 2023 after genetic testing revealed she had XY chromosomes. However, she was able to compete in the women's category under the International Olympic Committee's guidelines for testing testosterone levels."

      "text": "ACLU's top transgender lawyer dissed Harris as Democrats grapple with trans issues\n\nAn attorney poised to become the first transgender person to argue before the Supreme Court suggested that Vice President Kamala Harris does not \"give a s*** about trans people,\" according to recent posts on social media.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday agreed to allow Chase Strangio, co-director of the American Civil Liberties Union 's LGBTQ and HIV Project, to argue in early December on behalf of the families of three minors in Tennessee who challenged the state's cross-sex hormone ban for patients under 18. The case is expected to be one of the highest-profile of the Supreme Court's term.\n\nStrangio, a biological female who uses \"he/they\" pronouns, has made hundreds of posts online advocating broad access to medical procedures, including for \"trans youth,\" and has a history of promoting the notion that sex is subjective and that doctors merely \"assign\" it at birth.\n\n\"Our genital characteristics are one component of who we are and do not define, medically or biologically, our sex,\" Strangio wrote for Slate in July 2016. \"Additionally, all components of sex from genitals to hormones to chromosomes exist on a spectrum rather than as a binary.\"\n\nThe left flank of the Democratic Party agrees, and those beliefs about gender have caused intraparty rifts this election cycle. Strangio is supporting Harris but devoted a lengthy Instagram post to those on the Left who say \"Harris and the democrats\" don't care about transgender people.\n\n\"I don't disagree,\" Strangio said before arguing in a separate post that a second Trump presidency would \"mean legitimizing government discrimination against trans people for generations.\"\n\nA post shared by Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio)\n\n\"I understand this is deeply upsetting for some people,\" Strangio said of supporting Harris, adding, \"I believe our government is funding and enabling a genocide. And has been for decades.\"\n\n\"I am defending trans life and bodily autonomy as best I can in a violent and compromised system,\" Strangio said.\n\nA post shared by Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio)\n\nStrangio's remarks come as Harris and other Democrats have, in recent months, dodged questions on the extent of their support for transgender rights. In the past two weeks, the Trump campaign has poured more than $21 million into highlighting Harris's past support of funding transgender procedures for people incarcerated in prisons or Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, according to her response to a 2019 ACLU survey. Harris was also evasive on the issue when asked by NBC News's Hallie Jackson to clarify her stance on transgender procedures. The Democratic candidate said that while she believed transgender people \"should be treated with dignity,\" treatments are ultimately a \"decision that doctors will make in terms of what is medically necessary.\"\n\nA post shared by Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio)\n\nStrangio defended Harris in a new Instagram post on Thursday, calling Harris's vagueness on the matter during the NBC interview a form of \"strategic protection\" while suggesting the type of judges appointed under Biden and Harris \"makes a difference\" for transgender court cases.\n\n\"People are suggesting it shows she is abandoning trans people,\" Strangio added. \"I have a very different read.\"\n\nDespite Strangio's frequent posting and exercise of free speech, the attorney called for the silencing in 2020 of author Abigail Shrier, a bestselling author who has written extensively about the subject of transgender people who come to regret their decisions to make life-altering changes to their body.\n\n\"Stopping the circulation of this book and these ideas is 100% a hill I will die on,\" the attorney for the free speech legal firm said in 2020.\n\nStrangio has also publicly cast doubts that the Supreme Court would strike down Tennessee's ban on cross-sex hormone procedures for minors, according to a Law Dork podcast episode, during which the ACLU attorney admitted people are asking, \"Why would you take this to the Supreme Court, knowing that the Supreme Court is a risky\" move. Justices will hear arguments in United States v. Skrmetti on Dec. 4 in response to a petition by the Justice Department after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit upheld Tennessee's law, marking a blow against the ACLU's case.\n\nDo No Harm, an organization advocating the protection of children from underage transition procedures, called the ACLU's selection of Strangio a flagrant move for \"identity politics over science.\"\n\n\"The choice of Chase Strangio-who has rejected the idea of biological sex-to argue before the Supreme Court reaffirms the ACLU's commitment to fact-free identity politics over science,\" said Stanley Goldfarb, board chairman of Do No Harm. \"As we pointed out in our amicus brief, the Tennessee law follows medical ethics and that these sex-change procedures are unsupported by evidence-based medicine,\" Goldfarb added. \"We look forward to oral arguments and believe the Court will uphold Tennessee's protection of children from this harmful ideology.\"\n\nThe Skrmetti case focuses on the narrow question of whether the ban on transgender medical treatments for children violates the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. While the Supreme Court granted the ACLU's request for divided arguments in Skrmetti , justices declined the organization's request to consider a due process-related complaint.\n\nThe Washington Examiner made multiple attempts to contact the ACLU and Strangio."

Study of 100k+ patients found those with surgery had significantly higher rates of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation & substance use disorder vs matched controls w/o surgery pic.twitter.com/e5Bf36AQnN\n\nAccording to the researchers, \"Our analysis reveals a significantly elevated risk of mental health disorders-including depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and substance use disorder-post-surgery among individuals with a prior diagnosis of gender dysphoria.\"\n\nBreaking down the data by gender, the study found that both males and females who underwent these procedures experienced a greater likelihood of depression compared to their counterparts who did not have surgery.\n\nHere is a table of their findings. The red columns represent cohorts that underwent \"gender-affirming\" surgery, and blue columns represent cohorts that did not. Outcomes for males with GD who receive surgery compared to males with GD who do not: - Suicidal ideation: +35.6% 📈 -... pic.twitter.com/xQl5838Rcc\n\nThis challenges the narrative that so called 'gender-affirming' surgeries universally improve mental well-being by alleviating gender dysphoria. Instead, the research suggests that surgical interventions do not address the root causes of psychological distress and could, in some cases, exacerbate them.\n\nThe implications of these findings are profound, particularly as the number of individuals seeking sex-change surgeries continues to rise.\n\nFor years, advocates have argued that such procedures are a critical step toward mental health stability for those experiencing gender dysphoria.\n\nThe previous regime in the US even argued that blocking puberty, removing genitals, or adding fake genitals is necessary to keep people, including children, mentally healthy and to stop them from killing themselves.\n\nBiden's assistant secretary for health says \"gender-affirming care\" for minors - meaning irreversible sex reassignment surgeries and puberty blockers - is \"mental health care\" pic.twitter.com/Wsyw6WiFaP\n\nA bombshell study reveals that transgender individuals who undergo gender-affirming surgery face significantly higher rates of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. This isn't \"life-saving care\"-it's medical malpractice. https://t.co/rBo8qSKLFd\n\nSo it's the exact opposite of what they claim. Turns out chopping off peoples genitals and inverting them causes suicidal ideation? Wow. Shocker. Really, who could have possibly foreseen that outcome. Well, at least the doctors weren't doing this to childre......... 😶\n\nWho would've guessed that genitalia mutilation isn't the key to happiness?\n\nLet's see, person is depressed but told mangling their body will fix that. Then person has mutilated body plus existing depression, leading to even worse outcomes. Failure to accept who you are IS the illness, not the cure\n\n*  *  *\n\nYour support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.

      "text": "Former UPenn Athletes Sue To Expunge Trans Swimmer Lia Thomas' Records\n\nThree former swimmers for the University of Pennsylvania have sued the Ivy League college to expunge the records of transgender athlete Lia Thomas.\n\nAlums Grace Estabrook, Margot Kaczorowski and Ellen Holmquist filed the suit on Tuesday, alleging they suffered emotional trauma after Thomas competed as a woman, destroying everything they'd worked their entire lives to achieve. The lawsuit was filed one day before President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning biological men from competing in women's sports, the Fox News reports.\n\nThe three actual women claim that their former school, along with Harvard University, the NCAA, and the Ivy League Council of Presidents subjected them to harassment and abuse in violation of federal laws by allowing Thomas to compete on their team.\n\n\"The UPenn administrators told the women that if anyone was struggling with accepting Thomas' participation on the UPenn Women's team, they should seek counseling and support from CAPS and the LBGTQ center,\" reads the lawsuit.\n\n2004 grads Kaczorowski and Holmquist, and Estabrook, a 2022 graduate, say they were \" repeatedly emotionally traumatized \" after Thomas was allowed to compete with them in violation of Title IX, and say that school officials pushed pro-trans ideology on them the entire time Thomas was on the team.\n\nThey also allege that school administrators invited them to a talk titled \"Trans 101,\" where they were the problem if they had issues with a \"trans-identifying male\" on their team .\n\nSchool officials also allegedly warned them against speaking out about Thomas or they'd be labeled transphobes and risk not finding jobs upon graduation.\n\nThe defendants are accused of creating a culture of intimidation that forced young women to deny biology . The plaintiffs claim that adding Thomas to their team jeopardized their opportunities, privacy, and safety.\n\nThomas, who competed for the UPenn Men's Swimming and Diving team between 2017 and 2020 then transitioned to the women's team , coming in first in the 500, 200, and 100-yard freestyle races - setting women's records. Thomas also broke several women's records at the 2022 Ivy League Championship, hosted at Harvard University.\n\nThe lawsuit asks a judge to declare that Thomas was ineligible to compete in women's races, and expunge his records, according to The National News Desk .\n\n\"The Ivy League's plan was to crown a man as a women's champion in one of the most iconic swimming venues in America as scores of national and international journalists described the scene as a landmark civil rights accomplishment to be venerated,\" reads the lawsuit. \"To bring its vision to fruition, the Ivy League engaged in a season-long pressure campaign to keep Thomas eligible to compete and prevent women from speaking up for their equal rights.\"\n\nThe swimmers' attorney, Bioll Bock, told The National News Desk that the alleged \"pressure campaign\" defied common sense and harmed his clients.\n\n\"The Ivy League believed that if America's oldest and most storied educational institutions led the way, Americans would suppress common sense and submit to radical policies that steal young women's cherished sports opportunities and obliterate biological reality ,\" he wrote, adding \"This lawsuit exposes the behind the scenes scheming that led to the attempt by Harvard University, UPenn, the Ivy League and the NCAA, to impose radical gender ideology on the American college sports landscape. \"\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

He's going to lose badly,\" the President noted, adding \"The whole party is still into that.

      "text": "Trans City-Councilor Takes Month Off To Recover From Being Misgendered\n\nA trans Massachusetts city councilor is taking a one-month leave of absence, citing feelings of being unsafe after allegedly being \"misgendered\" by the mayor and another councilor, and being referred to as \"it\" by a third city official.\n\nThe soap opera starring that councilor, Thu Nguyen, erupted at Tuesday night's meeting of the Worcester, Massachusetts city council, where members held a public hearing over whether it was appropriate for council members like Nguyen to attend meetings remotely . Once again appearing remotely, Nguyen blamed the mayor and peers for the routine failure to show up in person, saying, \"Under your leadership, I have felt unsafe around this council body. I have faced transphobia with being misgendered and recently learned that I have been dehumanized to a point where I'm being referred to as 'it' by my colleagues on this council.\"\n\nHeralded as the \" first openly nonbinary lawmaker\" in Massachusetts history -- a title we're sure Paul Revere and Samuel Adams would be totally impressed with -- Nguyen has held office on the Worcester city council since 2022. Nguyen's preferred pronouns are \"they/them.\"\n\nThe day after the hearing, Nguyen posted a statement saying \"I am...sad to announce I will be taking a month to prioritize my mental and emotional safety,\" so he could recover from having allegedly been misgendered by Mayor Joseph M. Petty and Councilor-at-Large Kathleen Toomey, and called \"it\" by Councilor Candy Mero-Carlson. Nguyen filed a complaint with Worcester's Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion , urging the prompt launch of an investigation, adding that is was unfortunate to do so at the very same time that \" we transition under a Trump administration and exponential increase of fear experienced by the LGBTQ+ community.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the city clerk confirmed that Nguyen will continue receiving a $2,641 monthly city stipend while providing nothing for Worcester other than melodrama.\n\nOn the defensive and careful to say the right things for liberal Massachusetts society, Petty said, \"We are in a time of uncertainty, where members of the LGBTQIA+ community face real fears and challenges in simply being their authentic selves... I would never knowingly say anything harmful.\" He says Nguyen's accusation of misgendering goes all the way back to 2022 -- Nguyen's first year -- when the mayor forgot to use \"they/them\" before correcting himself and apologizing. Toomey said she's made a similar \"honest mistake\" during Nguyen's rookie year, saying \"there's never, ever been any attempt on my side to misgender them.\"\n\nAlleged \"it\" girl Mero-Carson issued a more assertive statement. \"While I do not recall making the statements in question, I acknowledge that it was a challenging and emotional week where difficult conversations took place...It is deeply troubling that Councilor Nguyen has chosen to distort the narrative and weaponize these accusations for political purposes,\" noting that Nguyen has the \"the lowest attendance record of any City Councilor.\"\n\nAs you might expect, Nguyen's council profile is loaded with woke leftist blather like this gem: \"Invested in the notion of social justice, they [sic] commit their time and efforts in... navigating the intersectionality of identity, systems and openings for collective care and healing.\" Nguyen concludes by touting a trio of identity-politics point-makers: \"They [sic] are proud queer, Vietnamese, nonbinary refugee.\"\n\nSince announcing the month off from work, Nguyen has been active on Facebook, basking in support pouring in from \"allies,\" such as LGBT group MassEquality, which condemned the \"bullying\" Nguyen has experienced. Nguyen is also wallowing in victimhood, posting the text of \"hate emails\" like this:\n\n\"Don't confuse my speaking the truth to you here with hate or some kind of phobia... Your petty, emotional, shrill, fake outrage about being misgendered is not helping you or trans people. It's what keeps you down... .Taking a month off. LOL! Who wants to have to put up with childish, petulant temper tantrums like that? No one. No one wants to work with you now and even though you will scream 'transphobia' it won't be that.

To be honest, after reading that line multiple times, we still don't know what gender the \"victim\" was formerly, and claims to be now.\n\nPsychotherapist Lotte Ingerslev, a critic of gender ideology, \"misgendered\" Nadia Jacobsen while alerting her female followers about his hardcore fetish porn content. According to Reduxx :\n\nIngerslev's blog post had documented the pornographic videos and images Jacobsen had posted to his social media and various fetish pornography websites. In one post made by Jacobsen to his now-defunct Tumblr account, nadiatv, he can be seen engaging with his male followers by way of gamifying his own sexual masochism.\n\nAfter warning her followers, on August 29, Ingerslev received a letter from Jacobsen's attorney demanding she delete a blog post exposing his sexual behavior and his role in drafting \"inclusivity\" policies for the Danish Football Association.\n\nThe post, published March 6, was titled: \"Man whose pornographic, fetish-focused videos are available for public viewing online helped draft DBU's new 'inclusive' recommendations to allow men into girls' changing rooms.\"\n\n\"To make it a little more interesting I am going to let you all decide for how long I should refrain from masturbating. I can't wear a chastity cage all the time, but when I am home I will... For every 'like' you add one day. For every reblog you add 3 days... I will only come [sic] as a girl for the rest of my life,\" Jacobsen had written. Reduxx notes:\n\nThere are also several photos and videos of Jacobsen masturbating himself anally with a sex toy while pretending to be a woman and wearing lingerie. Within the transgender pornography fetish community, a man's rectum is described using terms typically associated with female genitalia.\n\nThe letter also sought compensation of at least DKK 100,000 ($14,000 USD) and accused her of harassment, defamation, and misgendering, according to Reduxx .\n\nThe Reduxx report notes that lawyer Nikolaj Nielsen wrote: \"Lotte Ingerslev has unlawfully violated Nadia Jacobsen's privacy and honor by publishing on her website transkoen.dk an article that contains a number of information and images of an intimate nature, untrue claims, as well as by harassing Nadia Jacobsen in the article because of Nadia Jacobsen's gender identity.\"\n\n\"As illustrated by the title of the article, Lotte Ingerslev chose to misgender Nadia Jacobsen throughout the blog post and consistently refer to Nadia Jacobsen as a man, as well as to use the pronouns he/his when she refers to Nadia Jacobsen in the third person,\" the suit continues.\n\n\"In Danish law, it is generally recognized that deliberate misgendering of a trans person constitutes harassment.\"\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "'Dear God, What Is That Thing?': The Fugly Trans Olympics, Pt. II\n\nOriginally published via Armageddon Prose :\n\n(Contd. from Pt. I )\n\nLGBTQTM Propaganda Roundup: Nip/tucking the latest social engineering fisted from on high upon the American public.\n\nA real sci-fi hog of a tranny activist appeared recently on state media MSNBC alongside the diverse host to lament what will become of the trannies when the Orange Fascist gets his hands on them.\n\nVia TransLash Media (emphasis added):\n\n\" In light of growing hostility and anti-trans legislation across the U.S., many transgender people are seeking safe havens -whether by relocating to more trans-friendly areas within the U.S. or by moving abroad...\n\nTrans asylum refers to the search for refuge, safety, and inclusion for transgender people ; whether they are fleeing discrimination or unsafe living conditions. It can take many forms such as moving to a different city within your state, relocating to a relatively trans-friendly state like California, or moving outside of the US to countries that offer guaranteed protections for LGBTQ+ individuals...\n\nAnd as of this week, President Donald Trump has signed several executive orders that intensify these concerns for transgender and nonbinary people .\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an order that mandates that the federal government recognizes only two genders - male and female - based on biological sex assigned at birth. This policy effectively eliminates federal recognition of transgender and nonbinary identities. This not only impacts access to gender-affirming care and appropriate facilities, but also the processing of legal documents and anti-discrimination protections for transgender individuals.\"\n\nTranny activists and Social JusticeTM people in general have a knack for looking like the sea-creatures from Star Wars: Episode I - which, for the record, was one of the worst movies ever made until the latest batch of Star Wars came out and Princess Leia became a flying lesbian immune to the ravages of space with witchlike powers of flight that for some reason she never employed until post-menopause to save her dyke lover.\n\nThe only conclusion we can draw from these horrific displays is that these people go out of their way to make themselves as aesthetically displeasing as possible while requiring that the world embrace them as beautiful, empowered heroes of the culture war.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if this was some kind of sexual fetish power move that they touched themselves too alone at night: how ugly can I make myself, inside and out, and force liberal white women to still grovel at my feet for fear of what might happen to them if they point out the emperor has no clothes?\n\nMind you, Slovakia isn't rounding up trannies to send them to work camps, yet - the government is simply denying groomers the public resources they demand to turn the nation's children into lobotomized eunuchs with penises fashioned out of their own forearm flesh by \"doctors\" who \"affirm\" them.\n\nVia LifeSiteNews (emphasis added):\n\n\"Despite the fact that many aspects of the LGBT agenda - especially the transgender agenda - are scarcely a decade old, the progressive establishments of Europe, including the EU and much of the mainstream agenda, are relentless in their attempts to \"enshrine\" the LGBT agenda as central to the new European identity ...\n\nA similar culture war has been brewing this year in Slovakia, and the mainstream press is out in full force to shape the public narrative . The focus of this battle is Culture Minister Martina Simkovicova , the 53-year-old TV anchor who took office in October 2024 and has proclaimed herself a \"defender of Slovak culture and nothing else.\" Stating that she opposes \"LGBT ideology,\" Le Monde recently reported, she has \"dismissed several heads of public institutions\" including \"the director of the Slovak National Theatre , Matej Drlicka, and the director of the Slovak National Gallery, Alexandra Kusa, on the spot.\"\n\nSimkovicova stated that both were engaged in \"progressive-liberal political activism\" that was out of line with the government's \"cultural program\" and promised that the Slovak government will not give \"a cent\" to LGBT groups. She subsequently removed a number of government subsidies that were flowing to LGBT organizations.

      "text": "When parents refuse to go along with the trans craze, it makes a difference.\n\nDetrans: True Stories of Escaping the Gender Ideology Cult, by Mary Margaret Olohan, Regnery, 288 pages.\n\nBy 2015, the LGBTQ movement needed a new cause. Its decades-long march to normalize homosexuality was nearing a triumphant end, accelerated by a strategic shift away from democratic persuasion and towards a coercive use of civil rights law. As it became apparent that that year's Obergefell decision would effectively end the marriage fight, the LGBTQ movement moved to bring the T of their ever-expanding alphabet center stage.\n\nPresident Barack Obama started the year by becoming the first president to mention \"transgender\" in a State of the Union address. TLC debuted a new reality show starring Jazz Jennings, a young boy on a futile quest to become a girl. Bruce Jenner decided he was actually Caitlyn and subjected the American people to a confusing Diane Sawyer interview and a nauseating Vanity Fair cover. Hollywood released The Danish Girl , a highly fictionalized account of the life of Einar Wegener, one of the earliest documented recipients of sex reassignment surgery. Wegener died from surgery complications in 1931. The Danish Girl received an Academy Award in 2015.\n\nIn response, conservatives relied on biological, psychological, and philosophical arguments to combat this latest deviancy. Most notable was Ryan Anderson's tightly argued book When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment. Today, nearly a decade after the transgender moment took off, there's more than just theory to rebut it. The real life effects of this ideology are in, and they're not pretty.\n\nEnter Mary Margaret Olohan's Detrans: True Stories of Escaping the Gender Ideology Cult. As a reporter, Olohan has a knack for telling human interest stories. Her subject in Detrans is the growing number of young people, especially young girls, who fall into transgender ideology and take irreversible steps to alter their healthy bodies, only to regret it. The personal stories are just as important as the arguments from reason-and more powerful.\n\nDetrans centers on four young women who are in the process of detransitioning, that is, embracing their sex after years of attempting to be men. Their stories bear similar traits. Prisha Mosley was diagnosed with a host of mental health issues around the time she entered puberty. Chloe Cole was diagnosed even earlier, first with disruptive behavior disorder at age eight and then ADHD at age eleven. Luka Hein was placed in a partial hospitalization program because of her struggles with mental health. Both Chloe and Prisha were victims of sexual assault. Helena Kerschner developed an eating disorder, as did Prisha.\n\nThe internet fed on these vulnerabilities. Every one of the girls Olohan profiles was heavily involved in social media. \"Sad and lonely, also struggling with an eating disorder, Helena says she was delighted to find a platform like Tumblr, filled with friendly 'social outcasts' like herself,\" Olohan writes. These platforms eagerly served up pro-LGBTQ content to these vulnerable social outcasts. Chloe \"began exploring transgenderism online, and she quickly found a variety of LGBTQ groups and transgender influencers.\"\n\nSocial media wasn't these girls' only online influence. \"Pretty much every detransitioner I spoke with was exposed to pornography at an early age,\" Olohan writes, \"It wasn't information they volunteered-in fact, they were surprised when I asked about it.\" Most detransitioners recognize the role social media played in their transition. The fact that few also connect their pornography consumption to the life-altering procedures they undertook shows how ubiquitous smut has become and how harmful.\n\nOlohan's narrative progresses through these harms: After varying degrees of assistance from therapists and school counselors, often concealed from parents, the girls obtain prescriptions for hormones like testosterone and puberty blockers. Soon after, they experience severe mood swings, including intense anger and difficulty crying. \"Helena reports that she would struggle against the anger by punching herself until she could cry from the pain,\" Olohan writes. Many girls resorted to more severe self-harm.\n\nNot all the harm they experienced was self-inflicted. For girls attempting to transition, the next step after hormones is the euphemistically named \"gender affirmation surgery.\" Prisha spent $7,100 to have her healthy breasts surgically removed when she was eighteen. She put half the cost on a credit card and struggled to pay it off, since she lost her job at Panera Bread when she had difficulty lifting her arms post-surgery. Luka underwent her double mastectomy at age sixteen. Chloe had hers amputated at fifteen.\n\nOf the four detransitioners Olohan profiles, only Helena avoided this life-altering surgery. Interestingly, Helena's background also stands out among the other girls'.\n\nAs we've seen, Helena experienced her share of emotional issues growing up. But she still \"describes her family life as largely 'stable': her parents were married her whole childhood until after she had moved out, and they were always financially secure.\" Neither of her parents was very religious, but the family did go to a Protestant church on Sundays when Helena was little. Later, she went to a Catholic school and \"went through a phase of being super Catholic\" in early adolescence.\n\nBy the time she was in high school, fueled by her hours on Tumblr, Helena began to perceive herself as transgender. She fully identified as a trans boy by senior year-but had yet to tell her parents. When she did, they didn't embrace her delusion.\n\nOlohan reports Helena's mother's reaction: \"'No,' Helena's mother finally responded. She added, staring straight at the road ahead of them, 'No, I am not going to call you that. You are Helena and you are a girl.'\"\n\nThis reaction delayed Helena's medical transition. She didn't begin taking cross-sex hormones until she was 18 and no longer needed parental permission. By the time she was 19, she realized her mistake, and began to detransition. She still lives with the effects of the testosterone, but she knows she's fortunate. As she wrote in a 2022 Substack post, \"There are others for whom the harm has been exponentially worse.\"\n\nThroughout Detrans , as Olohan describes the immense social and corporate power pushing vulnerable teens to transition, it's easy to see the parents as victims as well. Pro-trans therapists are fond of asking skeptical parents, \"Do you want a living son or a dead daughter?\" It's clearly an emotionally manipulative line, meant to serve an ideology rather than the wellbeing of young people. Many well-intentioned parents respond as expected and go along, however reluctantly, with the transgender program for their troubled children.\n\nClearly, Helena's story does not indicate that families can always immunize themselves from the transgender contagion. But comparing her transgender experience to the others described in Detrans , it does suggest that parents have some agency in the face of the transgender onslaught. If parents understand what they're up against, they can make a difference.\n\nThe subtitle of Detrans is helpful here: \"Escaping the Gender Ideology Cult .\" This is no hyperbole on Olohan's part. It comes directly from the experience of detransitioners.\n\n\"I now understood [the transgender community] exhibits information control dynamics similar to that of cults or extreme religious sects,\" Helena told Olohan after her detransition, \"I was angry that I had been affirmed every step of the way, and only questioned when I was starting to express regret.\"\n\nLuka came to a similar conclusion. She realized that her experiences only counted if they went along with the transgender ideology. \"What mattered at that moment was I was pushing back against something that, at least according to [her doctor], could not be questioned,\" she told Olohan, \"At that point, I was like, OK, I'm in a cult, and I need to leave.\"\n\nIt is incumbent upon parents to know this and to protect their kids accordingly. The stories in Detrans are heartbreaking and they are only becoming more prevalent-which is why the book is so necessary. Transgenderism is not the next frontier of civil rights; it is a demonic cult, one intent on destroying families and lives. And it has the full backing of far too many in our society, including public education.\n\nSo get your kids off social media. Remove them from schools that endorse transgenderism. Provide them with as stable, intact a home environment as possible. And by all means, protect them from the scourge of pornography. If the philosophical arguments haven't yet convinced you to take these steps, read Detrans . As Olohan movingly illustrates in her final chapter, your kids' lives could very well depend on it.\n\nThis article appears in the September/October 2024 issue\n\nEmile Doak is the executive director of the Chelsea Academy Foundation in Front Royal, Virginia, and a contributing editor of The American Conservative , where he previously served as executive director.

      "text": "Once trusted storytellers now pose an active threat.\n\nIt took the gay rights movement decades to gain domination of the entertainment world. The transgender activists who were right at their heels made much shorter work of it. Hollywood transitioned in scarcely a decade, with every TV genre-including and perhaps especially children's entertainment-pushing transgender storylines.\n\nThis potent propaganda is accomplishing two primary goals: the normalization of gender ideology in all its forms and the demonization of dissidents who oppose it. In just a few short years, our culture's most powerful storytellers have enlisted in the service of the trans movement. Consider a few recent examples.\n\nIn 2022, director Billy Porter (a gay man renowned for dressing in drag) released the coming-of-age romantic comedy Anything's Possible . It is a standard, cheesy teen rom-com with an angsty pop soundtrack-except for the fact that Kelsa (whose name means \"brave\") was born male and now identifies as a \"trans girl.\" Kelsa looks like a girl, too, and Khal, her classmate, falls hopelessly in love. He watches Kelsa's YouTube videos about going on puberty blockers and transgender experiences and decides-like the open-minded protagonist that he is-that none of that matters. Gender itself doesn't matter. They are just two teens falling in love, and anything's possible.\n\nIt is more complicated, of course. References are made to the fact that Kelsa's body isn't female, but that is dismissed out of hand as irrelevant to love (although not, presumably, to love-making). The film is a powerfully normalizing piece of LGBT propaganda in large part because Kelsa is played by Eva Reign, a biological male who \"transitioned\" at a young age and can very much \"pass\" as female.\n\nJust as teen transgenderism is normalized, opponents of transgender ideology are demonized. When Kelsa is briefly barred from the girls' bathroom, it is portrayed as a bigoted attempt to tar a transgender person by exploiting unreasonable fears. Those who refuse to use Kelsa's \"preferred pronouns\" are portrayed as vile, \"illiterate\" people who merely wish to cause unnecessary pain. A mother who objects to Kelsa using the girls' bathroom, presented as a loudmouthed bigot, is told bluntly: \"You are a danger to your daughter with that attitude.\" The scene ends with her own daughter telling her, \"I don't think like you,\" and storming out.\n\nBoth Porter and Reign see the film-which was released on Amazon Prime-as \"part of a revolution.\" As Reign told Entertainment Weekly : \"Artists often times make [art] either in response to the culture or in opposition to it.\" Both hope that Anything's Possible will affirm the titular premise and spawn an entire subgenre of transgender stories.\n\nBut before that there was A Kid Like Jake (2018), directed by Silas Howard, a transgender director seeking to push LGBT ideology through art. The film features an all-star cast (including prominent gay actor Jim Parsons as lead) and tells the story of parents struggling to understand their \"gender-nonconforming\" four-year-old son, who insists on wearing princess dresses and \"tucks\" his penis between his legs in the bath-both key indications, according to trans activists, that he is transgender.\n\nJake's lesbian preschool teacher (played by Octavia Spencer) asks the father why he \"didn't tell [his son] there are some men who wear skirts in our culture\" and emphatically informs both parents: \"Let me tell you: the impulse to embrace children as they are is not a political agenda.\" The film ends with Jake, dressed in girl's clothing, being swung down the sidewalk by his parents.\n\nThat is a clever place to end the story-because in our culture, kids like Jake often end up on puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and then, finally, under the knife for castration and other surgeries. But Jake's future is left up in the air. His trajectory is likely tragic. Transgender child star Jazz Jennings, a kid like Jake, is now sterile and will likely never experience sexual pleasure due to his \"transition\" to female.\n\nThe Baby-Sitter's Club is an iconic series of paperback books about teen girls and their babysitting adventures that sold 176 million copies between 1986 and 2000 alone. In 2020, Netflix adapted the series-and turned it into trans propaganda almost immediately.\n\nIn Episode 4, club member Mary Anne is babysitting a child named Bailey. Bailey is a biological boy who wears pink princess dresses. When he begins running a high fever, Mary Anne must take him to the hospital. And then, as one media outlet described it: \"While Bailey's life is spared from danger, her dignity is challenged when the doctors continue to misgender her as a boy. Infuriated on Bailey's behalf, Mary Anne finally finds her voice...and uses it to argue on behalf of Bailey.\"\n\nJust in case anyone missed the point, another tween babysitter-Dawn-compares Bailey being transgender to using your dominant hand after years of being forced not to. The actor who plays Bailey is Kai Shappley, who made national headlines in 2016 when, after identifying as female, he was told by Pearland Independent School District leaders that he was required to use the boy's bathroom. Shappley later became the subject of an Emmy Award-winning documentary, Trans in America: Texas Strong .\n\nThe press refers to Shappley as a \"transgender activist.\" The original author of The Baby-Sitter's Club , Ann M. Martin, is a producer on the show and happy with the new storylines: \"I love that they made Dawn's father gay and that they introduced a transgender babysitting charge. As someone who is gay, I know how much positive representation matters, especially to kids.\"\n\nIt isn't just entertainment aimed at adults and teens that has transitioned in recent years. Blue's Clues , an animated show for preschoolers that first launched in 1996, released a \"Blues Clues Pride Parade Sing-Along\" in 2021, which featured a cartoon drag queen, a gay dolphin, a transgender beaver with chest scars from a double-mastectomy, and a panoply of queer and \"non-binary\" characters. Mr. Ratburn, the teacher in the beloved kids show Arthur , was shown marrying a man in a 2019 episode. The Clifford the Big Red Dog franchise was rebooted with lesbian moms. The popular children's show Peppa Pig aired an episode with lesbian polar bears.\n\nIf trans activists have their way, not a single children's franchise will be left untouched. Netflix's She-Ra and the Princesses of Power has multiple transgender characters, and Amazon Prime's Danger & Eggs has a \"trans girl\" and a \"non-binary character.\" PBS's Sesame Street has featured a Drag Queen Storytime, starring Billy Porter. Disney has debuted several transgender characters.\n\nAs the transgender culture wars rage through every American institution, our elite storytellers have thrown their full weight behind the transgender agenda-and we should not underestimate the pernicious power of their propaganda. Anything's Possible does more to sway teen minds than a dozen sex-ed classes from a blue-haired high school teacher. A Kid Like Jake -and many films like it-do more to mainstream the idea that allowing children to choose their own gender is a matter of morality and compassion then any hectoring Democratic politician, and more to persuade parents they have no choice but to \"affirm\" their confused and hurting children. Iconic American franchises and familiar cartoon characters are the single most effective method of teaching children the tenets of gender ideology before they can even understand what they are absorbing.\n\nAmerica's institutions have turned against American families-and America's storytellers now pose an active danger to those who imbibe and embrace their stories. We should act accordingly.\n\nJonathon Van Maren is a public speaker, writer, and pro-life activist.

      "text": "The lawsuits challenging them conflate several aspects of congressional and executive powers.\n\nIn two short weeks, President Donald Trump has issued scores of executive orders, many of them related to gender identity. Outraged critics claim that he lacks the authority to do so. Do they have a case?\n\nConsider first the orders themselves. In addition to recognition of a formal two-sex policy for the whole of government, Trump issued executive orders barring trans-identified individuals from service in the military, requiring the removal of preferred pronouns in all government communiques, and directing all federally funded educational institutions to maintain athletic programs separated by biological sex, rather than gender identity.\n\nOne particular executive order of January 28, 2025-\"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation\"-directed all federal agencies, among others, to \"immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end gender-affirming medical care for people under nineteen.\" It also directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \"end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children,\" including through Medicare or Medicaid conditions of participation or conditions for coverage,\" and through \"section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\" the ACA's non-discrimination provision.\n\nAn unsurprising flurry of litigation ensued, and, in the most recent, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the president and various federal executives on behalf of national LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, PFLAG, and a group of trans-identified minors and their parents.\n\nChief among their claims is that this executive order is beyond the scope of the president's authority (or ultra vires ) because Congress-not the executive-controls the power of the public purse. Therefore, they claim, the president's directive prohibiting expenditure of federal funds for the purpose of performing transgender treatment or surgery is illegal for two reasons: First, Congress has already appropriated funds to be disbursed through HHS without any such limitation, and second, the president cannot revise the text of statutes passed by Congress and signed into law.\n\nBut that argument conflates apples with oranges. Yes, appropriations bills are acts of Congress and therefore are statutes. And, yes, Congress passed, and then-President Joe Biden signed into law, the appropriations bill on which plaintiffs rely. But appropriations acts are not identical to statutes that regulate public or private conduct-and that difference matters.\n\nAppropriations laws fund the operation of government. That is critical because, under the Antideficiency Act, government officials may not spend undisbursed federal funds, nor may they encumber the federal government by using a credit card to run up debt. In fact, it is a crime to do so.\n\nAppropriations laws, however, operate against a background of substantive laws empowering government officials to take certain actions and prohibiting those officials from taking others. For example, the Defense Authorization Act passed annually by Congress fixes the number of aircraft carriers that the Defense Department may have. The bill that funds the Defense Department then limits the amount that DOD can spend during a particular fiscal year building new carriers.\n\nMoreover, congressional appropriators, and the appropriations bills that wend their way through the legislative process, do not generally make new substantive law through the appropriations process. The United States Supreme Court made that clear in the well-known case of Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill (1978).\n\nIn that case, the court addressed the issue of whether Congress had effectively repealed the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by repeatedly funding the operation of the Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project, even though its continued operation put at risk the continued existence of an endangered small fish, known as the snail darter. The court roundly rejected the argument that continued funding of the dam implicitly repealed the ESA:\n\nWe recognize that both substantive enactments and appropriations measures are \"Acts of Congress,\" but the latter have the limited and specific purpose of providing funds for authorized programs. When voting on appropriations measures, legislators are entitled to operate under the assumption that the funds will be devoted to purposes which are lawful and not for any purpose forbidden. Without such an assurance, every appropriations measure would be pregnant with prospects of altering substantive legislation, repealing by implication any prior statute which might prohibit the expenditure. Not only would this lead to the absurd result of requiring Members to review exhaustively the background of every authorization before voting on an appropriation, but it would flout the very rules the Congress carefully adopted to avoid this need [emphasis added].\n\nWhile Congress could make new substantive law through appropriations bills, should it choose to do so, there is one condition. In Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society (1992), the Supreme Court explained that Congress can legislate through appropriations laws but only \"as long as it does so clearly.\" The plaintiffs in PFLAG, et al . v. Trump , however, do not cite the text of any substantive or appropriations statute law that President Trump violated, so the TVA v . Hill rule applies here.\n\nAccordingly, the president's executive order is not ultra vires because it does not violate any specific federal law.\n\nThe PFLAG plaintiffs have also brought various constitutional claims in their lawsuit-including the parents' claim that the order violates their Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process right to direct the medical care of their minor children, and a claim that the order violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause because it \"discriminate[s] based on sex and transgender status.\" They also claim that the order violates the First Amendment.\n\nThose claims are unpersuasive.\n\nThe Supreme Court will decide this term whether discrimination based on alleged or proven transgender status is entitled to any heightened scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The majority of justices expressed skepticism during oral arguments in United States v . Skrmetti that it would. As for the general right to direct the medical care of one's minor children, neither the Supreme Court nor any other federal court has ever held that access to experimental, contested, or unproven medical interventions is constitutionally guaranteed.\n\nAtop that, the court has expressly held-twice, in Maher v . Roe (1977) and Harris v . McRae (1980)-that even if a party has a constitutional right to select certain medical care, the government has no constitutional duty to pay for their choice.\n\nAs for the plaintiff's First Amendment claim-that by \"withholding federal grants, the [order] engage[s] in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment and violate the rights of grant recipients and transgender patients\"-there is nothing to remotely suggest this is so.\n\nIn Prince v. Massachusetts (1944), the court rejected the claim that the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause prohibits a state from applying its child labor laws to the Jehovah's Witnesses. Also, in Jehovah's Witnesses v. King's County Hospital Unit No. 1 (1968), the court rejected a claim by parents that the state should not be able to provide life-saving treatment to their child against their religious wishes. Given those two decisions, there is no serious argument that the president's executive order is unconstitutional.\n\nThe president's executive order easily satisfies the lowest tier of judicial scrutiny, rational basis, in that the government clearly has a legitimate state interest (protecting vulnerable minors), and there is clearly a rational connection between that interest and the executive order's means and goals. Given that the most recent and comprehensive study of medical transgender treatment (England's nine-year Cass Report released last year) found no proven long-term medical benefit from these treatment for minors, the president's executive order is all the more constitutionally sound.\n\nObjection overruled.\n\nSarah Parshall Perry is a senior legal fellow in The Heritage Foundation's Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies.\n\nPaul J.

      "text": "Here is an e-mail I received from a reader who is a male-to-female transgendered person. The reader does not insist on anonymity, but I don't want to run the risk of trolls searching out the soul who was brave enough to write the letter below, and threatening violence. Remember as you respond that one of the rules of this blog's comments section is that you cannot personally insult someone who comments here. Anyone who speaks rudely or insultingly to my correspondent will get their comment sent to the trash:\n\nI've been reading your blog for several months, and I've enjoyed both your perspective and your intellectual honesty. I'm writing this email to share some personal perspectives on transsexuality that I've not read elsewhere, diverging substantially from both the common left/right positions. I hope you find them interesting.\n\nHaving read innumerable takes on transgender issues over the last decade, I've come to find the narrative explanations for the modern instance of the phenomenon lacking. On one hand, the left constantly innovates a linguistic matrix of concepts engineered as articles of faith - referentially justifying themselves in relation to other inventions, synthesizing a supporting web for belief contextualization. This style of rhetoric aims to entrench social dialogue in such a thing, keeping it at a safe distance from questions relating to the actual causal source of the phenomena.  The right, by contrast, spends many days futilely trying to attack the most outrageous & ungrounded concepts of the opposition - playing to an already sympathetic audience, but utterly ineffectual at achieving (meaningful) ideological turnover. Or, if more intellectually inclined,  conservatives attempt broad pictures explanations based on moral and spiritual decline... I believe there is some truth to the latter, but a better picture emerges when one looks at things on a more granular level.\n\nTo start, there is much missing in the mainstream conversations of transsexuality, concerning the actual cause. There are a few scientific explanations available, most prominent being Blanchard's conception of Autogynephilia (the AGP/HSTS model) - and I believe some of the observations of that theory are very real. Yet I also believe that academic sexologists are overly inclined and professionally motivated to posit their area of research as the 'one true cause'. I think a more fundamental reason has a basis in the very conditions of modern life. All the following applies exclusively to the case of MtF (Male to Female) transsexuality, and I believe the FtM variant has a somewhat different origin, but I won't speculate on it here\n\nOn a very concrete level, there is very little appealing to boys/young men in the modern world. Before they can even make sense of it, boys look around and see parents (or parents of friends) get divorced. Well before we become adults, we grow accustomed to transitory friendships and relationships - a fact that only becomes more real as we face realities of a geographically liquid labor market, forcing several cross-country before we turn 30. The dating market is also brutal, especially for socially awkward boys, or those less virile and masculine. To many boys, the dream of owning a home and land feels antiquated and even impossible - perhaps they witness their own parents brutally struggling with a mortgage, or they grow up around those who have never done anything other than rent.  They are subjected to a cruel form of education (additionally, one highly demeaning to gifted children), and promised that their reward for working diligently for half a decade may be to work in a cubicle at FAANG [Facebook/Apple/Alphabet/Netflix/Google] from 9-5 until they turn 60. In short: the modern version of a man is one fundamentally emasculated and servile.\n\nI think this accounts for much of the current cultural patterns. Masculinity is now so reduced that an increasing portion of boys turn their eyes away from it in disgust. As early as eight years old, I experienced these emotions. Eventually culminating in a deep sense of nihilism that would stay with me for over a decade. Latent to this was an awareness that society was conditioning me to accept a life that was fundamentally meaningless, but I lacked the words and experience to truly identify. By the time I was 11, my sexuality had manifested to the point where I realized it was incompatible with any sort of normal life - the kind that I didn't want to begin with. Even as I still desired love. A few years later, I learned of the possibility of transition, but found it grotesque and debasing - and turned away from it, with some part of my heart aching for it.\n\nOne note: To those like myself, (Modern American) Christianity was never a viable answer. In part, because it doesn't speak to this anger - and in part, because it has a certain dopey clumsiness to it. Evangelical Christianity always seemed like a haven for televangelical grifters with their grifted base, and Catholicism as a nest of hypocrites led by pedophiles. That was the cultural perception, at least. In the face of what I perceived to be the horrifying reality of modern life; religious faith seemed an ineffectual solution. Alongside this was the perception that Christians were largely domesticated, inoffensive, and tame - despite all leftist protestations to the contrary. Yet a soul that burns with fury does not seek to be placated and resents that which would tame it. I believe this is one reason the post-Christian far right is in ascendancy - they alone have found the words to give voice to this rage of many young men/boys.\n\nFor my part, that rage stayed with me until my early 20s, until it consumed itself leaving ashes and an absolute depression in its wake. At which point, the idea of transition - having haunted me for years - no longer disgusted me. It was never about deluding myself into believing that I really was a woman, but rather accepting the nature of the desires I felt and symbolically making them a part of myself and inscribing that truth into my body.\n\nI offer my example partly because I know it well, yet all because I've had enough experience in the LGBT world to know that isn't truly special. I've served on diversity committees at a high level in elite academic institutions, supervised multiple LGBT youth groups, participated in online discords, and borne witness to the cultural flows that orient people to transition. Many of these young adults/teenagers are highly intelligent but disgusted by the state of our society for reasons they struggle to put to words. Even as it is the very same that offers them incredible freedom and encourages their explorations in identity. Often enough, they are indoctrinated into the web of cultural leftism, intellectually blocking them from any vantage that might offer higher insight on their natures. Many are shaped to have a disposition to desire gender transition, long before they stumble on the concept.\n\nMen like Orban can patch the decay and delay it a few years - but the root cause is much deeper than things like drag queen story hour, or a salacious children's book on gender identity. These are symptoms - but the fundamental problem is not a 'desire to be trans', but a 'desire to not be a man'. A boy who enjoys being a boy will never find himself culturally groomed into transitioning, but one conditioned to despise his nature needs only the faintest push. Suppression only goes so far - and until these root causes are addressed with a more desirable and beautiful idea of masculinity, I believe this social process will continue.\n\nEnding on a personal note, I don't regret my choice to transition, and I wouldn't do a moment in my life differently. I found the love that I always sought, and that alone redeems my mistakes. But I cannot help but think that many who are transitioning now are inviting great pain upon themselves, and will find no such deliverance. For them, the rest of their lives will be lived in a state of perpetual resentment, haunted by demons they cannot name.\n\nThis is really profound stuff, and I thank the reader for writing it. It's easy to see that in many ways, modernity also teaches women to fear and loathe their femininity. The reader gives me a lot to think about. I don't want to give a hasty response.\n\nRemember: I will not post your comment if you speak insultingly to or about this reader.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

Judges would be able to grant or deny parents custody of their children at least in part on the basis of whether they affirm their children's false beliefs about their sex-beliefs that, in many cases, will change over time.\n\n\"Non-affirming parents\" are considered especially grave sinners in the progressive moral universe because they commit what progressives consider the worst sin of all: denying another person's autonomy, even when that person is a child- your child -and even when that person is manifestly delusional.\n\nEarlier this year, Washington State passed a bill allowing youth-services providers to decline to inform the parents of runaways that their children received \"gender affirming care\" while on the lam. The Biden CDC set up a chat room targeted at transgender-identifying children, particularly \"LGBTQ youth in the South,\" who may have been \"confined to...non-affirming home environments.\" These are whispers of what California Democrats are now saying out loud: Toe the line, or we will take your child from you.\n\nJohn Hirschauer was assistant editor of The American Conservative .

      "text": "As ever, Paul Kingsnorth's Substack is one of the most important Substacks in the world, and it's not even close. In his latest essay, Kingsnorth talks about how the public controversy over transgenderism is not really about male and female. It's about human nature itself. The beginning of the essay is a reminder about how insane -- honestly, insane -- the public dialogue is around trans today, and how fast it got there. Five years ago, if you had said that a Berkeley law professor would have testified contentiously before Congress that women aren't the only people who give birth, people would have thought you were bonkers. But it happened this week. Excerpts from Kingsnorth's latest:\n\nBack in America - now ground-zero for the abolition of biology - thousands of girls are undergoing double mastectomies, and teenage boys are being given 'puberty-blocking' drugs designed to chemically castrate rapists. Eleven year old girls are taught that 'if you feel uncomfortable in your body, it means you are transgender' - which may explain why, in some classrooms, a quarter of the children identify as precisely that. The concept of 'trans kids' - a notion that would have been inconceivably baffling to most people even a few years back, and for many still is - is now being pushed so hard that it starts to look less like the liberation of an oppressed minority than an agenda to reprogramme society with an entirely new conception of the human body - and thus of nature itself.\n\nKingsnorth gets into The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self , Carl Trueman's invaluable book ( now out in an abridged, reader-friendly version ) about the roots of the West's falling apart, which, as PK points out, began with Trueman trying to answer the question of how it is the phrase \"I am a woman trapped in a man's body\" came to be meaningful. Kingsnorth:\n\nMeanwhile Nietzsche and Darwin both helped, wittingly or unwittingly, to undermine the foundational assumptions of Western Christianity, thus unmooring the culture from its spiritual roots. Finally, figures such as Herbert Marcuse and Wilhelm Reich provided the justification for the removal of sexual taboos which exploded in the sixties counterculture and brought us into the pornified present.\n\nIt is this latter development, suggests Trueman, that may prove to be most significant. Identity in the contemporary West is now cored around sex and sexuality - a situation which he believes 'is arguably unprecedented in history.' Trueman identifies Wilhelm Reich and his countercultural successors as prime movers in this culture shift. Sexual liberation, to Reich, represented the latest stage of the ongoing liberation of the individual from both nature and culture.\n\nIn his 1936 book The Sexual Revolution , Reich argued that sexual repression had been imposed and weaponised by governments and churches for centuries as a means of controlling the masses. Liberation of the individual was thus intimately tied up with liberated sexuality:\n\nThe existence of strict moral principles has invariably signified that the biological, and specifically the sexual, needs of man were not being satisfied. Every moral regulation is in itself sex-negating, and all compulsory morality is life-negating. The social revolution has no more important task than finally to enable human beings to realise their full potentialities and find gratification in life.\n\nSexual freedom is human freedom.\n\nIt doesn't take much to move from that point to accepting that one's \"true self\" is not a self that is given, or a self that is shaped by limits, but a self that is fully chosen, against the bounds presented by nature or society. Transgenderism is just the next phase in humankind's revolt against nature, says Kingsnorth. More:\n\nWhat does a transhumanist billionaire [Martine Rothblatt -- RD] who wants to 'make God' have to do with a teenage boy who feels uncomfortable in his body? The answer is that Rothblatt is far from the only person who believes that the path to a disembodied, posthuman and post-natural future leads directly through the shattered gender binary. Looked at this way, the question of what pronouns to use, or who should be allowed into which bathroom, suddenly starts to look a lot more momentous than the newspapers are telling us. The unifying driver is the desire for trans-cendence : the latest stage in what another transhumanist, Kevin Kelly , calls our ongoing 'liberation from matter'.\n\nI don't mean to suggest that the activists currently beavering away to 'queer the gender binary' all have this end in mind, let alone that everyyone who considers themselves to be transgender buys into this worldview, or has even heard about it. But this is the direction of travel. People with gender dysphoria, girls with short hair, boys who play with dolls, people whose sexualities differ from the norm: they are not, in fact, the real issue.\n\nThe real issue is that a young generation of hyper-urbanised, always-on young people, increasingly divorced from nature and growing up in a psychologised, inward-looking anticulture, is being led towards the conclusion that biology is a problem to be overcome, that their body is a form of oppression and that the solution to their pain may go beyond a new set of pronouns, or even invasive surgery, towards nanotechnology, 'cyberconsciousness software' and perhaps, ultimately, the end of their physical embodiment altogether.\n\nI strongly urge you to read the whole thing -- and to subscribe. Unless we rise against these elite controllers, the day is coming when these writings will be outlawed.\n\nThis is all profoundly Luciferian. You know that, right? You should. Does anybody at your church ever talk about this stuff? If not, why not? If your church isn't talking about this stuff, it is not preparing you for the present that's here and the future that's coming.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "As radical gender ideology progresses in America, the UK offers an example of how to fight back.\n\nSlowly, over several decades, woke values have come to shape ever more of the institutions we interact with daily. As I explore in my new book, How Woke Won , views that carry high status among a graduate, professional class now dominate our schools, universities, policing, health care provision, mainstream and social media, and big business.\n\nTake the woke belief that sex is irrelevant and self-declared gender identity is all-important. Not that long ago, this was a fringe view held by a tiny number of gender studies professors and activists. Today, this belief is not only widely accepted by those running our public institutions but, when put into practice, leaves women at risk in prisons, changing rooms, refuges, and public bathrooms. It jeopardizes girls' sports and, worse still, makes some vulnerable to the idea that they need life-altering medication and surgery in order to bring their bodies in line with their perceived gender. Yet woke thinking dictates we put up with all this in order to 'be kind.'\n\nAs Dan Hitchens noted in The American Conservative last year, women in the U.K. have been fighting back and they have scored some significant victories. Over recent months, these successes have kept on coming. Comparison with the U.S. is now stark.\n\nWhereas the Biden administration is committed to promoting gender ideology \"in the classroom, on the playing field, at work, in our military, in our housing and healthcare systems-everywhere, simply everywhere,\" Liz Truss , Britain's newly appointed prime minister, has said: \"I will make sure that single-sex spaces are protected. We can't have a situation where...there are hospital wards which claim to be single-sex that simply aren't, or we have domestic violence shelters where that's under question.\"\n\nSadly, these divergent approaches are already having a very different impact on children.\n\nEarlier this summer, President Biden promised to end conversion therapy for the surging numbers of American children who identify as transgender. But to many, talking therapies are an essential means for minors to consider all the options available to them before committing to invasive medical procedures. In the U.K., a similar ban on transgender conversion therapy was proposed but, after much discussion, subsequently scrapped .\n\nPreviously, the health care systems in the U.S. and the U.K. were equally likely to promote 'gender-affirming care,' including puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgery. But while the U.K.'s national clinic for children struggling with their gender identity was closed down last month after a scathing report declared the practice to be \" not safe ,\" the American Academy of Pediatrics is doubling down on gender affirmation despite serious questions now being raised about this approach.\n\nWhen it comes to sport, Biden has proposed amendments to Title IX regulations to clarify that sex includes \"gender identity.\" This means that male athletes like Lia Thomas can compete alongside women. In the U.K., on the other hand, sports like rugby and cycling have taken steps to reinforce single sex participation.\n\nIn the U.S., men who identify as women can still be incarcerated with female inmates, leading to shocking cases such as that of Demi Minor , who impregnated two women while behind bars. In the U.K., women's jails are to be restricted to biological women under new policies proposed by the U.K.'s justice secretary.\n\nOne key factor in the progress we have seen in the U.K. in recent months has been the opening up of debate. Time and again, women have shone the disinfectant of sunlight on threats to their sex-based rights. This has often meant gender-critical feminists have had to make the case for free speech in order to get a platform for their views. In the U.S., ironically the land of the First Amendment liberties, the Academy of Pediatrics is trying to stifle debate by dismissing critics of its approach as \" anti-transgender activists .\"\n\nDespite the persistence, bravery, and sheer bloody-mindedness of a great many British women, there is still much further to go. Concern is growing about what children are taught in schools , and every day brings news of businesses expecting staff to wear pronoun badges or turning women's changing rooms into 'gender neutral' spaces. Gains that have been made rarely feel secure.\n\nMake no mistake: getting this far in the U.K. has been a hard slog. Campaigners for women's sex based rights have received death threats , lost their livelihoods , been arrested and taken to court charged with having committed hate crimes, and have been banned from social media. But it looks like, in the U.K. at least, common sense may finally be winning out against a once-dominant transgender ideology.\n\nJoanna Williams is the author of How Woke Won .\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "What's going on at Virginia Theological Seminary , one of the country's largest Episcopal seminaries? Well, there's this advice on how to start with gender-inclusive children's ministry:\n\nGender, like so many other aspects of human identity, exists on a spectrum. I'm a non-binary trans Episcopal clergy person, and thankfully, at this stage in my life, I'm not often told I need to do things like \"sit boy-girl-boy-girl crisscross applesauce around the rug so class can get started.\" Where would I go? The middle? Outside the circle entirely?\n\nI'm old enough and secure enough in who I am to joke about this, but many of the children who we are blessed to have as a part of the Body of Christ, are not yet. Children who are questioning their own gender, or who already identify as something other than the sex they were assigned at birth, may have to smoosh an important part of themselves down into a little box and outwardly identify as someone they're not or often (sadly) face ridicule and bullying for being brave enough to live their truths.\n\nThe author, Rowan Larson (they/them), goes on to explain how \"the gender binary hurts all of us,\" and then offers six ideas for starting \"a more inclusive children's ministry\":\n\nDon't ask children to sort themselves by gender , or worse, try to sort them that way yourself. Try asking children to self-sort by birthday month, grade, height, or whether they're cat lovers or dog lovers.\n\nRemind children that hobbies, interests, clothes, haircuts, names, and more can be for all of us, regardless of gender. One that comes up a lot for me is kids asking about why I have short hair. I remind them that anyone can have short hair; short hair doesn't mean that someone is a boy, just as long hair doesn't mean that someone is a girl. I usually give a non-gendered reason why I have short hair, for example, that I like it because it is very quick to wash and I don't need to brush out tangles.\n\nIf you see teasing or bullying based on gender or gender presentation, don't just stop the behavior, make sure to talk through the preconceived notions that drive it. For example, \"Sky, I saw you teasing Bear because he likes unicorns. I wonder why you think that Bear can't like unicorns, or that you should tease him for it?\" Children likely picked up the attitudes they have from their families or peers in places outside of church without even realizing it.\n\nFor older kids, offer a basket of pronoun buttons next to the markers and stick-on name tags so they can self-identify as they are comfortable. For something like a confirmation class or Youth Group, consider using a \"get to know you\" questionnaire, like this one from Teaching Outside the Binary .\n\nFor younger children, respect what they or their parents tell you about how they identify. For children who are questioning their gender or know they don't identify with the sex they were assigned at birth, that self-awareness can come as early as 3 or 4 years of age.\n\nIf your church building doesn't have all gender restrooms, consider starting that conversation with your Vestry or clergy person. In some cases, all that's needed is re-labeling single user restrooms with clear signs like these .\n\nRead it all. Go ahead.\n\nWhat kind of seminary teaches this stuff?! This is perverse poison. Rowan Larson is going to be ordained as a priest in the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts this Saturday. Things are going very badly for TEC in that diocese, as the church's data show :\n\nThat is, a 36 percent decline in average Sunday attendance in just nine years - with a 15 percent decline in a single year, which might indicate Covid skewing the numbers.\n\nIn fact, Episcopal News Service reported last year that the Episcopal Church is no longer looking at decline, but oblivion . Excerpt:\n\n\"The overall picture is dire - not one of decline as much as demise within the next generation unless trends change significantly,\" said the Rev. Dwight Zscheile, an expert in denominational decline and renewal. An Episcopal priest, Zscheile is vice president of innovation and associate professor of congregational mission and leadership at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\n\"At this rate, there will be no one in worship by around 2050 in the entire denomination,\" Zscheile told Episcopal News Service.\n\nThat's only 28 years from now.\n\nI genuinely don't understand the mindset of the people who run institutions like Virginia Theological Seminary. Do they really think the future of Christianity lies with nonbinary transgendered priests who advise churches to confuse little children about their own sex? Obviously they must ... but why? Or is it rather that they know they're on a glide path to oblivion, and just want to enjoy the irreversible ride?\n\nPicking on Episcopalian libs is the easiest thing in the world, and I want to resist that. I am not trolling here. I'm sure there are many good and faithful people at VTS. Still, I genuinely can't understand the logic of any of this. Is there a substantial number of people who would be eager to look to someone like Rowan Larson as their spiritual leader, and willing to turn their children over to the pastoral care of a parish led by someone who thinks the clergy should undermine the psychological stability of little kids? Is this what VTS endorses? It must, at some level, because Larson's piece appeared in an online VTS ministry.\n\nMaybe there is a need for trans non-binary clergy in Massachusetts. You tell me.\n\nI am wondering if there are signs that a church/denomination has gone into terminal decline. I'm talking about numerical signs (e.g., population drop below a certain number), but also cultural signs within the denomination. I'm thinking about Charles Featherstone , a white man who read and commented in this blog some years back, who was refused ordination in 2014 after graduating from a Lutheran (ELCA) seminary, because (he claimed) of something he revealed in his memoir. I never found out for sure what it was, but having read the book, I think I know - and it is something so completely banal from his teenage years that it could not possibly be the reason. Could it? Granted, I never got the other side of the story, so I can't pass judgment on whether or not Charles was unfairly refused ordination.\n\nI bring his case up here because he did tell me that though he wasn't a conservative, he was the only seminarian there from the working class, and boy, did it show. Everything was about advanced cultural progressivism (what we now call wokeism), but nobody had the slightest interest in class, except to think of him as problematic for not speaking their language. If his description of his ELCA seminary is accurate, then a church that is producing seminary graduates that are radically alienated in their beliefs, language, and habits of mind from the people they will be ordained to serve is not a church with a future.\n\nI would like to hear from seminarians and clergy personnel, to get your take on this. Help me understand what is going on. You don't have to identify yourself or your seminary, but do give us an idea of the specific church or general tradition it's part of. Or is there a theory of institutional decline that expands past the bounds of seminaries? I am thinking of something I learned in a political theory class as an undergraduate, some \"law\" saying that over time, the administrative class of any institution will come to regard its personal interests as synonymous with the interests of that institution.\n\nUPDATE: An Episcopal clergyman whose name and diocese I am withholding at his request writes:\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "Is an \"epidemic\" of violent anti-transgender bigotry raging in the United States? To hear LGBT advocates and their media and political allies tell it, the answer is emphatically yes. Ahead of the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance on Saturday, the Human Rights Campaign declared 2021 to be the most violent year for trans Americans since the organization began keeping track seven years ago, with 46 trans and gender non-conforming individuals killed.\n\nMainstream media outlets soon echoed that claim: 2021, declared CBS, was the \"deadliest year\" for trans America, while an opinion piece on MSNBC lamented \"a record in trans death from violence,\" showing that \"we live in a world where transgender people not only feel unwelcome, but also unsafe.\"\n\nIn a statement, President Biden likewise mourned the sheer extent of anti-trans bigotry roiling the nation: \"Today, on Transgender Day of Remembrance, we mourn those we lost in the deadliest year on record for transgender Americans, as well as the countless other transgender people - disproportionately black and brown transgender women and girls - who face brutal violence, discrimination, and harassment.\"\n\nThis violence, according to HRC's theory of the case, is caused by \"dehumanization\" and \"stigma,\" which begin with \"lack of family acceptance,\" a \"hostile political climate\" and \"cultural invisibility and marginalization,\" all of which lead to higher risk of violence against the transgendered. This makes it sound as if this year's victims were stabbed, brutalized, and gunned down by gangs of haters with obvious anti-trans motives, by \"hatred\" spread by conservatives and others who oppose the full-spectrum gender agenda.\n\nReality is far more complicated-if no less tragic-than the narrative suggests.\n\nThe complexity first became apparent to me in 2017, while I was writing a long feature essay in Commentary on the roots of male-to-female transgenderism. As part of my reporting, I attended a Transgender Day of Remembrance ceremony at New York City's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center. Not unlike this year's remembrance, attendees mourned and cried \"rest in power\" as each of that year's victims was identified. I found myself moved as well, but also wondering: How exactly did each of these men and women meet their end? The live event offered no detailed information. Nor did the website of the Gay Center or that of the HRC. All we heard was that \"stigma\" and \"hate\" had led to these violent deaths.\n\nSo I decided to research each of that year's deaths, including by searching publicly available information on local news sites, scouring court records, and calling homicide departments (as necessary). What I found belied the narrative of the LGBT groups-a narrative used to pursue political ends even sympathetic Americans might reasonably reject.\n\nIn reality, very few-if any-of that year's victims could be said to have succumbed to outright bigotry of the kind advocates rightly decry. Rather, most seemed to have died in gang-land disputes, domestic- and intimate-partner disputes, drug disputes, and other such violence that sadly plagues low-income minority communities across the land, especially in inner cities.\n\nSince then, I've done similar research on each subsequent year's slate of Day of Remembrance victims, and the reported facts have consistently verified my hypothesis: namely, that most trans victims of violence in the 21st century aren't dying at the hands of right-wing haters-but jilted lovers, ruthless drug dealers, and random gang-land thugs, for whom the gender identity of the victims was a marginal or non-issue.\n\nThis year's victims are no different. At the heart of each of their stories is human suffering. But the cause of the suffering isn't the ideological one blamed by their would-be advocates.\n\nOf the 46 cases identified by HRC in 2021, at least 19 by my count have already been ruled out as hate crimes relating to the victim's transgender or non-conforming identity: In case after case, a minimal amount of public-records research reveals victims shot by their lovers and ex-lovers, targeted in robbery attempts (botched or successful), bludgeoned and stabbed by the mentally ill in senseless attacks, or otherwise felled in domestic disputes. Consider:\n\nAnd on and on.\n\nMany other cases are highly ambiguous, involving unsolved murders in parts of the country (Chicago, Baltimore, Miami) where black men and women, regardless of their sexuality or gender identity, face an elevated risk of becoming victims of violent crime, committed by other black people in the overwhelming share of cases. In a handful of cases, police hadn't yet ruled out a hate-crime motive; in one-one single case-do police actively and explicitly suspect a gender motivation.\n\nThese 46 killings cry out for justice. They are 46 too many deaths. But advocates dishonor these victims when they whitewash the realities in which they were embedded and the true causes of their deaths, all to sell a political cause.\n\nSohrab Ahmari is a founder and editor of Compact magazine, a contributing editor of The American Conservative, and a visiting fellow of the Veritas Center for Ethics in Public Life at Franciscan University.

      "text": "Mary Harrington once wrote that America is a satanic theocracy . Not in the literal sense, of course, but more in the literary sense of the word. \"Perhaps Milton is to blame,\" Harrington wrote, \"Cromwell's chief propagandist is famous for creating the most sympathetic Satan in literary history. In Milton's 1663 Biblical epic Paradise Lost , Satan both longs for the Heaven he's renounced, but stubbornly refuses to be ruled, declaring: 'Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven.'\"\n\nTo simplify, the central thesis is that America is a society that is primed to ideologically worship radical self-love to the point that it is a perpetual rebellion against any natural authority and hierarchy.\n\nA plausible realist qualifier to that is that America is a revolutionary (and ideologically Protestant) society from its foundation; that means, unlike dispositionally satiated status quo powers, it needs a sense of providential destiny and a sense of rebellion in relation to other powers and authorities. That is perhaps all there is to it. America stood against empires when imperialism was the global norm. It then co-opted proto-imperialism to push back against other empires in its own hemisphere.\n\nImperial priorities dictated that America have an industrial base and expand from coast to coast. Imperial priorities dictated a (Teddy) Rooseveltian educational system for a republican citizenry. Imperial priorities decided asset prioritizations, railways, different English spellings, and alliance with Britain, pre-world war. The special relationship was purely imperial elite choice from both sides, most Americans (and Britons) were ambivalent about it. The Cold War was a conflict between ideological modernist cousins of liberalism and communism. The secular liberals made peace with the religious fellow citizens, to defeat the more fanatically secular and authoritarian fascism and communism. Hollywood churned out pro-faith and pro-family propaganda until the alliance of convenience was over.\n\nToday there is no competition to the elite liberals from the authoritarian left across the globe. Naturally their Sauron-like gaze is towards the faithful. That's why they see a Christian Russia to be far more a threat than the brutal authoritarian and secular China. If tomorrow China truly threatens American power, Hollywood will pivot towards worshiping faith, flag, and family again. Unipolarity explains foreign and domestic policy.\n\nOf course, hierarchy is the natural state of affairs. The argument that hierarchical disparity is not natural but material is the root justification for any totalitarianism. To balance that, the American liberal elite needs state power to actively discriminate or pressure one or other side. By that logic you can justify unlimited external intervention and control to fix that always everywhere, even things which are unfixable, like culture in Afghanistan, or educational and material disparity within our own country.\n\nAll that is to say that, unlike the notion that America itself is a liberal \"satanic\" theocracy, it is easier to see that America, like the rest of the Anglosphere, is under the thumb of a secular liberal priestly class. A farmer in Idaho or a small businessman in Ohio has more in common with one in Mansfield, UK, or on the shores of the Volga than the sociology department at Yale or the gender studies faculty at Rutgers.\n\nAnd that explains more than anything why the liberal priest class celebrates Easter as the new \"Transgender Day of Visibility.\" The presidential \" day of visibility \" edict wasn't a  random event. It was a deliberate, targeted powerplay by those who know their core support group across the country and the globe. Presidential edicts are always like royal charters, every single word thought out and planned. If you don't get that, you don't get politics.\n\nThe question here therefore isn't about state neutrality. The American state has never been \"neutral\" or even aspired to be neutral. That is a myth. The current elite and the state is actively undermining one side, and promoting the other. The idea that elegiacs to neutrality can and will defend against this elite ideology is a ludicrous concept. It is at the end of the day, like all conflicts, hot or cold, a theological war. Of course, one can refuse to have a theocracy and that's fine. The chances of having a Protestant Franco are near zero.\n\nBut the Dawkinsian idea that the American state can be truly secular, without a worldview dictated by a specific religion is also absurd and ahistorical. There will always be a faith, some sort of a faith. Even the Jacobins-a movement qualitatively similar to modern American liberal internationalists- worshipped \"reason\" in a temple . It is pretty much that. To change that, change the ruling class and install a counter elite. Restructuring the modes of propaganda, reforming the universities, the bureaucracy, and state theology is the way to change the country. It won't happen in one day-and neutrality won't win a theological conflict.\n\nIn Edward Watts's fascinating book, The Final Pagan Generation , the cultural shift that engulfed Europe took over a period of four hundred years. Romans, who were used to old gods and older ways, continued with their traditions, but that got mixed with new symbols. People were buried with both wooden gods and crucifixes as a new faith slowly engulfed the old. But the two most important factors were state powers, and time of change. Romans only changed when the state symbolism changed; the revolution was top-down, and one set of elites replaced the other set. It took centuries to transform society.\n\nThere is a tendency among the commentariat to cherry pick holy books and scriptures that justify one's ideology, the liberals focusing on eliminating poverty, and the conservatives focusing more on virtue and sexuality. But as a military historian, the most important lesson one can draw about implementing political power from the rise and establishment of Christianity is the necessity of steady martial resolve. The changes will be elite-driven and come from the top. It will be stable, subtle and resolute, without verging on fanatical, idiotic, and overtly preachy. And it will take time.\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "Trump's Executive Order Ends 'Trans' Tyranny and Protects Females President Donald Trump delivers on his promise to protect women and children from the \"left-wing gender insanity\"\n\nT hanks to Donald Trump's new executive order, entitled \" Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government ,\" the federal government is no longer coming after you for not recognizing \"transwomen\" as women or \"transmen\" as men in schools, workplaces, and public accommodations.\n\nThis is a major about-face from the Biden-Harris administration's insidious promotion of all things \"trans,\" endangering children (indoctrination, chemical castration, \"trans\" mutilation surgery), females (privacy and safety), and faithful Christians everywhere (mandatory speech requirements in employment and education).\n\nTrump was true to his commitment over a year ago to work against the \"left-wing gender insanity being pushed on our children [which] is an act of child abuse\" and \"to stop the chemical, physical, and emotional mutilation of our youth.\" The executive order fleshed out what was arguably the greatest line in his Inaugural Address : \"As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.\"\n\nThis one action alone justifies the outcome of the election (there are, of course, other reasons) because the eradication of any non-circular definition of \"woman\" and \"man\" (or \"male\" and \"female\") does inestimable damage to this most essential element of human civilization.\n\nThe opening \"Purpose\" section artfully summarizes the problem by presenting it as a problem for women: \"Ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have ... used ... coercive means to permit men to ... gain access to intimate single-sex spaces ... designed for women.... This is wrong.\" Such efforts \"attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being.\" Moreover, \"basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself.\"\n\nTrump's executive order rightfully pinpoints the locus of confusion as \"replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts.\" The sad result is that laws originally designed to protect women are perverted to \"undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept.\"\n\nIn order to preserve the original intent of legislation to protect women, the government has no choice but to revert back to a biologically based definition of what a woman is and what a man is. \"Accordingly, my Administration will defend women's rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.\"\n\nThe second section of \"Policy and Definitions\" pulls the rug out from under the house of cards that stand atop \"gender ideology\" and \"gender identity\" by re-establishing a secure basis for \"sex.\"\n\nUnder Trump's watch, the federal government will no longer define a \"male\" and \"female\" by subjective identity but solely by objective biological identity, i.e., by gametes or reproductive function. \"'Female' means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell [i.e., egg cell or ovum]. 'Male' means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell [i.e., the sperm cell].\"\n\nSections 3 through 8 largely spell out the practical effects on federal policy and regulations of reverting back to biologically objective definitions of \"sex\" that are based on male-female reproductive complementarity.\n\nPerhaps the biggest hit was rescinding part of Biden's executive order , which had redefined the prohibition of \"sex discrimination\" in Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act to include not only \"sexual orientation discrimination\" but also \"gender identity discrimination.\" In schools that receive federal funding, males will no longer be allowed into female restrooms, locker rooms, female living facilities, and sports (the latter two were still being worked on at the time of the Biden administration's revisions to Title IX in April 2024 ).\n\nBiden's Title IX executive order had recently faced challenges. With lawsuits from 26 Republican attorneys general , the Biden administration's revision of Title IX was on hold in their states. Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that Biden's revision was unconstitutional. Last week, the House of Representatives passed a bill prohibiting men from competing in women's school sports. It now goes to the Senate.\n\nAlso according to Trump's new executive order, as regards facilities that receive federal funding, \"males are not [to be] detained in women's prisons or housed in women's detention centers\" or allowed into female-only \"rape shelters.\" And, \"no federal funds are [to be] expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate's appearance to that of the opposite sex.\"\n\n\"Intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are [to be ] designated by sex and not identity.\" This would include, of course, restrooms, locker rooms, and showers.\n\n\"Agencies shall remove all ... regulations ... that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.... Agencies shall take all necessary steps ... to end the Federal funding of gender ideology,\" including in federal grants. \"Government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, [shall] accurately reflect the holder's sex,\" as also all \"applicable personnel records.\"\n\nAll federal guidance publications from previous administrations inconsistent with this new executive order are to be immediately rescinded, including (here I offer a selection of a much fuller list than in the executive order): \"The White House Toolkit on Transgender Equality\"; \"Creating Inclusive and Nondiscriminatory School Environments for LGBTQI+ Students\"; \"Supporting LGBTQI+ Youth and Families in School\"; \"Supporting Intersex Students\"; \"Supporting Transgender Youth in School\"; \"Confronting Anti-LGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools\"; \"Enforcement of Title IX ... With Respect to Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of Bostock v. Clayton County \"; \"Enforcement Guidance on Harassment [of LGBTQI+ Persons] in the Workplace\" (April 29, 2024).\n\nIn addition, the attorney general is charged with issuing \"guidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" Presumably, this would include protection for teachers in schools who decline to use \"trans\" pronouns for students, teachers, and staff.\n\nUndoubtedly, this executive order will be challenged in the courts, especially in relation to the Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which addressed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This underscores the importance of strong court appointments. The executive order would not affect areas over which the federal government does not have authority. But it is an excellent start to the Trump administration.\n\nOhio Protects Girls From Boys Who Want to Use Their Bathroom\n\nIs the Transgender Movement Really Backing Down?\n\nMeta's Oversight Board Threatens Women's Right to Sex-Based Protections\n\nRobert A.

      "text": "Canadian Journalists Try to Shut Down Reporting on New Prime Minister's 'Trans' Daughter \"You should take this down.\"\n\nT his week, a Canadian conservative news outlet, True North , reported on an essay written by the daughter of Canada's new prime minister for Yale University's feminist magazine . The woman, Sophia Carney, who is now going by Sasha, is 24 years old, graduated from Yale two years ago, and stylizes herself as an activist and writer.\n\nYet Canada's journalists are up in arms over True North 's revelations. They are refusing to report True North 's findings and are slamming those who even speak of them.\n\nWhy might that be? Why, of course, it's because True North 's reporting, which discusses Sasha Carney's ( public ) transgender identity, touches upon the topic of child \"gender transitions.\"\n\nIn the essay , Sasha Carney discusses how she adopted a transgender identity in high school and relates that she visited the U.K.'s Tavistock clinic for therapy. She seems to indicate, however, that she did not receive Tavistock's infamous \"gender-affirming\" medical interventions, such as puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones.\n\nSasha Carney wrote, \"I quietly stopped wearing underwire bras, and wore baggier clothes, and I felt a fierce surge of jealousy every time I walked into the Tavistock for therapy and saw patients turn left, towards the medical spaces I didn't feel 'trans enough' to enter.\"\n\nSeems relevant, right? As a child, the daughter of Canada's prime minister received therapy likely related to her transgender identity at the very medical facility that has since had its gender clinic shut down for the danger it poses to patients. We should know if Prime Minister Mark Carney - who is anticipated to call a snap election to take place on April 28 - supports or opposes transgender medical treatments for children, and how he handled the topic when it arose in his own family. As of now, Carney has not clarified where he stands on such treatments, even as they remain under intense scrutiny worldwide. Currently, Canada continues to cover the costs of \"gender-affirming\" medical treatments for children, including testosterone for girls and estrogen for boys. (RELATED: Canada Has a New Globalist Prime Minister (For Now) )\n\nEven those who think a girl who wants to be a boy should be pumped up with testosterone should want this information reported. After all, it seems Sasha Carney didn't feel fully affirmed in her identity. She wrote in her essay, \"My teenage years existed in close proximity to this TERF-driven scrutiny, which was fixated on identifying how 'authentically trans' people like me really were.\" Maybe Mark Carney chose not to fully affirm her childhood \"transgender nonbinary\" identity.\n\nYet the response of Canada's journalists has been to howl and scream and to demand fellow journalists stop even mentioning this.\n\nListen, just listen to what Canadian journalist John Ivison said when True North 's founder, Candice Malcolm, posted the story on her X account.\n\n\"You should take this down, Candice,\" Ivison said .\n\nThat is the sound of the censorship. John Ivison - with an air of coolness, smugness, and dismissiveness - just told a fellow journalist to shut up.\n\nTo make matters worse, John Ivison is the Ottawa bureau chief for Canada's National Post . In other words, he is a journalist in a position of significant power in Canada's media.\n\nIn a comment on his X post, Ivison took things further, saying , \"This is not what we do in Canada.\"\n\nIn other words, in Canada, it's apparently the accepted opinion that liberal politicians should be shielded from reporting that even touches on their personal lives. That evidently extends to the point that the online feminist magazine at Yale University is private information. And to the point that the writings of a 24-year-old political activist ( that are live on the internet ) must be hidden from public view.\n\nBut John Ivison is not alone in believing himself entitled to tell True North 's journalists to shut up.\n\nThe National Post 's Chris Selley wrote on Tuesday to lampoon the publication of True North 's story and to use it to smear all conservative publications in Canada as having low journalistic ethics. He said , \"[Conservative Leader Pierre] Poilievre has been musing about extending financial incentives to conservative outlets ... On Monday one of those [conservative] outlets reported a story about Mark Carney's eldest child's medical history in Britain. It didn't even attempt to explain why it would be of any relevance to Canadian voters. It didn't need to. It was about gender transition, and a chunk of the Conservative base is absolutely obsessed with that issue, and so there it was.\" (RELATED: Meet Canada's 'MAGA' Prime Minister Candidate: Pierre Poilievre )\n\nPerhaps more insidious is that apart from the aforementioned National Post column's vague mention of the story for the sake of criticizing it, no mainstream Canadian publications have reported on Sasha Carney's writings about her experience with the Tavistock clinic following the onset of her childhood transgender identity. In other words, Canada's liberal journalists have acted as one to silence a story they think will make their preferred politician and ideology look bad - in the midst of an election, no less.\n\nCanada's liberal journalists aren't the only ones who want conservative journalists to be censored in Canada.\n\nCanadian Member of Parliament Kevin Vuong posted on X to portray the reporting about Sasha Carney's Tavistock clinic essay as \"attacks\":\n\nI'm seeing attacks on PM Carney's daughter, and I want to implore, as someone whose family has been indiscriminately targeted:\n\nIn 🇨🇦, members of our family are off limits - leave them out of it.\n\nAttack the public office holder, attack our policies, but leave our families alone.\n\n- Kevin Vuong 🇨🇦 (@KevinVuongMP) March 17, 2025\n\nCanada has a real problem with censorship. And that problem goes all the way to the top.\n\nEarlier this week, Mark Carney pilloried reporters who dared to question him on his finances. At a press conference on Monday, when Stephanie Levitz, a reporter at the Globe and Mail , questioned the ultra-wealthy Carney on when he will disclose his finances, Carney said , \"What possible conflict would [I] have, Stephanie?\" Then, when journalist Rosemary Barton of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation further pressed him on whether he could have any conflicts of interest with his assets, Carney responded, \"Look inside yourself, Rosemary. I mean you start from a prior of conflict and ill will.\"\n\nThis is a country that needs a serious reassessment of the role of the press.\n\nREAD MORE from Ellie Gardey Holmes:\n\nNever Forget What They Did to Us Five Years Ago\n\nDemocrats' Civil War Over Transgenderism Heats Up\n\nMelania Trump Finds Her Stride\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "The Bizarre Vegan, Trans, and Rationalist Cult The Zizians are the symptom of a larger disease.\n\nI am closely following the murky case of the Zizian cult, a story so illustrative of our times that almost no one dares analyze it. It is always easier to say that they are just criminals, crazy, or evil. This is not the case. I admit that Ziz, the leader of the sect, has a brain like gruyere cheese, but the fact that he has managed to influence so many other high-capacity young people is meaningful. And if it is confirmed that he was able to drive some of them to suicide with his ideas, we should try to understand this cult still better. In addressing the alleged suicide of one of its members, Ziz wrote in his blog: \" Pasek's right hemisphere had been 'mostly-dead.' \" I clarify for the uninitiated that Ziz believes that we have half a female brain and half a male brain, and that both hemispheres fight, perhaps over deciding who does the dishes at home.\n\nSeveral members of the Zizians have been arrested in the midst of investigations into violent crimes. They are all the same: they are young, vegan, transgender, work in tech companies in Silicon Valley, love rationalist philosophy, and advocate anarchy.\n\nA few weeks ago, I published a report about them in Spain. To write it, I had to read a good part of the literary production of Ziz and his followers, investigate their forums, even their deleted messages, and I swear I have never been so close to suffering an appendicitis in the center of my brain.\n\nEverything about them is extreme. Their veganism is extreme. They believe that whoever kills an animal is just as guilty as whoever kills a man. So the vast majority of the population are their enemies. Their transsexualism is a strange element even for researchers. My theory is that, knowing their obsession with rationalist debate, they used estrogen from gender treatments to enhance their capacity for theoretical reasoning by boosting their verbal memory and other intellectual capacities.\n\nIts members lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, even lived on boats for a time, and their jobs were technological. Part of the cult's concern was the deep knowledge and threats of AI. In the cases I have studied in more detail, there is a surprising accumulation of people with obvious characteristics of social phobia and even autism.\n\nZiz invented a language full of nonintuitive metaphors to make his online conversations unintelligible to outsiders. This makes it difficult to understand his lengthy dissertations. However, there is one element in this story that is not new: rationalism. An etching by Goya comes to mind with the title The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters . The interpretation of the title of the work has been discussed a thousand times, but I prefer to stay with those who believe that Goya meant that it is reason that produces monsters. Let us remember: the Terror had ended in 1794, and Goya painted his etching only five years later. The excesses of rationalism caused the Terror, and revolutionary logic justified mass executions in the name of the goddess reason. In essence, the French Revolution was nothing more than an exercise in a tediously magnified return to paganism.\n\nNo wonder Ziz also sought to quench their thirst for blood. The leader of the cult used to tell of the trauma he suffered when realizing years after the fact how, as a child killing ants in the shower, he had indeed inflicted a terrible torture upon the bugs. I have consulted the ants, but they preferred not to make any statements about Ziz.\n\nIn my research, I have been surprised to see that several members were interacting on social networks with people who, on the surface, seemed to be prominent professionals in technology companies. It is surprising to see how they grew apart, perhaps because of Ziz's tendency toward radicalization. And it is also surprising that a strangely high number of these professionals who interacted on social networks with them were, for the most part, transgender. I am not trying to hatch a conspiracy theory, only to note a peculiar fact.\n\nThe role of the Center for Applied Rationality (CAR), the starting point for Ziz and others around him, is also unclear. It is confirmed that the Zizians were angry with the new direction CAR was taking and tried to attack one of their camps dressed in black robes and Anonymous masks. Certainly, the CAR camps or workshops, where they isolate you for a few days and teach you strange applied rationalism techniques, do not seem to be the best environment to keep your mental health in optimal conditions.\n\nThe investigation seems to be on the right track, and I hope we won't have any more unpleasant surprises in the form of suicides. Interestingly, no one has blocked potentially harmful content from the Zizians' blog. But be that as it may, I think the Zizians are the symptom of a larger disease. I don't believe they're just a side note on the local news page. These guys have read more books than all the other killers in the world combined. And these guys are children of a century that has endeavored to erase God and leave everything to reason.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Judge Raps PA School District for Trans Instruction Mt. Lebanon schools have been ordered to give parents advance notice and opt out of transgender instruction.\n\nM t. Lebanon, Pa., is a leafy suburb south of Pittsburgh known for its quality of life and its fine public schools.\n\nAccording to the educators who sit on blue-ribbon panels, the school district is among the best in Pennsylvania if not the country. Its graduates attend elite universities. And parents move to the district for the schools, surveys say. My wife and I moved there 35 years ago for just this reason.\n\n\"There is no evidence in this [court] record of bullying, unkindness, or disrespect toward transgender students in the elementary school attended by the children of Plaintiffs.\"\n\nBut the vaunted Mt. Lebanon School District now finds itself on the losing end of a significant court decision over transgender education in its public schools. By embracing the radical idea that it was acceptable \"teacher prerogative\" to instruct first graders that their gender at birth could be wrong, the district staked out a position that was at odds with common decency, common sense, and common Christian conviction.\n\nThe case began when Megan Williams, a first-grade teacher in the district's Jefferson Elementary School spontaneously decided two years ago to observe Transgender Awareness Day by reading noncurricular books which presented gender identity topics to her students. She then told her first-grade students: \"when children are born, parents make a guess whether they're a girl or a boy. Sometimes parents are wrong.\" Some of the young children experienced confusion about how that topic personally affected them.\n\nDistrict Superintendent Timothy Steinhauer (who has since retired) testified in the lengthy court discovery that accompanied the case, it was longstanding practice within the district to honor opt outs on subjects parents found objectionable. But the opt outs and prior notice were \"always teacher prerogative.\"\n\nSteinhauer testified: \"We [the District] don't have any specific guidelines for what you should notify parents about and not notify parents about.\" Steinhauer confirmed there were no written procedures on how or whether to notify parents.\n\nBut in this instance, past precedent was ignored. Parents were not notified or given the option to opt out. The district unequivocally backed teacher Williams' own personal preference, which was colored by the fact that her own child of the same age was transitioning from boy to girl at the same time.\n\n\"When I retired from Mt. Lebanon, the school district ALWAYS sided with the parents,\" she adds. \"We had to be so careful about what we said. This is just unbelievable. I am very disappointed in this town. Mt. Lebanon was always a conservative community. I'm very sorry to hear how Mt Lebanon has changed.\"\n\nLikewise, it's not a district my wife or I recognize anymore. I suspect, however, that's a sentiment widely shared by many citizens across America whose trust in community schools has been shattered.\n\nAs in many liberal enclaves, the prevailing ethos in Mt. Lebanon now puts great emphasis on \"inclusivity.\" But as the case made clear, their inclusivity is meant only for politically acceptable minority groups. Christians now are perhaps in the minority in our community. If you espouse a Christian worldview, as did the three courageous moms who sued the school district, that is unacceptably intolerant.\n\nIn this regard, Mt. Lebanon has changed radically in the time we've lived there. It's not quite Berkeley (California) yet, but it has moved inexorably in that direction. While the Lebo electorate was mostly Republican when we moved here, the school board hasn't had a Republican elected to it in more than a decade.\n\nAnd despite the rhetoric of \"tolerance\" expressed on yard signs and at cocktail parties, in the higher social strata, the only acceptable tolerance is that of the liberal persuasion. On the school board at least, if you cling to your Bible, you are considered deplorable and decidedly persona non grata.\n\nThis transition of America - from true tolerance to a widespread embrace of cancel culture, in both urban and suburban settings, even in an outwardly friendly place like Mt. Lebanon that supposedly espouses tolerance - has been well documented by academics on the fringes of the academy, where the transition is most radical.\n\nTheologian Carl Trueman, of Grove City College, has written persuasively on the role \"expressive individualism\" plays now in the social dynamic of towns like Mt. Lebanon. Tolerance and inclusivity mean not just living quietly and peacefully as a trans person, but changing the pronoun usage of everyone else to conform to your expressive identity.\n\nConsider what happened in a Virginia public school district. The school board recently agreed to pay $575,000, after years of litigation, to settle with Peter Vlaming, a high school French teacher whose employment was terminated in 2018 for refusing to use male pronouns for a transgender student. Vlaming had tried to avoid pronouns altogether and used the student's preferred name, but was fired after \"accidentally\" using a feminine pronoun. Vlaming sued, and the Viriginia Supreme Court ruled that his rights were violated.\n\n\"I was wrongfully fired from my teaching job because my religious beliefs put me on a collision course with school administrators who mandated that teachers ascribe to only one perspective on gender identity - their preferred view,\" Vlaming said . He was represented in his lawsuit by the Alliance Defending Freedom .\n\nSocial commentator Aaron Renn, author of Life in the Negative World , describes how Christians in this dynamic are treated now in the \"negative world.\" \"In this era,\" Renn writes, \"society has an overall negative view of Christianity. Being known as a Christian is a social negative, particularly in the higher domains of society. Christian morality is expressly repudiated and now seen as a threat to the public good and new public moral order.\"\n\nOn Sept. 30, Joy Flowers Conti, the senior federal judge in the Western Pennsylvania district court who oversaw the lengthy school court case, issued her decision.\n\nUntil the judge's ruling, Williams' own personal and subjective standard of gender fluidity and identity was the only acceptable pedagogy on transgender instruction in the Mt. Lebanon School District. When parents objected, administrators treated the parents as religious fanatics, and backed the teacher's conduct without question or inquiry. The three moms then filed a federal lawsuit , claiming their constitutional rights were violated.\n\nIt was a David vs. Goliath legal contest which ended, incredibly, in ignominious and embarrassing defeat for the school district. By issuing a summary judgment, Judge Conti said there was no need for a trial because there was nothing for a jury to decide.\n\nAs a matter of law, the judge writes in her opinion that the district and its attorneys didn't understand the law as applied and interpreted in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (based in Philadelphia, which includes Western Pennsylvania).\n\nSummary judgment was entered in favor of all three plaintiffs and against the teacher, three administrators, and the district itself. There were no financial penalties asked for or assessed, but the district will likely be held liable for all of the plaintiffs' attorney fees and costs.\n\nAs part of her ruling, Judge Conti issued a meticulous 94-page opinion that is must reading for anyone concerned with the drift towards radical activism that now pervades many public schools. Within the 94 pages are the cultural signposts of our modern times.\n\nOn page 2, Judge Conti dismisses the \"kindness, tolerance, and respect\" argument so prevalent among transgender activists.\n\n\"There is no evidence in this [court] record of bullying, unkindness, or disrespect toward transgender students in the elementary school attended by the children of Plaintiffs,\" Judge Conti writes. \"This case involves different beliefs about gender identity.\"\n\nOne of the parents who objected to Williams' instruction was Roman Catholic. A second was Mormon and the third religiously unaffiliated but morally motivated. Of the three moms, only one still lives in the district. According to her attorney, she continues to be ostracized and cancelled by some in the community.\n\n\"The Parents disagree that gender is a subjective, individual choice. They assert that gender is objective, immutable and determined by God and biology,\" Judge Conti writes.\n\nOn page 19 of her opinion, Judge Conti relates a telling exchange which presaged the controversy.\n\nOn Oct. 1, 2021, six months before the events occurred which triggered the lawsuit, a Mt. Lebanon parent (\"not a party to this case\") wondered how Jefferson Elementary School might memorialize LBGTQ month after reading about it in the school newsletter. The parent asked in an email to the school principal: \"I was wondering if/how this is acknowledged in the first grade because I am not comfortable with my daughter learning about gender identity at this age.\"\n\nBrett Bielewicz, the school principal, replied: \"There is no formal introduction or lessons surrounding it at [Jefferson Elementary School], especially in 1st grade. It's just merely an acknowledgment of inclusivity and awareness to our JES community.\"\n\nNothing formal, but informally yes, as parents in the school would soon discover.\n\nThe events that triggered the lawsuit began on March 30, 2022, when Megan Williams, a former student in the district who teaches first grade at Jefferson Elementary School, sent a text to two fellow teachers which read: \"Tomorrow is international trans day of visibility. I'd like to read something.\"\n\nShe was acting on impulse born of personal circumstance. Williams' child (a biological boy who was the same age as the first graders in her class) changed to using female pronouns the same week that Williams read two transgender books to her first-grade class on \"international trans day.\"\n\nOn that day, the books were read and discussed. If it had stopped there, Williams may have gotten away unscathed.\n\nBut after telling students that she'd like to bring her child to school in a month for Take Your Child to Work Day (which teachers were not permitted to do), Williams told students that her boy was now a girl, and she'd be wearing a dress to school. She then told the first graders \"when children are born, parents make a guess whether they're a boy or a girl. Sometimes parents are wrong.\"\n\nOne confused child raised his hand and said: \"But I'm a boy. I don't want to be a girl.\" The aide in the class testified that the student was \"upset.\" Williams responded, \"Yes you are. Talk with your parents about that.\"\n\nIn more than two years of litigation, the district (whose board president is himself an attorney) steadfastly maintained in repeated court filings that the parents not only had no case; they had no rights as parents to opt their first graders out of transgender instruction.\n\nThat argument - that \"teacher prerogative\" in the district trumped any and all parental rights - was specious, legal observers say. Judge Conti was equally skeptical.\n\nShe writes:\n\nThroughout this litigation, [the district and its administrators] have taken the position that in a public school, parents have no constitutional right to notice or to opt their children out of any kind of instruction, regardless of the content of that instruction, the age of the children, or whether the instruction is part of the published school curriculum....That is simply not the law within the Third Circuit.\n\nShe continues:\n\nRefusing to provide opt outs for parents who assert religious and fundamental parental rights objections to transgender instruction to young children, while providing notice and opt out rights for other sensitive secular and religious topics, constitutes disparate treatment and violates the Equal Protection clause.\n\nThough few local citizens seemingly know of the case (due to the news coverage blackout), what made it such a lightning rod is that first graders were involved.\n\n\"Who decides how to determine a young child's gender identity goes to the heart of parental decision-making authority on a matter of greatest importance,\" Judge Conti writes.\n\nShe further observes: \"Concerns about undercutting parental authority are heightened when the children are in first grade and the person trying to influence them is their teacher.\"\n\nAnd court testimony clearly demonstrated that teacher Williams was not the least bit repentant. She believed \"I'm in the right here!\" and \"that she was free to instruct the young, captive students in her class in accordance with her beliefs without giving parents prior notice or an opportunity to opt their children out of that instruction,\" Judge Conti writes.\n\nIn any other context, this would be called indoctrination. But because it occurred in a Mt. Lebanon public elementary school, and was a type of indoctrination the school board endorsed, it is considered exhibiting \"tolerance\" and \"respect.\" That's how the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette framed it in this column (in fairness to the PG, they did publish my rebuttal ).\n\nOf note, Judge Conti drew a sharp contrast with how principal Bielewicz dealt with the parents' complaint compared to another situation that arose at the school.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, after the lawsuit had been filed over the first-grade transgender instruction, a German teacher in the same school was doing some introductory instruction to a fifth-grade class about family-related words in German. In response to one student's question, the teacher was alleged to have told the class, \"I understand biology, and there's always one mother and there's always one father.\"\n\nAfter discussing this incident with Assistant Superintendent Marybeth Irvin, Bielewicz, the school's principal, interviewed every student in the class to assess the damage that had been done to the students.\n\nBy contrast, Williams' earlier violation, the judge noted in her opinion, was not investigated by either Bielewicz or the district.\n\nThe judge writes: \"Bielewicz characterized the Parents' position as merely objecting to Williams' reading books.... The adult aides in Williams' classroom were not interviewed or consulted at all.... The administrators made public statements in support of Williams.\"\n\nThis pattern of discrimination on transgender topics explains why the judge ruled as she did.\n\nWhile parents were not provided any advance notice or the ability to opt their children out from Williams' outburst on March 31, teachers within the district had on prior occasions provided advance notice and opt outs to students participating in routine activities, including: the Scripps Spelling Bee; dissecting animals in biology; viewing video clips from a television series involving a gay character; and an assembly featuring a therapy dog.\n\nReturning to the chronology of events: when one of the plaintiff parents (Carmilla Tatel) met with school principal Bielewicz on April 5, 2022 to raise concerns about Williams' conduct, he could not guarantee that Williams wouldn't teach the transgender content again.\n\nAccording to the court record, Bielewicz had sent an email to Williams the day before which read: \"You got tons of support from top down - trust me!\"\n\nHe was right. Incredibly, everyone in the chain of command - Assistant Superintendent Irvin, Superintendent Steinhauer, and School Board President Jacob Wyland - expressed public affirmation for Williams and her actions.\n\nNo one was disciplined then, nor even now (one shortcoming of the ruling, in my view). Williams and Bielewicz still work at Jefferson. Steinhauer and Irvin are retired, while Wyland still heads the school board.\n\nUntil recently, Bielewicz's public message as Jefferson's principal read as follows: \"I thank you in advance for allowing me the opportunity to 'be the change we wish to see in our world!'\"\n\nAs part of the judge's ruling, change will finally be enforced on him and others in the district. After more than two years of litigation, Mt. Lebanon schools have been ordered to give parents advance notice and opt out of transgender instruction. The total cost of this fiasco to community taxpayers has not been revealed.\n\n\"We are pleased that Judge Conti did a detailed examination of the facts and the law, and confirmed what we have said from the start: parental rights and beliefs matter in public education and cannot be disregarded or ignored. We are hopeful the District now understands that and will act accordingly,\" says the victorious Pittsburgh attorney David Berardinelli, who very ably represented the plaintiffs.\n\nWill the Mt. Lebanon School District act accordingly in the future? The people who run it haven't done anything sensible or truly tolerant since the start of this sad affair, so I have my doubts.\n\nA decision on whether the district will appeal the decision is expected on Oct. 21, when the school board meets. Although an appeal might seem ill-advised under the circumstances, modern standards of \"tolerance\" dictate that it may.\n\nThomas O'Boyle ( tom@beverlyheights.org ) blogs on the news ( O'Bservations ) and co-hosts a podcast ( Scattered Seeds Podcast ).

      "text": "Is the Transgender Movement Really Backing Down? In reality, the number of transgender activists questioning their movement's extremism is vanishingly small.\n\nO n Tuesday, the New York Times published an article declaring that transgender activists are in the beginning stages of wondering whether they went too far when they, in essence, adopted a strategy of screaming \"Bigot!\" at anyone who dared question even one of their precepts. The article comes at a moment when many Democrats are pinning Kamala Harris' election loss on the narrative that emerged from the famous \"Kamala Is For They/Them. President Trump Is For You\" campaign ad: that Democrats are at the mercy of ideological radicals, and are less focused on working for everyday Americans.\n\nBut Strangio and the ACLU.... believe \"transitioning\" children is of utmost priority and a critical civil right that needs to be protected.\n\nIn reality, the number of transgender activists who are actually questioning their movement's tactics - such as deeming it \"violence\" to \"misgender\" someone, steamrolling the medical community into saying such insanities as \"birthing parent\" and \"pregnant people,\" and calling evil anyone who questions giving little boys estrogen and little girls testosterone (to supposedly turn them into the opposite sex) - is quite small. (WATCH Ellie Gardey Holmes: The Spectator P.M. Ep. 94: Congress' Bathroom Fight Shows Shift on the Left )\n\nIn fact, the New York Times was only able to find two transgender activists willing to say so on the record. This is in spite of the fact that the author, Jeremy W. Peters, said he did everything he could to get transgender activists to do so. He explained, \"A lot of LGBTQ leaders and advocates didn't want to say they had concerns because they worried about dividing their movement.\"\n\nThe two people who did express some reservations with the transgender movement's aggressive tactics to the New York Times were Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, executive director of Advocates for Transgender Equality, and Mara Keisling, the funder of the National Center for Transgender Equality. For his part, Heng-Lehtinen said, \"We have to make it OK for someone to change their minds.... We cannot vilify them for not being on our side. No one wants to join that team.\" Keisling, meanwhile, said activists had \"looked unreasonable\" when they called people who opposed allowing men in women's sporting events bigots.\n\nBut even as there is an increasing feeling on the Left that things have gone too far in regard to transgender activism, most transgender activists are doubling down. When future member of Congress Sarah McBride, a man who identifies as a woman, agreed to not use the women's bathroom at the Capitol, many transgender activists decried it as a terrible retreat. LGBTQ publication The Advocate quoted a person who identifies as transgender as responding: \"The reaction I am seeing from prominent trans journalists and activists is extremely negative. They are seeing this as a betrayal.\"\n\nAdditionally, the LBGTQ organization GLAAD responded to the whole episode with McBride by asserting that the phrase \"biological sex\" is a term that is merely used to dehumanize people:\n\nThe resolution seeks to ban transgender women from using female restrooms inside the Capitol, barring both House members and employees from \"using single-sex facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex [sic].\" \"Biological sex\" is not an accurate nor a scientific term, but is used by opponents of transgender people to dehumanize them and deny their equal access to society.\n\nOthers are sending out clarion calls begging the Left to not back away from transgender activism. For instance, columnist Will Bunch wrote for the Philadelphia Inquirer last week: \"Whether hate-filled TV ads helped elect Trump is no reason to stop fighting for the humanity of 1 million transgender Americans.\" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has also gone on a media tour reiterating full support for transgenderism. Beshear vetoed a bill that would have protected minor girls in his state from being injected with testosterone and given mastectomies as part of their parents' attempts to turn them into men. Last week, he said on Face the Nation , in explaining his veto, \"That's my faith, where I'm taught that all children are children of God, and I wanted to stick up for children who were being picked on.\"\n\nThe ACLU, which has a major role in advancing transgender radicalism, in particular has elucidated total support for the same aggressive tactics on transgenderism. In a podcast episode earlier this month, Cecillia Wang, the organization's national legal director, focused on transgenderism when explaining her plans for the organization's efforts to diminish the impact of the Trump administration. Before discussing anything else, she worried about Trump's proposal to cut off Medicaid funding to hospitals that give children medical interventions to attempt to turn them into the opposite sex. She referred to this as \"life-saving medical care.\"\n\nBut Strangio and the ACLU are undeterred. They believe \"transitioning\" children is of utmost priority and a critical civil right that needs to be protected. \"The consequences of these 24 state laws banning medical care for trans young people are so drastic and so severe,\" she explained to New York Magazine .\n\nIn the end, it makes more sense for the transgender movement to continue its aggressive tactics. After all, when your movement is founded upon pushing a total lunacy that defies human experience (that some men are secretly women on the inside and vice versa), it turns out that aggressive social control is the only reasonable path toward success.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "The Trans Reckoning Is Not Yet Here - But It's Coming Soon Preparations ought to be made now.\n\nO ver at Compact magazine on Tuesday, Nina Power wrote \" The Trans Reckoning Is Here ,\" and, as evidence, she cited a report by a British pediatrician named Hilary Cass written for the National Health Service that upturned the faux-scientific basis on which that country has embarked on normalizing \"gender-affirming care.\"\n\nAs Power writes:\n\n[The report] made waves by calling into question the medical justification for hormonal and surgical treatments of gender-dysphoric youth demanded by activist groups and embraced by the medical establishment. The report states that the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones should be discontinued, not least because their long-term effects are unknown. Instead of taking narrow claims of dysphoria at face value, Cass adopts a holistic approach, arguing that such statements must be considered \"within the context of poor mental health and emotional distress among the broader adolescent population.\"\n\nThere is and will be major institutional and legal fallout to all this, as well as a feeling of relief (mixed with anger) on the part of all of us punished for dissenting from gender ideology. It feels like Britain is waking up from a collective bad dream. But how did any of these terrible and false ideas get taken seriously, let alone get played out, in many cases irreversibly, on the bodies of children? There are deep psychoanalytic questions here. First and foremost, how did the natural process of puberty-entering sexual maturity-become pathologized? How and why did medical professionals, not to mention unqualified people running pressure groups and charities, come to imagine that staving off adulthood through the use of dangerous drugs was the right response to childhood distress?\n\nThis is certainly good news, as it points toward a diminution in the number of children and young adults in whom the British government will invest taxpayer money in sexually mutilating.\n\nExcept it's not clear that Power's headline is ripe just yet.\n\nREAD MORE from Scott McKay: Dead Thugs and Tired Narratives\n\nThe reckoning for the nightmare that is transgenderism - together with its 40 percent post-op suicide rate and the increasing levels of madness and social contagion that it has sparked among its votaries and their supporters - is not upon us. It may come soon, to be sure, and the public revulsion to the quack medicine and perversion of civil rights cant in support of mental derangement has begun to spill over the banks that cancel culture and institutional capture have constructed.\n\nBut the reckoning hasn't yet come.\n\nAmerican Spectator publisher Melissa Mackenzie and I had a good discussion on this topic in one of this week's episodes of The Spectacle podcast , and it was bound up in a conversation over left-wing comedian Bill Maher's open admission that abortion is \"murder\" (and he's \"just OK with that\"). The elites in our society, who are mostly on the left, are so arrogant and tyrannical that they've begun admitting what we've known about them for a while - in blithering obliviousness that to admit these things is to admit what monsters they truly are.\n\nBill Maher openly admits the Left's real position on abortion:\n\n\"They think it's murder. And it kind of is. And I'm just okay with that. I am. There's 8 billion people in the world. I'm sorry, we won't miss you. That's my position on that.\" pic.twitter.com/ZCV5SwUZu1\n\n- Citizen Free Press (@CitizenFreePres) April 13, 2024\n\nMaher is doing so as a matter of political views and public policy. But then there are the celebrity parents - an astonishing number of them - who happily \"trans\" their children.\n\nThe latest of these monsters is the actress Naomi Watts , a declining Australian starlet who has dressed her teenage son up as a girl and paraded him around at fashion events. As reports the Daily Mail :\n\nNaomi Watts and her youngest child Kai were two peas in a pod on Monday as they stepped out in stylish dresses at the Dior pre-fall fashion show in Brooklyn.\n\nThe mother-child duo looked radiant in ankle-length gowns, which featured flowing skirts, and designer accessories as they caught up with friends.\n\nOpting for a plunging neckline, the Australian actress, 55, looked very chic in an all-white frock with ruffled sleeves as she accessorised with a long gold necklace.\n\nShe elevated her angelic look with a black designer handbag, a chunky black ring, and towering heels which boasted a gold sheen.\n\nMeanwhile, Naomi's teen Kai, 15, who was born Samuel, did Dior proud, stepping out in the brand's red and white floral pleated skirt worth $4,900.\n\nWatts had two children with actor Liev Schreiber before the couple broke up. Samuel is the younger of the two. They're \"co-parents.\" Meanwhile, Watts has now taken up with actor Billy Crudup .\n\nIt's fair to say that Samuel has had an insufficient presence of a father in his life. That seems to be true of many of these Hollywood trans kids. It's definitely true of the monstrous Charlize Theron , who has two adopted kids, one of whom she's attempting to turn into a girl:\n\nCharlize Theron wanted the world to use the right pronouns for her daughter.\n\nBack in April, the Bombshell star opened up about her kids in an interview with The Daily Mail . In her chat with the outlet, Theron explained that Jackson, 7, had told her four years earlier, \"I am not a boy!\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought she was a boy, too,\" the actress shared with the outlet. \"Until she looked at me when she was three years old and said: 'I am not a boy!'\"\n\n\"So there you go!\" Theron continued. \"I have two beautiful daughters who, just like any parent, I want to protect and I want to see thrive.\"\n\nIt's surprising that no one in the black community has taken issue with Theron, a rich white South African (and, therefore, already a member of a suspect \"racist\" class) woman, adopting a young black boy and attempting to \"trans\" him. A deeper insult to black manhood in America is harder to imagine, and yet ... crickets.\n\nTheron gained much fame for her portrayal of the deranged killed Aileen Wuornos in Monster . It turns out that the actress has become the near moral equal to the subject.\n\nNina Power is onto something when she notes the damage being done to children who are castrated by \"puberty-blocker\" drugs, which are advertised as having only temporary effect but, in reality, destroy the reproductive systems of those who take them. The further outrage of \"top\" surgery - cutting out the breast tissue of young girls under the delusion they're actually men - or, worse, \"bottom\" surgery, in which genital mutilation destroys the possibility of reproduction or even of sexual gratification for the victim, leaves these kids with a bleak, largely meaningless life.\n\nWe got a taste of what that might result in last year in Nashville, when a young biological woman who hadn't even gone through the full process of \"gender affirmation\" nonetheless went on a shooting rampage through a Christian school she had once attended. The Nashville shooter wrote a psychotic, rage-filled manifesto before the massacre that even today the authorities are loath to release for what it might portend.\n\nBut it isn't hard to imagine.\n\nIn 10 or 15 years, these children being \"transed\" by wayward, narcissistic, Munchausen-by-proxy parents, the vast majority of whom fit the classic definition of AWFLs (affluent white female leftists), will be saddled with the full implications of what's been done to them. Consider the case of Kellie - now Scott - Newgent, who was featured in Daily Wire host Matt Walsh's What Is a Woman documentary:\n\nThis is what the Cass Report in Great Britain has begun to reveal.\n\nWhat's going to happen when Newgent's story is written large? What will happen when the public begins to realize that the one of the top distributors of \"puberty-blockers\" to kids is the taxpayer-funded Planned Parenthood ?\n\nWhat happens when there are tens or hundreds of thousands of mutilated, marginalized adults who are cash registers for the medical profession and can never return to what God made them to be?\n\nThose on the right had better be the ones providing them a lifeline.\n\nStart with legislation aimed at the quack doctors and other so-called medical professionals who are pushing children down this road to perdition. Align with the trial bar and impose statutory liability for those involved in \"gender-affirming\" medical care.\n\nHey, maybe the victims of this Mengelean medical experimentation are happy and satisfied with what it's done to them. Great! For those who aren't, there ought to be compensation available. Trial attorneys have properties in this regard; let's make use of them.\n\nWhatever public policy and/or legislation might be useful in facilitating large lawsuits against the Planned Parenthoods and other practitioners of child castration must get that done - most easily at the state level.\n\nLet's also do something about the Charlize Therons and Naomi Wattses of the world - these Munchausen-by-proxy lunatics who seize upon bumps in children's development and/or difficult phases they might encounter during puberty in order to turn them into designer freaks. Perhaps family law can be enhanced - a parent might be able to act under color of law to deny custodial rights to an ex (or not even an ex) who insists on \"gender affirmation.\" That awful case in Texas a few years ago when that insane woman forced her son into transgenderism as her ex-husband attempted to stop her must never be repeated.\n\nThis might be controversial to say, but if, for example, a wife finds out that her husband is sexually molesting her child and proceeds to shoot him dead, there's a pretty broad consensus that she shouldn't be punished for it. She's a hero for doing that, many would say. And - not at all to minimize the monstrosity that is pedophilia - its victims don't necessarily receive a death sentence. They may - and usually do - have a long road to mental and emotional recovery, but it's possible to recover.\n\nHow do you recover from being sterilized and mutilated? And how is \"transing\" a kid not an abuse worse than sexually molesting him or her?\n\nWe'll let that hang for a while.\n\nIn states where Republicans dominate the legislature and the governor's mansion, the bills on transgender surgeries, locker rooms, girls' sports, and even pronouns generally speaking are all passing or have passed. That's good, and it's a process that ought to continue to completion.\n\nBut we should go further. Ruinous liability should be imposed on those who profit from this outrage. There should be implications in family law for those adults who abuse their responsibility and lead children down this satanic and ruinous path. And resources should be invested in educating the public about just how much damage this disastrous fad is causing.\n\nBecause, in a decade, when the full scope is known, the true cost will reveal itself. Preparations ought to be made now.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit... Read More\n\nIt's been a busy few weeks for Bernie Sanders, traveling...

Mr. Chairman, you have also misgendered me. Therefore, I never felt there was any avenue I could turn to for safety and feel protected against the discrimination and toxicity of our council culture.\"\n\nThat Nguyen felt compelled to make such a dramatic announcement in a city that awarded just over a third of its votes in November to Donald Trump, biennially sends to Congress one of its more liberal members in Jim McGovern, and features a city council comprised of politicians almost exclusively left-of-center tells us one of two things. Either a) transphobia runs deeper than even the most cynical among us ever grasped, or b) some people compulsively need to play the victim even when the local community throws parades and flies flags in their honor.\n\n\"For the record, I will not be taking on the responsibility of proving my experience of transphobia and the discrimination and toxicity of council culture,\" the city councilor explained. \"My experience is enough. I understand the amount of hate I have been and will be getting for speaking up.\"\n\nOr plaudits for \"courage\" and \"bravery\" in the face of the transphobes of ... urban Massachusetts ?\n\nIt all recalls the Little Britain character Daffyd Thomas, \" the only gay in the village \" - and not just because of non sequitur victimhood. Like Daffyd, Thu says \"they\" cannot go to work because of \"their\" sexuality and raises all sorts of issues ancillary to what goes on in the surrounding \"village.\"\n\nIn the keffiyeh-wearing city councilor's case, this has included advancing legislation mandating that crisis pregnancy centers refer clients to abortion clinics. Grievances expressed Tuesday included the intransigence toward an older Israel-Hamas \"cease-fire resolution\" (\"Let us not prioritize potholes and snowplowing over Palestinian lives,\" Nguyen had earlier commented) and a sunsetting of remote participation in public meetings by elected officials, which prompted the declaration: \"COVID is not over.\"\n\nCandy Mero-Carlson, one of the three city councilors called out for not using \"them\" in reference to Nguyen, noted \"their\" attendance record ranking lower than any other councilor (despite the advantages possessed by plural beings) prior to the announced hiatus and \"apparent determination to prioritize political agendas each week over the pressing work we are elected to do.\"\n\nIn a working-class city of 210,000, obsessing over ideological abstractions, often of a national bent, when such concerns as trash collection, schools, dangerous people in the public library, and public safety require the attention of councilors, strikes locals as more bizarre than a singular person's demand that others use the third person plural in reference to \"they/them.\"\n\nDenizens of Worcester, which hosts a gay bar and a lesbian bar, encounter a preponderance of the 72 genders and show a penchant for using pronouns beyond he and she.

      "text": "Trans Individuals Seek Euthanasia After 'Gender-Affirming Care' Transgender-identified adults are swimming in a sea of death.\n\nW hile most progressives insist that the reason that more than 80 percent of self-identified transgender adults have contemplated taking their own lives and 42 percent of them have attempted suicide is due to the stigma and discrimination they have historically faced, the reality is far more complex.\n\nThe truth is that transgender individuals are troubled. They suffer from high rates of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.\n\nAt the same time, we are told that the reason for the psychological distress and suicidal ideation within the transgender community is because of people's inability to \"access gender-affirming healthcare.\" ( VIDEO: Parents Are Being Locked Out of Their Kids' Medical Records )\n\nHowever, there are several studies that indicate that the prevalence of suicide attempts is actually elevated among those transgender individuals who are open about their transgender identity and have pursued surgery and a long list of pharmaceutical interventions in their attempt to change their gender. It is difficult not to conclude that the increasing public acceptance of, and encouragement for, \"gender-affirming\" medical treatment may actually be contributing to the escalating suicide rates within the transgender community.\n\nAnd although the Boston researchers attempted to explain away their discouraging data by pointing to the \"stressors associated with the transition process, such as disclosure, financial costs, or encountering discrimination within the healthcare settings, [that] might increase the risk for SI [suicidal ideation],\" the truth is that there are a growing number of self-identified transgender individuals who regret their decision to transition through surgical or medical interventions. An increasing number are choosing to seek out assistance in ending their lives.\n\nThe news last month of a 35-year-old male-to-female transgender-identified individual in Canada who requested assistance in dying through Canada's assisted suicide program because of his unbearable suffering illustrates the pain - both psychological and physiological - endured by many of those who have chosen to engage in surgical transition.\n\nHe claimed that the vaginoplasty he experienced in 2009 (which involved inverting the male organ into a neo-vagina) caused \"constant pressure, pain and discomfort now, many years after the original surgery.\" He requested assisted suicide for the \"pain/anxiety related to the neo-vagina for gender affirmation.\" Canada's assisted suicide program is available to adults who have a serious and incurable disease or disability and are in an advanced state of irreversible decline. But the Canadian's request was denied because he was told that \"other treatments could solve her problem.\" He was prescribed a \"numbing cream\" for the pain. Claiming that nothing has ended the pain he has been suffering, the Canadian told reporters for the Daily Mail that the \"doctors are more interested in finding out what pronouns she uses than easing her pain.\"\n\nCanada may be reluctant to provide access to assisted suicide for self-identified transgender individuals who are suffering because of the reluctance to admit that there are indeed failures and regrets for many following surgical transitioning. But Belgium does not seem to share such concerns. In fact, a 2016 article published in the Journal of Psychiatry by academic researchers from the Ghent University Hospital of Belgium actually appears to encourage euthanasia for those suffering after their surgical procedures. Acknowledging that \"a small percentage show regret after their surgical treatment, the Belgian researchers concluded:\n\nAs in all patients presenting with constant and unbearable suffering, the possibility of applying euthanasia should be discussed in an open way. Persons with gender dysphoria should not be treated differently in this regard. This could prevent them from committing suicide, which has a more negative impact on surviving relatives compared to euthanasia.\n\nFailing to appreciate the irony of promoting euthanasia as a way of preventing suicide for self-identified transgender individuals, the Belgian researchers provide a case study of a 62-year-old male-to-female individual who requested euthanasia after 11 surgical operations failed to end the constant neo-vaginal pain and blood loss he continued to experience. During his life, he had several intimate relationships, none of which were satisfactory because of these problems. The researchers concluded that his \"demand for euthanasia\" was \"authentic and well considered.\" His general practitioner agreed to act as one of three evaluators, and the other two physicians supported his wish for euthanasia.\n\nIt is difficult to predict whether Canada will eventually allow assisted suicide for the intractable pain and suffering that many post-op transgendered individuals experience. It is difficult to admit that \"gender-affirming care\" is causing such pain. But, it is likely that as these surgical procedures increase, the euthanasia industry in Belgium will become the suicide destination for those who regret the choice to change their gender.\n\nAnne Hendershott is a professor of sociology and director of the Veritas Center at the Franciscan University of Steubenville and author of The Politics of Envy (Crisis Publications).\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "The Teen Trans Craze The truth is now out there.\n\nI n 2019, when I began writing Irreversible Damage , the transgender craze quietly ravaging teenage girls for nearly a decade burst into an uncontrolled, destructive burn.\n\nThe previous year, a public health researcher then at Brown University, Dr. Lisa Littman, had stuck her neck out. In an academic paper, she hypothesized that the sudden spike in transgender identification among teen girls was the result not of typical gender dysphoria (severe discomfort in one's biological sex, normally beginning in early childhood) but of social contagion. Trans identification, Littman argued, had become the newest vector by which teenage girls experiencing some very real emotional difficulties talked themselves into illness and coaxed each other to self-harm. Analogous to eating disorders, transgender identification had become a maladaptive coping mechanism for untold thousands of anxious and depressed teen girls.\n\nSubscri\n\nWithin academic circles, Littman's study caused an uproar. Although it would eventually find corroboration in other academic papers, fierce opposition came from activists who can be counted on to blow their tops. Littman was fired from a job she loved. But apart from some reporting on the controversy, the media spent little effort investigating her theory. Families continued to suffer, having no idea that their daughters' sudden trans identification was likely part of a teen girl contagion racing across the Western world.\n\nIn 2019, no one knew how pervasive the phenomenon of teen trans-identification really was. And only the parents whose daughters had fallen into this well had any clue that schools, adolescent therapists, social media influencers, and even doctors were encouraging and facilitating social and medical transition among teen girls. Few knew how easily a teen girl could obtain irreversible hormone treatments and surgeries without a psychiatric diagnosis or her parents' permission. Covered by many university plans, the hormones were dirt cheap, the surgeries readily available, and the social push to undergo them: relentless.\n\nBut the epidemic was real: Between 2016 and 2017, the number of gender surgeries among biological females in the U.S. quadrupled. In 2019 alone, double mastectomies for \"gender dysphoria\" rose 15 percent, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Right now, GoFundMe alone hosts tens of thousands of fundraisers for \"top surgery\" so that young women can afford to remove healthy breasts. By every account of physicians and plastic surgeons, the majority of those requesting these surgeries were adolescent girls.\n\nWith incessant lies, activists had succeeded in stirring a fog around the medical and therapeutic issues related to the trans teen trend. Activists had created new language, \"gender-affirming care\" and \"gender-affirming surgery,\" as if girls were being treated only with mild interventions that simply supported young women in who they really were. In fact, the treatments were grisly, risky, dangerous, and based on the flimsiest evidence of any mental health benefits. The shifting goals of the treatments and the lies on which they were based often made them seem more like witchcraft. Only the doctors pressing them on teens weren't crackpots on the margins of society but graduates of our prestigious med schools. They advertised to youth on TikTok, they attacked other doctors on Twitter, they evinced the reckless bravado of gangsters.\n\nSo many of the experts who urged their daughters toward transition were, at best, reckless.\n\nTo uncover their corruption, I needed to dispel a slew of myths: No, this wasn't primarily happening to girls from troubled families. Neither divorce nor childhood trauma nor parent homophobia had created this epidemic. This was happening to liberal, two-parent families. It captivated the brightest daughters of highly educated parents - people of means who sprung for calculus tutors and tennis lessons. This was happening to girls - in other words - just like yours.\n\nAnd I needed parents to know that so many of the experts who urged their daughters toward transition were, at best, reckless. At worst, they were inebriates, drunk on a gender ideology until they could hardly recall that old Hippocratic Oath. Saints of Social Justice, conquistadors on behalf of a popular and celebrated cause, they had all but forgotten their patients. When I asked gender surgeons how they could justify removing the breasts of a girl who said she was \"gender fluid\" - i.e., someone whose gender pendulum was in mid-swing - they demurred as if I just wasn't getting it.\n\nBut I was getting it, and soon, so were the parents.\n\nSix months after I published Irreversible Damage in June of 2020, the High Court of Justice in England heard the testimony of doctors I had interviewed in my book and declared that a young woman, Keira Bell, had been subject to a hasty, reckless medical transition she began at age 16 with grossly inadequate medical oversight. More than 50 bills have been proposed in state legislatures to curtail or end medical transition for minors. For the first time in a decade, an actual debate is occurring over the appropriateness and salubriousness of gender treatments for minors. For the first time, parents whose daughter suddenly decides she is \"trans\" are no longer blindsided by the epiphany. Schools who encourage minors to adopt a new name and gender identity and actively conceal that identity from parents are now on notice that the days of such schoolwide conspiracies to deceive caring parents are numbered.\n\nThe attempts to censor my book have been legion. I fought every one - in the pages of the Wall Street Journal , in Quillette , on Tucker Carlson Tonight , and on Twitter. I continue to receive documents charting the ways Big Tech censors my work. Pity for them, the truth is already out there.\n\nAbigail Shrier is a writer living in Los Angeles and author of Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters .\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Chasing Gender Euphoria Olohan's new book Detrans offers a glimpse into true transgender liberation.\n\nD etra ns: True Stories of Escaping the Gender Identity Cult By Mary Margaret Olohan (Regnery, 288 pages, $33)\n\nThe transgender movement is, at its core, a quest for happiness. Daily Signal senior reporter Mary Margaret Olohan begins her new book, Detrans: True Stories of Escaping the Gender Identity Cult , by observing that every trans-identifying individual felt the \"same driving force: the desperate desire to know who you are and to be happy.\"\n\nThroughout Detrans , Olohan weaves together the stories of five detransitioners - individuals who once identified as transgender, underwent social and/or medical transitions to resemble the opposite sex, came to regret the decisions, and reverted to presenting in accord with their biological sex. Following their detransitions, these individuals, four of whom are women, have started to speak out against the abuse they endured at the hands of doctors, therapists, and school employees.\n\nThe women in Detrans all began to question their identities because being feminine seemed uncomfortable, unattainable, or downright terrifying. Battling intense gender dysphoria in conjunction with - and, perhaps, in response to - various mental illnesses and sexual traumas, all four individuals identified what seemed to be a solution: stop being a girl.\n\nWracked with dysphoria, the girls searched for the elusive \"gender euphoria\" heralded by transgender activists. If their bodies finally aligned with their perceived gender identities, they would be free. For these teenagers, it started with changing their pronouns and names. Shortly after, doctors, therapists, and activists - though the line that separates them is increasingly blurred - foisted testosterone prescriptions upon them. In the blink of an eye, these teenage girls had scars in place of breasts. Their metamorphosis was supposedly complete, but gender euphoria - the \"joy caused when one's gendered experience aligns with their gender identity, rather than with the gender they were assigned at birth\" - remained elusive.\n\n\"As she moved forward with her transition and continued taking testosterone, Prisha noticed that she was still suicidal and struggling with her mental health,\" Olohan writes. \"But she attributed that to the fact that she hadn't had top surgery yet, or that she hadn't been on hormones long enough, or that she hadn't had a hysterectomy yet. 'I was like, I have to keep chasing, and chasing, and chasing, and then I'll be happy and then I'll be aligned, and then I'll be in the right body,' she said.\"\n\nPrisha underwent a double mastectomy, referred to as \"top surgery\" by the trans community, and immediately experienced what she called \"surgery euphoria.\" Severely anorexic throughout her medical transition, Prisha was thrilled that the procedure had lowered her weight by eight pounds. Olohan notes:\n\nPrisha had also tried to convince her team to let her get a liposuction. But they had refused, Prisha told me, claiming that Prisha wasn't able to consent to this type of surgery because of her anorexia. Her desire for liposuction was attached to her body dysmorphia and eating disorder.\n\nNo such caution was exercised with her gender dysmorphia-generated desire to remove her breasts.\n\nNevertheless, Prisha was happy with the operation's results - for a while, at least. Soon, she found herself in familiar territory. The next step of transitioning always beckoned, promising the euphoria that always seemed just out of reach. (RELATED: The Trans Reckoning Is Not Yet Here - But It's Coming Soon )\n\nPrisha was far from alone. Every person Olohan interviewed expressed a similar unfulfilled hope that the next step could deliver the desired relief. The beginnings of the transition had been rocky, though reversible. But asking parents and peers to use different pronouns or a new nickname soon spiraled into puberty blockers and opposite-sex hormones, then irreversible surgeries. Giving up on the pursuit of gender euphoria and becoming \"detrans\" meant admitting to an error, facing the scrutiny of family and friends, and bearing the scars of medical transition throughout the rest of life.\n\nOver time, Prisha, Chloe, Luka, and Helena realized that their social and medical transitions had not alleviated their persistent unhappiness. And though a coterie of concerned professionals had coaxed them along the path to transition, no one was willing to help them reverse course.\n\nThe unhealed wounds from her mastectomy gave Chloe pause, and she realized at the age of 15 that she wanted to be a mother. Dealing with painful complications from testosterone injections, Luka weaned herself off of the hormone. Helena's girlfriend created a timeline of their photos together throughout the years. Seeing her face and body change - \"'from so young, hopeful, and most of all, recognizable, to weary, deadpan, and foreign,'\" she told Olohan - filled Helena with regret.\n\nPrisha's first revelation came through therapy. As she began resolving trauma, Olohan writes, \"She found the 'healing' that she had so desperately sought through transition.\" If transitioning was hard, detransitioning proved even harder. Olohan explains:\n\nThough [Prisha] initially 'medically detransitioned' by stopping her testosterone injections ... she continued to live, act, and dress like a man for a while. She also had a bit of a beard at this point, and she wasn't shaving. 'I was too deep in the shame and the lie,' she said. 'I was like, well, I've uprooted my entire life and everybody else's for this. I have to live with it.\n\nPrisha began dating a man who had a three-year-old daughter. She attributes her social detransition to the girl. \"Despite all that stuff I said about living as a man and literally having a beard, she started to call me 'Mommy,'\" Prisha told Olohan. \"She looked at me and she said it with her arms extended towards me ... And then I was like, 'That's it. I know exactly what I want. Anything is worth getting that which I have just had a taste of.\" Prisha fully detransitioned. Earlier this week, she gave birth to a child of her own.\n\nDetrans offers a powerful, step-by-step account of what transgender liberation theory actually looks like in practice. It's a hard and haunting - but necessary - book to read. Olohan's compassionate approach gives a voice to those who the LGBTQ community would rather ignore: the individuals who questioned the movement's veracity as their lives fell apart under its influence.\n\nMary Frances Myler is a contributing editor at The American Spectator .
