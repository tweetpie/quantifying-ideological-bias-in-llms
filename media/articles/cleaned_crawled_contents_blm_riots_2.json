(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nThere were only two Republicans on the presidential debate stage Wednesday, as former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis met for the highest-stake faceoff yet just five days before the nominating process formally starts with Iowa's caucuses.\n\nHaley and DeSantis' spirited debate came in the shadow of a live town hall held by the man who is dominating the primary contest, Donald Trump . The former president, of course, has stayed away from all five debates, holding a rival town hall Wednesday on Fox News. The one Republican candidate whose entire campaign has been based around stopping Trump, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , suspended his campaign just hours before the debate.\n\nChristie wasn't scheduled to be on the stage anyway as the field was whittled down to the only two candidates who are battling for a very distant second to Trump.\n\nHere are takeaways from the event.\n\nEver since debates began in August, Trump's absence has created a surreal scene of politicians badly trailing in the polls talking about what they'll do when they win the presidency. On Wednesday, at least, it was clear that the remaining contenders in the Republican primary are fighting for second place.\n\nThe opening question was why each of the two candidates thought they were the best option for voters who didn't want to support Trump. That set the stakes squarely about second place and the candidates snapped to it.\n\nHaley opened the debate by touting a new website to track DeSantis' \"lies.\"\n\nDeSantis countered, \"We don't need another mealy-mouthed politician who just tells you what she thinks you want to hear, just so she can get into office and do her donors' bidding.\"\n\nThe sharpest exchange came after Haley continued to needle DeSantis on how he ran his campaign, saying it showed he couldn't be trusted to run the country if he could spend $150 million and have so much internal chaos and stagnant polling. When the Florida governor tried to interrupt her, Haley said, \"I think I hit a nerve.\"\n\nDeSantis dismissed Haley's criticism as \"process stuff\" that voters don't care about and bragged about his conservative record in Florida while jabbing her for failing to pass school choice as governor.\n\nIt went on and on like that, with the two candidates constantly sniping at each other. They made swipes at Trump, but spent the overwhelming amount of time on the person standing at the podium next to them.\n\nThe political rationale is clear - Trump is 77 years old and faces four separate sets of criminal charges plus a bid to disqualify him from being president that is currently at the U.S. Supreme Court. Anything can happen, and if it does you'd rather be the runner-up than in third or lower. Plus, maybe Trump reaches down and picks his running mate from the top of the also-rans.\n\nTrump's campaign has already quipped that the debates are actually vice presidential debates and, during his Fox News town hall, suggested he already knew who his pick would be.\n\nAs has been the case, Wednesday's debate didn't seem likely to change the overall trajectory of the race, with Trump dominating. But at least there were some stakes.\n\nBy staying physically offstage, Trump has largely avoided being attacked in the debates. It's tricky to criticize a man beloved by most Republican voters, and for the most part, the contenders haven't bothered. But that's been slowly changing, and it continued to Wednesday.\n\nDeSantis opened with what's become his standard campaign sound bite, claiming that Trump is only interested in \"his issues\" and DeSantis cares about \"your issues.\" Haley quickly criticized the former president for piling onto the federal deficit, not being strong enough against China and failing to end illegal immigration.\n\nThe main mission for both candidates was to vault into second. But there are increasing signs that both know that, if they make it there, they have to have an argument for why Republican voters should back them and not their former president.\n\nHaley and DeSantis have both led conservative southeastern states and become emblems of right-of-center governance. However, the debate exposed a fundamental philosophical difference between them over the role of government.\n\nThe two were asked whether it was appropriate for government to try to bend corporations to its social stances, as DeSantis has tried to do in Florida by punishing Disney for opposing one of his measures to limit references to homosexuality in schools.\n\nAbsolutely, DeSantis said. \"The proper role of government, if it means anything, is to protect our kids and I've protected our kids.\"\n\nHaley gave a more traditional, small-government Republican answer. \"Government was intended to secure the freedoms of the people,\" she said. \"We don't need government fighting against our private industries.\"\n\nIt's been a longstanding bone of contention between the two - when DeSantis first went after Disney, Haley invited them to look at relocating to South Carolina. \"We need to stand up for the people, and not bow down to woke corporations,\" DeSantis said. \"We know Nikki Haley will cave to the woke mob every time.\"\n\nHaley contended that DeSantis had a warm relationship with Disney until the fight over the school regulations and that it showed that he was willing to use government to pursue personal vendettas.\n\nMany of Trump's rivals, including some of his fellow Republicans and President Joe Biden , have warned that he is surrounded by chaos and would be ineffective in the presidency at best - and a threat to democracy at worst. During his appearance at a Fox News town hall that aired at the same time as the debate, Trump seemed to downplay such concerns.\n\nHe backed away from his comments, also delivered on Fox last month, that he wouldn't be a dictator \"except for day one.\" On Wednesday, he said he's \"not going to be a dictator.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to have time for retribution,\" he said despite having repeatedly framed his campaign as a vehicle of retribution against his perceived political enemies. \"There won't be retribution. There'll be success.\"\n\nWhen asked if political violence is ever acceptable, Trump, who helped spark an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, said \"of course\" such activity is never acceptable. That's despite predicting \"bedlam\" just a day earlier if criminal cases against him succeed.\n\nTrump has spent the past several weeks standing by his comments about retribution or being a dictator, remarks that are extraordinary for any candidate for the presidency. The question now is whether his tone on Wednesday reflects a shift days ahead of an election or whether he will return to his hardline rhetoric that has echoed authoritarian leaders.\n\nWithout other candidates vying for attention on stage, voters got to see the contrasts between the two candidates. The biggest one may have been their style - Haley repeatedly talked about the importance of bringing people together while DeSantis was often scornful of reaching out to the other side.\n\nPart of Haley's pitch to the Republican electorate is that she could unite the warring sides of the country. On Wednesday, she bemoaned politicians who keep telling people who's \"wrong\" as opposed to uniting the public. \"What a leader does is they bring out the best in people,\" she said.\n\nShe was throwing a jab at Trump, but might have also aimed for DeSantis, a renowned partisan brawler who touts how he's defeated the Democratic Party and liberal interest groups as governor. The contrast was sharpest at the end of the debate, when the subject turned to crime and DeSantis bemoaned the \"BLM riots\" - a reference to \"Black Lives Matter\" - after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in 2020 and Trump's response.\n\n\"He sat in the White House and tweeted 'law and order,' but he did nothing to ensure law and order,\" DeSantis said, noting he mobilized the Florida National Guard and vowing that he'd keep Americans safe if president during similar unrest. He then dinged Haley for sending out a consolatory tweet about Floyd's death.\n\nDeSantis called the tweet \"virtue signaling,\" saying Haley \"was trying to impress people who are never going to like us.\"\n\nHaley bristled. She noted that South Carolina saw two horrible incidents during her tenure - the shooting of an unarmed Black man, Walter Scott, by a white police officer and the 2015 murder of nine Black people by a white supremacist at a historically Black Charleston church. After the church shooting, Haley removed the Confederate flag from the state capitol.\n\n\"We came together as a state in prayer and we had no riots,\" Haley said. \"We didn't need the national guard, because a leader knows how to bring out the best in people.\"\n\nThe line may get her votes, but in a Republican Party that's dominated by Trump's \"us versus them\" rhetoric, it's not clear whether it can get her enough to win the nomination.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Jill Colvin in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Republicans Are Insane to Make Heroes Out of Jan. 6 Rioters\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nCan't we all at least agree that the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was bad? Apparently not.\n\nThis week, leading voices on the American right began accelerating their attempts to reframe the Capitol riot as a heroic act , rather than a violent attempt to stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nOn one hand, this is not surprising. Republicans who initially condemned Donald Trump and the rioters in the immediate aftermath of Jan. 6 almost immediately began evolving on the issue . But the sentencing of Enrique Tarrio (the former leader of the Proud Boys) to 22 years in prison sparked renewed spasms of outrage this week. Consider a few examples.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSarah Palin, the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, said that prison sentences for Capitol rioters \" makes the good guy think, what's the use of being a good guy ?\" (That's right. Palin sees rioters as the \"good guys,\" which is all you need to know about the level of tribalism in our politics.)\n\nFormer Arizona Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake took the opportunity to revisit an old trope , calling it a \" staged riot ,\" and saying that \"many of the people were encouraged to go in by FBI informants.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suggested that, as president, he would pardon rioters who were handed \" excessive sentences .\" Like others on the right, DeSantis went out of his way to argue that \"a lot of people with the BLM riots... didn't get prosecuted at all.\"\n\nHere, DeSantis seems to be suggesting a few things. First, there is the notion that two wrongs make a right. Second, there is the assumption that BLM violence in the wake of the George Floyd murder (which is certainly to be condemned and punished) was perfectly analogous to sacking the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAnd third, there is the implication that America now has a two-tiered justice system, where people on the right are being targeted and receiving \" excessive \" sentences (never mind the fact that Tarrio's sentence was handed down by a Trump-appointed judge -or that sentences handed down were below what the government was seeking ).\n\nNevertheless, this is the narrative being pushed by DeSantis. And he's not alone. Likewise, presidential candidate and tech bro Vivek Ramaswamy lamented that \"Antifa and BLM rioters roam free while peaceful Jan. 6 protesters are imprisoned without bail.\" As such, Ramaswamy pledged to pardon \"all peaceful, nonviolent Jan. 6 protesters who were denied their constitutional due process rights.\"\n\nI'm not sure what Ramaswamy means regarding being denied due process. After all, Proud Boy leaders and members were sentenced this week after being convicted in a court of law. But his pledge to pardon \"nonviolent\" protesters could presumably apply to ex-Proud Boys leader Tarrio, who-like Oklahoma bombing conspirator Terry Nichols or cult leader Charles Manson-wasn't physically present at the riot.\n\nRegardless of the sentencing, it seems likely that the fate of the Capitol rioters will ultimately be determined based on which party wins next year's presidential election. So while their prosecution wasn't politically motivated, their pardoning most certainly would be.\n\nThis is an open secret that is already being used to encourage MAGA voters to get-out-the-vote.\n\nFor example, Scott Adams, the right-wing creator of the \"Dilbert\" comic strip, tweeted this week that \"2024 isn't a presidential election. It's a pardon hearing for J6. Treat it that way.\" It's a message that the rioters, themselves, have embraced. \"Oh, I know [Trump will] pardon us,\" Joe Biggs, a Proud Boys member who was sentenced to 17 years in prison, declared recently . \"I believe that with all my heart.\"\n\nBut 2024 won't just be about pardoning the Jan. 6 rioters; the 2024 election may very well impact whether Donald Trump is in a position to pardon himself .\n\nWith stakes so high, at least one prominent Republican is warning that a Trump loss could spark violence.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee declared this week that \"People in power use their police agencies to arrest their opponents for made-up crimes in an attempt to discredit them bankrupt and imprison them, exile them, are all of the above. And if you're not paying attention, you may not realize that Joe Biden is using exactly those tactics to make sure that Donald Trump is not his opponent in 2024.\"\n\n\"If these tactics end up working to keep Trump from winning or even running in 2024,\" Huckabee continued , \"it is going to be the last American election that will be decided by ballots rather than bullets.\" (Regarding Huckabee's dangerous rhetoric, it's unclear where the warning of violence stops and the inciting of violence begins.)\n\nKeep in mind, these comments are not being tossed out by nobodies. While it might be easy to dismiss Scott Adams as a gadfly or a rabble rouser, the others are past and current Republican candidates and elected officials. What is more, their statements are consistent with statements espoused by Donald Trump , the former president who is the odds-on-favorite to be the Republican nominee again in 2024.\n\nI repeat myself, but Republicans' evolving position regarding the Capitol riot isn't a new phenomenon. This is despite the fact that the general consensus immediately after the riot among Republicans was that it was a tragic and regrettable day-and that Trump bore much of the responsibility for the events that transpired.\n\nIn the initial aftermath, the riot was so demonstrably nefarious that the best way to avoid blame was to claim that the rioters were actually leftists running a false-flag operation.\n\nIt wasn't long, though, before Republicans began downplaying the violence that occurred that day . And now, we are told that the rioters were \"good guys,\" which would seem to suggest that Jan 6. was something akin to the Boston Tea Party.\n\nQuite the contrary. No matter how they try to spin it, Jan. 6 is a date that will forever live in infamy. At least, for the truly good guys who wear the white hats, it is.\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "How Many Republicans Does It Take to Tell a Crime From a Coup?\n\nThe clouds of teargas hadn't even cleared the battle-scarred hallways of the United States Capitol Complex before Republicans, led by House Minority \"Leader\" Kevin McCarthy , set about writing an alternate history of the insurrection their president and party had gleefully incited.\n\nAn organized conservative disinformation campaign turned violent rioters into peaceful \"tourists.\" Republican lawmakers refused to even speak to D.C. Police Officer Michael Fanone and other officers seriously wounded by the Trumpist mob. McCarthy, in an effort to delay and derail any government effort to uncover the truth, argued that any Jan. 6 Commission should also investigate last summer's Black Lives Matter protests . Even the folks at Fox News slammed that half-baked idea .\n\nOn Tuesday, the bipartisan Jan. 6 Select Committee impaneled by Speaker Nancy Pelosi began their critical fact-finding after rejecting the dead weight of McCarthy's self-selected obstructionists. For Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of only two Republicans on the commission, McCarthy's BLM comparison was simply too much to bear.\n\n\"Some have concocted a counter-narrative to discredit this process on the grounds that we didn't launch a similar investigation into the urban riots and looting last summer,\" Kinzinger said during an emotional opening statement. \"There is a difference between breaking the law and rejecting the rule of law, between a crime-even grave crimes-and a coup.\"\n\nKinzinger's moral clarity will disappoint his Republican colleagues, many of whom now see tying protests and riots in Portland and other cities to the Capitol insurrection as their last means of minimizing their own complicity in a direct attack on American government.\n\nWhen far-right lawmakers like McCarthy, Louie Gohmert, Matt Gaetz, and others compare January 6 to \"BLM riots,\" they're hoping to excite two thoughts in their listeners' minds: first that these two events are equivalent and then that Democrats didn't think it was a national emergency when 'their side' did it.\n\nNo one denies that the United States faced widespread and often deeply troubling protests during the summer of 2020. Between May and August, the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project recorded over 10,500 distinct demonstrations touching nearly every major community in America. But what is critical to add-and what Republicans hope to obscure by comparing these protests to the Capitol riot-is that fully 93 percent of last summer's demonstrations were peaceful acts of protected speech. The January 6 insurrection was decidedly not.\n\nFaced with largely peaceful protests, the GOP fear machine jumped into overdrive. Borrowing from left-wing organizer and conservative bogeyman Saul Alinsky, Republicans quickly publicized individual, isolated instances of violence as being representative of the entire Black Lives Matter movement. It was under that collective delusion that Trump encouraged a massively expensive, all-out police response that briefly turned Washington, D.C. into Fallujah.\n\nThis polarize-and-publicize approach helped solidify the image of BLM as violent and anti-American in conservative minds, even as it divorced Republicans from reality. In one particularly ridiculous instance, the Trump administration used a single instance of looting in Manhattan to declare all of New York City an \" anarchist jurisdiction .\"\n\nThe American people would need to drop all sense of nuance, context, and proportion to believe that myth-and that's exactly what the GOP is hoping will happen.\n\nAmong the Republicans whining that the Jan, 6 rioters have been treated unfairly is Senator Rand Paul, who joined Gohmert's unhinged calls for the Capitol insurrectionists to be released from jail. Paul, who has repeatedly and incorrectly claimed the Capitol mob was \"non-violent,\" is also a vocal supporter of McCarthy's 'BLM Commission' publicity stunt.\n\nRepublicans are no strangers to the power of false equivalencies, but their latest effort to avoid accountability finally pushed Kinzinger to an emotional breaking point. Kinzinger has seen the difference between protest and insurrection up close.\n\n\"I was called on to serve during the summer riots as an Air National Guardsman. I condemned those riots and the destruction of property that resulted,\" Kinzinger said. \"But not once did I ever feel that the future of self-government was threatened like I did on January 6th.\"\n\nWhen Kinzinger condemns opportunistic GOP attempts to compare BLM to the violent January 6 insurrectionists who shattered U.S. Capitol Police Sergeant Aquilino Gonell's foot with a stolen speaker, he is also hoping to head off a wave of performative \"BLM Commissions\" that Republican leaders hope to establish in red state legislatures across the country. Imagine a Jan. 6 Commission where every member is Jim Jordan. That's a good idea of the fireworks Republicans would hope to generate from an all-GOP \"investigation\" into Black Americans' political activism.\n\nThe GOP's desperate attempt to change the subject has shifted wildly before finally settling on BLM as a reliable villain. Back in May, Republicans wanted to launch a similar \"investigation\" into a ntifa's role in the Capitol attack (it had none). Then de facto GOP spokesman Tucker Carlson accused the FBI of masterminding the attack . Turning their fire on Black Americans may be all Republicans have left after facing a stinging round of denunciations from the Capitol police officers they have publicly abandoned.\n\nSergeant Gonell called the January 6 insurrection a \"treasonous act,\" and expressed frustration that Republican lawmakers lined up to support officers when they were putting down BLM protests in Washington, D.C. last summer, but disappeared when the perpetrators of violence were fellow Republicans. \"It was not antifa, it was not Black Lives Matter, it was not the FBI,\" he said of the Capitol insurrectionists. \"All of them were saying, 'Trump sent us!'\"\n\nKinzinger and the only other Republican on the commission, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, both seem acutely aware that the GOP's war on reality is already causing a seriously corrosive effect on our institutions of self-government. Cheney, no friend of the Black Lives Matter movement, nevertheless refused to join McCarthy and the Trumpists in their efforts to turn this investigation into yet another means to criminalize Black Americans.\n\nKinzinger and Cheney have demonstrated admirable patriotism in not only seeking the truth about the January 6 insurrection but in rejecting the multiple GOP attempts to dodge blame by smearing Black Lives Matter and leftist organizations. Their commitment to the truth is reassuring, but Congress will need more than Cheney and Kinzinger if it intends to prevent the GOP from wreaking havoc on the very idea of facts and truth.\n\nGot a tip?

And Fox seemed to want to be at war with its viewers and people who have opinions and voices like me.[It] became a less hospitable place.\"\n\nNoting that Murdoch's son Lachlan has been tapped to take over the media empire, Schlapp wondered if the new chairman would \"recapture the spirit of the early years of Fox\" or if the network is \"going to continue down the 'woke' road.\" In the embattled right-wing activist's telling, this wokeness included firing primetime host Tucker Carlson and \"getting rid of conservative voices\" like himself.\n\nUnsaid in Schlapp's mini-rant, though, was the real reason why he is no longer booked on Fox News.\n\nThe chief organizer of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) has been relegated to Newsmax and other fringe right-wing media after he was accused in January of \"aggressively fondling\" the crotch of former Herschel Walker staffer Carlton Huffman . Calling Schlapp a \"sexual predator,\" Huffman later sued the conservative icon over his \"repeated unsolicited and undesired advances,\" as well as his attempts to \"impugn\" Huffman's character.\n\nWhile Schlapp has vehemently denied the GOP operative's accusation, The Daily Beast reported last month that the CPAC chief made an offer to settle with Huffman, only to be rebuffed. Furthermore, the ACU has been informed about additional allegations of sexual misconduct against Schlapp, prompting a senior board member to resign and call for an investigation into the incidents. On top of that, other officials have also quit over concerns that Schlapp used the group to fund his sexual assault lawsuit.\n\nFollowing the allegations, Schlapp has essentially been barred from Fox News airwaves. Neither he nor his wife Mercedes , a former Fox News contributor and Trump administration official, have appeared on the network since January. Besides shutting out the Schlapps , Fox News all but ignored this year's CPAC, despite the symbiotic relationship the confab enjoyed with the right-wing network in years past.\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "On anniversary of Capitol riot, Washington - and America - are as divided as ever\n\nPartisanship overshadows sombre commemorations as insurrection becomes another wedge in a split nation\n\nThey thought it couldn't happen here. But so did many other nations before America.\n\nWalking the halls of the snowbound US Capitol on Thursday afternoon, a year to the hour since it was breached by a fascist impulse, it was hard to imagine the mob running riot - pummeling police, flaunting the Confederate flag and abusing a Black officer with the N-word.\n\nBut yes, it did happen here.\n\nThe cathedral of American democracy was scarcely attended and hauntingly hushed for the anniversary, in part because the coronavirus is rampant in Washington. Walk up a staircase and you might see a solitary reporter fetching coffee. Turn down a marbled corridor and you might spot a lone Capitol police officer - was he among those that fought and bled that day?\n\nRepublicans were particularly hard to find, their absence illustrating the radically different interpretations of what happened on 6 January 2021, or as one headline put it, \"a national day of infamy, half remembered\". It was clear that America could not decide whether this was a political scrap or a national tragedy, a moment for angry polarisation or unified mourning. It did not feel like catharsis.\n\nThe vice-president, Kamala Harris, kicked it off just after 9am by pointing to \"dates that occupy not only a place on our calendars, but a place in our collective memory\", citing 7 December 1941, 11 September 2001 - and 6 January 2021.\n\nBut whereas the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought Americans together to fight the second world war, and the terrorist strikes on New York and Washington conjured rare solidarity, the deadly siege of the Capitol turns out to be just another wedge in the divided states of America.\n\nAnd unlike those previous calamities, the more than 220-year-old Capitol bears few visible scars of the day that windows were smashed, congressional offices ransacked and faeces left on the floor. Without a tangible reminder, it is easier to deny reality or forget. Instead, the scars are psychological and institutional; the bleeding is internal.\n\nHarris was followed by Joe Biden, whose barnstorming speech offered his most vivid critique yet of his predecessor Donald Trump's big lie about the 2020 election and incitement of the mob. It was an I-don't-negotiate-with-terrorists epiphany for the president about the limits of bipartisanship.\n\n\"I did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it either,\" said Biden, unexpectedly at 79 discovering his inner Henry V and previewing his 2024 election campaign. \"I will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.\"\n\nBut it was the details of that day - the sound of gunfire, the narrow escapes, the messages to loved ones - that struck a chord and stuck. They were bulwarks against the attempts to rewrite history and supplant it with a false narrative.\n\nThese details were recalled by senators speaking in the chamber that had been overrun by the rioters such as Jacob Chansley who, wearing a horned headdress and carrying a six-foot spear, scaled the dais and took the seat that Mike Pence had occupied an hour earlier, proclaiming, \"Mike Pence is a fucking traitor\" and writing, \"It's Only A Matter of Time. Justice Is Coming!\"\n\nThere was Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, who had only been in the chamber for 45 minutes, watching the start of the counting of ballots, when an armed police officer in a big flak jacket grabbed him firmly by the collar. \"I'll never forget that grip.\" he said. \"And said to me, 'Senator, we got to get out of here, you're in danger.'\"\n\nSchumer was within 30ft of \"these nasty, racist, bigoted insurrectionists\", he recounted. \"Had someone had a gun, had two of them blocked off the door, who knows what would have happened. I was told later that one of them reportedly said, 'There's the big Jew. Let's get him.' Bigotry against one is bigotry against all.\"\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar also had indelible memories of being evacuated from the chamber. \"I remember the words of one staff member who yelled out, 'Take the boxes. Take the boxes.' She was talking about the mahogany boxes that were filled with the electoral ballots, because we knew they would be destroyed if they were left behind.\"\n\nShe remembered how her staff hid in a closet with only forks to protect themselves, next to the doors where the insurrectionists had invaded. She remembered the cuts on the faces of police officers. And she remembered officer Harry Dunn, who was called the N-word multiple times, looked at his friend as they collapsed in the Rotunda and asked, \"Is this America? Is this America?\"\n\nOver in the House of Representatives, where 20 members had to take cover in the gallery that day, Speaker Nancy Pelosi presided over a moment of silence. Tellingly, there were only two Republicans on the floor: the former vice-president Dick Cheney and his daughter, congresswoman Liz Cheney, dying embers of the party's anti-Trump resistance.\n\nDick Cheney said in a statement that he is \"deeply disappointed at the failure of many members of my party to recognize the grave nature of the January 6 attacks and the ongoing threat to our nation\".\n\nThat failure was manifest in the decision of Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy to stay well away from Washington. Minority whip Steve Scalise's office did have a sign that said, \"Thank you, US Capitol police heroes\", but it opened to reveal a staffer and a TV showing replays of the riot, but no sign of the congressman himself.\n\nTrump had cancelled a press conference but there were two Republicans who could not resist the limelight. In a tiny room (for which they inevitably blamed Pelosi), Trump acolytes Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene spun baseless conspiracy theories about FBI involvement in the deadly attack. Gaetz insisted: \"We did not want the Republican voice to go unheard today.\"\n\nGreene played the all too familiar whataboutism card. Don't forget, she said, that Senator Bernie Sanders thinks the 2016 Democratic primary was stolen from him, and Hillary Clinton thinks the 2016 general election was stolen from her. \"If Democrats cared about riots, they would have cared about the Antifa-BLM riots all over the country in 2020.\"\n\nWhen one reporter challenged Gaetz about Biden's memorable image of a dagger being held at the throat of democracy, the Florida congressman insisted: \"We are here to vindicate our democracy.\"\n\nThat is the twist: the mass delusion behind Trump's big lie is that his followers believe they are saving democracy rather than destroying it. Republicans are imposing voter restriction laws and seeking to put Trump loyalists in charge of running elections. The next assault on the republic is unlikely to be as clumsy or crude as 6 January.\n\nThursday's commemorations ended with a prayer vigil on the US Capitol steps. Two decades ago on 9/11, Democrats and Republicans stood side by side here and sang God Bless America. This time, holding candles and wearing masks as the US marine band played, Democrats again stood and sang God Bless America. This time, there were no Republicans."

      "text": "Greg Abbott Declares Open Season on Protesters in Texas\n\nBob Daemmrich/ZUMA Press\n\nOn Thursday, purportedly on the advice of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott formally pardoned Daniel Perry for his 2020 murder of Garrett Foster at a Black Lives Matter protest in Austin. I say \"purportedly\" because Abbott never waited for the board before passing judgment in the case; he announced a little over a year ago that he was \"working as swiftly as the law allows\" to get Perry out of prison.\n\n\"Texas has one of the strongest 'Stand Your Ground' laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive District Attorney,\" Abbott explained on X at the time . He used that same line verbatim in his statement declaring Perry a free man. This is the twisted nature of what law-and-order means in Texas: It is soft-on-crime to convict someone of murder now.\n\nPerry was driving his vehicle near the state Capitol when he encountered the BLM protesters that night in Austin. He drove into a crowd of demonstrators after honking at them first. He then shot Foster five times through his car window.\n\nPerry claimed self-defense as his justification for killing Foster, who was also armed, and his attorneys argued that Foster had pointed a rifle at him. Witnesses stated that Foster had not raised his gun, however. And the prosecution produced disturbing messages from Perry in which he talked repeatedly about shooting and killing protesters. \"I might go to Dallas to shoot looters,\" he wrote in one text.  In another message, per the Texas Tribune , he mentioned seeing \"blacks ... gathering up in a group.\" and wrote that \"I wonder if they will let my cut the ears off of people who's decided to commit suicide by me.\" He told a friend that \"I might have to kill a few people on my way to work, they are rioting outside my apartment complex.\"\n\nAfter being charged, Perry became a right-wing cause célèbre. Abbott made his initial promise to look into a pardon almost immediately after then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson ran a segment criticizing him for inaction in April of 2023. Members of Perry's defense team did make hay of the fact that one member of the jury had apparently improperly consulted information that was not introduced in court. But conservatives were attracted to the trial for bigger reasons. Like Kyle Rittenhouse, Perry was exalted as a persecuted martyr standing up to progressive \" anarcho-tyranny .\" In his own statement on the pardon, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton placed the shooting in the context of the \"BLM riots [that] terrorized the nation in 2020 .\"\n\nIt's worth reckoning with the ramifications of the self-defense argument here: The right to bear arms is so inviolable that you can carry a gun almost anywhere-but, also, if you see someone carrying a gun at a protest, you can shoot them justifiably. It's hard to have a First Amendment when the Second Amendment looks like that . It doesn't make for much of a Second Amendment either.\n\nBut this is not just about Daniel Perry. Abbott's pardon and its accompanying rhetoric fits into a pattern of sanctioned violence or threatened violence against undesirables. In this case, it was an Air Force veteran protesting police brutality-there is not even a cursory mention in Abbott's statement of Foster, the victim. In January, it was migrants. \"The only thing that we are not doing is we're not shooting people who come across the border,\" Abbott told former NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch, \"because, of course, the Biden administration would charge us with murder.\"\n\nThe question of how to deal with people-and particularly people who are inside cars-who inflict harm on protesters is very much a live issue. Drivers deliberately hitting groups of people with their vehicles is an extremely common thing in the United States; a Boston Globe analysis found that \"Between Floyd's death on May 25, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2021, vehicles drove into protests at least 139 times.\" There were charges in just 65 of those incidents. At least 16 states have recently considered laws to grant immunity to drivers in such circumstances. Last month, ater critics of Israel's bombing campaign in Gaza shut down streets in New York City, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) implored drivers to \"take matters into your own hands to get them out of the way.\" In another text message ahead of an earlier trip to Dallas, Perry wrote to a friend, \"no protestors go near me or my car.\" The message from Abbott and people like him is ominous. Daniel Perry was not the first.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWallace, a 27-year-old Black man, was fatally shot in front of his mother while reportedly experiencing a mental health crisis.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nThousands of protesters made their way through West Philadelphia on Tuesday, marking the second night of unrest after the police killing of 27-year-old Walter Wallace Jr. on Monday afternoon.\n\nHundreds of protesters gathered in Malcolm X Park earlier in the evening for a demonstration, where crowds chanted Wallace's name and activists spoke about demanding real change. Following the gathering, crowds dispersed across the city. While protests started off peaceful, groups were met with police officers in riot gear, who formed lines to barricade the protesters and shield the police precinct.\n\nJust before 10 pm, the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management issued a warning to residents in select districts to stay home because those areas were \"experiencing widespread demonstrations that have turned violent with looting.\" However, much of the violence came from police, as officers used pepper spray to control crowds and beat protesters with batons in West Philly's commercial corridor. Officers arrested looters across the city; more than 90 people have been arrested since Monday. While Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf gave the National Guard permission to activate in the city on Tuesday, they were not deployed.\n\nAdditional protests are planned for Wednesday as activists demand that the police department fire the officers who shot Wallace.\n\nIn video footage of Wallace's encounter with police, both officers had their guns drawn as Wallace, who was reportedly experiencing a mental break, advanced toward the officers with a knife, though the knife is not visible in the video. By Monday night, West Philadelphia had become grounds for hours of unrest.\n\nCommunity leaders are calling for the police department to release body camera footage of the incident as others question whether the city's new system for responding to behavioral health crises was put into effect on Monday. Meanwhile, activists with groups like Reclaim Philadelphia have long demanded the defunding and dismantling of the Philadelphia Police Department, which they say has a police union contract that allows for the surveillance, harassment, displacement, and incarceration of Black and Latinx communities in the city.\n\nAccording to a report from the Philadelphia Police Department on Monday, officers made their way to the 6100 block of Locust Street in the Cobbs Creek neighborhood of West Philadelphia after receiving a report about a man with a knife.\n\nOn Tuesday, reports revealed that police had responded to three calls of disturbances at the residence that day. Shaka Johnson, the attorney for the family, said at a press conference on Tuesday that the police were made aware of Wallace's mental health condition, that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was taking lithium for it. According to Johnson, Wallace's brother called for an ambulance for assistance with Wallace who was experiencing an episode, but the police showed up instead.\n\nA live video posted to Instagram on Monday afternoon by a bystander sitting close by in a car on the block shows what took place in the moments before officers fired their weapons.\n\nWallace, first standing on the sidewalk, moves toward officers who are standing in the middle of the street. As Wallace advances toward them, the officers walk backward away from Wallace with their guns pointed toward him. Wallace pursues the officers to the other side of the street, in between parked cars and back into the street, for about 25 seconds.\n\nDuring this time, Wallace's mother follows Wallace in an attempt to shield him and stop him from advancing toward the police. Other bystanders scream for both Wallace and the officers to stop. Officers can be heard yelling, \"Back off, man!\" and \"Drop the weapon!\" Another bystander, a young Black man, follows behind Wallace before officers scream, \"Move! Move! Move!\" to him as they prepare to use their weapons.\n\nOnce Wallace is back in the street, each officer fires several rounds of shots; Wallace falls to the ground immediately. His mother and other bystanders run to his side, visibly angry with the police for shooting him. In the video, Wallace is seen standing several feet away from the officers when they shoot him.\n\n\"I'm yelling, 'Put down the gun, put down the gun,' and everyone is saying, 'Don't shoot him, he's gonna put [the knife] down, we know him,'\" Maurice Holloway, a witness, told the Philadelphia Inquirer .\n\n\"Why didn't they use a Taser?\" Wallace's father, Walter Wallace Sr., told the publication. \"His mother was trying to defuse the situation.\" He added, \"He has mental issues. Why you have to gun him down?\"\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, who spoke to the family Monday night, said the video of the incident \"presents difficult questions that must be answered.\" The two officers, whose names have not been released, were removed from street duty and the PPD's Officer Involved Shooting Investigation Unit has launched an investigation into the shooting, which Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said will fully address residents' questions about the fatal shooting. Both officers were wearing body cameras.\n\nAhead of the unrest, Outlaw said she planned to join Kenney to meet with members of the community and members of Wallace's family to \"hear their concerns.\"\n\n\"While at the scene this evening, I heard and felt the anger of the community. Everyone involved will forever be impacted,\" Outlaw said.\n\nOn Tuesday, both Outlaw and Kenney met with community members at a West Philly church to answer questions about the police shooting and the city's actions. Attendees demanded that Outlaw explain why the officers hadn't yet been fired. \"I'm going to be honest, I don't have an answer for you,\" Outlaw said, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer .\n\nOn Monday evening, a large crowd assembled at the scene of the police killing, with gatherers alleging excessive use of force on the part of the two officers. Protesters eventually moved to Malcolm X Park, where they chanted \"Black Lives Matter\" and Wallace's name.\n\nAt a nearby police station, protesters were met with police officers who were dressed in riot gear and formed lines with shields and barricades.\n\nHundreds of people also traveled to West Philly's 52nd Street commercial corridor where vandalism and looting ensued, creating a scene that mirrored the unrest that took place in West Philly after the police killing of George Floyd in May.\n\nAccording to police, at least 30 officers were injured in the protests, including from thrown bricks and rocks. One officer, who was run over by a black pickup truck in the early hours on Tuesday, was hospitalized and in stable condition with a broken leg later in the morning.\n\nAs police attempted to control the crowd, violence broke out. In various videos online, officers could be seen beating protesters with batons.\n\nIn another video , a Black woman is pinned to the ground as one officer repeatedly punches her in the face, with several officers forming a blockade around the assault.\n\nCity Council member Jamie Gauthier, who leads the district where Wallace was killed, demanded that the police department immediately release the body camera footage from both officers. \"The public deserves a full, unvarnished accounting of what took place today,\" Gauthier said.\n\nThe killing took place about a week before the presidential election, when Philadelphians will vote on a ballot measure to determine whether the city will restore its police oversight commission. Critics have long argued that the commission, however, would have no real power over the police department, as commission recommendations were historically overlooked and ignored. The body was also underfunded, and investigations into police misconduct took years.\n\nPennsylvania, and Philadelphia, is at the center of the presidential election, with some predicting the state could be the tipping point in determining who wins. Trump has seized on this reality by advocating for poll watchers in Philadelphia , and Donald Trump Jr. sensationalized the situation in the city on Tuesday morning, suggesting that people vote for Trump to avoid \"more BLM riots in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nFor activists, Wallace's death further underscores their calls to push for greater attention to victims of police violence who have mental health conditions, like Daniel Prude, who was fatally shot by police in Rochester, New York, on March 23 while experiencing a mental health crisis. Activists have demanded that resources be redirected from police officers to emergency response systems and experts who are actually equipped to address such situations.\n\nAt the start of October, Philadelphia announced it had launched a program to flag 911 calls related to people experiencing a behavioral health crisis. It is unclear whether this initiative was in use on Monday. But as local PBS station WHYY points out , the police department has already trained nearly half of its officers in crisis response, and the department hopes to have a behavioral health specialist accompany officers on calls by the end of the year.\n\n\"Had these officers employed de-escalation techniques and non-lethal weapons ... this young man might still have his life tonight. Had these officers valued the life of this Black man - had they treated him as a person experiencing mental health issues, instead of a criminal - we might be spared our collective outrage,\" Gauthier said in a statement, adding, \"In this moment of reckoning and pain for West Philly, we need accountability, we need justice, and we need it now.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

Following the gathering, crowds dispersed across the city. While protests started off peaceful, groups were met with police officers in riot gear, who formed lines to barricade the protesters and shield the police precinct.\n\nJust before 10 pm, the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management issued a warning to residents in select districts to stay home because those areas were \"experiencing widespread demonstrations that have turned violent with looting.\" However, much of the violence came from police, as officers used pepper spray to control crowds and beat protesters with batons in West Philly's commercial corridor. Officers arrested looters across the city; more than 90 people have been arrested since Monday. While Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf gave the National Guard permission to activate in the city on Tuesday, they were not deployed.\n\nAdditional protests are planned for Wednesday as activists demand that the police department fire the officers who shot Wallace.\n\nIn video footage of Wallace's encounter with police, both officers had their guns drawn as Wallace, who was reportedly experiencing a mental break, advanced toward the officers with a knife, though the knife is not visible in the video. By Monday night, West Philadelphia had become grounds for hours of unrest.\n\nCommunity leaders are calling for the police department to release body camera footage of the incident as others question whether the city's new system for responding to behavioral health crises was put into effect on Monday. Meanwhile, activists with groups like Reclaim Philadelphia have long demanded the defunding and dismantling of the Philadelphia Police Department, which they say has a police union contract that allows for the surveillance, harassment, displacement, and incarceration of Black and Latinx communities in the city.\n\nAccording to a report from the Philadelphia Police Department on Monday, officers made their way to the 6100 block of Locust Street in the Cobbs Creek neighborhood of West Philadelphia after receiving a report about a man with a knife.\n\nOn Tuesday, reports revealed that police had responded to three calls of disturbances at the residence that day. Shaka Johnson, the attorney for the family, said at a press conference on Tuesday that the police were made aware of Wallace's mental health condition, that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was taking lithium for it. According to Johnson, Wallace's brother called for an ambulance for assistance with Wallace who was experiencing an episode, but the police showed up instead.\n\nA live video posted to Instagram on Monday afternoon by a bystander sitting close by in a car on the block shows what took place in the moments before officers fired their weapons.\n\nWallace, first standing on the sidewalk, moves toward officers who are standing in the middle of the street. As Wallace advances toward them, the officers walk backward away from Wallace with their guns pointed toward him. Wallace pursues the officers to the other side of the street, in between parked cars and back into the street, for about 25 seconds.\n\nDuring this time, Wallace's mother follows Wallace in an attempt to shield him and stop him from advancing toward the police. Other bystanders scream for both Wallace and the officers to stop. Officers can be heard yelling, \"Back off, man!\" and \"Drop the weapon!\" Another bystander, a young Black man, follows behind Wallace before officers scream, \"Move! Move!

Trump has seized on this reality by advocating for poll watchers in Philadelphia , and Donald Trump Jr. sensationalized the situation in the city on Tuesday morning, suggesting that people vote for Trump to avoid \"more BLM riots in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nFor activists, Wallace's death further underscores their calls to push for greater attention to victims of police violence who have mental health conditions, like Daniel Prude, who was fatally shot by police in Rochester, New York, on March 23 while experiencing a mental health crisis. Activists have demanded that resources be redirected from police officers to emergency response systems and experts who are actually equipped to address such situations.\n\nAt the start of October, Philadelphia announced it had launched a program to flag 911 calls related to people experiencing a behavioral health crisis. It is unclear whether this initiative was in use on Monday. But as local PBS station WHYY points out , the police department has already trained nearly half of its officers in crisis response, and the department hopes to have a behavioral health specialist accompany officers on calls by the end of the year.\n\n\"Had these officers employed de-escalation techniques and non-lethal weapons ... this young man might still have his life tonight. Had these officers valued the life of this Black man - had they treated him as a person experiencing mental health issues, instead of a criminal - we might be spared our collective outrage,\" Gauthier said in a statement, adding, \"In this moment of reckoning and pain for West Philly, we need accountability, we need justice, and we need it now.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K. Rowling's transphobia.\n\nTrump's tariffs might actually be good for Ukraine.\n\nBright headlights can make it easier for drivers to see the road. But there's a dark side.\n\nAnd how religion became a force in US politics.\n\nIn the past four decades, the gap between rich and poor has grown significantly. It's a dangerous trend.\n\nThese government scientists are likely the next in line for big cuts.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC. All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Harford Civil Rights Project tells story of county as a \"hub of civil rights\"\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  February 18, 2025 / 10:09 PM EST / CBS Baltimore\n\nIf you have spent time in Harford County, you know of Ray's Caribbean American Food and Hickory Ridge Elementary School.\n\nWhat you may not know is how they are connected to the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n\"Not as well known, as say maybe what happened in Baltimore or in other places further south, but a lot did happen here,\" said Dr. James Karmel, director of the Harford Civil Rights Project and professor of history at Harford County Community. \"It was kind of a hub of civil rights.\"\n\nDr. Karmel says the Harford Civil Rights Project  was created to highlight what happened over the past 60 years, the pivotal players, and how change was made.\n\nHe hopes it inspires people to use their voices for positive change, too.\n\n\"Where there is injustice, where there is severe inequality as there was in the Jim Crowe Era, you want people to think about, what can I do to change this? What can I do to make things a better world to progress?\" said Dr. Karmel. \"You can enact change like this but it takes hard work and it takes maybe some amount of courage and maybe a little sacrifice sometimes too.\"\n\nWithin the 437 square miles of Harford County lie pivotal moments in Civil Rights history that many do not know about. That's why Dr. Karmel started the Harford County Civil Rights Project.\n\n\"If I go here and look at our exhibition, which is harfordcivilrights.org , you can scroll down and see these are the stories which are all kind of site-based stories related to different civil rights themes, things that took place in Harford County,\" said Dr. Karmel.\n\nThe project started with a grant in 2018 from the National Endowment for Humanities, and it has since involved more than 700 students of all different backgrounds, researching and adding to the project.\n\nStudent Elizabeth Hunter focused her research on activist H. Rap Brown.\n\n\"One of the protests that he was at, maybe you'd say running, was one that got pretty violent and ended up having a lot of rioters and arson committed. He was then charged and his trial was in Bel Air, Maryland of all places,\" Hunter said.\n\nThe project includes oral history clips, photos, and in many cases, documents.\n\nThe multimedia efforts are also included in the featured article on the Route 40 Freedom Ride, a protest to end segregation in several locations along the highway, put together by student Josiah Carey.\n\n\"I never knew that there was an actual freedom ride for Harford county so it was really interesting to learn about and to learn how it started and how they kind of just traveled down there and just took their stand against it,\" Carey said.\n\nThe website and GPS-activated app for guided tours features countless stories about Civil Rights icons like Dwight Petit and the Stamp family, segregated education at the Central Consolidated School and the Havre De Grace Colored School, restaurants such as the Flying Clipper and the Bonnie Brae Diner.\n\nWhile learning about the past, those who have contributed to the app hope people can apply what they learn to the present and the future.\n\n\"I feel like it impacts me as a person of color, as a person who is a minority,\"  student Quentin Santiago said. \"I think it's really important to learn the history so it can be even more impactful to me for the future so I can maybe help out in the future or I could stand against things with a better, more clear mind on the issues at hand.\"\n\n\"I know how hard he's worked and everyone else involved to try to get more of the information out there because it needs to be,\" student Brittany Baylor said. \"It shouldn't be something that should just only be learned for a few months. It happened, you can't erase what happened.\"\n\nThe students say that while we've come a long way in the last 60 years, we still have a long way to go.\n\n\"I hope they find a reason themselves, maybe take a reason of why I did the project, and apply it to themselves and take that into the future or into the present, and do with that knowledge what they will be it to protest or to stand for something or to help an organization or build an organization from the ground up,\" Santiago said.\n\n\"Obviously, over the last couple years, we've seen a big influx in the BLM riots, and I think today we sort of think we have it all figured out and it's all perfect when obviously that is far from the truth,\" Hunter said.\n\nAshley Paul joined the WJZ team in December 2024 as a reporter, and could not be happier to call Charm City home!\r\n\r\nAshley has told stories all across the country, including in Maine, Central Pennsylvania and Tampa, where she won a Florida Association of Broadcast Journalists award in the \"Multi-Media Journalist In a Large Market\" category.\n\n© 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

      "text": "A Photographer's Journey Through the Dangerous New Age of Conspiracies in America\n\nI n November 2017, the House Intelligence Committee released fake advertisements found on Facebook in the walk up to the 2016 election. As politicians on each side argued over whether the ads changed the election results, the heart of the revelation was way more disturbing. The Russian ads targeted the American public to deepen wounds on divisive issues and spread false information. Facebook said, \" what we saw from these actors was an insidious attempt to drive people apart ,\" according to Colin Stretch, the general counsel for the company.\n\nIn 2020, less than one month before the election, America seems even more divided and deeply fractured after a turbulent year with a deadly pandemic, economic pain, and a chaotic presidency. With many Americans on lockdown, social media has been a vital form of communication - but one that is also driving dangerous conspiracies. From the false QAnon conspiracy, which promotes Trump as the final defense against a \"deep state\" cabal of Democrats and Hollywood elite who traffic, rape, and cannibalize children, to fake claims that COVID-19 is a hoax, the spread of disinformation on social media is deepening divisions that some fear could lead to a further rise in civil unrest in the coming weeks.\n\nConvoluted messaging from the White House on these fake theories doesn't help. During the Oct.15 NBC Town Hall President Donald Trump denied knowing what QAnon was, and then quickly contradicted himself, saying, \"What I do know it is they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard but I know nothing about it.\"\n\nTo combat the spread of false information, on Oct. 15 YouTube announced \"efforts to curb hate and harassment by removing more conspiracy theory content used to justify real-world violence.\" Facebook also recently said they would ramp up their fight against disinformation , particularly QAnon, by removing pages and groups from the app, but it may not be effective-or it may be too late.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis Taete , an L.A.-based photographer originally from England, spent more than a year covering American political rallies and protests he mostly found on Facebook. He began to see the conspiracies manifest themselves through the believers caught in the fervor of misinformation that show the social media platform's darkest side as a divided reality.\n\nSpeaking via Zoom, he recalls how it all began.\n\nWhen did you start noticing conspiracies in the political landscape?\n\nI always had an interest in documenting people with fringe beliefs; it used to be a lot more difficult to find. I started seeing more of it in the real world in 2019, and there's been a huge explosion of conspiratorial thinking both online and off since COVID started.\n\nWe've always lived with conspiracies - like the moon landing was fake, or conspiracies around who killed JFK. I think they've gotten worse this year because: A, social media makes it easy for people with the same beliefs to connect more easily, and B, everybody is stuck at home, spending all their time on the internet, which makes it easy to fall down these rabbit holes.\n\nIt's also something you see when the world is in turmoil, and things are unstable. People don't know what they can trust. I think it's a lot easier for people to cling on to something like QAnon, which is an easily understood-if imaginary-battle between good and evil, than the complicated reality of the world.\n\nCan you tell me about the process of finding conspiracies in the social media landscape?\n\nI'm in a lot of Facebook groups. That's the only thing I use Facebook for these days. I've joined various QAnon, far-right, Three Percenter, and militia Facebook groups. The 'groups' tab on Facebook shows a curated newsfeed from the groups you're in. I use that and Facebook's events pages to keep up on real world happenings.\n\nMany of the pictures here are from anti-lockdown rallies. But the boundaries between these things have become incredibly blurred. The event might be a Trump Rally, but you're still going to see a huge anti-lockdown presence and QAnon signs.\n\nDo you find it hard to question supporters about Trump?\n\nIt can be hard to find common ground with people at these events, because many of them refuse to admit Trump is at fault, no matter how trivial the issue is.\n\nWhich is by design. I don't think Trump cares if he's seen by people as a liar. He just wants to bring reality into question as much as possible because that's the most convenient thing for him, ultimately.\n\nI have a family member who started posting \"Save the Children\" messages about children being trafficked. They believe this is the biggest story that the media is not reporting. As a reporter, I'm like, human trafficking is an important issue, but this is not the same. It's hard to have a conversation and not seem uncaring.\n\nYes, it very difficult to have a critical conversation that's about a campaign to stop child abuse, because you sound like your pro-child abuse. But the type of human trafficking they're talking about isn't really happening in this country. Human trafficking exists and is bad, but the reality is more complex and is often linked to abuse, survival sex work, and homelessness. It's not what you see in Taken and Rambo 5 .\n\nCan you tell me what they say is happening?\n\nThey think millions of children are being snatched in grocery stores and parks and sold on the internet for people to sexually abuse or cannibalize. Some believe thousands of children are being kept in underground lairs under Central Park and LA's Getty Center. But the data does not back that up.\n\nIn your work on Instagram, I'm shocked by someone holding up a sign about Tom Hanks being a pedophile. When you publish that work, I fear the photographs could be removed from the original context. What's the best way to present this work?\n\nIt's difficult but I sort of think the rules have gone out of the window a little bit. In the past I'd maybe lean toward not wanting to amplify toxic views or give people more attention, but the 'Tom Hanks is a pedophile' thing is a huge narrative in the QAnon world, so there are potentially hundreds of thousands of people who think Tom Hanks is murdering children to cannibalize them or has been executed or replaced by a body double. I think it's important to look at the specifics of what these people believe, rather than speaking generally about \"the QAnon conspiracy theory,\" because it shows how ridiculous these things are.\n\nI think a lot of media ignores some of the more out-there sides of these conspiracies because they're worried about amplifying it. Or it's difficult to use traditional reporting methods to report on them. Like, if you were to approach Tom Hanks for comment on a story about people accusing him of being a cannibal pedophile, he's probably not going to respond. And that might lend legitimacy to the theory.\n\nI'm hoping the context and the way I take the photos makes it clear that I think many of these things are absurd. I wouldn't be posting these conspiracies if I felt there was a chance people were seeing my photos and thinking these things were real. I'm, hopefully, not going to post a sign that has some made-up facts about human trafficking that might seem real if you just stumbled across the picture.\n\nDo you talk to and engage with the people you're photographing?\n\nYes. I posted a video recently of a woman I interviewed on Tom Hanks' star on the Walk of Fame, where she explained that she believes Tom Hanks is killing babies to extract a chemical called adrenochrome , which he uses to keep himself young, and that he's escaped to Greece to avoid prosecution.\n\nI empathize somewhat. It's easy to understand how people end up falling for these conspiracies about powerful people if you have Jeffery Epstein and Harvey Weinstein operating in full view of many powerful people, doing a lot of really F-ked up things for years, and that's true. Is it that much of a stretch to believe that Tom Hanks is killing babies?\n\nWhat are the other conspiracies that you think are harmful right now?\n\nI'm seeing a lot of anti-Antifa and anti-BLM stuff in the Facebook groups I'm in. \"Antifa/BLM riots\" are the biggest story on my Facebook right now. If these groups were your main source of information, you would think that the '94 LA riots have spread across the country and that people are being executed by BLM in the middle of the street. It's making people extremely scared of these protests, and I think you're seeing that in the violence that they're being met with.\n\nThese are huge groups that have tens of thousands of members where it's just a constant feed of those kinds of conspiracies that are met uncritically. A lot of people trust these groups more than they trust mainstream media outlets.\n\nDo you notice Facebook cracking down on this at all?\n\nI think Facebook is mostly dealing with it from a PR perspective. They've removed some QAnon groups, but that's had very little impact on my toxic feed of Facebook groups. The \"Save Our Children\" groups are still there, \"Against Human Trafficking\" is still there, which is essentially just QAnon-lite.\n\nI don't think they have any real interest in stamping out misinformation. That would require a huge investment from them. I don't think you can use an algorithm to block this stuff. People will find a way around it.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Introducing RealClearInvestigations' Jan. 6-BLM Riots Dataset\n\nMany in the political and media establishment have cast the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol as one of the darkest episodes in American history, comparing an episode in which one person was slain (a protester shot by police) to 9/11, Pearl Harbor, the Civil War, and the British sacking of the capital city in 1814. Seizing on the gravity of a mob trying to interfere with the process of recording Electoral College votes after a presidential election, Democrats impeached Donald Trump over the Jan. 6 breach and put him on trial in the Senate. Democrats have also spearheaded a congressional investigation-one focused on the former president-that will likely stretch into next election season.\n\nRepublicans, Trump supporters, and others see a double standard at play in Democrats' emphasis on Jan. 6. They note that many Democrats cheered nationwide protests and some even put up bail after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd, a black man, by a white police officer-prolonged unrest that generated far more death and destruction. They argue that groups associated with the summer's violence, such as Black Lives Matter and Antifa, themselves aim to subvert democracy, and acted accordingly in targeting cops, public offices, and private businesses.\n\nThe electorate itself is divided, but doesn't necessarily view this issue as an either/or choice. Polling shows that a large majority of Americans support the idea of examining the causes of both the 2020 summer riots in America's cities and the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.\n\nIt is clear, then, that many Americans see two sides to this story. In keeping with its mission to fill gaps in press coverage, RealClearInvestigations is launching a running compendium of data, with hyperlinked sourcing, comparing the damage done on Jan. 6, and the subsequent treatment of those accused of perpetrating it, with two other recent events: the summer 2020 riots and-in some ways a closer analogy-the all-but-forgotten riot in Washington on Inauguration Day 2017, as protesters challenged Donald Trump's election and legitimacy much as Jan. 6 rioters challenged Joe Biden's."

      "text": "Judge in President Trump's Case Says BLM Riots Were 'Mostly Peaceful'\n\nA judge presiding over a January 6 case involving former President Donald Trump said the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests were \"mostly peaceful\" and commented angrily that President Trump \"remains free\" after January 6.\n\nhttps://www.oann.com/newsroom/judge-presiding-over-j6-trump-case-called-blm-protests-mostly-peaceful-ranted-about-how-trump-remains-free/\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan criticized the comparison between the Black Lives Matter (BLM) riots and the Capitol breach during a 2021 hearing on Matthew Mazzocco, who was present on Capitol grounds on January 6, OANN reported.\n\n\"Now, there are some people who have compared the riots of January 6 with other protests that took place throughout the country over the past year and who have suggested that the Capitol rioters are somehow being treated unfairly,\" Chutkan wrote. \"I flatly disagree.\"\n\n\"People gathered all over the country last year to protest the violent murder by the police of an unarmed man,\" Chutkan continued. \"Some of those protesters became violent. But to compare the actions of people protesting, mostly peacefully, for civil rights, to those of a violent mob seeking to overthrow the lawfully elected government is a false equivalency and ignores a very real danger that the January 6 riot posed to the foundation of our democracy.\"\n\nTom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, commented on the J-6ers' treatment, saying on X: \"The Department of Justice charged only about 300 people for the left-wing and BLM riots in multiple cities across America. This same agency has charged over 1,100 to date for the Jan 6 disturbance in Washington DC.\"\n\nJudge Chutkan diverged from the prosecutorial recommendation for Matthew Mazzocco because she felt he only showed remorse when it became clear he could face jail time.\n\nAccording to court documents, Mazzocco went inside the Capitol when crowds streamed inside and interrupted a joint session of Congress that was convened to certify electoral votes.\n\nThe San Antonio, Texas, man was not seen committing any violent acts, according to the FBI and prosecutors.\n\n\"Mazzocco is seen and heard on the video telling others not to take or destroy anything, and that they were probably going to get in trouble for what they were doing,\" the FBI affidavit states.\n\nMazzocco was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\n\nProsecutors last month told Chutkan that Mazzocco should receive no jail time. They recommended he be sentenced to three months of home confinement, probation for three years, and at least 60 hours of community service in addition to a $500 charge of restitution.\n\nMazzocco admonished others not to damage any property and was only inside the Capitol for 12 minutes, and there is no evidence he himself engaged in any violence or property destruction, prosecutors said. He also admitted to his actions in a timely manner and did not have a criminal history.\n\n\"Mr. Mazzocco was in the Capitol for only 12 minutes, and he did tell others, don't take or break anything, noting that they would probably get in trouble for what they did,\" Judge Chutkan wrote.\n\nMs. Chutkan, in another sentencing hearing in October 2022, expressed anger that Trump is not behind bars.\n\n\"I see the videotapes,\" Ms. Chutkan wrote. \"I see the footage of the flags and the signs that people were carrying and the hats they were wearing and the garb. And the people who mobbed that Capitol were there in fealty, in loyalty, to one man-not to the Constitution, of which most of the people who come before me seem woefully ignorant; not to the ideals of this country; and not to the principles of democracy. It's a blind loyalty to one person who, by the way, remains free to this day.\"\n\nPresident Trump commented on this in a social media post, saying: \"The following TRUTH is a quote by highly partisan Judge Tanya Chutkan, angrily sentencing a J-6er in October of 2022. She obviously wants me behind bars. VERY BIASED AND UNFAIR!\"\n\n\"I intend to keep politics out of it,\" Ms. Chutkan said to President Trump's attorney John Lauro in a hearing to settle a dispute over a protective order in the President's case.\n\nJudge Chutkan refused to block the release of documents to the Jan. 6 Committee. In her ruling, she wrote, \"Presidents are not kings, and [former President Trump] is not President.\"\n\nAccording to a new CBS poll, 63 percent of independents believe the indictments against the 45th president are intended to stop his campaign.\n\nAbigail Jo Shry, 43, is facing a charge of threatening to injure or kill another person after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) found out she left a threatening voicemail for Judge Chutkan and U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), according to charging documents."

      "text": "But in the context of other incidents over the past 24 hours, what happened to me was mild.\n\nGod bless Olivia Reingold!  That young lady has some serious stones!  The rest of us need to take a page from her book (not ripping it out of her hand, but you know what I mean) and start pushing back.  I wear an Israel bracelet every day, featuring the Israeli flag, and most days I wear a necklace a friend gave me that reads \"We Will Dance Again\" from the tattoo worn by Mia Schem, another brave young woman who could teach us a lot about how to live.  I'm thinking of getting the same or a similar tattoo.  (I'm 70 years old; this would be my first tattoo.)  These people are fascists and if the bloody 20th century taught us anything it's that we cannot let the fascists win.\n\nDon't they realize that they are next? no one seems to remember Robespierre anymore.\n\nWhat you need is a man with a bat standing next to you, to help explain to the Hamasniks that they touch you at their peril.\n\nThere will come a point in time when enough is enough and the only response to threats of intolerance and violence will be to stop the threats and intimidation, by whatever means necessary. My father in law grew up in Nazi Dresden and escaped just weeks before no else could at 18. 98% of his family was slaughtered in the camps. The Jewish population of New York and those who support them is huge. Intimidation and threats of violence reminiscent of Nazi Germany cannot and should not be tolerated. Jews and people of conscience failed to fight back when this kind of hate, intimidation and violence emerged over 90 years ago.We must not fail again. This is a cancer and must be removed before it is allowed to metastasize any further.\n\nThese snowflakes are nothing more than foreign agitators and baristas in masks.  They limit their activities to places where progressive prosecutors refuse to enforce the laws of the land, where police cannot use force against them and where a disaffected and unpatriotic populace allows these things to occur. In stark contrast, the efforts by these same cowards to engage in this type of uncivil conduct in Red America has been unsuccessful; the reason is simple, law enforcement is allowed to do their job, prosecutors actually seek sentences, including jail, and a patriotic and well armed populace will simply not tolerate their anti-american and anti-semitic conduct.   To quote country music star Jason Aldean, \"try that in a small town and see how far you get.\".\n\nAssault and robbery. Where is law enforcement? They do have a right to say almost anything they want. Threatening to kill or harm someone is not protected by that right. Taking another's property through force or the threat of force is also not protected speech. If Hamas truly wants to end the suffering of the Palestinian people from the response to their horrific terrorist attack on October 7th, all they have to do is have all their leaders and fighters surrender to the IDF and the war ends today. But if a similar, proportional attack was made against the United States, with 50,000 people killed, all civilians, including babies and with women raped in the streets, the strongholds of Hamas in Gaza would be sheets of glass with a lingering red mist floating above them.\n\nThanks, Olivia, for being a woman willing to brave physical harm and pushing back when it occurs by utilizing the police but also for showing that words are not violence - we women should all be willing to hear our ideals mocked or vilified - it makes us stronger. Public life is not for the faint of heart ❤️\n\nWelcome to Joe Biden and the Democrat party's vision for America.  Can't you just wait for another fours year of this?\n\nMake no mistake, this is both deliberate and orchestrated.\n\nI agree to this being deliberate and orchestrated. It is clear that all these huge demonstrations with millions of palestinians flags all over the world and the same slogans « from the river to the sea «  require a costly logistics. So in your view by whom is it orchestrated ?\n\nOlivia, this retired teacher has a new hero: you. You are inspiring, and my young daughter needs role models like you.  But please be careful. Thank you.  - Ralph\n\n\"Mostly peaceful\"\n\nDid you write similar exposes of BLM protests?\n\n\"Everyone just knows\" Hamass should be able to go into Israel to murder entire familes, murder 400 young people at a music festival, parade raped and murdered kidnap victims through the streets (to cheering crowds no less) and kidnap mothers literally holding their babies. But if Hamass can make it back into Gaza they should be able to say \"Safe Space!!\" and thus have immunity from retribution.\n\n- signed, the ICC, every Ivy League school administration (and nearly every non-Ivy administration), every \"university\" Diversity Studies department, Black Lives Matter (who literally cheered Hamass on 10/7), Rashida Tlaib (who voted \"present\" a vote condemning Hamass' orgy of murder, rape and kidnapping), the UAW, Ilhan Omar, most of our \"media\", the UN, the Nobel Prize committee, 90% of Congressional Democrats, etc etc etc...\n\nWhy hasn't NYS passed a law banning face coverings and hoods ?\n\nThere's no reasoning with unreasonable people. I imagine most of them are  just mouthing words that other people have put into their heads. Thank you for reporting what they say and do.  It gives the rest of us advance warning so we can see them coming.\n\nOur elected officials used to enforce the laws that we all relied on to keep the peace. Today these officials have been placed in these positions by the radical billionaires who are dedicated to burning down all our shit. The media and the education industry are cohorts in this mission. It is up to the truth tellers and good citizens to take control via the only means we have- at the moment- and that is the ballot box. Vote the bastards out. Term limits. Enforce the damn laws. Keep up the outstanding work Olivia.\n\nYou're comments are spot on.\n\nGovernment  officials are ignoring the growing mobs of violent \"protestors\" who are using hate speech to harass and intimidate Jews and anyone who supports Israel.  Mayors, governors and the President must step up and stop it. These mobs are not ok. Face coverings to hide identities are not ok when the protestors are intimidating people. Vandalizing homes and monuments and disrupting public events in a violent manner cannot be tolerated. If security guards can't stop it, call in the police or  National Guard. Make some rules for the protests and enforce them. It's getting out of hand.\n\nYes, you're correct and this violence needs to stop, but what about when leftists and Dems were targeting conservatives like Ted Cruz, Betsy DeVoss, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, et al., simply eating at restaurant for example - where was the outrage about these attacks on people who worked/supported the Trump Administration and/or are Congressional Republicans?  The one-sided, selective outrage shows the hypocrisy of many in the Dem Party and the Left.\n\nI was outraged at that as well. I was upset about the BLM riots, too. None of these tactics are ok in civilized society. People should have the freedom to eat dinner in peace and quiet in a restaurant, absolutely. Store owners should be protected from mobs looting and police stations should not be burned to the ground by people who are upset. The assault on our Capitol was not ok either.  I don't want violent mobs of any political persuasion intimidating others, destroying property, desecrating monuments and the like.\n\nI am glad you were not physically injured. Thank you for doing your job.  You did it even though they harassed you.  I am starting to think many of these people are mentally ill."

There has been a lot written in that space and if you need me to share that I can\n\nThis was one of the more intriguing Honestly podcasts to listen to.   On the one hand, Bari pushed Turchin hard to clarify his positions.  On the other hand, some of those positions were a bit confusing (everyone's a revolutionary unless they are a (certain kind of) elite)!\n\nAm I the only one that was hearing Hari Seldon in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series during this discussion?  Pyschohistory essentially equals cliodynamics, at least at a surface level.   As another science fiction hero might say:  fascinating! :)\n\nWhenever I see theories that are clearly backed by data, they are at least worth listening to.   It feels like Turchin's Russian background is naturally driving much of his thinking - it feels like if he chose to take sides, he would be a proper socialist.  So, that's sort of a problem but that doesn't invalidate the process, just the conclusions.\n\nAnyway, if elites have all of the money and political power, one way to fix the politics is to somehow get the money out of politics.  If you can't buy your president (looking at you, Zuck) or your prosecutors (Soros), then you'll have to rely on old-fashioned merit and hard work to convince people that you can lead them in a direction that is more prosperous for most if not all people.\n\nNo posts"

It argues that societies operate cyclically, going through golden ages and end times.

See you in the comments. -BW\n\nOn predicting 2020:\n\nBW : In 2010, you published an article that predicted that 2020 would be a year of instability, using hundreds of thousands of historical data points. The listener doesn't need a reminder of the events of that turbulent year, but it was indeed an instability spike. How did you see that coming?\n\nPT : I'd been studying past societies and found that they always get into these \"end times.\" It happened to recur periodically, and not terribly perfectly or mathematically, but there was something that drove societies into social turbulence and political disintegration. I had been staying away from the present because I didn't want to get into politics. But I was giving talks about the seventeenth-century crisis , the age of revolutions, things like that, and people kept asking me, \"Well, where are we?\" And so I decided to look at where we are. This is not a very simple process. The theory is based on quite massive amounts of data. So it took me a couple of years to gather together the database for which I could actually perceive the trends. And what I found truthfully shocked me because I saw our society well on the road to crisis. Of course, our society is quite different from ancient Rome or medieval France and even pre-Civil War United States. But at a more abstract level, the drivers of instability were already working full throttle. So that was one of the reasons why I decided to publish this forecast. And I just want to emphasize that I'm not a prophet. This was a scientific prediction.\n\nBW : What was the reaction when you predicted that?\n\nPT : There was, frankly, disbelief, and it was tinged with a desire to think that I must be wrong because nobody wants to believe in bad predictions. People like Steven Pinker and Max Rosen were making all of these rosy predictions right around the same time. Those predictions were very popular because everybody wants to think there is going to be a happy ending to this story. So, the reaction to my prediction was negative, but it was fine because I had tenure at that point. One of the advantages of American academics is that once you have tenure, you can actually try dangerous, risky, intellectual strategies. And it was really quite remarkable. It was thrilling.\n\nWhy elite overproduction is a predictor of crisis:\n\nBW : You write in your book that a handful of factors are the harbingers of end times or societal crisis, one of which is something you call \"elite overproduction.\" What is that?\n\nPT : Elite overproduction turns out to be the best predictor of a crisis to come. It is essentially ubiquitous in the pre-crisis periods of all societies. I used the game of musical chairs to illustrate it, except in the usual game, you start with 11 players and ten chairs, and one person loses. Here, instead of removing chairs, you keep chairs constant, and we add more players. You can imagine the amount of chaos that is going to happen. Now let's connect this to the overproduction of wealthy people in the United States. As more and more of them become players in politics, they drive up the price of getting into office. And more importantly, the more people are vying for these positions, the more people are going to be frustrated. They're going to be losers. But humans don't have to follow rules. This is the dark side of competition: if it's too extreme, it creates conditions for people to start to break rules. This is why 2016 was such a revelation, because in spring 2016, we had 17 major Republican candidates in the presidential primaries. And because there was such intense competition, there was a lot of incentive for people to start breaking rules. And we saw that one individual in particular was very good at breaking rules and was getting ahead, so others started to imitate him. Responding to criticism:\n\nBW : Your idea is that history moves in cycles, and that we're like a snowball rolling down a hill right now, headed off a cliff. How do you respond to the Steven Pinkers of the world who have a more linear idea of history, that the arc of history is long, but it bends toward progress? They point to data to say, look at all of these economic metrics. Standards of living are at an all-time high. We're not in poverty. We don't die from a snakebite on the Oregon Trail, or whatever example you want to use. How do you respond to that view of things?\n\nPT : I actually don't argue against it. Both are happening. There is undeniable progress. Our economies are much more productive than 100 years ago or 200 years ago. However, it doesn't mean that just because over the past 5,000 years things have been getting better, they're going to get better in the next ten years. These are not precise mathematical cycles. These are more like booms and busts. And unfortunately, we are right now in a bust situation. So shouldn't we learn how we can smooth out those busts? Because in the majority of cases, these enzymes end up in revolutions of civil wars that kill hundreds, or sometimes tens of millions of people, like what happened in China in the nineteenth century. So don't you want to find out how we avoid those terrible outcomes?\n\nBW : Yes, I would like to find out how to avoid it, because frankly, when I'm reading your book and I'm encountering your ideas, the core idea here is that history is an inevitable cycle, and that depresses me. The message I think it conveys is that we're just victims of the moment and the time that we live in, and there's not much we can do about it.\n\nPT : But that's not my message at all. I'm an optimist by nature. By understanding why these end times happen, we can socially engineer ourselves out of them.\n\nBW : So if those of us who love this country and don't want us to be in a doom spiral want to know from you how do we change our trajectory when we have an elite that many people view as corrupt and unrepresentative, what would you say? Because in your book you say that one of two groups is going to lead the charge against this current elite establishment-either immiserated, noncredentialed working class, which is a jargony way of saying carpenters or truck drivers, or it'll be frustrated aspirants within the credentialed class-like young people with great SAT scores that are denied admissions to elite universities. And you say that this first group-the carpenters, the plumbers-are going to fail because there's a lack of effective organization among them. But the latter group, these frustrated excess elites, are going to be the ones to lead the charge for change. Do I have that right, and tell me how that will work?\n\nPT : Yes, you're quite right. And that's because we have large historical material. You see that if elites are unified and the state is strong, then popular uprisings always fail. Just think about the Jacquerie in France or many other such uprisings, and they were all killed and dispersed. So why do we need the elites? Because any kind of action, especially good action that results in good outcomes, is the result of organized action by many people cohering in social movements, parties, or some organizations that have set goals. And then they work in a very disciplined manner to achieve those goals and persuade the rest of the society to follow their lead. That is how positive change occurs in human societies.\n\nOn counter-elites:\n\nBW : The subtitle of your book contains the word counter-elites . Explain the difference between the elites and the counter-elites, and how people should know which one they're dealing with.\n\nPT : There are more elite wannabes than there are positions. So some of those elite wannabes are frustrated elites. Some just accept the situation and go back to carpentry or whatever, but a proportion of them are driven by a sense of injustice. They decide to take alternative ways. By the way, Bari, you are a counter-elite.\n\nBW : Are there counter-elites that are inside the establishment institutions? For example, would J.D. Vance, who ran on a very populist platform to become senator in Ohio, be considered a counter-elite inside the Senate?\n\nPT : So some counter-elites become revolutionaries and want to violently overthrow the regime. Other individuals become dissident elites. They want to work within the system to try to change it. So I see J.D. Vance at this point, and if you look at the left part of the spectrum, Bernie Sanders, as dissident elites. And dissident elites are usually better because counter-elites usually use violence or propose violent solutions.\n\nBW : To be clear, I'm a nonviolent counter-elite. I do not think I have the revolutionary spirit.\n\nPT : Right. So you are a dissident, then?\n\nBW : Well, I don't know. We have disaffected elites, counter-elites, dissident elites. . . it all gets a little bit confusing.\n\nPT : I understand, but human societies are complex. And so I would not be giving justice by trying to boil things down to just one or two major points.\n\nBW : Peter, why would anyone choose to be a counter-elite when all of the incentives are there to at least aspire to become part of the normal elite? Like what lies on the side of counter-elite is social suicide, career suicide, getting tagged as all kinds of bad words. . . . So what will incentivize elite aspirants to flip and join the counter-elite side?\n\nPT : I'll give you two reasons. First of all, being a counter-elite is a high-risk but high potential gain strategy. As somebody said, a successful revolution is ten thousand new jobs for revolutionaries. So if you're beating your head against the wall and you see millions of other people who cannot get into positions and your chances of trying to get into the establishment is zero, then maybe even a small chance of a successful revolution may be worth it. The second driving reason is that in these \"end times,\" the sense of injustice is palpable. It is not right that the majority of the population is losing ground-even many of the wealthy don't think that's right. So young individuals coming from very elite backgrounds could be motivated by trying to change the system for the better. Many of those individuals start by trying to do good, but then because they don't get anywhere, they turn to violence. So this is a slippery road where you can travel all the way to becoming a violent revolutionary and a violent radical.\n\nOn how to change the trajectory:\n\nBW : For those listening who feel like, oh God, what do I do about all of this? I don't want to live in end times.\n\nPT : Organize.\n\nBW : Organize how?\n\nPT : So people who have no power, what we can do is start organizing as a social movement. And again, this would require leaders. So somebody would have to step forward and try to start doing this. So, for example, the New Deal didn't happen in isolation. There was a period preceding it called the Progressive Era . And the Progressive Era saw a pretty broad-based social movement, mainly young professionals. So not necessarily working class, but people who were low-rank elites at best and maybe even not elites at all. So that's one thing. But also what's going to happen is that if the instability continues to increase, then eventually the governing units understand that things are not going to always go the way they want. They become frightened, essentially, and that helps them to sharpen their minds to start looking for nonviolent solutions.\n\nOn what's in store in 2024:\n\nBW : Peter, I know you're not a prophet, but you did predict the insane chaos of 2020. What do you think the headlines will be ten years from now? And if that feels like too much of a ridiculous prediction, how does your understanding and your theory of history inform the way that you think the next few years, or perhaps next presidential election, will play out?\n\nPT : I'm very worried about 2024, because you now have two parties that say that they will not accept the win of another party. That rhetoric is growing. What precedes actual violence is violent rhetoric. So 2024 is going to be a really high probability break point. Typically periods of heightened instability take many years, somewhere between 10 and 20 years. So what I hope is that in 2035, the headlines would be that we managed to get the worker wages to grow, and the economy is finally growing in a sustainable way. That's one possible outcome. The other possible outcome is the previous decade was so horrible, everybody became tired of violence, so nobody wants to start violence again. But when the new generation comes along, they will again have the same type of turbulence happen. And I'm sorry if I'm not making a clear case, but that's because our future is unpredictable. It really depends on us collectively. You can actually contribute quite a lot by putting the right ideas out and helping people make better choices. You, Bari, can make a difference. I can also hopefully make a difference by making science better so we can use it to understand history better. So perhaps rather than setting a goal of how we can solve everything in one year, we should think about how we can start making small steps.\n\nTo support vital conversation, become a Free Press subscriber today:\n\nhttps://www.c-span.org/video/?536106-2/open-forum\n\nThe high school and college students that I know are bitter about the Covid shut downs that deprived them of normal socializing and education.

      "text": "In the wake of another assassination attempt, Trump is falling into the same trap as his enemies: equating hateful speech with hateful actions.\n\nApologies for this tangent:\n\nIt amuses me to no end when English majors use words like \"stochastic.\"\n\nWas \"random\" just too pedestrian in this context?\n\nIf we were talking about random voters on both sides of the political spectrum, I'd agreed with you. But we're talking about institutions and elites whose positions of power and whose professed \"neutrality\" allow them to amplify their political rhetoric and seemingly justifying political violence, which is then followed by their lack of shame in what they are doing. Obviously sticking to the playbook. I'm sorry. These are people who don't really care what they break as long as they get what the result that they want.\n\nThis reminds me of our government calling on Israel to \"tone it down\" while Hezbullah continuously drops bombs on Israel and Hamas keeps innocent civilians captive after having raped and murder over 1,200 in cold blood on October 7, 2024. I understand about taking the higher ground, but only if all sides are held to the same standard.\n\nI was reliably told by Democrats for the past 4 years that Trump's words on Jan. 6 caused or incited violence. Yet now they argue their words have no effect at all on the rise in violence in the last 2 months. Seems as though only one candidate has had multiple attempts on his life.\n\nIt is kind of the author to note that Trump is \"understandably angry\" about two attempts on his life in as many months. He then goes on to criticize Trump's reaction. I have not seen the media criticizing the tsunami of hatred spewed toward Trump, by the likes of  prosecutor Letiticia James who was actually out on the street on multiple occasions blasting him with a bullhorn, and the endless parade of democratic harpies daily ramping up the rhetoric. Why no article about that? It is obvious brain trusts like Joy Behar and Morning Joe have done nothing but savage Trump's every move for years. Yet the article, of course, focuses on the need for Trump to tone it down. Very lopsided and biased.\n\nSurely the purpose of the horrendous photo that accompanies this piece is to solicit\n\nyet more hate toward Trump.\n\nHave to agree. How about a nice scowling shot of one of the Joys-Reid or Behar. Easy to come by.\n\nIt's worth noting there is now actual data to support the argument that sufficiently extreme exaggerations have violent consequences. A new Rasmussen poll is out saying 28% of Democrats (and 17% of the entire sample, plus another 14% who weren't sure) think the country would have been better off if Trump had been killed. If that doesn't horrify you, regardless of how you vote,  I don't know what to say. This is beyond out of hand. A plurality of the sample (45%) thinks anti-Trump rhetoric was responsible.\n\nSorry Eli, I respectfully disagree. Two things can be true at the same time. For example, it is true that we, as a society, have agreed that criminal guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt because we believe it is better that some guilty people go unpunished than for one innocent person to be punished. At the same time it can be true that an accused person who is found not guilty may have actually committed the crime. With respect to free speech, It can be true that we, as a society, have agreed to draw the line,  to use an example from the Supreme Court, at yelling fire in a crowded theater. Therefore, remarking, \"Wouldn't it be would be really cool if someone yelled fire in this crowded theater\" is tolerated free speech, but actually falsely yelling fire in the crowded theater is not. Similarly, as Eli posits, calling someone a Nazi or an existential threat can be protected free speech, while trying to kill that person is not, and it is the attempted killer who is legally responsible for their illegal act not the prior speaker who exercised their right of free speech. At the same time it can also be true that there can be a causal link between what one person says while exercising their right of free speech and someone else taking illegal action based on what the other person said. Thus, it can be true that numerous, prominent influencers frequently and repeatedly, over a span of years, calling President Trump a Nazi and an existential threat can have radicalizes listeners to those messages into believing they need to act illegally to neutralize that alleged threat. While we may have agreed, in the name of free speech, not to invoke the the power of government to prohibit such speech (or using ugly or coarse language or burning the American flag, etc.), it remains the right of all private citizens to exercise their rights of free speech to express their belief in the existence of a causal link between inappropriate or dangerous protected free speech and illegal actions of others, and to condemn such a speech and to stigmatize and shun those who engage in it. Thus, if you happen to be sitting in a crowded theater and the person next to you says, \"Wouldn't it be cool if someone yelled fire,\" it is perfectly acceptable for you to respond, \"No it would not, and you should be ashamed of yourself for even thinking such a thought, and do not ever let me hear you express such a dangerous and stupid thought ever again.\" In fact, I respectfully suggest that if we do not, as private citizens, exercise our right of free speech to call out and condemn those who engage in inappropriate or dangerous protected free speech, then we only hasten the erosion our precious right of free speech. Strongly believing that, although we may disagree with what someone says, we must defend their right to say it does not mean that we should muzzle ourselves from expressing our disagreement. Further, I suggest, the more inappropriate and dangerous what they said is, the greater our obligation to express our disagreement and condemn what they said. It is disingenuous in the extreme that the same people who repeatedly call President Trump a Nazi and existential threat disavow any responsibility for the two assassination attempts (so far), yet at the same time call for President Trump to be prosecuted for the actions of others on January 6, 2001.\n\nThis is what Nancy Pelosi said about Trump just before the Butler assassination attempt.  \"This is not a normal election where you want to win and if you don't, you cooperate and do the best you can for the country and hope to win the next time. This is something that is undermining our democracy. He must be stopped. He cannot be president.\"  (quoted in RealClearPolitics 07/02/2024).  This is not the same as saying your opponent's policies would be bad for the country, that he is \"gonna put y'all back in chains,\" that he is Putin's puppet, that his personality is disagreeable.  Extreme rhetoric is baked into the First Amendment and is a normal part of our political process.  Pelosi's statement is different in that she explicitly rejects the normal democratic process, ostensibly to protect democracy itself, a stance which logically predicates some kind of extraordinary intervention.  As I see it, this kind of rhetoric is only coming from one side.\n\nEli is absolutely correct.  The trap is sprung and you can now see the end game for first amendment principles.  The fruit was too low for too long.  It's much easier to lazily claim words are violence than to have discourse about the benefits of your own ideas.  Not click baity enough.  The legal definition of incite used to be a word of art in the context of free speech.  Apparently now everything \"incites\".\n\nI see clips of political debates from the 80's and 90's and wonder what happened in the interim.  We've lost our ability to be civil, witty and funny while making serious political points.  It's now devolved into existential threats to drive voter turnout.  I'm hoping the last 10-20 years is simply a test period we'll look back upon with wonder.  Somewhere the algorithms decided you only have to call the other side names and there's no requirement to talk with the public to prove your ideas are better for the country.  Better yet, we need to stop others from publicly challenging our ideas.\n\nThe authoritarians unfortunately have coaxed us to the edge of this slippery slope.  One day soon me publicly chastising govt policy will be determined by the govt, the sole authority to determine that which is true or civil, to be seditious or hate speech worthy of jail time.  You may say that's hyperbole.  Just wait.\n\nIt's happening in Spain. Today. Big brother is here and his name is Pedro Sanchez and his socialist/communist coalition government which will now forever remain in power.\n\nI wanted to like this article's conclusion, but the trip there was full of potholes ; p Democrats call Trump a \"threat to democracy\" because of his conduct around the 2020 election and Jan 6, period, which has continued to infect the GOP since, with a large percentage of Republican officeholders at least cynically playing along with \"stolen election\" rhetoric as a vehicle to attempt to disenfranchise large numbers of voters (presumed to be voting Democratic) and to give powers to county elections boards run by True Believers to toss out results without any standards of proof of fraud, or to otherwise gum up the works to create chaos and doubt around results that will be close and determinative. You can agree or disagree that \"stolen election\" is a Big Lie, but you can't disagree that this is the viewpoint of the vast majority of Democrats and their voters. It's entirely rationale, therefore, for Democrats to clearly state that Trump is a threat to democracy on that basis and oppose him on that basis, and not \"extreme rhetoric\" that just demonizes Trump because they dislike his \"policies\" (he needs to have some to dislike).\n\nOn the other hand, Trump and his supporters regularly state that Democratic leaders, any Trump opposition (including Republicans and former Republicans), the entire media that is not explicitly right wing friendly, all institutions coded as \"left\", and by extension the 50% or so of Democratic voters are \"evil\", \"enemies within\", \"destroying the country\", \"hate America\", \"hate YOU (Trump supporters)\", \"if I (Trump) don't win you won't have a country anymore\", are \"communists\", \"Marxists\", \"pedophiles\", they will \"steal your sacred elections (if there's any result that Trump doesn't win)\", and I'm probably just reciting the top phrases from Trump's Truth Social posts in the last 24 hours. His rallies are filled with the same rhetoric, and it's these lines that really get the crowd going and cheering, Harris was right, however that they get bored when he goes on 10 minute long discursive rambles about sharks, electric boats and Hannibal Lecter - but talk about \"locking up\" various Democrats (which started back in 2016 with of course \"Lock Her Up\" led chants about HRC) and taking \"revenge\" on \"his\" enemies (which are of course \"yours\" too!) and all the supposed \"predations\" of the left gets the crowds going.\n\nHas anyone considered that the recent shooter (the first one I believe was shown not to have an anti-Trump fixation at all but just wanted to go out on a Big Historical Note of assassinating an Important Person, who was equally open to shooting Biden or Trump, and Trump \"won\" just because he happened to holding an even in the area) was motivated not by Democratic \"rhetoric\" about Trump, but about Trump's own words? How is it not as likely that Trump calling an entire political party and its voters and associating it with every cultural trend they dislike \"evil\" and \"destroying America\" is not inciting folks against him directly? I don't need to watch \"MSNBC\" or hear Trump's words sane-washed by NY times or have Kamala Harris tell me what he is saying is bad - anyone can hear it straight from Trump himself, so I'm surprised there's not even a tiny bit of introspection here that Trump may be the one inciting the crazies himself - both the ones for him as well as the ones against him.\n\nBlaming the \"victim\"? Maybe, or just calling it like I see it. You can't really believe that anyone who is upset about Trump's rhetoric is only upset because Democrats are telling them Trump's a bad guy, that they can't see, read and hear Trump's rhetoric themselves, and ask yourself if there's any reason whatsoever for a certain type of mindset to find any of that threatening on its own, regardless of what Democrats do or do not say about it. Trump has made his entire political career about being deliberately polarizing, belligerent and over the top rhetorically. His supporters have reveled in this. Unfortunately that comes with risk in a nation awash in high powered guns easily accessible by pretty much anyone including very unstable and dangerous individuals - blaming \"the Democrats\" for people reacting to stuff they can see and hear plainly coming from him, if at that is the case, is not going to alter the risk - even if Harris only talks about Trump's ridiculous tariff \"policy\" Trump's still out there talking about the \"enemies\" he wants to punish if he gets back into power, and of course the 2020 election fallout of Trump's \"Stolen Election\" lies and Jan 6 is hardly that far back in the rearview for anyone to put that together and conclude for themselves that \"Trump is a threat to democracy\". I'm not justifying attempts on his life btw, the only way to beat him is once again at the ballot box and this time be ready for the tantruming, at least he won't be running the federal government for over 2 months after the fact - but if we're looking around for reasons as to why someone with access to guns and planning would want to take out Trump because of \"rhetoric\", consider what the \"rhetoric\" might be and where it's coming from that they're responding to.\n\nOr...people's political expressions shouldn't be cause for violence and we should stop rationalizing criminal behavior because it's committed against the other side.\n\nYou're not nearly as smart as you obviously think you are.\n\nah well ;p\n\nSummarized...trump started it.\n\nMaybe? If that's how you want to interpret it. Look, 99% of the responses are outraged that Eli Lake concluded with the shooters not being motivated by DNC or MNSBC \"extremist rhetoric\" - of course they want to blame \"Democrats\" and \"the media\". I first disagree that the vast majority of what is said about Trump in those spaces is \"extremist\" in the first place, but then second in response to the overwhelming belief within the commentariat this could only have been caused by Democratic \"rhetoric\", what makes you so sure? Do you think Trump is only filtered to people outside of his base through the Democratic Party and MSNBC? That if the possibility exists that Shooter #2 at least was motivated by a personal animus to Trump that was formed by consuming anti-Trump rhetoric, then it's equally as possible that they were reacting directly to the things Trump says and has done and promises to do - himself. I'm pretty sure someone who is already predisposed to say, support Ukraine's and oppose Putin has a pretty clear vision of where Trump and a Trump Administration would stand on this issue if elected (if we're to understand this issue was at least partially motivating to the shooter) just by listening to Trump and observing his record regarding, they are probably not getting that view provided to them by Democratic campaign talk, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, etc. They probably *agree* with that more or less consensus view, but they most likely formed it directly as a result of hearing Trump and not Biden or Harris describing Trump's position.\n\nAgain, everyone here is behaving as though Trump is not able to be heard and interpreted on his own, and that the very invective sort of rhetoric that Trump regularly engages in could not be as inciteful to violence from those who oppose him as much as it could be inciteful to those who support him, in different ways. If you're blaming \"rhetoric\", Trump's rhetoric cannot be excluded from it.\n\nDoes that mean he should tone it down too, as many want to demand of the Democrats and \"media\"? That Democrats should basically abandon any sort of negative campaigning on Trump on any aspect of his fitness for Office, maybe just drop out the race and let him win by default, hey why not lol - that seems to be the jist here. Bad things happened to Trump, we blame Democrats, they should basically just let Trump win or we'll continue to blame them if more bad things happen. Well that's not gonna happen :) So Trump is going to continue to Trump, Democrats will continue to prosecute the case against him on mostly the grounds of his fitness for Office, followed by some terrible policies that he has at least partially articulated, and in a nation with access to millions of guns and lots of unstable people and an election season that is going to be very likely contentious and fraught - in big part due to how Trump is already framing any potential loss of his - well, shit's gonna happen regardless, so Trump just better beef his security if he wants to continue to campaign in belligerent and threat mode. But let's not pretend that is not contributing to the kind of environment that produces assassination attempts, even if it gets directed back at him, or at his opponents.\n\nAnd look - if Harris had an assassination attempt on her by someone who claimed they did it because they got upset about her talking about clamping down on social media disinformation, they view that as a dangerous attack on the First Amendment. They also think that is a backhanded attack on conservative viewpoints. Now they might have been incited by hearing only Republican and Trump and Fox News rhetoric about this policy - where they also disagree with Harris's policy and basically concur with the shooter regarding its implications. Or they may have heard her comments regarding in a campaign speech, debate or wherever and formed that opinion directly. Is Harris \"at fault\" for inciting the shooter? No, but her statements are out there as being potentially divisive, and yet so are the statements of Republicans and Trump claiming she wants to jail conservatives and end free speech and is a threat to the Constitution. The shooter believes those things too, but maybe as an individual highly motivated around issues of the First Amendment and highly engaged in right wing social media conspiracy theory corners they are very sensitive to that sort of \"threat\" and also happen to be very unstable and have access to a gun. They probably would have taken the shot even if Trump limited his criticism to this policy of \"government overreach\" and left out the \"threat to the Constitution\" and \"hates conservatives\" stuff. Not the best example but hopefully you can see the distinction. And I certainly don't mean to compare something Harris has said about online disinformation as really belonging in the same category as Trump's regular outbursts about Harris being an \"America hating Democrat that will destroy this country\" as his general frame of attack against her, which is why it's a poor example - Harris has simply not engaged at the same level of eliminationist sort of rhetoric of which is what makes the Trump situation so unique.\n\nSo following your line of thinking, the  lady who goes out to a bar in the short skirt and low cut top can expect to be raped? Asking for a friend.\n\nIf I understand you correctly, it is Trump's rhetoric that is the reason for the BLM riots in Democrat-run cities.\n\nThank you for opening my eyes!\n\nOf the stew of ingredients that produced the Summer 2020 riots, yes Donald Trump was *one* of the many matches tossed into the fire, at least in part due to his failure at leadership and crisis management - and the long simmering cracks he helped widen in differences and relations, particularly racial. Sorry for the mixed metaphor though!\n\nIf it makes you feel better, I do hold local and state officials accountable as well that allowed disorder to continue for far too long, and minimized their responsibility for public safety and order.\n\n\"If it makes you feel better\" - No, it doesn't.\n\nI remember \"mostly peaceful protests\", students in London screaming to police \"Don't shoot\" (in London!), red vaginas. Of course, Trump ignited them. He was elected by Putin, who also created Cambridge Analytica and Brexit.\n\nYou know what's most interesting. Progressives never admit their own mistakes. Never! On the contrary, the more stupid mistake they make, the more efforts they make to go in the wrong direction, following Hegel's maxim \"if facts contradict theory, then so much the worse for the facts.\"\n\nNetZero to 2030 is a classical example of this arrogance of educated idiots.\n\nThere's a big difference between blaming speech and banning it.  Blaming speech is itself speech!  As long as it's a citizen asking others to tone it down, let's stay out of the way.  If the government is trying to make them tone it down, then we have work to do.\n\nHave to disagree with Eli on this one.  The man who tried to shoot Trump in Florida was on a \"Hero's Journey.\"  That's why he went to Ukraine. To be a hero, both to himself and the world.  And what better way to be a hero -- to the media, the Left, the elite -- than to shoot today's Hitler.  There are many more such people at loose, and they will be watching for their curtain call.\n\nThe left says \"silence is violence,\" questioning their dogma is violence, asking questions is violence, Trump is Hitler and the end of democracy, etc etc while condoning actual violence as \"protest.\" I am a free speech absolutist but you cannot reasonably equate what the two sides here are doing. It is not the same.\n\nTDS, TDS, TDS.  Pretty simple, Eli.\n\nBookended as it was by Secret Service ineptitude and FBI secrecy, Butler unfortunately bears the taint of potential involvement more than rhetorical inspiration. But saying that would just motivate more pointless squabbling like cats and dogs."

      "text": "Radical Democrats are energized by Harris's progressive veep pick. That's a problem for the party, writes Eli Lake.\n\nWhat makes Walz a radical? This column never addresses that. Walz is very popular with moderates in Minnesota, and for good reason.\n\nThis is what happens when people stop listening to each other. Imagine what a landslide win the Democrats could achieve with a moderate with backbone. Instead we have windsock, faux-radicals.\n\nHow can I get more accurate info on Walz? Everything is so partisan..I read one thing then its modified or softened by some other source. It's hard to know what's accurate. And, being friendly or charming isn't enough for me any more in a candidate running for president or Vice President. Being glib doesn't make you right, it makes you glib. Being charming doesn't make you right it just makes you charming. I'm over the the charm offensive and the quick quips. I want to see where they stand on policy. My concern is they lie to win, then swing hard left.  That's what Biden did. Harris isn't even pretending. Scary.\n\nRespectfully one only has to look at the economic data to start.   If that wasn't enough to scare the pants off you, you could then look into how he withheld the National Guard during the blm riots.  All factual.\n\nWhere do you go for the economic info? Wall Street Journal? Agreed, very concerning his reaction to the riots.\n\nThat's a good place to start because they provide sources.  I then go to the sources themselves.\n\nThat's not surprising.  Tim Walz is representative of all the wrong people.\n\nWalz's record in Minnesota is crazy left.\n\nThe GOP can easily win without the Charlottesville scum. The Democrats cannot win without the pro-Hamas wing of its party, which is about 40 percent of its voters under age 35 and  20 percent of the rest. Truth is beauty, and beauty truth. That's the true story, so the MSM is desperately trying to turn Gov. Walz into Edmund Muskie whike the Democratic left knows he's more George McGoverrn.\n\nMcGovern won one state in 1972, partially for advocating appeasement of our enemies.\n\nBut, appeasement sounds more like Trump/Vance than Harris/Walz to me.\n\nI'm not voting for that.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nI see it's time for a simultaneous dual screen rewatch of Idiocracy + the Republican convention.\n\nIt might be hard to tell which is which.\n\nWas Hulk Hogan running for reelection?\n\nOr was that President Camacho?\n\nCheck out the movie folks, whatever your persuasion.\n\nUmm ... Iran cash? Failure to attack the Houthis with authority? Green light for modest Russian action in Ukraine? Or does that all go down the Democratic Ministry of Truth memory hole too?\n\nOpen borders ... energy failures ... inflation ... gender ideology and DEi ... the list of failures of a long one.\n\nHarris's team are desperately trying to roll back the news she met with, and supports a group that wants to leave Israel defenseless.  Putin, Xi and the Iran mullahs were emboldened during the Biden administration - and the Obama administration before that.  They were surprisingly quiet during Trump's presidency.  I think appeasement might mean something different than you think.\n\nThe author, and many commenters here, seem to confuse Tim Walz with Ilhan Omar. I get it. They do look kind of alike. He'd look better in a head wrap for sure. So yeah, let's save our country and our democracy. Vote for the guy who doesn't respect the results of elections. Stop the Steal, and all that. Makes perfect sense.\n\nDid Hillary respect the results of the election? Did Stacy Abrams?\n\nDoes this mean I should vote for the rapist with the top secret nuclear war plans in his bathroom? Sounds reasonable.\n\nTrump was never convicted of rape. Anyone who would believe E Jean Carroll was raped is very naive.\n\nForgive me, but I disagree.  As he was entitled to in a democracy, Trump question the results of the election.  He did not incite the riot - in his speech he clearly advocated a peaceful march on the Capitol.  Now talk to me about Schumer threatening SCOTUS that it would \"reap the whirlwind\".  Read Matt Taibbi's article on how Biden has weaponized the FBI against Tulsi Gabbard.  Then come back to me about those who don't respect democracy.\n\nYes. But don't you see. Hilary and Stacy Abrams questioning elections = heroes of democracy and freedom. Trump? No that's insurrection. 🤷‍♀️\n\nMegyn Kelly Reveals the Truth on the Military Record and \"Stolen Valor\" Claims About Tim Walz\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-A2avP9iXA&t=4s\n\nAug 8, 2024\n\nMegyn Kelly begins the show by discussing the truth about MN governor and Dem VP pick Tim Walz's military record, the reality about him leaving the National Guard, \"stolen valor\" claims and the facts, how Walz and the left are trying to spin this massive controversy, and more.\n\nMost of my parents' parents, brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles died in the Holocaust.  I grew up aggressively sensitive to antisemitism, never allowing it to go unanswered.  Luckily, during my football days I was 6'4' and weighed 250, but it was the principle of 'Never Again' that guided my words and actions.\n\nI was involved with SDS and it chaotic, violent protests throughout the '60's.  My awakening came during the early '70's.  All my fellow 'revolutionaries' began supporting the 'Palestinian freedom fighters'.  These people are the ancestors of today's democrats.  It was a time when those terrorists were wantonly murdering Jews around the world.  This caused me to step back and reassess.\n\nThen came the '72 Olympics.  Avery Brundage, a Hitler supporter from the '36 Olympics wanted another Munich setting.  Providing little security for Israel, the terrorists murdered a number of the Israeli athletes and were allowed to fly away.  The next day, Brundage continued the competition with hardly a hesitation, and democrats in the US were relatively silent.\n\nWhile I did not trust Nixon, I left the democrats and eventually came to cast my ballot in 1980 for Mr Reagan.\n\nThe radicals have driven the democrat bus over the cliff of reason, propriety and objectivity.  They are well on their way to becoming a terrorist organization.\n\nMr Scholl and C24:\n\nHumanity has always searched for a scapegoat (the precept of Rene Girard) to divert attention from its evil and its failings. \"It is not our fault, they made me do it.\" (This ignored the insight of Solzhenitsyn, The line between good and evil goes through the individual human heart). The Jews have been historically the most vulnerable and most frequently were \"served up\" by the then current elites to assuage their guilt.\n\nJerusalem and Athens are the political and intellectual foundations of the West. The lessons were learned and were successful.\n\nHowever, currently the West has been crippled and compromised by Dostoyevski's precept, Without God everything is allowed. The West has no values. Concurrent with this, China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea have decided to fill the vacuum created and destroy the West, Europe and America.\n\nIsrael, contrary to historical context, has decided to say NO. How dare they. Aren't the Jews supposed to do our bidding and submit, as in the past.\n\nIsrael is the Churchill, while Europe and America are the Chamberlain, the latter crippled by a distorted world view, a situational ethics and \"tolerance\" approach, hoping against hope that all of this, the current Nazis, Iran, China, etc will go away. They will not. Confrontation is the only currency available. Heaven help us.\n\nThe West used to have values, we can have them again, but we must provide sanity to prevail. Very well composed response to Mr. Scholl and C24.\n\nOne of those values used to be respect for the results of elections.\n\nHopefully we can get back to that by rejecting politicians who don't.\n\nThank you, I appreciate your framework for viewing the situation.\n\nI too am a child of parents who survived Auschwitz, the Warsaw Ghetto and other camps and ghettos but whose other family members were murdered for being Jewish.  I had no one to celebrate holidays with but my parents and brother. My parents were damaged with PTSD (then not spoken of). But they loved America and Israel. I was against the Vietnam because I did not want my  brother to go, it would have killed my parents again. I saw the democrats start to turn and heard the jargon on college campuses where I worked. DEI but not for Jews. Summer Lee seeing Harris' rejection of Shapiro as a \"f..ing\" victory is scary. Bowman, Omar, Bernie clearly Anti-semites cheering Walz because it was not Shapiro looks like the 1930s. My vote may not count in a blue state but my message will be all republican across the board.  My pro-choice mindset be damned. My People and Israel come first.\n\nBrundage was rotten.\n\nI don't love Harris/Walz, but I hope they win because Trump actually is a con man and a liar and an authoritarian loving fool.\n\nThere is a word for him in Yiddish---schnorrer.\n\nOld Captain Bone Spurs must go\n\nYou honestly believe Kamala ISN'T a con woman? Bone spurs? I don't recall hearing anything about Biden serving. Look at Walz! Stolen valor!\n\nHmm. That's not even close to what schnorrer means. The dems are the schnorrers their hands out, their votes bought with college loan payouts and a perpetual welfare state. Trump is lots of things but not that.\n\nI can understand not loving everything about Trump and I understand the 8 year over the top propaganda war by mainstream media, Hollywood, big tech, and more has convinced a lot of people that Trump is a con man and an authoritarian.  But I am sorry, those attacks just are not true.  He is a Patriot that supports and defends our Constitution.  You cannot be an authoritarian and pro-Constitution.  He of course puffs stats and information (like all politicians do), but he does not lie on important things.  He is not a politician so he honestly tells you what he is going to do in office... Harris/Walz are going to lie to the American people for the next 100 days... they will not tell American voters what they stand for and what they want to do in office.  To me that sounds like liars and con men.  And they will be the true authoritarians... take your guns, take freedom of speech, go after your political enemies, etc.  I am sure my words did not sway you... but if you are looking for honesty and a President who will not govern like an authoritarian, then your vote should be with DJT.\n\nyou love Harris/Walz enough to vote for the antisemitic left\n\nThere is a word for you in Yiddish - a schmuck.\n\nI've been called way worse, and I appreciate your input\n\nGefehrlekh\n\nTrump is a con man? An authoritarian? Here is the democrat left (you apparently prefer):  anti-first amendment, anti-equality under the law, the border, inflation, Afghanistan, Israel support, China and Ukraine corruption, wokeism, covering up Biden's mental problems, biological men in women's sports, lawfare, illegal student loan forgiveness, weak military, sanctuary cities, trillions on wasted climate change, and many more. If you agree with all this, by all means vote for Harris. But you, and everyone, should consider voting based on beliefs not personalities.\n\nAbsolutely true. Let's not forget their horrid Covid policies. How many lost their jobs because they wouldn't \"show their papers\"? While millions of unvaxxed invaded through open borders. And anyone who disagreed was silenced for \"misinformation\" by the ministry of truth. It's Orwellian at best. A nightmare.\n\nI don't know much about Walz so not going to comment. But I am still dumbfounded that the issue of Gaza is something that has suddenly become one of the main criteria for voting and choosing candidates. It would be one thing if there were boots on the ground but there aren't. Yes, the US is supplying weapons, but they're also doing that in many other far flung conflicts that these people are happy to ignore in favor of the war du jour. I do understand why but at the same time I also don't understand. To me it seems like the majority of Americans care more about groceries, housing, community safety, so why wouldn't you make your choices and run your campaigns on that rather than be beholden to a small group of people who are obsessed with a conflict that up until Oct 7th they clearly had no interest in?\n\nBecause, it's part of the bigger narrative.  Which makes it more crazy.  Narrative: Israel, BAD.  Anything that opposes Israel GOOD.\n\nI would bet dollars for donuts that, Americans care about more important things.  And I would double down on my donuts that Americans care that there are STILL AMERICAN hostages from October 7th\n\nOne could even broader it out further....Israel: powerful, white or white adjacent; Palestine: lacking power, non-white. It's a brand of Marxism with a racial twist.\n\nI appreciate and respect the pragmatism of your sentiments.  Here is why Gaza/Israel/Iran/Hezbollah matter to me:  In my lifetime I have watched the U.S. bail on several far flung wars du jour.  While these were  ill-conceived and dishonorably concluded, none of the counties in question was a first-world highly developed country.  The relationship between Israel and the U.S. has been longstanding and arguably as deep as our relationship to NATO.  Israel is now in a very real existential crisis and if it fails, the standing of the U.S. will plummet in the eyes of our other near-peer comparable allies, e.g. Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.  Those countries matter in ways that Afghanistan and Iraq never did.  The BRICs countries are committed to converting the world away from the U.S. dollar reserve based economy.  The perceived unreliability of the U.S. as an ally to a country like Israel would be a long stride toward losing our status as world economic hegemon.  Not that long ago the Pound Sterling was the world's reserve currency, a status it lost as the British Empire declined.  From a practical standpoint, if the U.S. Dollar is ever likewise dethroned, concerns about groceries, housing, etc. will grow exponentially.  I am not Jewish, but given the way the chess board is arrayed, our fate is linked to Israel's.\n\nThis is all true. The Jews have always been the canaries in the coal mine of the west. And we have an administration that empowered and funded Iran, then told Israel this the last time they'll come to their aid. It doesn't bode well for anyone if Iran is free to run ripshod over the region.\n\nYet another reason to back Ukraine. Putin & Xi have the dollar squarely in their sites. An America that is perceived as unreliable is a danger, to itself.\n\nOh I agree with you - it's more that this has now becoming a grousing point on the far left to the exclusion of all else (I am centre/left of centre) and it is driving efforts to derail anything that is deemed even remotely supportive of Israel.\n\nSadly, the democratic party has been taken hostage by an illiberal cabal of neo-socialists who have no understanding of history and who seek to undermine our Constitutional order and its foundational tenets. Mr. Trump's character flaws and sophomoric conduct remain troubling; even so, his policies on national defense, separation of powers, the 2nd amendment, Israel, deregulation, immigration, energy independence and traditional American values remain firmly in the center.  To paraphrase a friend of mine, if forced to choose between a socialist who seeks to imposed California values on the Republic and a jerk, I am going to vote for the jerk.\n\nBut he's meeeeean.  And abortiona bortionabortion.\n\nBrilliant comment - summarizes my position better than I could've said so myself.\n\nCheck out Lewis Carroll's \"The Walrus and the Carpenter.\"\n\nKamala Harris = The walrus\n\nTim Walz = The carpenter\n\nThe oyrsters are us - but we won't be issues invitations to a walk at the seaside we can refuse. We'll be frog marched at gunpoint (we won't be allowed any firearms, but they will retain theirs) into being their supper.\n\nPlease remember the far left predictable USA radical Garrison Keillor wrote the Prairie Home Companion so NPR could wallow in nostalgia of Lake Webegon as they promoted their new world order of no borders, no women or men, awful public schools and fascists institutions masquerading as elites.\n\nLake Wobegon, where all the men are women, the women are whatever they say they are, and all the children are illiterate.\n\nWhat if he were radically pro-Israel?\n\nMaybe, but so are people across the Democratic Party.  Who are the \"right people\"?\n\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/bring-normality-back-joe-manchin-and-other-moderates-praise-harris-selection-of-tim-walz/ar-AA1olpM7"

      "text": "He called himself a QAnon Tier I Ranger SEAL Operator, and had the 17 tabs down one sleeve to prove it. \"In a situation like this, Embed, you stick to me and I'll get you home, brother. Unless the GPS gets us lost again.\"\n\nBehind the wheel of his F-150, looking for parking near the state capitol, I knew he meant it. The eyes, always the eyes. In the backseat was his AR-15 with the handle on top, equipped with several dozen accessories from Bass Pro. His personal gear said he was ready, clothing half in arctic-urban-backyard camo, half blaze orange. \"I can't afford this s*** unless I can get two seasons out of it,\" he said. He asked I call him \"Mike,\" though I found out on Facebook his real name is Michael. His tactical hair gel caught the light as he spoke.\n\n\"If we find free parking we approach from the east. If we have to feed the meter, I come in from the north.\" The tactical radio rang. \"Honey, I told you it'll be after 6p.m. ... I don't know, get a pizza,\" he said in some sort of Pepe code.\n\n\"The mission today is to occupy the space in front of the CNN crew and dominate the interviews. CNN will identify themselves by removing their heads from their own butts, so watch for the signal. Stay frosty in case we spot Maddow and I call an audible. And bunch up so it looks like there're more of us.\"\n\nYou're right, that didn't happen. I made Mike up. It's funny.\n\nBut this did happen: Daily Beast published a \" scoop \" revealing one of the men charged in the January 6 riot had a fully assembled Lego model of the Capitol in his home, which the FBI insinuated was used as a tactical planning tool and thus seized as evidence. It formed part of the prosecution's argument against bail. It sounds like a joke.\n\nThe problem is that it wasn't true; the man merely had the unopened Lego set and the prosecutors lied. The accused rioter remains in jail. The Lego set is still available on Amazon .\n\nAnd this is also true and not so funny. Most of the 539 people arrested for the January riot did not commit acts of violence, and face accusations of little more than gussied up trespassing. Many were charged simply with violating a 6 p.m. curfew . Yet almost all have been denied bail and are being held in solitary as a \"safety measure\"-lockdown 23 hours a day.\n\nIn any other context such treatment of innocent people would raise a woke storm. The ACLU claims \"prolonged solitary confinement is torture and certainly should not be used as a punitive tool to intimidate or extract cooperation.\" Except, that is, in what has become a punitive political prosecution. The decision maker on jail conditions? Biden's attorney general.\n\nMeanwhile, after six months, the first person was finally tried. He pled to a misdemeanor charge of \"parading in the Capitol building\" and was given probation. The second prosecution ended with time served on a misdemeanor charge. Next up was a yet-unsentenced plea to \"obstructing Congress.\" Another trespasser had his bail revoked and was sent to solitary for leaving a voicemail to the court referencing \"the size of his genitalia.\" Brownshirt stuff, amiright?\n\nIn another pending case involving no violence or vandalism, prosecutors demanded maximum penalties, stating though \"individuals convicted of such behavior may have no criminal history, their beliefs make them unique among criminals in the likelihood of recidivism.\" A thought crime.\n\nThe single felony conviction out of all of this led to only an 8 month sentence for \"obstructing an official proceeding.\" Somehow not a terrorism, sedition, or treason charge to be found in D.C. Prosecutors demanded a much greater sentence by claiming the action was an \"assault on democracy.\" As a metric, Hitler was sentenced to 5 years for his failed \"beer hall putsch.\"\n\nOnly 534 cases more to go to see justice. Rarely have so many resources been used to accomplish so little.\n\nThis is true but not so funny, too. The day after the Capitol riots, the FBI asked Americans \" to step up \" and identify people who participated. Not only did friends and relatives rat each other out, but armies of unrelated people jumped at the chance to roleplay Stasi. Even somewhat news organization CNN helped identify people on behalf of the FBI. The New York Times published a guide to militia symbols so would-be sleuths could tell their Oathkeepers from their QAnons. The AP called these citizens \"sedition hunters\" as America weaponized the Kancel Kulture Kids into an e-mob.\n\n\"I put my emotions behind me to do what I thought was right,\" said Jackson Reffitt, whose GoFundMe hit $140,000 after he turned in his own father to the FBI.\n\nTech found its niche. While the mob was still in the Capitol, groups including Bellingcat scraped everything posted to build evidence for the FBI. Reddit users created a 12GB tranche of videos. Intelligence X (whose customers are \"companies of all sizes and governments\") has 1,300 files. The goal was to crowdsource identification so no rioter escapes.\n\n\"If you look at the history and incidents like the 1812 breach of the Capitol as well as the 1933 German Reichstag fire it highlights the need for accurate and original data in historical context,\" said Intelligence X's CEO. Wired reminds us how \"Previously, third-party groups archiving video and photo evidence have been crucial in the process of identifying war crimes happening in Syria.\" The 1812 breach was by the British Army in time of war. There was no fire, Reichstag or otherwise, on January 6, and certainly no war crimes.\n\nFurther extending the private sector's reach into Americans' rights and privacy, the Department of Justice hired a contractor (Deloitte at $6.1 million) to catalog all this tech-collected data, surrendering the decision of who is prosecutable to private industry. A judge recently put the project on temporary hold.\n\nWorking the other side of the operation, Facebook, Twitch, and YouTube deleted live streams of the Capitol riot and demonetized the accounts. Twitter went further, tagging Trump's tweets about the riot with a warning, deactivated most engagement \"due to a risk of violence,\" all before removing the Trump material completely. For next time, Facebook revealed it has a tool called CrowdTangle which tracks users' engagement levels with whatever the hell Facebook thinks is a right-wing media source. The tool is available only to selected academics and journalists, of course.\n\nAnd this is not funny at all. The FBI published a manual for citizens to use to report on each other for \"displaying a readiness to commit a violent act\" or even \"displaying a mindset oriented toward committing a violent act.\"\n\nMost of it is recycled from some post-9/11 \"How to Spot an Islamic Terrorist Under Your Bed\" campaign, making it even more obvious white militia is to be this generation's jihadi bogeyman. Though a jaunty warning reminds that many of the FBI's \"indicators\" are also constitutionally protected acts, such as owning a gun and criticizing the government, the main point is when in doubt, turn them in, Citizen.\n\nFunny as it is, despite the wishes of Democrats, their FBI, and their MSM, the January 6 riot was just not an attempt to overthrow the U.S. government or change an election. The rioters had absolutely no path to doing that, no mechanism for stopping Joe Biden becoming president. They hardly even qualified as vandals: no fires set, no destruction of priceless paintings or statues, no ransacking of files. They dispersed relatively quickly and simply went home. In contrast, BLM riots took multiple lives and did millions of dollars in damage across the nation for months.\n\nApart from fear mongering, the Democrats also have larger goals in mind. They want to get people used to working to further political law enforcement, and to become more comfortable with, if not demanding of, unequal law enforcement as a political tool.\n\nSo no surprise the Biden administration just unveiled a national strategy to combat \" domestic extremism,\" calling for ideological screening of government employees for ties to \"hate groups.\" The plan highlights a shift in the government's approach, which for decades prioritized fighting foreign terrorists. Those same tools of war will now be turned inward, on us, to validate the Democratic dystopia the party plans to run on. And that for sure is not funny.\n\nPeter Van Buren is the author of We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People , Hooper's War: A Novel of WWII Japan , and Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the 99 Percent .\n\nPeter Van Buren is the author of We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People , Hooper's War: A Novel of WWII Japan , and Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the 99 Percent .\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "An op-ed contributor to the NYTimes, Emily Tamkin, writes about \"How The American Right Stopped Worrying And Learned To Love Russia.\" She mentions me in her piece:\n\nMany of the admirers of the world's strongmen on the American right appear to believe that the countries each of these men lead are beacons of whiteness, Christianity and conservative values. On Wednesday, conservative commentator Rod Dreher wrote , \"I adamantly oppose risking the lives of boys from Louisiana and Alabama to make the Donbass safe for genderqueers and migrants.\"\n\nTypical moronic analysis. \"Beacons of whiteness\" - good grief. Emily Tamkin has an expensive education, but she is an ignoramus. At least she linked to the long post where I made that intentionally hyperbolic comment. Here's more context from that essay (emphasis in the original):\n\nTo repeat myself: I am opposed to Russia's actions in Ukraine. I think Russia should leave Ukraine alone, but whatever happens, I am adamantly against following the US leadership into hawkish actions against the Russians. It's not at all because I support Russia or in any way approve of what it's doing. (I hope Russian families and Russian soldiers stop to think about what exorbitant cost is extracted from them so that Putin can restore Greater Russia.) It's rather that I am sick to the point of puking of these people - the American elites - sh*tting all over so many of us, yet expecting us to send our sons (and daughters) to fight its damn wars. Especially when the goal is to extend American political and cultural hegemony over the world, to allow the Western-oriented elites in those countries to ruin the lives of the normal people in those places in the same way they have ruined ours.\n\nPut another way, I adamantly oppose risking the lives of boys from Louisiana and Alabama to make the Donbass safe for genderqueers and migrants. If that makes me a reactionary troll, fine, I'll own that. I love my country and would put my life on the line to fight for her against foreign invaders. But we are not the good guys I used to think we were. We can't even protect schoolgirls in Louisiana and Alabama from this toxic ideology that is destroying their moral sense, but they expect us to gear up in case we are called to fight for Ukraine?\n\nAnd, as you know if you've been reading this blog these past few days, I repeatedly condemn Russia's aggression against Ukraine. What you don't learn from Tamkin about what I wrote in that very post is that in it, I regret falling victim in 2002 to the right-wing warmongers who took us to the bad war in Iraq. Weirdly enough for someone Tamkin accuses of having a thing for whiteness, I mentioned favorably Muhammad Ali's apocryphal quote that he was refusing to go fight in Vietnam because he did not want to fight foreigners on behalf of a racist regime at home. In fact, the thrust of the entire piece was about how American elites of both right and left expect everybody to jump all aboard their military crusades, despite the fact that that same ruling class despises many of them as deplorable.\n\nNone of this context appears in the Tamkin piece. In fact, she not only smears me as pro-Putin, even though my denunciation of Russia's warmongering appeared in the very same column she quotes, but she also links conservative like Tucker Carlson, Pat Buchanan, and me to stone-cold racists and neofascists like Richard Spencer (who has publicly denounced me in the past) and Matthew Heimbach.\n\nThis is why I hate The New York Times, which epitomizes the utter dishonesty of the Left. All Tamkin seems to care about regarding the war is that critics of knee-jerk US militarism like me aren't onside regarding identity politics. The lives of our kids, I guess, are disposable to her in this potential war between the US and Russia. All she knows is that she hates Putin because he's a right-winger, so everyone who is not willing to rush idiotically into World War III can only be a bigot - and we know what they deserve, right?\n\nI was talking briefly this morning with an American conservative friend here about how the Left, and maybe even the mainstream Right, is dangerously out of touch with some grassroots conservative feeling about war and culture war. I told him that I heard from a conservative friend this weekend who told me about going to a class reunion, and meeting up with a bunch of his buddies who, like him, had either joined the military or gone into public service in some way immediately after 9/11 (they were in college then), because they wanted to serve their country. Today, not a single one of them would counsel their children to join the military. They no longer trust the US military leadership under this new regime of wokeness, and they think that the US Government, and elite society, hate them and their values.\n\nMy friend nodded his head, and agreed with me that wokeness is a national security issue. If we are in a new Cold War with Russia, the American people are going to need to find a way to unify, and be strong. Every single thing about wokeness - Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, all of it - is designed to exacerbate divisions along racial, sexual, and political lines, and demonize those who don't agree. You may not like political, cultural, and religious conservatives, and you may think white people are what's wrong with America - believe me, white people and others on the Right are well aware of how y'all think; you think we don't read you and listen to you? - but there are a lot of us in this country, and you are going to have to depend on us if we get into war. I have no doubt that most Americans would fight like hell against those who would invade this country. But enlist to risk being sent abroad for some stupid nation-building mission, or to spread at gunpoint the American idea of \"freedom and democracy\" when the same ideology is destroying our country from within? Not no, but hell no.\n\nI know - truly, I do - people who are grateful that they have guns, not because they think they're going to have to use them one day to fight invading Russians, but because they fear they might have to use them one day to fight Emily Tamkin's class. I used to think they were paranoid. After the Canadian truckers' protest, I no longer do.\n\nLet me put it to you liberal readers in a way you might be able to understand. A couple of years ago, when BLM was going strong after George Floyd's murder, many black football players in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) marched for BLM. I wondered how these older white men who coach SEC teams were going to react. Alabama's Nick Saban marched with his team; LSU's Ed Orgeron did not. I have no idea what Saban really thinks of BLM, but he at least had the sense to know that when your team is predominantly black, you cannot take the strong feelings of your black players for granted. Whether or not their cause was righteous, if you want these young men to play for you, you don't have much of a choice but to show them respect. After Orgeron was fired by LSU after two bad seasons, there was speculation that he lost the respect of black members of his team after equivocating on BLM.\n\nThis is the kind of thing I'm talking about. Had I been an SEC coach, I would not have wanted to endorse the BLM organization with my presence at a march. But the purpose of my job is to win football games, and realistic self-interest meant that I would need to show the young men whose labor I depended on to succeed that I respected them (if not their cause). You don't have to agree with them, but if you want them to help you accomplish your shared mission, you had better respect them.\n\nSame thing here. If the ruling class in the US - not just the government, but business leaders, university leaders, media leaders, military leaders, and the rest - want to be able to count on American men and women to continue to volunteer to serve in the military, it had damn well better start treating all of us with respect. The old-fashioned liberal values that held this country together until the day before yesterday, when wokeness arrived, can do it again. America is not an ethnostate, and is not held together by a common religion. We need civic nationalism - and that civic nationalism has to make room for political, religious, and cultural disagreement within a broader unity.\n\nWhen Biden took office, he signed a document moving LGBT advocacy to the forefront of US foreign policy goals. When I snarked about sending American troops to queer the Donbass, this is what I was referring to. The US elites have no idea at all how offensive and alienating this stuff is to many cultures around the world. It doesn't care. It's just going to roll right over those bigots.\n\nGay marriage rights is settled law in the US, and that's something religious and social conservatives like me have to live with. But the war now for transgender rights, waged by the US Government, law, medicine, woke capitalism, the media, and everybody else, is taking the form of a direct assault on children and families. The Hungarian government passed a law last year protecting children here from being propagandized for this stuff, and reserving that right to families. If you want to teach your children about LGBT, nobody's going to stop you. You just can't use schools and media to usurp the rights of parents to do so. I wish we had the possibility to pass similar laws in the US. It might not be constitutionally possible, but American conservatives should admire without apology the Hungarian government for taking that step.\n\nNone of this makes sense to the Emily Tamkins of the world. Their moralistic narcissism is all-encompassing. She sees no meaningful difference between disgusting neo-Nazis like Spencer and Heimbach, and normal conservatives who have put in a good word for Putin in the past, or at least are not eager to rush into another damn war. I see that she is now writing about American politics and culture for the British magazine New Statesman . I hope the UK lefties who subscribe understand what kind of narrow view of this country they'll be getting.\n\nThe war-and-culture-war problem is much broader and deeper than most of us know, I fear. This morning I had breakfast with a Hungarian friend, a young woman in her mid-twenties. Everybody here is worried about the Ukraine war spreading to Hungary. She told me that over the weekend, at family dinner, her younger brother, who is 21, said that if Hungary was attacked, he would leave the country. Everyone at the table was shocked by this. She told him that she, his sister, had already started looking into what kind of volunteer work she could do for the military in the event of war, and there he was, stating his plans to run away? She said her father came down hard on his son. Finally the young said okay, he would reconsider. But the fact that an able-bodied young Hungarian man, especially one raised in a conservative religious family, would feel that way about an attack on his homeland - that was very hard for them to take.\n\nI told her that a conservative Hungarian friend of mine had told me last summer how shocked and appalled he was to hear his son of the same age say the same thing. How many more Hungarian men of that generation feel the same way? I asked.\n\nMy friend had been present a couple of weeks ago when a big group of us met with PM Viktor Orban. She reminded me that Orban said in that meeting that he believed Hungarian culture's sense of manliness had declined. This from her brother, she said, was evidence that he's right. Now, you can't very well accuse wokeness of doing this to Hungarian men - Hungary is not (yet) a woke country - but something has happened here since the generation of 1956, which turned out in the streets to fight the Soviet invaders the same way the Ukrainians are fighting the Russian invaders today. If these two young Hungarian men we discussed at breakfast today aren't one-offs, but indicative of a broader softening in the younger generation of Hungarian males, then Hungary has a huge culture problem. Their own culture will have become a national security threat. With Russian soldiers rampaging through next-door Ukraine, this is not an abstract issue.\n\nI had to run out a few minutes ago to do an errand. While I was gone, I ran into a Hungarian friend, around age 30 I would say. I told her about the breakfast conversation, and asked her if she thinks this is a common problem. Yes, absolutely, she said, adding  that she observes the same attitude widely among Hungarians of her generation. \"The boys are so soft,\" she said. \"I see it in my brothers. That whole generation, they all have their heads stuck in their smartphones. They don't know what's going on in the world, and don't care. They have had life so easy.\"\n\nIf I were the US Government, or at least a DC think tank, I would commission a reliable study on if and how wokeness is affecting social cohesion, with special reference to the willingness of young people to join the military. Given the brand new reality that Mr. Putin has frog-marched us all into, this is really important information to have. See, it's not just alienated conservatives you have to worry about. Wokeness also tells people of color and other minorities that America is a shithole country whose history is nothing but racism, bigotry, and exploitation. Why, exactly, should young people who come to believe that narrative be willing to put their lives on the line to fight for America?\n\nJ.D. Vance brought a lot of opprobrium onto himself by saying in an interview a couple of weeks ago, before Russia attacked, that he didn't care what happened to Ukraine, because he was more concerned with all the people back home in America dying from drug overdoses. It was an unattractive way of making a good point, which was this: that America is rotting from within, and nobody in power in our country, in the government or the private sector, seems to give a damn, especially if those suffering people can be dismissed as backwards bitter-clingers who have the wrong ethnicity, the wrong politics, the wrong religion, and the wrong views about gender fluidity. You can roll your eyes and dump on J.D. all you like, but the man is telling an inconvenient truth. Many people in North America saw how the media and other elites made all kinds of excuses for the BLM riots that burned down parts of cities, and for peaceful BLM protests that violated everything the government advised about Covid social distancing. But when mostly white (but not exclusively white - hello, Sikhs!) Canadian truckers staged their own protest, the state set on them and went after their bank accounts.\n\nYou don't think people notice this stuff? You don't think they will remember it? Maybe you don't. But one day, you will.\n\nOne more thing: Emily Tamkin graduated from Columbia, and then earned a Master's degree at Oxford. From what I can find online, she is a New Yorker by birth. There is nothing at all wrong with being a New Yorker with an Ivy League and Oxbridge education, but I would guess that she doesn't know much at all about life in the rest of the country. Or care. That's her business, but if you live in that kind of elite professional, cultural, and geographical bubble, you shouldn't be surprised when the Americans you make a habit of sneering at and calling Nazis because they don't share your parochial views and priorities don't have any affection for you, or desire to take up arms to defend your contemptuous self.\n\nI am seeing among many Americans, of both Left and Right, an alarming unwillingness to consider any nuance in this Russia-Ukraine situation, as if to attempt to see the world through the eyes of one's enemies or opponents is immoral. I cannot say it often enough: this is exactly how I was in 2002, in the year the US prepared itself to go to war in Iraq. I did not want to hear the arguments of anyone who disagreed with my clear beliefs about the evil of Iraq, and the urgent need to launch a war in the Middle East to punish Islamic radicals of all sort. The fact that Saddam was an evil bastard, but the enemy of Islamists, did not matter to me. The claims that liberal democracy would not work in the Arab world, not because the Arabs were evil, but because they were not culturally prepared for liberal democracy, I dismissed as unimportant, and maybe even racist (\"So you're saying that Arab people are incapable of democracy, then?\"). The only thing I thought was that Americans and Europeans who opposed the war were either fools or cowards. It felt so good to be so righteous - indeed, on the Right Side of HistoryTM.\n\nWe are setting ourselves up for the same mistakes, only this time, the stakes could mean World War III. Or, if by the grace of God we get out of this situation without a wider war, we will still face years, maybe decades, of an armed standoff with Russia, and perhaps Russia and China both. We cannot afford our self-satisfied incuriosity and bigotry about people not like ourselves. That's true for all of us, conservatives and liberals alike. If you know anything about the period just before World War I started, European crowds all over the continent, and in the UK, were eager to rush off to fight, certain that war would be good for everybody, and would be over and done with quickly. The media were full of pro-war moralistic agitprop. It was all very jolly ... until reality liquidated everyone's delusions in the trenches.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "In 2015, Portland, Oregon, enjoyed its third year in a row as the number one moving destination in the country. Americans flocked to the City of Roses for its clean, lush environment, temperate climate, outdoor activities, and progressive culture. Miles of bike lanes, an extensive light rail system, city blocks designed for pedestrians, a burst of green buildings, and dedication to renewable energy also placed Portland as a national leader in sustainability.\n\nBut today Portlanders are fleeing en masse, many to Boise, Idaho. What has changed the minds of these Portland residents about the livability of their city? And what is it about Boise that is drawing so many Portlanders eastbound? Extensive violence compounded by a collapsing economy, out-of-control homeless problem, and high costs of living have left a once-thriving city heading towards demise.\n\nPortland police have responded to close to 200 shootings since January 2021-a surge of 116 percent-the highest increase compared to other cities across the country statistics show . Even Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler admits crime is a problem, nine months after his June 9, 2020, pledge to divert $12 million from the police bureau and other city departments defunded three police units, including the gun violence reduction team. According to a March 10 report , \"'We see it has reached crisis proportions,' said Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, speaking about the violence. 'We are collectively unified in our desire to bring an end to it.'\" That desire to quell the violence proves too little too late for many residents whose safety and livelihoods have been compromised beyond repair by passive, virtue-signaling politicians.\n\nWhile Portland's notorious reputation for months-long BLM riots and attacks on jails and courthouses by protesters has tainted its long-time status as one of America's most livable cities, Governor Kate Brown's unremitting COVID-19 lockdowns have extended the damage by ruining once-thriving small businesses.\n\nThe pandemic proved to be the final blow to many Portlanders, as Brown has maintained tight restrictions for more than a year. While other states around the country began lifting restrictions last summer, Brown lifted restrictions minimally, just to tighten them again in November. Gyms, salons, restaurants, and other small businesses across the city were unable to survive the extended lockdown. Anthony Smith of the Oregon National Federation of Independent Business issued a statement after the governor instituted the second freeze, stating:\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, the overwhelming majority of businesses have done everything asked of them in order to keep their employees and customers safe, which is why \"workplace outbreaks\" at businesses that were previously required to shut down account for a very low number of the state's total positive cases.\n\nIt simply doesn't make any sense to impose further restrictions on businesses that provide safer, regulated spaces for Oregonians to engage in economic and social activities in masked and socially distanced atmospheres.\n\nTo make matters worse, Portland's homeless problem is driving homeowners out of the area. Once a pristine city, boasting numerous public gardens, 150 miles of trails, and more than 200 parks, today a drive along Portland's major freeways and through the heart of downtown reveals mountains of trash, tarps, and tents, as well as graffiti and used needles.\n\nFor decades, Portland's lenient policies created a haven for transients. More recently, these policies have evolved from protecting those on the streets to rewarding them. Last year, city leaders handed out $500 gift cards to the homeless, and established camps , providing tents each on a 12-foot-by-12 foot plot of land near bathrooms, showers, and other amenities, fenced off from the public. More recently, Portland's City Council has proposed \"bending and breaking previous zoning rules to allow people in need of a safe place to sleep to find it, whether in RVs, tiny house villages, innovative semi-permanent structures and other non-traditional forms of shelter around the city\" according to the Oregonian . The proposal , as currently written, would allow temporary sanctioned outdoor shelters in open spaces including parks, natural areas, and public golf courses.\n\nWhile the homeless population reap government rewards, homeowners struggle to make ends meet as Oregonians pay the second highest income tax in the country. Thanks, in part, to this decade's technology boom, as well as an influx of rich, recent transplants from other states, average housing costs have risen steadily in recent years. KOIN 6 News notes, \"In January 2020, homes were selling for an average of 98.82% of the listing price. In January 2021, that number jumped to 103.9%, according to RMLS.\" A residential review of the Portland Metro area shows that between February 2020 and February 2021, the average sale price of a home has increased 14.8 percent from $460,200 to $528,500. Also, between the same months, the median sale price has increased 15.3 percent from $407,500 to $470,000.\n\nBurdened by increasing lawlessness, a collapsing economy, a large homeless population, and high living costs, businesses and residents have begun fleeing Portland, some to the suburbs, and many more out of state to Boise, Idaho.\n\nUnited Van Lines reports that Boise topped the list of inbound moves in 2020, and \"nearly two-thirds of this urban influx are well-educated millennials under 40, many of them relocating from much pricier West Coast metros like Seattle, San Francisco and Portland\" according to livability.com .\n\nAn average of 234 days of sunshine, over 90 parks, a lower cost of living, a growing art scene, and outdoor activities draw many transplants to the area. The \"Greenbelt\"-a 25 mile stretch of paved trail along the Boise River-is perfect for walking, biking, jogging, and wildlife watching. U.S. News describes Idaho's capital as sitting \"squarely on the boundary of urban and rural, civilized and wild, refined and raw.\" Furthermore, the promise of low crime, job stability, and conservative values are drawing many more Portlanders who yearn to raise their children in a safe, stable environment.\n\nBoise realtor Josh Rudzek, associate broker at Silvercreek Realty Group, uprooted his family and career as a Portland realtor three years ago to move to Idaho. In an interview, Rudzek noted, \"I've found that most of the people I meet moving from Portland are looking for stability and a culture that is more family-friendly and people-centric.\"\n\n\"A more conservative location tied in with a lower cost-of-living and vast recreational activities has made Boise and the surrounding areas an irresistible transition for buyers as they visit,\" he said. \"The Treasure Valley is reminiscent of old Oregon when housing was affordable, homelessness and crime were less, and a neighbor was willing to help out just because they were your neighbor.\"\n\nDionne and Brad Quick, longtime residents of Tigard-a Portland suburb-relocated to Boise last August with their two teenage daughters. In January 2020, Dionne realized her dream of moving her small business as a fitness instructor to people with special needs out of her home garage and into a local gym near Portland. She opened Uniquely Abled on March 3, 2020. But only weeks later, COVID-19 struck and her business, like many others, suffered. \"By the time gyms were approved to open, the stipulations were so severe, I was unable to bring in the revenue needed to pay for the expenses to run the studio,\" Dionne said. \"As a small gym, I relied on providing group sessions, but was unable to do so with social distancing and capacity limitations.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Dionne's husband, Brad, a deputy of 11 years with the Washington County Sheriff's Department, watched fellow police officers in neighboring Multnomah County stand toe-to-toe with protesters and rioters. Witnessing politicians and the public turn on police officers in Portland, he realized the seriousness of the situation. He made the difficult decision to quit his job with the sheriff's department after watching the poor treatment of Portland police officers and seeing crime skyrocket. Brad said he felt it was important to move his family to a safer city. \"Portland is filthy and unsafe even during the day,\" he said. \"Boise's leaders believe in law and order, which keeps the city safe. Unlike Oregon, which recently legalized all drugs, marijuana is illegal and violence is intolerable in Boise.\"\n\nAs Portland crime skyrockets, Boise crime has decreased 9 percent, according to Boise Police who credit, in part, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The department adds, \"The overall decline over the last few decades is also related to BPD's growing community policing efforts.\" Boise PD's 2020 annual report to the community reveals the department responded to 151,897 calls for service-that is 1,061 fewer than the previous year.\n\nHomelessness has not proven as significant a problem in Boise as in Portland to this point. According to the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, the entire state of Idaho had an estimated 2,315 people experiencing homelessness as of January 2019. This number stands in sharp contrast to the 4,177 homeless in the city of Portland alone as reported in May 2019. However, as Treasure Valley attracts new residents from along the west coast, rates of homelessness increase, as well. An NPR article notes that \"Like many western cities, Boise is in the midst of an extraordinary affordable housing shortage. It's also one of the fastest-growing cities in the nation, a source of tension in some corners.\"\n\nA potential silver lining to the threatening homeless problem is found in a burgeoning job market. In fact, Idaho took the No. 1 spot for its economic growth according to the 2021 U.S. News Best States rankings , also coming in strong for its business environment, growth, and employment. The article cites Bill Connors of the Boise Metro Chamber who stated, \"Our state government is stable. It's not doing wild shifts politically.... Yes, it's conservative and business-friendly, but it's stable.\"\n\nBoise's elected officials would be wise to learn from Portland's mistakes in dealing with the now-uncontrollable homeless problem, establishing solutions early on that will curtail sprawling camps that spill into residential neighborhoods and onto city streets.\n\nUpon her 2020 election, Boise's mayor Lauren McLean indicated that she recognized how increasing taxes related to escalating home values can cause financial struggles for residents. Because of this, she has made lessening property tax burdens a high priority. McLean did not raise Boise's property tax collections in the 2021 budget, nor did she make any substantial cuts to services for residents. But the 3 percent merit-based raise that city employees have received every year since 2014 was suspended this year to balance the budget and avoid increasing property tax rates. McLean would be wise to follow through and determine other areas where money could be saved to ensure residents who are housed remain that way.\n\nDespite the rising housing market, many Boiseans consider the city's growth an asset, recognizing the benefits of a booming economy thanks, in part, to entrepreneurs and startups introduced to the Treasure Valley. However, the common warning to newcomers remains clear: \"Don't Portland our Boise.\" The people of Boise have maintained a lawful city and thriving economy, which could be upended as by throngs of Portlanders, whose history of voting for dangerous policies and progressive politics has damaged a once-beautiful city and healthy economy.\n\nKathleen Bustamante is a freelance writer and college writing instructor in Portland, Oregon.\n\nThis New Urbanism series is supported by the Richard H.

Even leaving aside Democratic and deep state propaganda organs like MSNBC, the list above shows much more than \"collusion\" between the Democrats and the media; it shows participation. None of the hoaxes, from the massive effort expended on the Russia story to the almost silly tirades when Trump uses a word like \"bloodbath,\" would have been possible without the active participation of the media in promoting and shouting out the \"story.\"\n\nPerhaps the most compact example would be the 51 former intelligence officials claiming Hunter Biden's laptop looked like Russian disinformation. The group put out a press release but it took a triple punch to make it effective in the 2020 campaign. Punch one was the media dissemination without verification of the accusations. Punch two was Twitter in particular and the rest of the media in general deep-sixing the laptop story and failing even to lift a finger in investigation. Punch three was Biden repeating the accusations as fact in one of his debates with Trump. How could he lose?\n\nHe didn't. And that is the real takeaway here, the need to remain ever-vigilant against the misinformation machinations of the deep state, the Dems, and the media as we edge closer to the presidential election this November.\n\nPeter Van Buren is the author of We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People , Hooper's War: A Novel of WWII Japan , and Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the 99 Percent .\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "The president is not one bit sorry:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday defended as \"totally appropriate\" the speech he made at a rally last week that was followed by his supporters launching a deadly siege of the Capitol.\n\nIn his first live remarks since the violence last Wednesday, Trump deflected blame and sought to highlight other politicians' comments last summer about protests against racial injustice and police brutality.\n\n\"If you read my speech - and many people have done it, and I've seen it both in the papers and in the media, on television - it's been analyzed, and people thought that what I said was totally appropriate,\" Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews, en route to Alamo, Texas.\n\n\"And if you look at what other people have said - politicians at a high level - about the riots during the summer, the horrible riots in Portland and Seattle and various other places, that was a real problem, what they said,\" Trump continued.\n\n\"But they've analyzed my speech and my words and my final paragraph, my final sentence, and everybody - to the tee - thought it was totally appropriate.\"\n\nThis man deserves the most forceful repudiation possible. More than that, this country needs to know that its leadership, in both parties, regards this kind of behavior as utterly disqualifying for public office, or respect. A bright red line must be drawn and defended. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 in the House GOP leadership, has come out for impeachment. The Times reports that Sen. Mitch McConnell is saying that he would favor it, to make it easier for the GOP to purge itself of Trumpism:\n\nYet as they tried to balance the affection their core voters have for Mr. Trump with the now undeniable political and constitutional threat he posed, Republican congressional leaders who have loyally backed the president for four years were still stepping delicately. Their refusal to demand the president's resignation and quiet plotting about how to address his conduct highlighted the gnawing uncertainty that they and many other Republicans have about whether they would pay more of a political price for abandoning him or for continuing to enable him after he incited a mob to storm the seat of government.\n\nI find that dishonorable - worrying about whether or not you'll pay a greater political price for abandoning Trump. Of course many of them will. But it's the right thing to do. How about showing some leadership, for once? If the price of winning your next primary is remaining silent on the question of Trump and his post-election behavior, which culminated in the storming of the Capitol by a \"Hang Mike Pence!\" mob, then you have lost your priorities. If you cannot explain to voters why they are wrong to give a pass to a president who behaved as Trump has done, and what it means to have a president who fouls American democracy by rousing the rabble to break down the doors of the Capitol and shout for lynching the vice president, then why are you in public service? If that's what it takes to keep your job, why would you even want a job like that? Honestly, I do not get it.\n\nRoss Douthat discusses how Trump may well have destroyed the Republican Party . Excerpts:\n\nHere's how it could happen. First, the party's non-Trumpist faction - embodied by senators like Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski, various purple- and blue-state governors and most of the remaining Acela corridor conservatives, from lawyers and judges to lobbyists and staffers - pushes for a full repudiation of Trump and all his works, extending beyond impeachment to encompass support for social-media bans, F.B.I. surveillance of the MAGA universe and more.\n\nAt the same time, precisely those measures further radicalize portions of the party's base, offering apparent proof that Trump was right - that the system isn't merely consolidating against but actively persecuting them. With this sense of persecution in the background and the Trump family posturing as party leaders, the voter-fraud mythology becomes a litmus test in many congressional elections, and baroque conspiracy theories pervade primary campaigns.\n\nIn this scenario, what remains of the center-right suburban vote and the G.O.P. establishment becomes at least as NeverTrump as Romney, if not the Lincoln Project; meanwhile, the core of Trump's support becomes as paranoid as Q devotees. Maybe this leads to more empty acts of violence, further radicalizing the center right against the right, or maybe it just leads to Republican primaries producing a lot more candidates like Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, to the point where a big chunk of the House G.O.P. occupies not just a different tactical reality from the party's elite but a completely different universe.\n\nEither way, under these conditions that party could really collapse or really break. The collapse would happen if Trumpists with a dolchstoss [stabbed-in-the-back] narrative and a strong Q vibe start winning nominations for Senate seats and governorships in states that right now only lean Republican. A party made insane and radioactive by conspiracy theories could keep on winning deep-red districts, but if its corporate support bailed, its remaining technocrats jumped ship and suburban professionals regarded it as the party of insurrection, it could easily become a consistent loser in 30 states or more.\n\nAlternatively, a party dominated by the Trump family at the grassroots level, with Greene-like figures as its foot soldiers, could become genuinely untenable as a home for centrist and non-Trumpist politicians. So after the renomination of Trump himself or the nomination of Don Jr. in 2024, a cluster of figures (senators like Romney and Susan Collins, blue-state governors like Maryland's Larry Hogan) might simply jump ship to form an independent mini-party, leaving the G.O.P. as a 35 percent proposition, a heartland rump.\n\nRead it all.\n\nI don't see how the GOP avoids this fate. As Douthat points out early in his column, the Republicans have had to hold together during the Trump years by depending on having enough people who are able to tolerate Trump's excesses for the good things his presidency has meant for them, even if it's only keeping liberalism at bay. That's blown sky-high now.\n\nHe's talking about people like me. As bad as Trump was on many things, and even though I didn't vote for him, I found him tolerable, mostly because the alternative from an increasingly woke Democratic Party and liberal establishment was even worse. Besides, though Trump was a particularly flawed messenger, the populism that he brought to the Republican mainstream was on balance good for a party that could not seem to break free of zombie Reaganism.\n\nSo, when, on Election Night, Sen. Josh Hawley - for me, a real hope for the conservative future - tweeted out that the GOP is now a working-class party, I saw that as good news. Trump might lose, but the track he put the Republican Party on was a good one, I thought.\n\nBut then he started up with the Stop The Steal garbage, and disparaging election officials. He trash-talked Georgia election officials, and ended up costing the GOP the Senate, and giving the Democrats unified control of Washington. Then came January 6.\n\nThere is no way I will have anything to do with a QAnon party. None. What the MAGA mob did last week was vile and extremely unpatriotic, and if a party of the Right cannot condemn it meaningfully, then that party has not the slightest appeal to me. I don't understand how anybody can claim to love this country and support what that mob did, or even dismiss it as not so bad.\n\nEven though I really do believe Sen. Romney has acted with honor and courage in this crisis, I don't have any interest in a Romneyite breakaway party that would attempt to restore the pre-Trump status quo. The problem with Trumpism was Trump, not populism.\n\nNo doubt people like me are the smallest sliver in the conservative voter coalition, and we don't matter much anyway. Most Republican voters would be able to make a choice between the two right-of-center parties, I suspect. But such a split would mean a long-term era of Democratic dominance has arrived.\n\nWhether or not he is impeached and convicted, it seems unavoidable that Donald Trump will leave Washington having destroyed the Republican Party. If he had behaved just a bit more normally last year, he might have won re-election. Had he accepted his defeat like a normal person, he would have remained a kingmaker in the GOP, and could have been satisfied that he changed the Republican Party in his own image.\n\nBut that's not the choice he made. After the once-unthinkable damage that man has done to the Republican Party, to political conservatism, and to American democracy, he deserves total repudiation. Politicians that cannot muster the wherewithal to issue a rebuke to this president, or any president who behaves as Trump has done, is not one that is going to command respect, loyalty, or votes outside of the hardcore Trumpists.\n\nI had an extremely frustrating conversation this evening with a friend who believes all of this was invented by the Left to discredit the president. The narrative is unfalsifiable. It's not a question of a political disagreement; it's about living outside of reality. All day long I've been getting e-mails from people who are really suffering because beloved friends and family members - even elderly parents - are completely lost in this toxic unreality of paranoia and conspiracy. I've never seen anything like it in my life, aside from woke militants. Something demonic is in the air. We might not need an impeachment and conviction so much as we need an exorcism.\n\nIf you think I'm overreacting with the demonic stuff, take a look at this interview with Arieh Kovler, an Israeli analyst who follows the pro-Trump Internet, and warned on December 21 that a MAGA mob on January 6 was going to try to storm the Capitol. Excerpt:\n\nWhat did they think they were being called on to do?\n\nThey thought, \"This is the thing we have been asked to do. Trump is telling us to do this, so we have to do it.\" But more than that, it must be important enough, the key to his winning. Because why would he ask us to come to Washington if it wasn't part of the plan? It wouldn't make any sense. There's a trend among the Trump fans-it's almost religious-to see him as basically infallible and any mistakes are caused by bad people around him. He wouldn't be calling us to Washington unless there was a purpose that would ultimately end in him winning the election.\n\nSo they saw that, and are convinced they're coming in order to win the election. Or perhaps they're going to be an army. You can see the discussions around this: \"Why has he asked us to come? Surely there's a reason.\" They would say, \"Should we bring guns? Is he asking us to bring guns? But maybe he doesn't want us to be armed because if we're armed we'll get in trouble, and we need to be there.\"\n\nThe other part of it this is that since the late summer, when Trump was falling in polls and Biden was polling thoroughly ahead, the one thing I picked up from all parts of Trump World-from the QAnon-ish to the MAGA-ish to fairly moderate conservatives-is: Trump's gonna win. You didn't see that from people supporting Biden. You saw, you really hope he wins. The Trump people thought: Trump's going to win and not only is he going to win, you smug liberals, you're going to have the smile wiped off your face. This ideology really took hold and a lot of people really believed it. Trump was continually telling them everything was in the bag and he was massively ahead and we're going to win California and it's going to be a landslide.\n\nCome Election Day, he doesn't win. So all these people go, \"Wait, it can't be. How could Trump possibly lose an election that everyone I know knew he was going to win?\" I could just see a certain reality catching up with [them], and it would have to be on that day [of the certification]. And once they saw Trump saying to his supporters, come to DC on that day, I could see it going the wrong way.\n\nYou could see the discussion become less abstract. By last week, these people were sharing maps of D.C. They were talking about having enough of them that they would be able to erect basically their own cadre around the entire area of Congress. They had a map of the tunnels [in the basement of the Capitol], and they were talking about how they're going to be able to stop Congress from leaving. They imagined that this was the day there were going to be mass executions of Congressmen.\n\nBut a lot of them also just imagined they were going to be there for this historic time when Trump pulled away the curtain and revealed that all of Congress were traitors and then took his just and equal revenge. There were a variety of characters: people who were there to watch Trump gain control and people who thought Trump would win, but only by activating the military, [with] a proper military coup that they supported. They thought they were there to go and purge Congress. They were there to stop the certification. They were there to punish those who went against Trump. When you put them all together, you get this explosive mixture.\n\nThe only thing that surprised me was that it was not the army I expected it to be.\n\nBy that Kovler means that he thought they would be armed. Read it all.\n\nThe conservative Catholic writer John Jalsevac explains why he's so angry right now. Excerpts:\n\nNothing, absolutely nothing, has disturbed me more over the past four years, than the weird misuse of Christian religious language, spirituality and mysticism in service of the Trumpist political agenda. I've written about this elsewhere , and so I won't repeat myself here.\n\nHowever, I will add that I hope the day will come when I will see other alleged Trumpist \"prophets,\" or the people who spread their prophesies, apologizing for misleading the faithful, as Christian leader Jeremiah Johnson recently did (And has since received death threats for so doing.)\n\nThe effect of these alleged prophesies has been to endow political loyalties with a degree of religious fervor and conviction that rightly belong only to God. Clad in the certitude of total faith, Trumpist true believers have breezily rejected every inconvenient fact or event or piece of evidence as a diabolical deception. After all, what do your \"facts\" matter, when God Himself has told us the truth? Eric Metaxas even stated that he didn't need evidence that the election had been stolen; he knew that Trump had been re-elected , because God was on Trump's side.\n\nIn reality, this was the diabolical deception: the complete confusion of spiritual and political loyalties; the rejection of reason and fact in favor of credulous belief in unproven and untested \"prophesies\" that amounted to little more than wish fulfillment fantasies rubberstamped with divine endorsement.\n\nIn the world of Trumpism, religious principles were rewritten to accommodate Trump, rather than Trump being measured according to religious principles. The mere fact that Trump openly used religious language and imagery and made overt gestures to a religious demographic was taken as a de facto triumph, indisputable evidence that the President was bringing the United States back to God, that his faith was sincere, that he was God's instrument doing God's work.\n\nAnd if you doubted this, it was because you lacked faith.\n\nThe result was a weird, perverse form of Christian nationalism. As Russell Moore wrote this week:\n\nThe sight of \"Jesus Saves\" and \"God Bless America\" signs by those violently storming the Capitol is about more than just inconsistency. It is about a picture of Jesus Christ and of his gospel that is satanic. The mixing of the Christian religion with crazed and counter-biblical cults such as Q-Anon is telling the outside world that this is what the gospel is. That's a lie, and it is blasphemous against a holy God.\n\nTrump has not brought the country back to God. He and his grifter friends have infiltrated and perverted the Church, exploiting Christians' spiritual loyalties to serve his personal ambitions, recreating the church in MAGA's image, and luring us away from our core religious, ethical and political principles.\n\nSo yeah, I'm angry.\n\nMore:\n\nI have said since the first day of Trump's presidency, that the primary result of his presidency would be to foment a backlash from the left that would not only erase whatever conservative gains he pursued in the meantime, but would ensure that conservatives were ultimately far worse off than if he had never been president.\n\nIt is hard to deny that this is where we find ourselves now: Most of Trump's accomplishments were accomplished through personnel changes or executive orders. All of this will be wiped out on the first day of the Biden administration. Meanwhile, MAGA has descended into a rat's nest of violence, conspiracy theorizing, and cultish thinking, culminating in a horrific attack on the seat of democracy that has given the tech giants the excuse and public support they need to conduct a purge, silencing and marginalizing conservative voices. Meanwhile, the whole GOP is weakened by this internal civil war, the conservative movement divided and rendered ineffectual by ferocious disagreements over the personality who has dominated our every waking hour for the past five years.\n\nThe right's response right now is to blame everything on the left. No doubt, the left bears a great deal of the blame. I can recite the litany of leftist crimes of the past four years as well as anybody else. But I have lost all patience with whataboutism. I have lost all patience with the mental habit of eschewing responsibility by responding to all criticism or internal self-doubt by reciting the litany of grievances against the left.\n\nAll we had to do, was stay true our principles: Truth matters. Character matters. Charity, decency, honesty, the rule of law, love for our enemies, humility, goodness - all of these matter.\n\nSome conservatives have been asking me why I'm directing so much of my anger at \"our side,\" when the \"other side\" has done so many horrible things. The short answer? Because I'm not responsible for the other side . I can't change them. I have no influence over them. I am not surprised when my enemies do things I disagree with. It doesn't make me angry, because I never expected anything different.\n\nBut when my own side abandons its own principles willy-nilly, and then girds itself in the impregnable armour of puerile whataboutism (\"Ok, so we did riot a little. But what about all those BLM riots over the summer, huh? Why didn't the media get as angry about those!\"), then I get angry.\n\nRead it all. I'm sick of it too. Today I spoke to someone who - how shall I put this? - is in a professional position to know what the capabilities of surveillance are, and what it likely to happen next. This person reached out to me to say they had read Live Not By Lies , and that all of it is spot on - except that it's actually worse than I say in the book. This person said that because of what happened in Washington on January 6, all the soft-totalitarian things that I write about in the book are going to come at Christians and conservatives much faster.\n\nI'm open to hearing arguments in the comments section for why Congress should not impeach and convict Trump. But I'm weary of hearing I told you so from the Left, and whatabout and traitor! from the Right. If you have something substantive and meaningful to say about this, comment away. If you just want to shout, taunt, or troll, save it, because I'll spike your comment.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "How Tim Walz allowed BLM rioters to wreak havoc on Minneapolis\n\n'Many at MPD believe he was one of main reasons they had to watch one of their precincts burn in 2020.'\n\nBy Thursday, May 28, 2020, riots had plagued the city of Minneapolis for over three days. The Black Lives Matter rioters focused much of their attention on the Minneapolis Police Department's 3rd Precinct as officer Derek Chauvin, who was later convicted of killing George Floyd, had been assigned to that station.\n\nThe day after the video of George Floyd being arrested by Chauvin went viral, May 25, rioters attacked the 3rd Precinct and would continue to do so until the thinly stretched officers were ordered to evacuate the building on Thursday. As scenes of their retreat and the fire that consumed the front of the station were blasted across the American media, many people were asking: Where is the Minnesota National Guard?\n\nWhile Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) received much-deserved criticism for how his administration handled the widespread riots, the decision to deploy a state's National Guard rests on either the president or the governor.\n\n'The fall of the 3rd Precinct, and damage to surrounding areas, had set the tone for the rest of country during that turbulent period.'\n\nIn 2020, Frey told the Star Tribune that Governor Tim Walz (D) and his administration had dithered as the situation across from St. Paul continued to deteriorate. \"We expressed the seriousness of the situation. The urgency was clear,\" Frey said about a phone call he had with Walz on Wednesday, May 27.  \"[Walz] did not say yes. He said he would consider it.\"\n\nFrey said he had asked the governor's office whether his verbal request for National Guard troops was considered a formal request. Walz's office said it was but then later walked that back, saying the state needed a plan on how soldiers were to be used.\n\nA group chat with staffers from Frey's office said Walz was \"hesitating\" about deploying the Guard.\n\n\"Walz was not only complicit, but many at MPD believe he was one of main reasons they had to watch one of their precincts burn in 2020, while being forced to abandon it,\" a Minneapolis police officer who served during the BLM riots told Blaze Media.\n\nMembers of Minnesota's National Guard were fully deployed on Friday, the May 29, the day after the 3rd Precinct was evacuated and burned. However, it was clear they were given orders to engage with rioters as little as possible. This was exemplified when a curfew was announced to people who had gathered at the National Guard and police perimeter near the 3rd Precinct. The curfew's announcement caused the crowd to start attacking the security perimeter. Instead of holding their ground, the guardsmen and officers withdrew from the area entirely, using tear gas to cover their retreat.\n\nThe rioters were once again in control of the area around the 3rd Precinct and followed law enforcement down Lake Avenue in an attempt to burn down the 5th Precinct, but they were unsuccessful. Instead, rioters turned their attention to looting and burning buildings on the rest of Lake Street.\n\nThe fall of the 3rd Precinct and the damage to surrounding areas had set the tone for the rest of country during that turbulent period. It signaled to those on the far-left that if they put enough pressure and had the numbers, they could get U.S. police officers to abandon their stations.\n\nThat strategy was nearly replicated in Seattle a few days later, when then-Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan (D) ordered Seattle police to leave the East Precinct after days of rioting outside. The order led to the creation of the infamous \"Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,\" also known as the \"Capitol Hill Occupy Protest.\"\n\n\"If there's a silver lining to this [Walz] nomination,\" a Minneapolis police officer told Blaze Media, \"it's that the rest of the county, and world, will finally get to hear the truth of his complete failure of leadership, and abandonment of his LEOs during the 2020 riots.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

Met police chiefs were so worried about the violent crowd attempting to breach the barrier to Downing Street that they commanded elite armed officers to withdraw, fearing activists might grab their guns and use them, court papers reveal.\n\nIt is the first time the Met has admitted that armed officers were deliberately taken away from Downing Street during a riot. The clashes, which took place when Boris Johnson was Prime Minister, left more than two dozen police officers injured, including a policewoman hospitalised after her horse bolted.\n\nThree days after the troubling scenes, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was photographed with his deputy Angela Rayner taking the knee in support of BLM.\n\nSenior politicians reacted with fury last night, describing The Mail on Sunday's revelations as evidence of 'two-tier policing' and demanded an immediate investigation.\n\nShadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick said: 'If this is true, then the Met's leadership recklessly surrendered to the mob and jeopardised the security of Downing Street in a pathetic attempt to placate hostile protesters. This will only add to the growing perception of two-tier policing where fashionable causes and minority groups are treated more leniently than everyone else.'\n\nReform MP Lee Anderson said: 'To learn that armed police were stood down due to fears of having their weapons taken is absolutely shocking. Mayor Sadiq Khan and the then commissioner Cressida Dick have serious questions to answer.\n\nThe moment PC Nicky Vernon was knocked from her horse spooked by the mob\n\nA mounted police officer lays on the road after being unseated from their horse, during the  demonstration on Whitehall, near the entrance to Downing Street\n\nDemonstrators clash with police officers on Whitehall during the Black Lives Matter protest in London\n\n'To think our Met capitulated to the rabble that is BLM is truly staggering. Maybe now the current PM and Deputy PM will stop taking the knee and get on with protecting the public. There is absolutely no point in our police carrying guns if they are not expected to use them. Our police are there to protect and serve, not to cower and surrender.'\n\nTobias Ellwood, the former Tory MP hailed a hero for trying to save PC Keith Palmer's life in Westminster during a terror attack in 2017, said: 'I'm flabbergasted. Downing Street along with Parliament is the heart of our democracy. In no circumstances should there ever be a moment where our ability to defend it is reduced. Otherwise what is the purpose of even having a security operation if it so easily collapses?\n\n'This warrants a far deeper investigation and to ask were there political judgements here that overrode operational decision-making.'\n\nConservative MP Neil O'Brien contrasted the order to withdraw the Met's heavy-handed treatment at the peaceful vigil in March 2021 for Sarah Everard, who was kidnapped, raped and murdered by Met Police officer Wayner Couzens.\n\n'It's horrendous to think that incredibly violent people who ended up nearly killing a female police officer were being pandered to at every turn by the Establishment and politicians like Keir Starmer. There's a dotted line between people like Starmer taking the knee and the police ceding territory to the mob.'\n\nViolence erupted at the BLM protest in June 2020, part of global unrest following the murder of George Floyd by an American police officer in Minneapolis and in the febrile days after some Covid lockdown restrictions were easing.\n\nRioters clashed with mounted police in Whitehall and Parliament Square. Flares and missiles were hurled, and horrific footage showed PC Nicky Vernon being knocked from her horse, Rocky, when she hit a traffic light after thugs threw objects at them.\n\nNow PC Vernon, who suffered neck and back injuries, is suing Scotland Yard, claiming the withdrawal of the armed police guard contributed to the disorder which led to her injuries.\n\nLeft: A police horse is spooked as a bike is thrown towards it. Right: One of the police horses that bolted hit a person participating in the protest\n\nProtesters holding placards attend a demonstration at the Parliament square\n\nViolence erupted at the BLM protest in June 2020, part of global unrest following the murder of George Floyd by an American\n\nPolice line the streets in Whitehall outside Downing Street during the demonstration\n\nMetropolitan Police officers take a knee during a Black Lives Matter protest in London\n\nHer lawyer claims the 'armed police customarily on duty outside Downing Street' had been removed because, an official report found, the officers on the ground 'were coming under attack by the now very hostile and violent crowd'.\n\nBut in its defence to the court claim, Scotland Yard said they were right to stand down the elite protection officers, because of the risk of guns being fired. Lawyers for the Met said they were forced to intervene with an 'active push' by mounted officers after Downing Street came under serious threat.\n\nIn court filings obtained by this newspaper, the force's barrister, Adam Clemens, wrote: 'A crowd in the vicinity of the junction of Whitehall and Downing Street appeared either to be focusing, or at least directing some of their ire, on Downing Street itself... There was a genuine concern that protesters might attempt to get into Downing Street.'\n\nHe said there had been a 'risk of a discharge of a firearm, or of members of the public overcoming an armed officer and taking possession of a firearm'.\n\nIt had been appropriate to withdraw armed officers and that an 'active push', in which several horses moved forward at a medium and controlled trot, 'was a reasonable, proportionate and appropriate reaction to the threat posed' by the crowd outside Downing Street, he said.\n\nDowning Street is one of the most heavily protected places in the UK. Gates block entry to the street, which is constantly patrolled by armed police from the diplomatic protection group. There is also usually at least one police officer stationed outside the door of No 10.\n\nThe Met emphasised it was officers outside the Downing Street barriers that were withdrawn, suggesting armed guards inside the gates remained on duty.\n\nPC Vernon, 47, was in hospital for eight days after Rocky bolted, having also suffered a collapsed lung, broken collarbone and shattered ribs. She is still receiving treatment more than four years on for post-traumatic stress and anxiety.\n\nThe clashes, which took place when Boris Johnson was Prime Minister, left more than two dozen police officers injured\n\nA police officer who was injured when falling off a horse during scuffles with demonstrators at Downing Street during the demonstration\n\nPolice line up near Downing after graffiti appeared on the wall in Whitehall\n\nShe also alleges the force knew her 14-year-old horse had a history of unsafe behaviour and therefore 'exposed her to a foreseeable risk of injury'.\n\nThe footage of the sickening moment when she was thrown backwards off Rocky when she collided with a traffic light has been viewed around the world.\n\nThe Met denies Rocky was prone to 'bolting' and while it admits the officer suffered serious physical injuries, it disputes any long-term impact on her mental health or career prospects within the force. The force rejects her £200,000 claim, adding that even if it was successful, it would be worth no more than £100,000. The case is at an early stage and has not yet reached a trial.\n\nA total of 27 Met Police officers were injured during the anti-racism demonstrations.\n\nProtesters clambered on Winston Churchill's memorial statue in Parliament Square and daubed 'racist' on the plinth.\n\nThis retreat will test the public's faith in our police\n\nBy Rakib Ehsan\n\nIs there a more egregious erosion yet of the principles of 'Great' British policing?\n\nBack in June 2020, the Black Lives Matter protests in London were described as 'largely peaceful'. That description came from none other than the Metropolitan Police. Now we know the extraordinary truth: that the force cravenly submitted to protesters and left the seat of British democracy vastly more vulnerable.\n\nWhat happened at Downing Street was not a tactical retreat. This was not General Kutuzov pulling back to successfully suppress Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Removing armed officers was a straightforward dereliction of duty, which could have had grave consequences.\n\nWhen the police are faced with a rioting mob, retreating should not be an option.\n\nOne can only presume that there was another line of defence inside the gates to protect the then prime minister Boris Johnson - who had been in intensive care with Covid just two months previously - his wife and their baby.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday's revelations are damaging for two reasons. Not only do they weaken public faith in the police, they send a message to other protest groups that, if they are sufficiently threatening, police will give up trying to control them.\n\nFor this is not the only time that officers - even unarmed ones - have retreated in the face of an angry mob.\n\nLast July, police withdrew from the Harehills area of Leeds after social services removed four Roma children from their family and riots broke out. Then, a couple of weeks later, unrest exploded in Southport following the murder of three little girls. Faced with gangs of far-Right white rioters, did police retreat on this occasion? Not an inch. More officers were drafted in from neighbouring forces.\n\nThe Met emphasised it was officers outside the Downing Street barriers that were withdrawn, suggesting armed guards inside the gates remained on duty\n\nA total of 27 Met Police officers were injured during the anti-racism demonstrations\n\nI have often warned of the risks of 'two-tier policing' - where minorities are perceived to be treated differently to white Britons. When this extends to violence and intimidation, I dread to think what this means for public safety.\n\nI have often warned of the risks of 'two-tier policing' - where minorities are perceived to be treated differently to white Britons. When this extends to violence and intimidation, I dread to think what this means for public safety.\n\nIf the issue is that the Metropolitan Police doesn't have enough armed officers, then that should be put right. But the failure to properly police riots is not so much an issue of numbers. The BLM riots occurred during the pandemic when there seemed no shortage of officers to hand out fines to people sunbathing in parks or organising 'parties' at work. Their failure is more a matter of attitude.\n\nThe police need to approach their duties with the professionalism, courage and resolve that the public expects them to have.\n\nTaxpayers will stump up £19.5 billion to fund policing in England and Wales over the next year. In return, we expect our streets to be kept safe and our elected representatives to be defended against angry protesters. When the mob arrived at the gates of Downing Street in 2020, the police buckled. I dread to think what could happen the next time they come baying.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

None of what we're doing will ever bring our baby back. Her life is priceless,' Turner said during a news conference Monday. 'We deserve justice. Someone needs to be held accountable.'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nAttorney Mawuli Davis, center, stands with his clients, Charmaine Turner, right, and Secoriey Williamson, parents of Secoriea Turner, as they speak during a press conference to announce a lawsuit against the city of Atlanta and others for the death of their 8-year-old daughter\n\nSecoriea Turner was shot and killed riding in an SUV with her mother and a friend on July 4, 2020\n\nThe child was killed during BLM protests near the Wendy's where Reyshard Brooks had been shot dead by a white cop weeks earlier\n\nA makeshift memorial is pictured at the site of Brooks' shooting on June 17, 2020\n\nThe restaurant was set on fire the day after Brooks' killing, and people protesting police brutality camped out at the site during the weeks that followed. Makeshift barricades had been set up in the area, and armed men had been blocking roads and turning some drivers away.\n\nAs the driver of the SUV Secoriea was riding in approached the barricade, armed people began walking toward the vehicle and signaling the driver couldn't pass and one or more people shot into the vehicle, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe city stopped tolerating protesters occupying the Wendy's site after Secoriea's killing, and the charred shell of the restaurant was demolished on July 14.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Fulton County State Court against the city, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant, City Council member Joyce Sheperd, Wendy's International and the company that owns the property where the Wendy's was located.\n\n'The murder of Secoriea Turner, as a result of senseless gun violence, is a tragedy that no family should have to endure. Due to the anticipated litigation, the City will offer no further comment, at this time,' a city spokesperson said.\n\nA police spokesman likewise said the department doesn't comment on pending litigation. Sheperd didn't immediately respond to an email Monday.\n\nWendy's did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe lawsuit names (L to R) Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Police Chief Rodney Bryant and City Council member Joyce Sheperd , among others\n\nA screenshot from surveillance video shows an armed suspect in Secoriea's murder\n\nThe suit says that violent, armed vigilantes mixed in among the peaceful protesters who gathered at the site to protest police violence and pay tribute to Brooks. At least two people had been shot and wounded in that area in late June.\n\nJulian Conley, 20, is charged with felony murder and aggravated assault in Secoriea's death and remains in jail\n\nThe street was barricaded by an armed militia that became increasingly violent and refused to let people pass, the lawsuit says.\n\nCity officials were aware of the dangerous situation and allowed it to happen, the complaints alleges. Bottoms said the city planned to clear the area weeks before Secoriea's death, but Sheperd asked for more time to talk with protesters, the lawsuit says.\n\nCity and police leaders ignored community leaders' calls for police help and did nothing to address the violence, the lawsuit says.\n\nAccording to a June 17 police department email quoted in the lawsuit, officers had been told to respond to victims of violence but 'not be overly proactive in any shape, form or fashion.'\n\n'The mayor, the city council and the police department are specifically making the decision not to have law enforcement at a certain location,' said Shean Williams, a lawyer for the family, calling it a unique situation.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses city leaders at the highest levels of failing to provide basic public safety and public protection.\n\nThe lawsuit also names Wendy's as a defendant, arguing that the company and the owner of the property failed to provide security at the site\n\n'But for Defendants' lack of intervening to control or dismantle the nuisance of an armed barricade that obstructed the roads and the violence that surrounded it, Secoriea would still have her life today,' the lawsuit states.\n\nWendy's and the property owner also behaved negligently by failing to provide safety and security on the property and at its access points, the lawsuit says.\n\n'They allowed a nuisance to occur at the property,' Williams said. 'They were on notice of that nuisance - the danger, the hazards that persisted with vigilantes being on the property.'\n\nThe lawsuit seeks a jury trial and asks for damages in an amount to be determined by a jury. Back in October, Secoriea's family said they planned to sue the city of Atlanta for $16million.\n\nJulian Conley, 20, is charged with felony murder and aggravated assault in Secoriea's death and remains in jail. He turned himself in July 15, a day after police got warrants for his arrest.\n\nTurner, left, said the lawsuit will not bring back her daughter's 'priceless' life, but she argued that someone needs to be held accountable\n\nMawuli Davis, right, the family's attorney, said during Monday's press conference announcing the lawsuit that the wait for justice has been frustrating\n\nHis attorney said at the time that Conley was armed and protesting peacefully and witnessed the shooting but did not open fire.\n\nOn the night of Secoriea's death, Conley claimed that the SUV the victim was riding in tried to come through a road block and hit a barricade and a man armed with a rifle, according to Patterson.\n\nThe man got up and opened fire at the vehicle, Jackie Patterson, his lawyer, said his client told him.\n\nConley said everyone thought somebody in the SUV was shooting and other armed people opened fire at the vehicle, Patterson said.\n\n'He was in disbelief that people were shooting at the vehicle,' the attorney said.\n\nPolice have said as many as four people were involved in the shooting, but no one else has been arrested.\n\nMawuli Davis, a lawyer for Secoriea's parents, said Monday that the family has been talking with the district attorney's office and investigators and that the wait for justice has been frustrating.\n\n'It didn't take a lot of time for them to lose their daughter's life,' Williams, the other attorney, said, referring to Secoriea's parents. 'Why should it take the city a lot of time to make this right? That's just not the appropriate response, in my view.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Their lives mattered.\n\n'Fifty-five businesses were looted or destroyed the night David was murdered, many of them Black-owned. Their livelihoods mattered. My husband was a Black man who selflessly served his community for over 40 years. His life mattered.'\n\nShe added that it is key for woke corporations to realize that by funding the BLM movement, they are 'hurting our country'.\n\nAnn added: 'It is clear that the anti-law enforcement sentiment that has been fueled in this country by Democrat and left-wing activist rhetoric has gone too far.\n\n'Yes, there are bad cops out there, but addressing bad policing by ordering no policing at all is not a solution. It is extremist, it is dangerous, and it cost my husband his life.'\n\nShe added that David became a police offer because when he was a boy, he wanted to be a superhero. 'And he was a superhero,' Ann said.\n\nAnn is working with Concerned Communities of America - a group involving influential black clergy and leaders which is pushing back against woke corporations and individuals who funding deadly BLM riots.\n\nBlack Lives Matter and other influential organizations are seeking to shrink police department budgets and reallocate resources to mental health professional and social workers, housing and education.\n\nThe 'defund the police' movement took root after the murder of George Floyd, a black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in May 2020.\n\nStephan Cannon, 26, of Glasgow Village, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Dorn, 77, who was shot when he investigated alarms going off at a friend's pawn shop\n\nAnn, a retired police sergeant with over 20 years of service, said that David (pictured together) did not agree or support BLM because 'it never actually did anything to help black lives'\n\nPolice investigate the scene of a shooting at Lee's Pawn & Jewelry in St. Louis on June 2, 2020, after Dorn was found shot dead\n\nIt was during the 2020 riots over Floyd's death that David was killed.\n\nLast month, Cannon, 26, of Glasgow Village was found guilty of first-degree murder for the death of David, who was shot when he investigated alarms going off at a friend's pawn shop in St. Louis.\n\nCannon was also found guilty of first-degree robbery, first-degree burglary and three counts of armed criminal action. He faces a mandatory term of life in prison without parole when he is sentenced September 13.\n\nDorn was killed on June 2, 2020, when he approached Lee's Pawn & Jewelry in north St. Louis and fired off warning shots to stop looters who were ransacking the business.\n\nCannon shot Dorn 10 times and the retired police officer's body was found on a the sidewalk in front of the pawn shop.

Floyd's death was followed by social justice protests and riots across the nation, which came at a time when COVID-19 cases and government-mandated lockdown measures meant to control the pandemic upended society in unprecedented ways ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nAfter Walz's comments on May 29, 2020, Minneapolis was again rocked by riots that evening , according to local media reports.\n\n\"Protesters blanketed the area near the Fifth Precinct, heavily damaging at least seven buildings - including a U.S. Post Office, a Wells Fargo branch, a staffing agency and a Subway in a nearby strip mall,\" the Star Tribune reported at the time.\n\nDemocrat vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov.

Portland, Oregon, for example, saw at least 100 nights of rioting and protests that summer.\n\nThough Walz did mobilize the state's National Guard just days after the riots began, locals have said the Democrat governor acted slowly to curb the destruction.\n\n\"I called the White House after [four] days of unbridled rioting with the Governor frozen on what to do,\" Republican state Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka wrote on X on July 28. \"I know that Gov[.] Walz and Pres[ident] Trump talked.

PAUL, Minn. - A Minnesota business owner who watched helplessly as his St. Paul establishment was destroyed during the 2020 George Floyd riots spoke to Fox News Digital about how the state, led by Gov. Tim Walz, failed to protect business owners like him.\n\n\" When the rioters first came here they went and destroyed the strip mall on the left-hand side here, I was in my shop,\" Long Her, owner of New Fashion Tailoring and Alteration in St. Paul, Minnesota, told Fox News Digital. \"I witnessed everything and videotaped. My friend and I stayed in our shop until nightfall, and I was going to go to sleep and watch over my shop, but my friends said, 'it's too dangerous, let's go home' so we ended up going home that night.\"\n\nHer, a Hmong immigrant, recalled that he was \"afraid\" for his livelihood when he went home that night but hoped that the destruction would be contained to the other side of the street.\n\nWhen Her came back the next morning to check on the store that he had owned for decades, he discovered his worst fears had come true, and the location was ransacked.\n\nMINNESOTA RIOTS CONTINUED AFTER WALZ TOOK 'RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE' THERE WOULDN'T BE CHAOS\n\nSt. Paul, Minnesota, business owner Long Her, left, spoke to Fox News Digital about how the 2020 George Floyd riots affected him and his business.

During that time, a lot of people were scared to go out, and so I lost a lot of customers,\" Her said. \"People are not coming out to shop, and so I lost a lot of money and customers from that.\"\n\nHe went on to say that safety was \"not a big concern\" for business owners in the twin cities before 2020, but after the pandemic, \"there's a lot more people that would shoplift or steal stuff from the store.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of homeless people sleeping in this area. It's making it very unsafe for business owners and even shoppers, and so we need to have more police force to help us in this area, to protect the businesses and the people here.\"\n\nMinneapolis is widely considered the epicenter of the defund the police movement, and C BS News reported earlier this year that the city's police department is understaffed by 200 officers and the police force has shrunk by 40% over the last four years.\n\n\" I don't care what party they're from,\" Her said. \"It should be nonpartisan when it comes to the police force and putting more police on the street to help citizens.\"\n\nFox News Digital asked Her if he fears that a situation like the 2020 riots could happen again.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov.

      "text": "CNN Panel's Rosy Narrative On BLM Riots Goes Belly Up After Scott Jennings, Attorneys Give History Lesson\n\nRepublican strategist Scott Jennings and attorneys Arthur Aidala and Michael Van Der Meer touched off a heated discussion Tuesday night after bringing up the lax prosecution of Black Lives Matter rioters during a debate over President Donald Trump's decision to pardon participants in the riot at the Capitol.\n\nTrump pardoned more than 1,500 people convicted of crimes surrounding the storming of the Capitol building during the certification of the electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2021 Monday. Aidala angered liberal panelists on \"CNN NewsNight\" by noting that some of those arrested in connection with the Capitol riot were held in \"horrible humanitarian conditions.\"\n\n\"Trump campaigned on this. This is no secret. Nobody should be surprised that this took place,\" Aidala told host Abby Phillip. \"Whether you like it or not, he campaigned on it openly and I will say, as a criminal defense attorney, Abby, those people who were incarcerated, they faced some horrible humanitarian conditions during their period of incarceration.\"\n\n\"Jail is not nice, okay?\" Phillip responded after other panelists started interjecting. \"And it's not nice for January 6th prisoners. It's not nice for anybody else who's there.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\nIn 2021, Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Chip Roy of Texas wrote the Justice Department requesting answers about alleged mistreatment of Jan. 6 defendants.\n\nAfter a further back-and-forth on the issue, \"The View\" co-host Ana Navarro claimed that Trump voters \"screwed around\" and were \"finding out,\" leading to Phillip asking Scott Jennings about people charged with assaulting police officers during the riots that followed the death of George Floyd in police custody in May 2020, which killed at least 24 people and caused nearly $1 billion in property damage .\n\n\"By Trump's definition of this, and by his token, I would always also expect to see, you know, the hundreds of people who were convicted of the George Floyd protests of assaulting police officers to walk free. Right, Scott?\" Phillip asked, with Jennings responding: \"Well, they were prosecuted, I mean, how many were prosecuted ultimately?\"\n\nJennings told Phillip many of those arrested during the summer 2020 riots had their charges dropped, with Phillip claiming hundreds were charged, saying she had the figures before defense attorney Michael Van Der Veen intervened.\n\n\"Well, they went into all kinds of diversionary programs,\" Van Der Veen said. \"I'm one of the few lawyers in this country that represented people in those riots and on January 6th, one of the very few, and the way that the prosecution was handled between those two groups are starkly different.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris backed a bail fund for those involved in the riots after Floyd's death, which also released sex offenders and people charged with domestic violence. Many of the protests where rioting broke out were backed by Black Lives Matter, which has come under scrutiny over the lavish lifestyles of the group's leaders.\n\nBlack Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors handed hundreds of thousands of dollars to her child's father and her brother, according to documents. She also purchased a $6 million mansion in the Los Angeles area using donor funds.\n\n\"Don't you think that there is a substantive difference between what happened on January 6th, what they were trying to do, and why the federal government has a desire, and in fact, a necessity to prevent that from ever happening again?\" Phillip responded. \"Don't you think there's a substantive difference between those two things? One of them was trying to overturn an election.\"\n\nJennings stepped in to answer, prompting Phillip to turn her attention to him.\n\n\"You don't think there's a difference between trying to overturn an election and violent social justice protests?\" Phillip asked Jennings, who responded, \"Well, you call it social justice.\"\n\n\"I think both groups of people were mad about something going on. They wanted to change it. They took matters into their own hands, that they should not have done,\" Jennings added after a back-and-forth with Phillip. \"In both cases, you had people engaging in activities that they should not have engaged in. Now, our culture, our public discourse decided that one group of people, social justice, is good, and these people were bad. But the reality is they had the same motivation.\"\n\nFormer Biden campaign aide Ashley Allison then jumped in.\n\n\"I don't even want to get in this debate because it's done. People voted, and as Ana said, FAFO, okay, go, go Google it if you don't know what that means, because I can't say it on national television,\" Allison said. \"But this is the era that we are in and people there were people in protest. They were not riots, they were protests, and there were people who showed up at the protest and did bad behavior. But that was because a man was murdered unjustly.\"\n\n\"That doesn't give you the right to break into the Nike store!\" Aidala responded. \"That doesn't give you the right to break into Tiffany's!\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Tim Walz's wife, Gwen, said she left her windows open to \"smell the burning tires\" during the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots because she felt it was a \"touchstone\" moment.\n\nAn interview clip with Gwen Walz discussing the 2020 riots and her reaction to them resurfaced online Tuesday after Vice President Kamala Harris announced she would be choosing the Minnesota governor as her running mate for the 2024 election. In the interview, which was aired on KSTP-TV's \"5 Eyewitness News Nightcast\" channel, Gwen could be heard talking about the riots and her choice to leave the \"windows open as long\" as the city was burned by looters and rioters.\n\n\"I could smell the burning tires. That was a very real thing, and I kept the windows open as long as I could because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening,\" Gwen Walz said.\n\nHere is a bizarre clip from an interview with Gwen Walz stating that she left her windows open during the Minneapolis Riots so she could smell the burning tires.\n\nHer daughter also coordinated with rioters to let them know that the National Guard would not be activated one night. pic.twitter.com/ityW100Z4y\n\n- Dustin Grage (@GrageDustin) August 6, 2024\n\nMinneapolis was quickly swarmed by rioters after the death of George Floyd in 2020, leading to many buildings being burned down and businesses looted, with the violence lasting for three days.\n\nFollowing the reveal of Walz as Harris' running mate, Republican lawmakers and others online quickly pointed out how Walz failed to immediately send the National Guard into Minneapolis to address the violence occurring at the time. Walz had previously argued that calling the National Guard would only incite further rioting, as he had suggested protesters needed space to express their outrage, according to Fox News.\n\n\"I want to just be clear there's philosophically an argument to be made that an armed presence on the ground in the midst of where we just had a police killing is seen as a catalyst,\" Walz said at the time.\n\nWalz's office and the Harris campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Police Sgt. Ann Dorn, whose husband, David was killed during the riots, defended Aldean's song \"Try That In A Small Town\" and called the controversy \"absurd\" after watching the music video. \"It speaks of small-town values. It speaks of community values. It speaks of standing up for ourselves,\" she said.\n\nContinuing, Dorn inquired, \"When did it become illegal in the United States of America for us to stand up for ourselves? That's our given rights to protect ourselves, our life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.\"\n\nThe widow of David Dorn, who was murdered by a BLM rioter in 2020, defends Jason Aldean and says America needs a stronger sense of community to fight against tyranny pic.twitter.com/nidlJRK1Mx - Jesse Watters (@JesseBWatters) July 20, 2023\n\nThe widow of David Dorn, who was murdered by a BLM rioter in 2020, defends Jason Aldean and says America needs a stronger sense of community to fight against tyranny pic.twitter.com/nidlJRK1Mx\n\nShe further explained she understood Aldean's intentions behind the song despite the criticism it has received.\n\n\"It's a sense of community. It's a sense of neighborhood. It's a sense of taking care of each other, and we've gotten so far away from that that it's actually very scary,\" she added.\n\nWhen asked by Watters if she wished \"there were more small-town-minded people around\" on the night of her husband's murder, Dorn responded, \"I do. There's a lot of disrespect now and there's no sense of community, and people don't stand up for their community.\"\n\n\"They don't stop these things that happen in a small town, just like Jason says in his song, you're not going to do that here, the community's not going to stand for it,\" she stated.\n\nFurthermore, Dorn said, \"The community's not gonna allow you to come into our town and destroy our town. We're gonna defend it and we're gonna defend it with our lives if we have to.\"\n\nThis came after Aldean, 46, addressed accusations on his Twitter page that his song was \" pro lynching \" and was in reference to the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.\n\n\"These references are not only meritless but dangerous,\" the country singer wrote. \"There is not a single lyric in the song that references race or points to it- and there isn't a single video clip that isn't real news footage -and while I can try and respect others to have their own interpretation of a song with music- this one goes too far.\"\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

      "text": "CNN Panel Instantly Implodes When Commentator Mentions 'Ferguson Effect' Spiking Crime\n\nSparks flew during a CNN segment Tuesday night after 1776 Project PAC founder Ryan Girdusky said the \"Ferguson effect\" and less police presence in communities leads to spikes in violent crime.\n\nSt. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson coined the term \"Ferguson effect\" in 2014 following the fatal police-involved shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, which hypothesizes that a decrease in police activity leads to a surge in violent crime. Girdusky argued that the \" Ferguson effect \" and the death of George Floyd led to a surge in black male deaths in response to CNN's Abby Phillips' criticism of former President Donald Trump calling on the involvement of the military to suppress the Black Lives Matter (BLM) riots in the summer of 2020.\n\n\"There are the post-George Floyd riots [that] resulted in 15,000 black male deaths in this country,\" Girdusky said.\n\n\"How?\" CNN political commentator Bakari Sellers asked.\n\nGirdusky said there was less police presence at the time of the 2020 riots because officers feared for their jobs at the time, leading to a surge in violent crime.\n\n\"The surge of violent crime, it was like Ferguson effect, the Ferguson effect and the Floyd effect ... Because what happens is after the Ferguson riot and after the Floyd riot, policemen in fear of their jobs many times and political coverage, pull back from their jobs resulting in crime size,\" Girdusky said.\n\n\"Ryan, hold on, hold on. Ryan, we got to stop you there because you're literally making a connection out of your own conjecture,\" Phillips said. \"You can not just do that.\"\n\nCNN published a piece in October 2015 titled, \"FBI chief tries to deal with the 'Ferguson effect,' which details former FBI director James Comey linking a rise in violent crime to a decrease in police activity.\n\nWATCH:\n\nAfter Phillips quieted the panel down, Sellers said a surge in riots and violent crimes cannot be blamed on the deaths of black men.\n\n\"That literally, and my point to you is, that makes no sense,\" Sellers said. \"And I would argue to you that I'm not coming from a perspective where I want fewer police. I want police actually to be paid more, I just want better police, more qualified police, I want there to be a database where police, if they commit bad acts, they can't just go from one department to the next. That's criminal justice reform.\"\n\nPhillips then pointed out that Trump was president during Floyd's death and the BLM riots, leading Girdusky to say that the president does not control local police departments.\n\n\"You're trying to blame crime on Joe Biden, but you're saying that people who died when Donald Trump was president, that's not his fault?\" Phillips asked. \"I don't agree with either, [with] blame being assigned to either president. I think presidents don't have a magic wand and they don't control crime from the White House. But if you're gonna say that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are responsible for a rise in crime.\"\n\n\"I didn't blame Joe Biden,\" Girdusky said.\n\nIf anyone who I was on the panel with wants to know about the Ferguson or Floyd Effect... here's where CNN covered it. https://t.co/80ZuBpg8iO\n\n- Ryan James Girdusky (@RyanGirdusky) October 16, 2024\n\nCrime became a major political issue in the aftermath of the BLM riots and leading into the 2024 election.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris supported the defund the police movement that sprung from the BLM riots right before becoming then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's running mate. She also supported the Minnesota Freedom Fund in a May 2020 blog post urging for the bailing of rioters.\n\nAfter she joined the 2020 presidential ticket, Harris' then-press secretary Sabrina Singh said Harris did not support defunding police.\n\n\"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not support defunding the police, and it is a lie to suggest otherwise,\"  former Harris press secretary Sabrina Singh said in October 2020, according to CNN. \"Throughout her career, Sen. Harris has supported increasing funding to police departments and boosting funding for community policing.\"\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screenshot/CNN)\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

But to compare the actions of people protesting, mostly peacefully, for civil rights, to those of a violent mob seeking to overthrow the lawfully elected government is a false equivalency and ignores a very real danger that the January 6 riot posed to the foundation of our democracy.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice charged only about 300 people for the left-wing and BLM riots in multiple cities across America. This same agency has charged over 1,100 to date for the Jan 6 disturbance in Washington DC.\n\nThis statement came in the sentencing of Matthew Mazzocco, a J6 defendant who pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of \"Parading, Demonstrating, or Picketing in a Capitol Building.\" The Department of Justice recommended three months under home confinement and probation for Mazzocco, but Chutkan sentenced him to 45 days in jail plus 60 hours of community service. This came after she noted that Mazzocco was barely in the Capitol and didn't cause harm to anyone or anything.\n\n\"Mr. Mazzocco was in the Capitol for only 12 minutes, and he did tell others, don't take or break anything, noting that they would probably get in trouble for what they did,\" Chutkan wrote.\n\nChutkan, in a sentencing hearing in October 2022, expressed anger that Trump is not behind bars.\n\n\"I see the videotapes,\" Chutkan wrote. \"I see the footage of the flags and the signs that people were carrying and the hats they were wearing and the garb. And the people who mobbed that Capitol were there in fealty, in loyalty, to one man - not to the Constitution, of which most of the people who come before me seem woefully ignorant; not to the ideals of this country; and not to the principles of democracy. It's a blind loyalty to one person who, by the way, remains free to this day.\"\n\nTrump highlighted this very statement by Chutkan in a Truth Social post, saying, \"[Chutkan] obviously wants me behind bars. VERY BIASED & UNFAIR!\"\n\nChutkan, in a hearing to settle a dispute over a protective order in Trump's case, repeatedly told John Lauro, Trump's attorney, that she would keep politics out of her courtroom.\n\n\"I intend to keep politics out of it,\" she told Lauro.\n\nChutkan was also the judge who refused to block the release of documents to the January 6 th Committee. In her ruling, she wrote, \"Presidents are not kings, and [Trump] is not President.\"\n\nAccording to a new YouGov/CBS poll, 63% of independents believe the indictments against the 45 th president are intended to stop his campaign.\n\nSIXTY THREE PERCENT INDEPENDENTS in the latest You Gov/CBS poll say that the J6 indictments are intended to stop Trump's 2024 campaign pic.twitter.com/kKqVU9x7KH\n\nStay informed!

      "text": "Seattle To Pay $3.6 Million in Damages to Businesses Over 2020 BLM Riots\n\nThe city of Seattle will reimburse business owners $3,650,000 for damages caused by Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots in 2020, according to new court filings.\n\nBusiness owners sued the city for damages caused by the 2020 Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) protest, a 16-block section of the city where left-wing activists prevented police from entering for three weeks. In a settlement with the business owners, Seattle agreed to reimburse damages by March 3, the Post Millennial reported , for refusing to crack down on the rioters.\n\nDistrict Judge Thomas Zilly attributed the business owners' losses to the city's negligence. \"Plaintiffs plausibly allege that the city's actions-encouraging CHOP participants to wall off the area and agreeing to a 'no response' zone within and near CHOP's borders-foreseeably placed plaintiffs in a worse position,\" Zilly wrote.\n\nThen-mayor Jenny Durkan (D.) insisted at the time that the CHAZ was a peaceful protest, referring to the neighborhood takeover as the \"summer of love.\" Durkan dismissed then-president Donald Trump's warning that he would take action if Seattle authorities failed to reclaim the city.\n\n\"The threat to invade Seattle, to divide and incite violence in our city, is not only unwelcome, it would be illegal,\" Durkan said.\n\nDuring the police-free period from June to July 2020, rapes, robberies, and murders increased in the zone by 250 percent. A Seattle coffee shop owner recalled being \"barricaded\" in his store by gun-wielding protesters, the New York Times reported at the time. The autonomous zone was the site of multiple shootings , which left a 16-year-old and a 19-year-old dead.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 caused up to $2 billion in property damage, according to a report from insurance agencies.\n\nPublished under: 2020 , Antifa , Black Lives Matter , Defund the Police , George Floyd , Jenny Durkan , Riots , Seattle\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Local Reporter Surveys Philly Strip Mall Ravaged by BLM Riots\n\nFox 29 Philadelphia reporter Steve Keeley explored the aftermath of looting in the city's Port Richmond neighborhood Wednesday morning-and found an entire strip mall destroyed by a mob.\n\nThe city has seen widespread unrest following the death of Walter Wallace Jr., whom police shot for reportedly charging them with a knife, but recently the looting has become increasingly calculated.\n\n\"An immigrant store owner from north Jersey, he tried to guard his store,\" Keeley reported. \"He put mattresses and big furniture pieces up against his doors, he said it was no match for the crowd. They came in with U-Haul trucks-U-Haul trucks!-and I can't tell you the words he used to describe it.\"\n\nAs left-wing activists have justified looting in the name of the Black Lives Matter movement, cities around the country have struggled to maintain order. Wallace's family have pleaded with Philadelphians not to destroy businesses in his name, but the rioting has continued.\n\nKeeley said a security officer told him what the rioters did to a Walmart they later ransacked.\n\n\"Somehow, for fun of it I guess, some people climbed up to the pipes and pulled them down,\" he said. \"That's what's causing the store to be completely flooded.\"\n\nIn addition to stealing and destroying products, the rioters took Walmart's cash registers as well.\n\n\"Same goes for all the stores elsewhere in this strip mall, all the registers were stolen,\" Keeley said.\n\nThe rioters also apparently used explosives to open some of Walmart's vending machines in order to take the cash inside.\n\nLOOK at @Walmart vending machines.   You can see that one of them was BLOWN UP to get the cash box out.  And inside the store ALL the cash registers are GONE.

'Looters were shooting looters.\"   '50 yr old man that had his car filled then was carjacked and had all his stolem stiff re-stolen from him\"from @PhillyPolice on scene of looting tell FOX 29. @FOX29philly pic.twitter.com/FahA709kFN\n\n- Steve Keeley (@KeeleyFox29) October 28, 2020\n\nPennsylvania governor Tom Wolf (D.) mobilized the National Guard to deal with the rioting, but Philadelphia police have been ordered not to arrest looters, Fox 29 reported . In a directive, Deputy Police Commissioner Melvin Singleton told police to respond to \"priority\" calls only, which do not include \"disturbance, missing person, missing vehicle, burglary or theft.\"\n\nVideos show a Black Lives Matter organizer saying it was time to \"rip the root out of the f-ing soil\" and protesters harassing Jewish people who said they wanted to join the protest out of \"solidarity.\" The protesters shouted that the Jews were part of the \"Synagogue of Satan\" prophesied in the New Testament.\n\nPublished under: Black Lives Matter , Philadelphia , Protests\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
