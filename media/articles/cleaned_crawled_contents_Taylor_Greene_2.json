      "text": "'Leave Elmo alone': Marjorie Taylor Greene ripped for attack on public broadcasters\n\nU.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) reacts while talking with U.S. Representative Nancy Mace (R-SC), on the day of U.S. President Donald Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress, in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 4, 2025.\n\nProgressives roundly ridiculed U.S. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene on Wednesday after the serial conspiracy theorist made baseless claims that National Public Radio and Public Broadcasting Service are \"radical left-wing echo chambers\" with a \"communist agenda\" and called for their defunding.\n\n\"Is Elmo now, or has he ever been, a member of the Communist Party?\"\n\nGreene (R-Ga.)-who chairs the House Oversight Committee's Subcommittee on Delivering Government Efficiency ( DOGE , but not part of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency)-convened the hearing, titled \" Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the Heads of NPR and PBS Accountable ,\" to examine alleged \"biased news\" and whether American taxpayers \"will continue funding these leftist media outlets.\"\n\n\"After listening to what we've heard today, we will be calling for the complete and total defund and dismantling of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,\" the congresswoman told NPR CEO Katherine Maher and the PBS CEO Paula Kerger during her closing remarks, referring to the nonprofit that helps fund PBS and NPR .\n\n\"Here's how it works: In America, every single day-every single day-private businesses operate on their own, without government funding,\" she added. \"We believe you all can hate us on your own dime.\"\n\nPBS gets about 16% of its funding from federal sources. For NPR , the figure is around just 1%.\n\nGreene-who has amplified conspiracy theories including QAnon, Pizzagate, the 9/11 \"hoax,\" government involvement in mass shootings, \"Jewish space lasers\" causing wildfires, the U.S. government controlling the weather, and the \"stolen\" 2020 presidential election-made more blatantly false claims during Wednesday's hearing, including that PBS used \"taxpayer funds to push some of the most radical left positions like featuring a drag queen\" on one of its children's programs. This never happened.\n\nNevertheless, Greene used props including a blown-up photo of drag queen Lil' Miss Hot Mess, a children's book author and Drag Queen Story Hour board member, whom the congresswoman called a \"monster,\" while baselessly accusing Maher and Kerger of \"grooming and sexualizing\" children.\n\nAnother Republican member of the panel, House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer of Kentucky, appeared to not understand the difference between an editorial-an opinion article-and the the work and standards of media editors:\n\nDemocrats on the DOGE subcommittee pushed back against the attacks by Greene and other Republicans on the panel. Mocking Greene's assertion that PBS and NPR have a \"communist agenda\" and referring to one of the most beloved characters on the long-running children's show Sesame Street , Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) asked Kerger a McCarthyesque question: \"Is Elmo now, or has he ever been, a member of the Communist Party? A yes or no.\"\n\nKerger answered \"no,\" prompting Garcia to retort: \"Now, are you sure, Ms. Kerger? Because he's obviously red... He also has a very dangerous message about sharing. And helping each other; he's indoctrinating our kids that sharing is caring. Now maybe he's part of a major socialist plot and maybe that's why the chairwoman is having this hearing today.\"\n\nRep. Greg Casar (D-Texas) responded to a false assertion by hearing guest Mike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation-the main force behind Project 2025, the plan for a far-right overhaul of the federal government that includes defunding public broadcasters-as well Musk's glaring conflicts of interest by referring to a popular porcine protagonist of Muppets fame.\n\n\"To your knowledge, has Miss Piggy ever been caught trying to funnel billions of dollars in government contracts to herself and to her companies?\" Casar said.\n\nAt the end of his remarks, the progressive lawmaker implored Greene to \"leave Elmo alone\" and instead bring in Musk, the de facto head of the other DOGE, for questioning. Musk, the world's richest person, and President Donald Trump support defunding public broadcasters.\n\nIn typically fiery fashion, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) told Greene and Republicans that \"free speech is not about what y'all want somebody to say, and the idea that you want to shut down everybody that is not Fox News is bullshit!\"\n\nTim Karr, the senior director of strategy and communications at the media reform group Free Press, told Common Dreams after the hearing that Greene's \"bogus attack against public media is a blatant attempt to further weaken the sort of journalism that questions the corruption and cruelty of the Trump administration.\"\n\n\"This is not about saving taxpayer dollars or based on any genuine concern about whether there's too much bias on public media. It's a blatant attempt to undermine independent, rigorous reporting on the Trump administration,\" Karr argued.\n\n\"Greene may not like public media-and that's no surprise given that she's no fan of journalism that holds public officials and billionaires accountable,\" he continued. \"But she and her Republican colleagues are far out of step with the American people and their needs. Communities all across the country rely on their local public radio and TV stations to provide trustworthy news reporting and a diversity of opinions.\"\n\n\"In every survey, the American public indicates it wants more support for public and community media, not less,\" Karr added. \"Unfortunately, President Trump and his cronies in Congress have instead tried to zero out funding for public media. They have repeatedly failed because millions of viewers and listeners oppose them and instead believe that support for public media is taxpayer money well spent.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Freedom of the Press Foundation, and Reporters Without Borders sent a joint letter urging Greene's committee \"to approach its examination of public broadcasting with the understanding that press freedom is not a partisan issue, rather a vital part of American democracy.\"\n\n\"The tone and conduct of the proceedings matter,\" the groups' letter asserts. \"The American public deserves access to quality, independent journalism, regardless of geography, income, creed, or political views. Public broadcasting delivers on this vital need by providing high-quality, fact-based reporting to the American public, including underserved communities across the nation.\"\n\n\"Congressional scrutiny of public broadcasting must not undermine the ability of journalists to report the news safely and without fear of reprisal,\" the groups stressed. \"Otherwise, a dangerous precedent will be set that could further erode trust in the media and undermine press freedom more broadly.\"\n\nThe Communications Workers of America (CWA) union is sharing a petition telling Congress to protect public broadcasting.\n\n\"Republican leaders in Congress and the Trump administration are following the Project 2025 playbook and trying to shut down funding for independent public television and radio stations,\" the petition states. \"Many CWA members work at these locally owned stations and play a crucial role in keeping our communities informed. Without public television and radio stations, we will lose access to critical local news and programming.\""

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) on MSNBC Wednesday.\n\nElon Musk spoke at the cabinet meeting, and Steele noted that he did so before Trump spoke. \"He is the most important person in that room, and that includes the President of the United States,\" Steele said.\n\nHe criticized the meeting attendees. \"The fact that they just sat there like little lemmings and applauded the moment that more and more of their power was sucked away from them and affirmed by Elon Musk standing there is significant,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, I know a lot of folks are going to, you know, take exception of what I said about who the most powerful man in that room is, but I'm sorry. I'm watching the dynamics. I'm listening to how this is laid out. If I'm the president of the United States, I'm not letting him talk first,\" he added.\n\nGreene, who is chair of the Department of Government Accountability subcommittee, criticized Democrats who have been standing up for federal workers amidst Trump and Musk's mass firings.\n\n\"You can protest all you want, Greene said, \"but the American people disagree with you. You're protecting the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy is not a business. Those are not real jobs producing federal revenue. By the way, they're consuming taxpayer dollars. Those jobs are paid for by the American tax people who work real jobs, earn real income, pay federal taxes and then pay these federal employees. Federal employees do not deserve their jobs. Federal employees not do not deserve their paychecks.\"\n\n\"Maybe I'm confused, but isn't she a federal employee?\" asked MSNBC's Chris Jansing.\n\n\"Yes... the level of stupid there is untenable, and the fact that she's the chair of this subcommittee should tell you everything you need to know. She is a federal employee.\"\n\n\"The American people don't agree with what's happening. Every... piece of polling that's coming out shows a significant majority, which means, which tells me Republicans don't agree with this... So I just this is where we are, Chris, and the country is going to have to grapple with the wholesale onslaught against the government and the mess that's being left in its wake, because this is not going to get undone easily, as long as you have individuals like that sitting with power and control over how this plays out.\"\n\nWatch the video below or at this link :"

Al Green (D-TX) was booted from the House chamber during President Donald Trump's address, even as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was allowed to openly flout House rules yet went unpunished.\n\nFew Democrats are coming to the defense of Rep. Al Green after Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) removed him for repeatedly yelling to Trump that he had \"no mandate to cut Medicaid. \" Even the congressman himself later told reporters he's willing to face whatever punishment comes his way for publicly protesting the president.\n\n\"It's worth it to let people know that there are some of us who are going to stand up against this president,\" Green said.\n\nBut some Democrats are questioning what they see as a double standard in upholding the House of Representatives' crucial rules.\n\n\"Marjorie Taylor Greene was sitting over there with a cap on that violates the rules of the House,\" Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) complained to Raw Story after the address of the congresswoman's bright red, MAGA-style trucker cap emblazoned, 'Trump was right about everything.'\n\n\"Nobody said one word to her, even though Nancy Pelosi told one of the guys, 'Can you not see that cap over there?' And he said, 'Oh yeah, I see it' and then he walked out,\" Cleaver said. \"So that's not right.\"\n\nRight or wrong, Republicans are writing - or, at the very least, interpreting - the rules in Washington these days.\n\nThat has Democrats scrambling. And breaking rules as they go.\n\nThere was a lot of rule-breaking in the House chamber\n\nWhile it's not his political style, Cleaver says he knows Rep. Al Green's protest was motivated by his convictions.\n\n\"He's my friend, and he is somebody who believes deeply and irreversibly in treating people decently,\" Cleaver said. \"And I think some of the things that Mr. Trump has done and said violated what he believed to be, and he was courageous enough to stand up and challenge the president right there in the chamber.\"\n\nA few Democrats stood up, turned their back to the president, and revealed 'Resist' or 'No king lives here' tee shirts before walking out.\n\n\"That's a lie!\" Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) wrote on a mini whiteboard. Or \"Start by paying your taxes!\" on another.\n\nA couple dozen House Democrats waved protest fans throughout the speech that were emblazoned \"False,\" \"Musk steals,\" \"Save Medicaid\" and \"Protect veterans.\"\n\n\"I thought it was effective. I think it was helpful to express how they were feeling without disrupting the proceedings,\" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) told Raw Story after the speech.\n\nWhile Gillibrand respected the sign-waving, she wasn't happy that Green yelled at the president during the address.\n\n\"I didn't appreciate it, but I can understand why he felt so strongly,\" Gillibrand said. \"It's not the time or the place, from my perspective, but, again, I understand how he feels - understand how a lot of people feel.\"\n\nEvery elected Democrat feels that pressure to one degree or another.\n\n\"There are a whole variety of different tactics, and there is such pressure on us to express the strong convictions of our supporters that there's a desire to do that,\" Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA) told Raw Story. \"Whether that is a way to win swing voters? Everybody has a different tactic.\"\n\n\"Did you hold one of the signs?\" Raw Story asked.\n\n\"No, I didn't, but I did collect them. Anybody who wanted a sign could get a sign,\" Sherman - while holding at least three of his fellow Democrats' discarded signs in his hands after the address - said. \"I was busy taking notes on the speech and tweeting a little bit about it, so I thought my tweets were more interesting than their signs because they were longer.\"\n\n\"I do not think anyone should heckle a president\"\n\nOther Democrats weren't happy with all the rule-breaking, regardless of which side of the aisle it came from.\n\n\"I do feel that when you're in that chamber and the president of the United States is delivering a speech, there should be decorum in the chamber, respect for the office,\" Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) told Raw Story.\n\nWhile Booker loves Rep. Al Green as a colleague and friend, he does believe he crossed a line.\n\n\"I do not think anyone should heckle a president, interrupt their speech,\" Booker said.\n\nAs for how the Democratic Party comes back, Sen. Gillibrand says it's gonna take more than one speech.\n\n\"It's all about organizing and building a blue wave,\" Gillibrand said. \"Making sure our advocates and our allies are focused on explaining to the American people what's happening, explaining how these different cuts and changes are hurting communities and then building coalitions to oppose Trump in the next election.\"\n\n\"Leave the antics to MTG?\" Raw Story asked.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Gillibrand said through a laugh.\n\nNOW READ: We crushed fascists before - and it's time to do it again"

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene floats making J6 a national holiday\n\nWASHINGTON - With the fourth anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack coming this Monday, steel fencing is now once again wrapping the Capitol, which has had some Democrats in tears and many Capitol Police officers reliving the horror they endured that day.\n\nBut the GOP now controls both sides of the Capitol, and the party's hoping to change the debate.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers are vowing to investigate members of the bipartisan, select January 6 committee, even as President-elect Donald Trump is promising pardons for many - and, potentially, all - those convicted of violently interrupting official government proceedings .\n\nALSO READ: Revealed: The secret Republican plot to disenfranchise millions of voters\n\nBut Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) - who's been the GOP's fiercest advocate for those imprisoned for storming the Capitol four years ago - floated to Raw Story going a step further - and memorializing the day as a national holiday.\n\n\"Curious if you have any thoughts, with Jan. 6 on Monday,\" Raw Story asked as Greene and a small group made their way to the House floor Friday. \"I know your party wants to change the conversation on that in this new Congress.\"\n\n\"To what?\" Greene asked.\n\n\"On Jan. 6, what happened in 2021,\" Raw Story replied.\n\n\"You mean, make it a national holiday?\" Greene replied through a broad grin.\n\n\"Your Democratic counterparts say that you guys are trying to rewrite history,\" Raw Story pressed.\n\n\"How's that?\" Greene asked.\n\n\"Pardoning the J6 folks,\" Raw Story said.\n\n\"Oh, you mean, like after Joe Biden pardoned sex criminals and some of the worst criminals, just letting them out of jail. We're the ones changing history?\" Greene said. \"They're the ones that objected to three Republican presidents, so you can't change history. Unless we make it a national holiday.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" Raw Story asked. \"Do you want that?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Greene said through a broad smile ahead of Friday's speaker vote.\n\nAs Greene walked onto the House floor, Raw Story turned to her boyfriend and communications director for clarity.\n\n\"Was she joking?\" Raw Story asked.\n\n\"Well, she smiled,\" her boyfriend replied with a laugh. \"But...\"\n\n\"Shut up about Jan. 6,\" Greene's communications director told Raw Story through laughter.\n\nIn June, Biden issued a proclamation granting full and unconditional pardons to military service members and veterans who were court-martialed and convicted under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for consensual sexual acts with adults. That pardon aimed at addressing discrimination against LGBT service members during the \" Don't Ask, Don't Tell \" era.\n\nLast month, Biden pardoned 39 people convicted of non-violent crimes, and commuted the sentences of about 1,500 people, most of whom were non-violent offenders. These pardons and commutations primarily involved drug-related offenses and people who had demonstrated successful rehabilitation.\n\nAmong Biden's pardons was his son Hunter, who was convicted of gun charges in June and who later pleaded guilty to three felonies and six misdemeanors related to tax evasion."

Mike Johnson has surrendered to Joe Biden at every turn and is no different than Nancy Pelosi. He has funded the left's radical agenda time and time again!\"\n\nThe five-page letter aimed to explain why Greene filed a motion to vacate the speakership last month, calling it a \"warning\" to the Louisiana lawmaker.\n\nJournalist  Zeeshan Aleem emphasized in a Wednesday, April 10 op-ed that although pushing for what she wants regardless of internal pushback is on brand for the Georgia leader - \"her letter marks a new escalation.\"\n\nIronically, the MSNBC Daily writer and editor notes, \"If she really attempts to oust Johnson in the coming weeks for daring to defy her demands, and succeeds, she will be the one responsible for pushing the party into another historic display of chaotic internal strife.

It's not the bill that I would have drafted or all of us would have drafted if we had the majority in the House and the Senate and had a Republican president that would sign it in law, but instead we have Democrats in those other two chambers in the Senate and of course the Oval Office, and so they know over here that we have a one vote margin so I have virtually zero leverage to be able to negotiate, get a better package.\"\n\nAleem's full op-ed is here ."

Marjorie Taylor Green (R-GA) walked back one of Donald Trump's many Day One promises with a condescending remark.\n\nThe president-elect made an attention-grabbing promise during a May 2023 town hall to \"settle\" the Russian-Ukraine war within \"24 hours\" of taking office, which was actually his campaign's most consistent promise, but the Georgia Republican told NOTUS the media had simply gotten that oft-stated position wrong.\n\n\"I think you need to understand language,\" Greene said, \"and everyone else in America understands that language.\"\n\nALSO READ: Fox News has blood on its hands as Trump twists the knife\n\n\"I don't think the media pressing Day One is specifically 'Day One,'\" she added. \"But he's talking about that as one of his first roles as president, and there are many.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) isn't just loathed by Democrats - she's also been falling increasingly out of favor with her Republican colleagues, according to a new report.\n\nCNN reported Tuesday that the Georgia Republican has become increasingly isolated since Rep. Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) became speaker last fall. She's reportedly become \"persona non grata\" among the House Republican Conference due to her penchant for bomb-throwing and caustic language in committee hearings. And CNN's Annie Grayer and Melanie Zanona wrote that Republicans are now even considering \"repercussions\" for the far-right congresswoman in their efforts to rein her in.\n\n\"This is supposed to be a collaborative body, at least within your own conference, and she doesn't play nice in the sandbox,\" Rep. Carlos Giménez (R-Florida) told CNN.\n\nGreene reportedly eroded much of her colleagues' good will in her failed motion to vacate Johnson, which had scant support and was defeated by both Democrats and Republicans . Other members of the House majority are also reportedly exasperated with Greene's attempts to bring divisive motions to the floor that have little chance of passing the House and would be dead on arrival in the Democratic-run U.S. Senate.\n\nEven though the House barely managed to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas - after the first attempt failed - the MAGA firebrand reportedly now wants Johnson to bring a motion to the floor to impeach President Joe Biden over the Southern border (where illegal crossings have sharply declined this year). She's also clamoring for a government shutdown this fall, saying that Congress should cut off all funding for the Department of Justice in protest of former President Donald Trump's 34 felony convictions in his New York criminal trial.\n\n\"We aren't a serious country anymore. We're literally a banana republic,\" Greene said in response to Trump's unanimous guilty verdict on all counts by a jury that both prosecutors and the defense approved. \"So what does it matter funding the government? The American people don't give a s-.\"\n\nHowever, other more centrist members of the Republican conference are throwing cold water on her legislative proposals.\n\n\"I don't think that you cure one hasty ill-advised action with another,\" Rep. Nick LaLota (R-New York) said. \"I think that she feels that the score will be settled if we do something equally as hasty here, and I don't think that's how the government should work.\"\n\nGreene is reportedly unmoved by her colleagues' increased distaste for her. She told the network that she's \"gotten past\" other Republicans' disapproval and remains steadfast that the GOP majority is largely \"feckless,\" \"useless\" and \"does nothing.\"\n\n\"I'm not interested in angering anybody or upsetting anyone. What I am interested in is being a part of a Republican conference that does something for a change,\" Greene said."

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene targets former Biden official's religious faith in House hearing\n\nDuring a House Oversight Committee hearing on Wednesday, U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) invoked God and religion to harshly question Martin O'Malley, the former Commissioner of the Social Security Administration and a former Governor of Maryland, about his personal views on abortion and his Catholic faith.\n\nIn her highly confrontational interrogation of O'Malley, a longtime Democrat who also served as Governor of Maryland for eight years and ran for president in 2016, Congresswoman Greene, a self-avowed Christian nationalist , invoked his Catholic faith to attack his beliefs about abortion.\n\n\"Since you're very interested in being DNC chair, you are after all a lifelong Democrat politician - I don't even know if you had a job in the real world, but you have been an elected politician for years,\" Greene accused (video below). \"Mr. O'Malley you're also a Catholic, are you not?\"\n\n\"I am,\" O'Malley confirmed.\n\n\"Do you serve God or do you serve the Democrat Party?\" Greene asked.\n\n\"I serve God,\" O'Malley responded.\n\nAn off-camera committee member interjected: \"Mr. Chairman, as a Roman Catholic, I take offense at the suggestion that somebody has [inaudible] to God and their service as a Catholic.\"\n\nGreene tried to talk over the objection, which went unaddressed by the Republican majority chair.\n\n\"Mr. O'Malley, will you be supporting the murder of the unborn up until the day of birth like your party does? As DNC chair, will you be supporting the murder of innocent unborn people? Is that in line with your faith in God and the Catholic Church?\" Greene said, appearing to grandstand.\n\n\"I trust the judgment of women and doctors over the judgment of government,\" O'Malley patiently replied.\n\n\"Now, do you trust God's judgment?\" Greene continued. \"Do you trust God that he loves and has created every single human being? Do you support the murder of unborn children and are you going to uphold that evil practice that the Democrat Party wants to continue? You see, abortions over 95% of them are unintended pregnancies. They use abortions as birth control. So are you going to continue the birth control practice of murdering the unborn children as chair of the DNC? Will that be, that be a policy?\"\n\nO'Malley, appearing to near the end of his patience, replied, \"I am pro-choice, and I trust the judgment of women and their doctors over judgments of government.`\n\n\"Well, thank you for letting God know where you stand with the murder of -\" Greene snapped back before O'Malley interjected.\n\n\"I talk to God every day,\" he declared.\n\n\"Yeah, well you might want to talk to him a little bit more, Mr. O'Malley, because you're definitely in the wrong,\" Greene charged.\n\nThe Republican from Georgia was not finished.\n\nMinutes later she posted a short clip of her attack on O'Malley to social media, and wrote : \"WATCH: 'Catholic' Martin O'Malley confirms abortion is the sacrament of the Democrat Party.\"\n\nO'Malley has been called \"a Pope Francis Democrat\" and a \"a pray-every-morning, church-every-Sunday\" believer, according to a 2015 Religion News Service article.\n\nWatch the video below or at this link .\n\nRELATED: 'Antisemitism Is Wrong, But': Marjorie Taylor Greene Pilloried for Promoting Antisemitic Claim"

      "text": "It's Not Easy Being (Marjorie Taylor) Greene\n\nA goofy Washington tradition devolves.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nWhere have you gone, Elmo, Cookie Monster, and Big Bird?\n\nIn a more innocent time, the hallowed puppets of Sesame Street were recurring characters in congressional debates about public broadcasting. They served a vital and somewhat quaint Kabuki function: Whenever a politician questioned whether PBS or NPR should continue to receive government funding, public-broadcast advocates predictably trotted out their furry or feathered friends to disarm the bullies and remind everyone how beloved these creatures are. Especially by kids. Remember the kids!\n\nSadly, Messrs. Elmo, Monster, and Bird were nowhere to be seen on Capitol Hill today. They would not have fit in, anyway, as the proceedings in a crowded basement-level hearing room of the Capitol Visitor Center were not sweet, accepting, or the least bit neighborly.\n\nTom Junod: My friend Mr. Rogers\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, had invited the heads of PBS, Paula Kerger, and of NPR, Katherine Maher, to testify before the House Oversight Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE). As chair of the subcommittee, Greene had many questions. And, it would seem, preexisting impressions: The hearing was titled \"Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the Heads of NPR and PBS Accountable.\" ( The Atlantic has a partnership with WETA, which receives funding from PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.)\n\nGreene gaveled the proceeding to order at 10 a.m. \"Today, we are looking at the more than half a billion dollars federal taxpayers spend annually to fund public radio and television,\" she said in her opening statement. She vowed to grill the witnesses about their oversight of \"radical left-wing echo chambers,\" and accused the CEOs of perpetrating a \"communist agenda\" and being fine with \"sexualizing and grooming children.\"\n\nThis seemed hostile.\n\nIt was not really surprising, though. In her brief time in Congress, Greene has proved a relentless voice of MAGA grievance and one-woman Masterpiece Theatre in reacting to the latest outrage visited upon Donald Trump. Her newly created DOGE subcommittee fashions itself as a corollary to the efforts of Elon Musk in his quest to identify and slash or eliminate whatever government work and workers he deems unworthy.\n\nThe panel quickly fell into a familiar pattern of Republicans and Democrats taking turns giving five-minute speeches, nominally framed as questions for the witnesses. Representative Stephen F. Lynch of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat, devoted most of his statement to railing against the subcommittee's priorities. He believed that it should not be using its power to \"go after the likes of Elmo and Cookie Monster,\" but should be more concerned with getting to the bottom of why high-level officials in the Trump administration texted sensitive national-security material to Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of this magazine (a big story this week, apparently). \"If shame was still a thing, this hearing would be shameful,\" Lynch said.\n\nJames Comer, the Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee, said that he used to listen to NPR while working on a farm during his rural Kentucky youth. He spoke with a measure of nostalgic fondness for the outlet, until his inevitable pivot. \"I don't even recognize NPR anymore,\" lamented Comer, who now dismisses the outlet as \"propaganda.\"\n\nEven if the Sesame Street characters were not physically present, Democrats were eager to apply the show's recurring bits to Trump's conduct in the White House. \"To borrow a phrase from Sesame Street , the letter of the day is c -for corruption ,\" Greg Casar, of Texas, said. \"Leave Elmo alone!\" he pleaded.\n\nFrom the January/February 2023 issue: Why is Marjorie Taylor Greene like this?\n\nRobert Garcia, a Democrat from California, had pointed questions for Kerger, of PBS. He wanted to know whether Elmo's ruddy complexion signaled some troubling political sympathies. \"Is Elmo now or has he ever been a member of the Communist Party of the United States?\" he asked. Garcia also wanted to know if Bert and Ernie had an extremist liberal agenda. He appeared to be kidding.\n\nThe spectacle lasted a few hours and was mostly forgettable. But it illustrated how another entrenched (and somewhat goofy) Washington tradition-wrangling over whether to defund public broadcasting-has devolved into cheap and predictable posturing. Theoretically, it should be possible to hold a perfectly legitimate debate over whether public money should subsidize radio and TV outlets-and to do it without the chair of the subcommittee accusing PBS of being \"one of the founders of the trans child-abuse industry.\"\n\nAlas, this was not to be today. The hearing room emptied out around lunchtime, and that was it for conducting the nation's business.\n\nThis article was brought to you by the letter d -for depressing ."

      "text": "The Sin the House Freedom Caucus Couldn't Forgive\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene is no longer radical enough for the GOP's radical fringe.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene has been called many things, but she has never been called a moderate squish.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe U.S. representative from Georgia was apparently kicked out of the House Freedom Caucus, the hard-right group famous for bedeviling Republican House speakers, in a vote last month, Politico first reported . Representative Andy Harris, a board member, told several outlets about the outcome. The HFC says it does not comment on membership, and Greene released a statement that did not specifically address the expulsion but said, \"In Congress, I serve Northwest Georgia first, and serve no group in Washington.\"\n\nRead: Why is Marjorie Taylor Greene like this?\n\nGreene was not ejected for subscribing to QAnon beliefs , or for encouraging violence against colleagues, or for blaming wildfires on Jewish space lasers , or for supporting Vladimir Putin . Instead, Harris said, Greene was punished for tangling with her fellow HFC member Lauren Boebert of Colorado and daring to take a minimal step toward governance by aligning herself with Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a conservative Republican. The vote shows just how radical the MAGA fringe in Congress is today-a wild-eyed clique implacably opposed to governance .\n\nWhen Greene entered Congress in 2021, she was viewed, correctly, as wacky and toxic. In February of that year, Democrats moved to kick her out of her formal committee assignments after McCarthy hesitated to punish her for offensive remarks. But Greene used the ensuing two years to build her power within the party. She forged an alliance with McCarthy: It saved her from pariahdom and made her a major face of the party, and it gave him credibility (or at least cover) with right-wing members. When his bid for the speakership nearly faltered in January 2023, she was a crucial backer. And when McCarthy needed votes for the debt deal he struck with President Joe Biden in May, Greene was there.\n\nBut the closeness to McCarthy, whom the right views as an unreliable and moderate speaker, and support for the debt deal was too much for her HFC colleagues to bear, according to Politico 's reporting. The fury over the debt deal is silly. McCarthy never had much leverage to bring against Biden, and he managed to extract more from the White House than many Democrats would have liked. The alternative to the deal he struck wasn't a better deal-it was a catastrophic national default. Greene's sin, to HFC members, was insufficient nihilism.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Marjorie Taylor Greene is just a symptom of what ails the GOP\n\nThe idea that Greene has become some sort of moderate is belied by the other reason she was kicked out. Last month on the House floor, she called Boebert \"a little bitch\"-amid a disagreement over competing resolutions to impeach Biden. (A typically unrepentant Greene defended her word choice to Semafor , explaining , \"She has genuinely been a nasty little bitch to me.\" Boebert, for her part, said that she had defended Greene's comments on free-speech grounds ahead of the caucus vote.)\n\nGreene is as extreme as she ever has been, but she became prominent not just for her \"loony lies and conspiracy theories\"-to use Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's phrase-but for her savvy wielding of those views in the press to get attention. But some of the remaining members of the Freedom Caucus, although not so well known, have terrifying views of their own.\n\nThe chair, Scott Perry, a Pennsylvanian, was a key plotter of Donald Trump's attempted paperwork coup to steal the 2020 election, and has been swept up in Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation . Jim Jordan of Ohio, the chief inquisitor of the House majority, is the vice chair. Andy Biggs of Arizona responded to Donald Trump's federal indictment in June by tweeting , \" We have now reached a war phase. Eye for an eye.\" His colleague Clay Higgins of Louisiana outdid him with a m é lange of militia vernacular incomprehensible to the average citizen . Mary Miller of Illinois first reached national attention in 2021 when she told rally attendees, \" Hitler was right on one thing: He said, 'Whoever has the youth has the future.'\" She may not have intended to praise Hitler; the same cannot safely be assumed about Paul Gosar of Arizona, who is deeply entwined with neo-Nazis and white supremacists . Matt Gaetz of Florida is, well, Matt Gaetz.\n\nJeff Sharlet: The congressman telling Trump supporters to \"buckle up\"\n\nWhen Greene was kicked off her committees back in 2021, I argued that the GOP was disingenuously treating her as one lone, unhinged figure who could be ignored. The problem for Republican leaders was that they couldn't very well punish her for views that the party had tolerated and fostered.\n\nA little more than two years later, the center of the House congressional caucus has moved so far that Greene is no longer a fringe member-in fact, the fringe members view her as an avatar of compromise and weakness. That's no longer just a problem for Republican leaders. It's a problem for the entire country."

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene's Civil War\n\nThe congresswoman is too influential within the GOP-and too representative of its views-for her calls for secession to be dismissed.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene-a peddler of far-right conspiracy theories , a speaker at white-nationalist rallies, a supporter of political violence, and an all-around unhinged individual -would renew her call for secession.\n\nOn Presidents' Day, Greene tweeted :\n\nWe need a national divorce. We need to separate by red states and blue states and shrink the federal government. Everyone I talk to says this. From the sick and disgusting woke culture issues shoved down our throats to the Democrat's traitorous America Last policies, we are done.\n\nThe temptation of many people, eager to move past America's political freak show, will be to ignore her comments and dismiss her as an outcast, a fringe figure, deranged but isolated. The less said about her, the better.\n\nThat's unwise.\n\nFrom the January/February 2023 issue: Why is Marjorie Taylor Greene like this?\n\nGreene is not just a member of Congress, not just a member of its Committee on Homeland Security; she has become a confidante of Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy. He has \"forged an ironclad bond\" with Greene, according to The New York Times . She has \"taken on an outsize role as a policy adviser to Mr. McCarthy.\" He has in turn lavished praise on her.\n\n\"If you're going to be in a fight, you want Marjorie in your foxhole,\" McCarthy told the Times . \"When she picks a fight, she's going to fight until the fight's over. She reminds me of my friends from high school, that we're going to stick together all the way through.\" He'll even stick together with those arguing for secession, apparently.\n\nGreene is not alone in her views. She is giving voice to a widespread and growing sentiment in the Republican Party. Among Republicans in the South, for example, support for secession was 66 percent in June 2021, according to a Bright Line Watch/YouGov poll . (The poll found support for secession growing among every partisan group in the months following the January 6 riot at the Capitol.)\n\nLast summer, thousands of Texas Republicans approved a platform that called on the state legislature to authorize a referendum on secession from the United States. And shortly after Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, Rush Limbaugh, one of the most dominant figures on the American right, said , \"I actually think that we're trending toward secession. I see more and more people asking, 'What in the world do we have in common with the people who live in, say, New York?'\"\n\nLimbaugh, who died in early 2021, added that \"a lot of bloggers have written extensively about how distant ... and how much more separated our culture is becoming politically and that it can't go on this way. There cannot be a peaceful coexistence of two completely different theories of life, theories of government, theories of how we manage our affairs. We can't be in this dire a conflict without something giving somewhere along the way.\" (Limbaugh said of secession, \"I myself haven't made up my mind.\")\n\nThe Republican Party, forged a century and a half ago in the fight against secession, now finds the move worth contemplating.\n\nCivil War-like secession isn't going to happen in the United States, at least not anytime soon. But all of the emotions that are attached to a desire for secession-seething resentment, existential fear, an unforgiving spirit, contempt and hatred for those who disagree with you-are stoked by the kind of rhetoric employed by Greene and those who see the world as she does. Such language will further destroy America's political culture and could easily lead to extensive political violence.\n\nSeyward Darby: There's nothing fun or funny about Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nDon't expect a wave of Republican lawmakers and current and potential presidential candidates to get on the secession bandwagon. That is still too extreme for most of them, at least right now. But I doubt that many Republicans, aside from courageous figures such as Utah Governor Spencer Cox and Liz Cheney , the former chair of the House Republican Conference , will call Greene out. (Senator Mitt Romney of Utah and former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan have shown integrity throughout the MAGA years as well.)\n\nBut by and large, if Republicans call Greene out, they will offer only gentle rebukes. Mostly, they'll want to ignore her comments, change the topic, and try to redirect attention to Democrats. During the past half a dozen years, Republicans have perfected whataboutism.\n\nWhat the rest of us learned during the Trump era is that a party led by craven men and women-some of them cynical, others true believers, almost all afraid to speak out-will end up normalizing the transgressive, unethical, and moronic.\n\nTrump did horrifying things at the end of his presidency, including attempting a coup and inciting a violent mob to attack the Capitol. The majority of Republicans tolerated what he did, to a degree that simply wouldn't have happened at the beginning of his presidency. It took time for the corruption to fully take hold, for the party-lawmakers and the right-wing media complex-to fall completely into line. But fall in line they did. Trump may be losing his grip on the Republican Party, and that is a good thing, but his nihilistic imprint remains all over it.\n\nMAGA Republicans like Marjorie Taylor Greene have added calls for secession to their corrosive lies about the 2020 presidential election. More incendiary and treacherous claims will follow. Greene and McCarthy-one crazed, the other cowardly-embody a large swath of the modern-day GOP. Any party that makes room for seditionists and secessionists is sick and dangerous."

      "text": "The Rise of Anti-history\n\nThe Trumpist wing of the GOP uses history as a bludgeon, without regard to context, logic, or proportionality.\n\nIn June, Marjorie Taylor Greene visited the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. The visit was, by her own account, revelatory. Earlier in the spring, the Georgia member of the U.S. House compared Food City, a grocery chain that identified vaccinated employees on their name tags, to the Nazis, who forced Jews to wear Stars of David. A few days later, she compared Democrats to Nazis.\n\nNow she was contrite. \"When you make a mistake, you should own it. I have made a mistake, and it's really bothered me for a couple of weeks now, so I definitely want to own it,\" she said . \"The Holocaust-there's nothing comparable to it.\"\n\nThe lesson wore off in less than a month. When President Joe Biden announced plans to send public-health workers door-to-door to encourage people to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, Greene tweeted : \"People have a choice, they don't need your medical brown shirts showing up at their door ordering vaccinations.\"\n\nDavid A. Graham: Marjorie Taylor Greene is just a symptom of what ails the GOP\n\nAnother museum visit would probably be futile. For Greene and others in the Trumpist wing of the Republican Party, anti-history has become a shibboleth. They drop historical references and facts into political debates, but without regard to context, logic, or proportionality. Their villains include Adolf Hitler, but also Mao Zedong and Joseph McCarthy; the Holocaust was bad, but also, Jewish people control the weather . The pose is more than the simple historical illiteracy that's endemic among American politicians. In this GOP faction, members are willfully ignorant of history, which they view in purely instrumental terms, as a bludgeon to wield even as they do not bother to understand it.\n\nAs usual, Donald Trump himself has led the way. In 2018, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly had to give the then-president a capsule lesson about interwar history and which countries were on what side of the two world wars, according to a new book from the Wall Street Journal reporter Michael C. Bender. \"Well, Hitler did a lot of good things,\" Trump reportedly replied, citing the improving German economy in the 1930s. (Trump denies this.) \"You cannot ever say anything supportive of Adolf Hitler,\" Kelly replied. \"You just can't.\" He was right, though he somehow didn't see this as a reason to quit on the spot.\n\nTrump's ignorance of history is well established. In the first fortnight of his presidency, he cited Frederick Douglass as \"an example of somebody who's done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice,\" evincing no awareness of who Douglass was. A few weeks later, Trump mentioned Abraham Lincoln at a dinner. \"Great president. Most people don't even know he was a Republican,\" he said . \"Does anyone know? Lot of people don't know that.\" Who? Then in May 2017, Trump mused nonsensically that if Andrew Jackson had lived later, the Civil War might have been avoided.\n\nRead: Trump's peculiar understanding of the Civil War\n\nPredictably , many of the most egregious examples of the anti-historical approach involve Hitler. Another notable case occurred in Washington State, where a Republican state legislator wore a Star of David to an event in order to protest vaccine mandates. (\"It's an echo from history. In the current context, we're all Jews,\" he wrote on Facebook, before later apologizing.) American conservatives have often argued that the Nazis were actually leftists, noting that the party's full name included the words National Socialist , but the anti-historians have moved from this smirking sophistry to a reflexive recourse to the Holocaust, no matter how ill-fitting or ill-advised, in nearly any debate.\n\nThe contradictory views of Hitler from the anti-historians might seem like ideological confusion. But they actually demonstrate how the anti-historians' use of the past is purely opportunistic. These politicians aren't interpreting history to bolster their views, but cherry-picking isolated, misunderstood examples to fit whatever argument they happen to be making.\n\nAnti-history is not restricted to peculiar views of Hitler. Earlier this week, the former Trump spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News viewers , \"We know most of our forefathers, all of our main Founding Fathers, were against slavery, recognized the evils of it.\" (Several Founders expressed ambivalence about slavery while enslaving people, but that's not what McEnany said.) Representative Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina is fond of citing American history and is often wrong, creating his own anti-history canon .\n\nRead: Donald Trump's narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass\n\nMany legitimate disputes exist about the facts of history and its interpretation: Consider some-though perhaps not most-of the debate over The New York Times Magazine 's 1619 Project . Political figures might also make dubious or mistaken statements about history without participating in anti-history.\n\nConspiracist thinking, another hallmark of Trumpism, is anti-history's natural partner. Each snatches isolated facts or claims out of their proper context, fabricates new contexts for them without regard to reality, and fashions them into partisan weapons. That Greene (found espousing bizarre anti-Semitic theories when she isn't comparing anything she dislikes to the Holocaust) and Trump are leading proponents of both anti-history and conspiracy thinking is not a coincidence.\n\nIn 1955, the founding father of a new strain of conservatism, William F. Buckley, promised that his magazine, National Review , would \"stand athwart history, yelling 'Stop.'\" The rising Trumpist strain in the conservative movement stands athwart slop, yelling, \"History!\""

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Is Just a Symptom of What Ails the GOP\n\nHow can the party hold one individual accountable for espousing repugnant beliefs it previously indulged as a route to victory?\n\nKevin McCarthy's official position is minority leader, but as this week demonstrates, it is a titular role only.\n\nMcCarthy, the top Republican in the House, faces a conundrum in the form of Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a freshman member who has been called a \"cancer\" on the Republican Party because of her \"loony lies and conspiracy theories\"-and that's in the words of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nWhile Greene's views are especially extreme, the dilemma McCarthy faces is an illustration of the broader problem for the Republican Party today: How do you hold one individual accountable for repugnant things you'd previously decided to indulge as a route to victory?\n\nGreene's list of horrifying statements and beliefs is too long to detail here, but it includes racism and bigotry of all sorts and the espousal of conspiracy theories including Pizzagate and QAnon. Many of these statements came to light during her run for Congress.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The GOP abandons democracy\n\nNonetheless, Greene won her race in a safe Republican district and headed to Congress, where she has already reportedly harassed a Democratic lawmaker and filed articles of impeachment against President Joe Biden. More recently, old social-media posts surfaced in which she backed the execution of some congressional Democrats and blamed a major wildfire on a Jewish space laser. In what is either a cruel intentional joke or a breathtaking unintentional one, she was assigned to serve on the House Education and Labor Committee, as well as the Budget Committee.\n\nIn a highly unusual rebuke, Democrats announced that they would force a vote on kicking Greene off her committees. That's a potential twofer for Democrats: They'd rid themselves of Greene, whom many members of Congress find repulsive, and also force Republican members to go on the record as either condemning or condoning her. McCarthy tried to find an escape hatch. First, he reportedly went to Greene, hat in hand, and basically begged her to disavow her past comments or simply step down from the committees herself. If she didn't, he warned, Republicans might remove her from the committees themselves.\n\nGreene's response would not have come as a surprise to anyone even slightly familiar with her: She refused, and sent some inflammatory tweets about it . Then McCarthy tried to cut a deal with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer to remove Greene from the education committee in exchange for canceling the vote. That apparently didn't work either, and yesterday, Democrats announced a vote for today to strip Greene of her assignments. During a caucus meeting Wednesday night, Greene reportedly offered a weak partial apology (really more of a non-apology) and received a standing ovation from colleagues.\n\nThe sequence shows McCarthy is not in charge of his caucus in any meaningful way. Now his members face a painful vote on Greene. On the one hand, she is a dangerous lunatic espousing horrifying lies, and her positions are damaging to the Republican Party and the nation; not voting to strip her assignments is a moral abdication. On the other hand, she is a reliable Republican vote. Significant portions of the Republican base believe in the same conspiracy theories as Greene, so voting to remove her risks alienating some of the party's most enthusiastic base voters and small donors, along with former President Donald Trump, who has backed Greene and (according to her) remains in touch.\n\nPut more finely, the Republican Party will struggle to win national elections without purging people like Greene, but individual members will struggle to win GOP primaries if they do purge them. (Already, Democrats have rolled out a TV ad targeting eight Republican representatives for enabling Greene.)\n\nDavid A. Graham: This is the price of a failed impeachment\n\nThe puzzle for Republicans is what to do when many of your voters, donors, and activists believe things that you think are crazy. Recently, their answer has been to grit their teeth and embrace the crazy. Although the GOP has long had conspiracy theorists within its ranks, when voters nominated Donald Trump for president in 2016, they placed one at the top of the ticket. Insiders expected that Trump would lose, but he didn't. Some party elders thought that they'd be able to control Trump, or at least nudge him, once he was in office. They were wrong again.\n\nYet despite those failures, when Greene surfaced, the GOP tried to handle her in precisely the same way. When her abhorrent beliefs first came to light during the 2020 primary, many leaders condemned her and threw their support behind a rival candidate. When he lost, they meekly slunk back to Greene.\n\n\"Greene could have a devastating impact on the Republican party at-large,\" a top House GOP aide warned The Dispatch back in August . \"It's one thing to have fringe members who represent very ideological districts. It's quite another to have a member who is an avowed conspiracy theorist and traffics in hateful rhetoric that offends the vast majority of Americans. Embracing someone like that will unquestionably turn off the voters who determine congressional majorities.\"\n\nThe party could have disavowed her entirely. Greene probably would have won her deep-red district anyway, but at least Republican leaders could have kept her at arm's length. Instead, they embraced Lyndon Johnson's famous calculation about J. Edgar Hoover: Better to have him inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in.\n\nRead: Newtown's congresswoman takes on Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nIt didn't work. McCarthy brought Greene inside the tent, but she's doing her damage there. Leadership just doesn't have much leverage against a member like Greene, who has strong grassroots support and Trump's backing. Her views are just as abhorrent as before, appalling revelations continue to surface, and McCarthy has no control. He evidently didn't have the votes within his own caucus to strip her of her assignments, and even if he had, she's plainly not in Washington to do the hard work of legislating. For the same reason, threatening to block her bills won't help. The party could withdraw campaign funding, but she'd likely to be able to plug that hole with small donors. The House could expel her, but it seems likely she'd just run and win again. Greene is doing exactly what she promised to her constituents when she ran.\n\nThe whole situation is reminiscent of how Republican leaders tried to handle Trump's spurious claims of a fraudulent 2020 election. (Not coincidentally, Greene has also backed those bogus claims.) They knew that the election hadn't been stolen, but they also didn't want to get crosswise with Trump or his fervent followers. McConnell and several other high-profile Republicans declined to acknowledge Biden's victory until after the Electoral College voted on December 14. When Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (acting as a sock puppet of the Trump campaign) filed a bogus Supreme Court case to overturn the results, 126 House Republicans signed a brief in support -including McCarthy and his deputy, Minority Whip Steve Scalise.\n\n\"What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time? No one seriously thinks the results will change,\" a senior Republican official told The Washington Post in November. And if the result did change ... well, that just meant Republicans kept the White House.\n\nThe problem is that many people did think the results would change. When it became clear that neither the courts nor Vice President Mike Pence was going to hand Trump a second term, a violent mob stormed the Capitol with an eye toward overturning the election, and perhaps lynching some members of Congress or Pence.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump lost everything for Republicans\n\nIn the aftermath of the attempted coup, McConnell got (some) religion. He blasted the insurrection and bluntly blamed Trump for inciting it. According to some reports, he even welcomed the second Trump impeachment. (However, he later supported an unsuccessful Senate vote to dismiss it as unconstitutional.) McConnell is a canny operator, and this makes some political sense: Senators, because they run statewide, are somewhat less susceptible to primary challenges and more dependent on winning a broad spectrum of voters.\n\nMcCarthy had no similar epiphany. Initially, he said Trump was responsible for the violence. Then, under political fire from the president's supporters, he backtracked and made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to atone last week, presumably clad in his finest sackcloth suit. Then he returned to Washington, where he promptly faced the Greene situation-which is just another symptom of the same disease.\n\nThere isn't an obvious path out of the morass for the Republican Party. Democrats have a very narrow majority in the House, and the president's party usually loses seats in midterm elections (though Republicans have endured comparatively low turnout in non-presidential elections in the Trump era, a pattern which may or may not continue). But even if the GOP can win House seats in a midterm, the failure to reckon with the unpopular views of people like Marjorie Taylor Greene-indeed, the failure to even clearly reject them-will make it hard for Republicans, already a minority party, to win nationally or prevail in Senate races. McCarthy would presumably like to be speaker of a Republican-led House, but if his experience as putative leader of the caucus is any sign, would anyone be listening?"

      "text": "Why Is Marjorie Taylor Greene Like This?\n\nOn the ground in the Georgia congresswoman's alternate universe\n\nListen to more stories on audm\n\nThis article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from The Atlantic , Monday through Friday. Sign up for it here.\n\nShe was very late . A man named Barry was compelled to lead the room in a rendition of Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the U.S.A.\" to stall for time. But when she did arrive, the tardiness was forgiven and the Cobb County Republican Party's November breakfast was made new. She wasn't greeted. She was beheld, like a religious apparition. Emotions verged on rapture. Later, as she spoke, one man jumped to his feet with such force that his chair fell over. Not far away, two women clung to each other and shrieked. I was knocked to my seat when a tablemate's corrugated-plastic FLOOD THE POLLS sign collided inadvertently with my head. Upon looking up, I came eye-level with a pistol tucked into the khaki waistband of an elderly man in front of me. \"She is just so great,\" I heard someone say. \"I mean, she really is just amazing .\"\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene arrived in Congress in January 2021, blond and crass and indelibly identified with conspiracy theories involving Jewish space lasers and Democratic pedophiles. She had barely settled into office before being stripped of her committee assignments; she has been called a \"cancer\" on the Republican Party by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell; and she now has a loud voice in the GOP's most consequential decisions on Capitol Hill because her party's leaders know, and she knows they know, that she has become far too popular with their voters to risk upsetting her.\n\nNobody saw her coming. Not even Greene saw Greene coming.\n\nShe was a product , her family loved to say, of the \"Great American Dream.\" There was a three-story home at the end of a shaded driveway in the small town of Cumming, Georgia, north of Atlanta; there was a finished basement in which Marge-and that is what she was called, Marge-and her friends would gather in faded nylon one-pieces after a swim in Lake Lanier.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Marjorie Taylor Greene is just a symptom of what ails the GOP\n\nHer father was Robert David Taylor, a Michigan transplant for whom a three-story home had never been guaranteed but who had believed acutely in its possibility. Bob Taylor was the son of a steel-mill worker; he had served in Vietnam; he had hung siding to pay for classes at Eastern Michigan University. He had married the beautiful Carrie Fidelle Bacon-\"Delle,\" to most people, but he called her Carrie-from Milledgeville, Georgia, and rather than continue with college, he had become a contractor and built a successful company called Taylor Construction. For Marjorie Taylor, the first of Bob and Delle's two children, the result was a world steeped in a distinctly suburban kind of certainty: packed lunches and marble kitchen countertops, semiannual trips to the beach, and the conviction that everything happens for a reason.\n\nShe came of age in Cumming, the seat of Forsyth County. With her turtleneck sweaters and highlighted mall bangs, Marge Taylor might have been any other teenage girl in America. At South Forsyth High School, class of 1992, she was a member of the Spanish club and a manager of the soccer team. She may not have been voted Most Spirited, but she dressed to theme during homecoming week; she may not have had the Best Sense of Humor, but by graduation she had amassed her share of inside jokes with friends. \"Shh ... It's the people outside! \" her senior quote reads in the high-school yearbook. \"Run the cops are here! I'm gone!!\" She was \"nice to everyone,\" \"upbeat,\" with \"tons of confidence,\" recalls Leslie Hamburger, a friend of hers and her brother David's. \"I have nothing but good memories.\" The good-but-not-great student was hardly, in other words, an overachieving scold already plotting her ascent to Washington. It's difficult to imagine an 18-year-old Ted Cruz bothering with something called the Hot Tuna Club.\n\nForsyth County was a calm, quiet, ordered place. But it had a history. In September 1912, an 18-year-old white girl was found bloodied and barely breathing in the woods lining the Chattahoochee River; she died two weeks later. Within 24 hours of her discovery, four Black men had been arrested and charged with assault. A white mob dragged one of the suspects from his cell and hanged him from a telephone pole. Two others were tried and executed. White residents then decided to undertake nothing short of a racial cleansing. On horseback, armed with rifles and dynamite, they drove out virtually all of the county's Black population -more than 1,000 people. So successful were their efforts that the county would experience the modern civil-rights era vicariously at best. There were no whites only signs to fuss over in Cumming, because there were no Black people to keep separate.\n\nIn January 1987, a white resident organized a \" Walk for Brotherhood \" to commemorate what had happened 75 years earlier. The project was complicated by the immediate wave of death threats he received. Arriving from Atlanta, the civil-rights leader Hosea Williams called Forsyth the most racist county in the South. Oprah Winfrey came down to cover the event. But most people in Forsyth ignored the whole affair; broach it in conversation, and you were considered a pot-stirrer. George Pirkle, the county's resident historian, was reminded of this as recently as 2011, when he readied for publication The Heritage Book of Forsyth County . He told the mayor of Cumming about his plans to include the region's Black history in the volume, and got an incredulous response: \"Well, why in the world would you want to do that?\" As Martha McConnell, the local historical society's co-president then and now, told me, the subtext was clear: \"Don't be starting things.\"\n\nIn the end, the Heritage Book did not go starting things. Look through it today and you will see the neatly arranged census data that cuts off at 1910. To include 1920, of course, would have revealed that the Black population was suddenly gone. To go beyond 1920 would have revealed that the Black population never came back.\n\nAll of which is to say that Marge Taylor's worldview was shaped in a community artificially devoid of sociocultural conflict, a history scrubbed of tension. That's the basic attitude here toward the past, Pirkle told me: \"If you don't talk about it, it goes away.\"\n\nDecades later, as they considered her scorched-earth rise to power-the conspiracy theories and racist appeals and talk of violence against Democratic leaders-some of her teachers would find themselves wondering how they'd failed to notice the young Marge Taylor. How was it that they had no memory of her holding forth in civics class, or waging a boisterous campaign for student office? How could it possibly be that in fact they had no memory of her at all?\n\nShe did as she was supposed to do, graduating from South Forsyth High and then packing up and moving an hour and a half away, to Athens, for four years at the University of Georgia. She would flit all but anonymously through the campus of 20,000 undergraduates. For Marge Taylor, UGA was about becoming the first in her family to graduate from college-setting herself up to run Taylor Construction. Almost certainly it was also about meeting a nice man. Perry Clarke Greene was a nice man. Three years her senior, he was tall and earnest and came from Riverdale. He, too, was in the university's Terry College of Business. They exchanged vows the summer before her senior year, in 1995.\n\nAmong the things I do not know about Marjorie Taylor Greene-she would not speak with me for this story-is what her wedding was like. A newspaper account, if it exists, has yet to turn up. I do not know whether she stood before an altar laden with white gladioli, as her grandmother once had, or whether the reception was a small affair at her parents' home in Cumming or something bigger somewhere else. I also do not know whether, on that day, she was happy: whether the quiet and respectable life that now unfurled before the new Mrs. Perry Greene felt like enough.\n\nThe young couple moved into a three-bed, three-bath colonial with symmetrical shrubbery in the north-Atlanta suburb of Roswell. Perry Greene became an accountant at Ernst & Young, and Marjorie Greene became pregnant. In January 1998, she smiled alongside the other mothers with tired eyes and loose clothing as they learned to exercise and massage their newborns in the North Fulton Regional Hospital's \"Mother Lore\" class.\n\nIt wasn't long before Perry started working for his father-in-law as general manager of the family business. After facilitating the sale of Taylor Construction, in 1999, he moved on to Taylor Commercial, a former division of the company, which specialized in siding for apartment complexes and subsidized-housing projects. Soon after, Bob Taylor named his son-in-law president of the company.\n\nMarjorie, meanwhile, tended to their one, two, and finally three children. There were lake days with Mimi and Papa, three-week Christmas vacations in the sun, and annual drives to visit Perry's extended family in Oxford, Mississippi. A lot of time was spent traveling to fast-pitch softball tournaments-Taylor, the middle child, was barely a teenager when she started getting noticed. (\"Can't believe she is being recruited in 8th grade,\" Greene would write on her personal blog after a weekend at one university.)\n\nAs for Taylor Commercial, it was eventually bought by Marge and Perry. Financial-disclosure documents filed in 2020, when Greene first ran for office, reveal a company whose value ranged from $5 million to $25 million. There is a photograph that Greene cherishes: of her as a child smiling alongside her father at a construction site. Bob did not want his daughter to see her inheritance as a given; Greene has said that her father once fired her from a job she held at the company as a teenager. But now the girl in the photograph was chief financial officer of Taylor Commercial; her college sweetheart was its president; her family was by that point living in a tract mansion in Milton, which borders Alpharetta. Who could say, of course, how regularly she made use of the indoor pool, or marveled at the built-in aquarium on the terrace level-two features of this \"smart-home luxury estate,\" in the words of a recent listing. But she could at least enjoy the fact of them.\n\nAnother thing I do not know about Marjorie Taylor Greene: I do not know precisely how long it was before the shape of her life-the quiet, the respectability, the cadence of carpooling and root touch-ups-began to assume the dull cast of malaise. Perhaps it was during one of the many softball tournaments, another weekend spent crushed against the corner of an elevator at the Hilton Garden Inn by grass-stained girls and monogrammed bat bags. Perhaps her Age of Anxiety arrived instead on a quiet Tuesday in the office of her multimillion-dollar company, when it occurred to her that running this multimillion-dollar company just might not be her purpose after all.\n\nWhat I do know, after dozens of conversations with Greene's classmates and teachers, friends and associates, is that by the time she reached her late 30s, something in her had started to break.\n\nLater, on the campaign trail, Greene would anchor much of her story in the fact that she was a longtime business owner: a woman who'd always more than held her own in the male-dominated world of construction. In beautifully shot television ads, voters saw a woman whose days were a relentless sprint between building sites-hard hats, reflector vests, jeans-and light-filled conference rooms, where she wore dresses with tasteful necklines and examined important blueprints.\n\nThat is not a fully accurate picture. People at Taylor Commercial seem to have liked Greene personally, but she spent only a few years on the job and did not put her stamp on the company. Call her on a weekday afternoon, and there was a good chance she'd answer from the gym. She had \"nothing to do with\" Taylor Commercial, one person familiar with the company's operations told me. \"It was entirely Perry.\" A 2021 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted that the Taylor Commercial website during those years scarcely hinted at Greene's existence. The only flicker of acknowledgment came in the last line of Perry Greene's bio , a reference to the wife and three children with whom he shared a home.\n\nBy 2011, the Journal-Constitution reported, Greene was no longer listed as the chief financial officer, or any other kind of officer. A year earlier, the company had been hit with state and county tax liens. Greene would one day joke about her lack of business acumen. But it doesn't seem to have been terribly funny in the moment. Greene simply didn't love the work. She had grown up with this business; she had gone to school for this business. And yet the girl in the photograph, as it turned out, had little interest in running this business.\n\nSome people close to Greene would describe the ensuing dynamic-her own connection to the business weakening while her husband's grew stronger-as a source of tension for the couple. Marjorie Taylor Greene's path to Congress could perhaps be said to have begun here: when, in the aftermath of her tenure as CFO, she appeared determined to strike out in search of something to call her own.\n\nIn 2011, the same year she stepped away from her job, Greene decided to commit herself to Jesus Christ. Or recommit herself, perhaps. Last spring, Greene revealed, apparently for the first time publicly, that she was a \"cradle Catholic,\" born and raised in the Church . This disclosure was occasioned after Greene told Church Militant, a right-wing Catholic website, that efforts by bishops to aid undocumented immigrants reflected \"Satan controlling the church.\" In response, Bill Donohue of the conservative Catholic League demanded that Greene apologize. Greene felt moved thereafter to share the details of her own personal relationship with Catholicism, explaining that she had stopped attending Mass when she became a mother: when she'd \"realized,\" she said in a statement, \"that I could not trust the Church leadership to protect my children from pedophiles, and that they harbored monsters even in their own ranks.\"\n\nGreene eventually decided to join North Point Community Church, one of the largest nondenominational Christian congregations in the country. And so during a service one Sunday, as applause and encouragement echoed across the sanctuary, Greene waited her turn to be immersed, blond hair tucked behind her ears, Chiclet-white teeth fixed in a nervous smile.\n\nMany baptisms at North Point are accompanied by testimony, in which the congregant shares a brief word about her journey to Christ. Video of Greene's testimony is no longer on the church's website, but the journalist Michael Kruse described its key moments in an article for Politico . From the stage that morning, he wrote, Greene spoke about \"the martyrs book,\" meaning, I think, the Book of Martyrs , John Foxe's 16th-century history and polemic on the persecution of Protestants under Queen Mary. As she'd considered the \"conviction\" of such men and women, \"how they died for Christ,\" Greene said, \"I realized how small my faith was if I was scared to do a video and get baptized in front of thousands of people.\" Before those thousands of people, she accepted Jesus as her lord and savior.\n\nGreene's congressional biography leaves the impression of deep and meaningful engagement with North Point, but according to a person in the church leadership, her involvement tapered off after several years. This person noted, somewhat ruefully, that Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state who defied President Donald Trump, has long been involved in North Point, but \"no one ever asks me about him.\"\n\nIt was around this same time that Greene, as she later put it on a local radio show, \"finally got brave enough\" to step into a CrossFit gym. Greene's original gym of choice had been the Alpharetta branch of Life Time. The gym, with its LifeSpa and LifeCafe, bills itself as a \"luxury athletic resort,\" and it's easy to see how Greene might have tired of the ambience. She is not-has never been-the kind of biweekly gym-goer who walks for 45 minutes on the treadmill while watching Stranger Things on an iPad. In one of the few candid shots of Greene in her 11th-grade yearbook, she is flat on her back on a weight bench, lifting two heavy-looking dumbbells. \"Marge Taylor pumps some Iron,\" the caption reads.\n\nIn 2007, a workout partner at Life Time told Greene about CrossFit, a fitness regimen that combines Olympic weight lifting with calisthenics and interval training; it has long been popular among law enforcement and members of the military. The two women went on CrossFit.com and printed out the workout of the day, or \"WOD,\" in CrossFit parlance. This was, in the early years of CrossFit, how most newcomers engaged with the program, printing out the WOD and heading to their regular gym. By the end of that first WOD, Greene was sold. In 2011, she started going to the CrossFit gym in Alpharetta.\n\nWhat Greene found at the gym (or \"box,\" as it is known) was community. The coaches, the members, the stragglers who popped in \"just to see what this is all about\"-they loved her. This is something many observers in Washington and elsewhere do not appreciate about Greene: that she can be extremely likable, so long as you are not, in her estimation, among \"the swamp rat elites, spineless weak kneed Republicans, and the Radical Socialist Democrats who are the demise of this country that we all love and call home.\" She has a sugary voice and a personable, generous affect; she is, when she wants to be, the sort of person whom a stranger might meet briefly and recall fondly to their friends as \"just the nicest woman.\" \"The softer side of Marjorie Taylor Greene is what her friends, neighbors, and the people who elected her know,\" Jamie Parrish, a Georgia Republican and close friend of Greene's, told me. Her supporters back home can seem genuinely confused by her chilly or hostile portrayal and reception elsewhere.\n\nAt CrossFit, Greene's warmth made her a star. \"CrossFit's really intimidating,\" she explained in one radio interview. \"Most people's experience with CrossFit is ... they run across ESPN, and they see these monster people doing crazy amazing things, and they're usually like, 'Ohhh, I'm never gonna do that.' \" But Greene could put people at ease. When she started coaching classes herself, the reviews were stellar. \"I loved working out with Marjorie Greene,\" Carolyn Canouse, a former client, told me by email. \"She was patient with my lack of athleticism, and always encouraging and supportive to everyone in the gym. She would bring her dog to work with her sometimes (he was adorable!), as well as her children who were all down to earth and nice to be around.\"\n\nGreene trained on most days and competed in a workout challenge known as the CrossFit Open; at her peak, she was ranked 47th in the U.S. in her age group. Over time, she seemed to regard CrossFit less as a grounding for the rest of her life and more as an escape from it altogether.\n\nWhen Greene was running for Congress, a man named Jim Chambers, jarred by her self-presentation as a paragon of family values, wrote about her alleged extramarital affairs at the gym in a Facebook post. ( The New Yorker 's Charles Bethea later reported on text messages from Greene apparently confirming one of the affairs.) Her first alleged relationship was with a fellow trainer. Chambers, who owned one of the CrossFit boxes at which Greene coached, recalled viewing her initially as \"this married lady who was at least nominally Christian, maybe not especially, but led a very suburban life. And then, like, quickly thereafter, she confessed that her marriage was on the rocks and falling apart.\" According to Chambers, Greene made no secret of the affair with the trainer. She talked openly about her problems with Perry-\"different lives and interests ... typical stuff,\" as Chambers summarized it. \"She struck me as an extremely bored person,\" he added. Later, Greene apparently had an affair with another man at CrossFit, a manager whom Chambers had recently hired from Colorado; this relationship, Chambers said, was more serious, more involved, \"a real affair.\" (Greene's office did not respond to a list of questions about the alleged affairs and other matters.)\n\nBy March 2012, she and Perry had separated. Four months later, she filed for divorce. Two months after that, the couple reconciled.\n\nThe family appeared to resume its ordinary rhythms. By January, Perry was posting again on Tripadvisor. This was no small thing. Before the separation, he had been in the habit of reviewing, with great earnestness, establishments ranging from the local Melting Pot (\"As stated this is a fondue restaurant, so it is very unique\") to the Cool Cat Cafe on Maui (\"My family loves their burgers so much we have 'Burger Sunday' every Sunday as our family dinner\"), only to go conspicuously dark during the sadness and tumult of 2012. But come the new year he was back, sharing his thoughts about the Encore, in Las Vegas (\"Great ambience. Wife and I loved it!!!\"), and an Italian restaurant in Alpharetta whose wine list, he judged, was \"pretty good!\"\n\nMarjorie, meanwhile, worked with a personal coach in the hope of qualifying to compete in the international CrossFit Games. For the next two years, she would busy herself with his intense weekly prescriptions, all the while chronicling her experience on a WordPress blog . \"Test post,\" she began in April 2013. \"I'm testing posting on my blog from my iPhone ... See if this works.\"\n\nScattered among the posts about creatine supplements (\"I love that stuff\") and the iPhone footage of Greene's triple jumps, there are glimmers to suggest that her family had found its way back. \"I decided that I'm going to make a little home gym in my basement,\" Greene wrote in May 2013. \"This way, on days I'm not coaching I can train at home and be around my kids. My husband thinks it's a great idea. Hopefully, they can see Mom working hard, and I can set a good example for them.\" Six months later: \"Just hanging around the house this weekend with my family, and I'm really happy with that.\"\n\nMuch of the time, however, the blog posts suggest someone pinballing from aggressive cheerfulness (\"Totally doing the happy dance!!\") to the \"negative thoughts\" that could rush in with no warning: \"I wish there was a switch to turn off those thoughts.\"\n\n\"Confidence is also an area that I struggle in,\" Greene wrote in one of her blog posts. \"But I've decided to say 'why not me?' \"\n\nIn 2013, she set out to become a businesswoman again. Partnering with Travis Mayer, a 22-year-old coach and one of the top CrossFit athletes in the world, Greene opened a 6,000-square-foot box called CrossFit Passion, on Roswell Street, in Alpharetta. Two years later, they relocated to a space nearly twice the size. In 2016, however, Greene sold her stake. She no longer blogged about her WODs or anything else related to CrossFit.\n\nIt's unclear what prompted so abrupt a turnaround; Greene hasn't discussed the subject publicly. \"She would go through a really hard workout and then just stop in the middle of it and start crying,\" a person who was close to Greene during this time told me. \"And that started happening more regularly toward the end. It was just too much stress.\" (Mayer, who went on to rename the gym United Performance, which he still owns and operates today, did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nThe other thing that happened to Marjorie Taylor Greene in 2016 was Donald Trump. Greene's family had never been especially political. Every fourth November, minus a cycle or two, Bob and Delle Taylor made sure to stop by the library or the First Baptist Church and cast a vote. It is reasonable to assume that the Taylors leaned right. For years, the family's construction company was a major sponsor of the Atlanta libertarian Neal Boortz's eponymous talk show. Boortz, one of the most popular radio personalities in America during the late 1990s and early 2000s, told me that Bob (who died in 2021) had been a good friend for decades. Still, the family did not give money to candidates, Republican or Democrat; they did not hold fundraisers at the house on Lake Lanier. For the Taylors, the 2016 presidential election commenced with no more fanfare than any other. On Super Tuesday, Bob, Delle, and Marjorie did not vote in either party's primary. In fact, Marjorie had not voted since 2010.\n\nGreene's political origin story was not unlike that of millions of other Trump supporters. Despite having never hinted at an interest in politics, she found herself suddenly beguiled by a feeling, a conviction that despite the distance between Trump's gold-plated world and her own, she knew exactly who he was. \"He reminded me of most men I know,\" she has said . \"Men like my dad.\"\n\nIn some ways, he was like her dad. Bob Taylor may not have been overtly partisan, but he rivaled Trump in his tendency to self-mythologize. In 2006, Greene's father had published a novel with the small publisher Savas Beatie called Paradigm . As best I can tell, this is Taylor's effort to demonstrate the value of a system he invented called the \"Taylor Effect\"-which purports to predict the stock market based on the gravitational fluctuations of Earth-in the form of a high-stakes international caper. The story follows twin scientists who discover an ancient Egyptian box in the bowels of the Biltmore estate, the contents of which, they soon realize, could \"destroy many of the world's most powerful families\" if ever made public.\n\nHe considered his stock-market theory to be \"the Genuine Article\"; in the afterword, he likened himself to da Vinci, Galileo, Edison, Marconi, and the Wright brothers. \"History,\" he wrote, \"is filled with characters who endured ridicule, imprisonment, and even death because they discovered things we know today with absolute certainty to be true .\" Suzanne Thompson, a North Carolina author hired to help Taylor write Paradigm , recalls that Taylor had \"a bit of an exalted sense of himself.\" She was unaware that he was Marjorie Taylor Greene's father, and gasped with dismay when I told her. \"Oh my gosh, I had no idea. Oh my God.\"\n\nAlthough Greene's political awakening was sudden, she would later portray her support for Trump as the unveiling of a well-formed political identity that she'd had no choice but to keep hidden. \"I've always had strong feelings about politics, but when you're a business owner, you have to really, really be careful about what you say,\" she told a conservative YouTube vlogger in 2019. But when she sold her gym, \"something magically happened to me: I didn't have to worry about what members thought anymore.\"\n\nGreene may now have felt free to speak, but it was not clear what she wanted to say. It was clear only that she wanted to say something . It was as though she spent the first six months of Trump's administration gathering up the scattered feelings and dim instincts that informed her attraction to his brand of politics and examining them under a microscope, twisting the knob until the edges came into focus. By July 2017, Greene was ready to start posting about politics.\n\nSeyward Darby: There's nothing fun or funny about Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nShe headed to American Truth Seekers, a now-defunct fringe-right website run by a New York City public-school counselor who went by the name Pat Rhiot. The contents of Greene's earliest posts have been lost to the ether, but the headlines, archived by the Wayback Machine, summarize the brand Greene set out to establish from the very beginning: \"Caitlyn Jenner Considering What?\" was the first headline, followed over the next few days by \"Female Genital Mutilation: America's Dirty Little Secret\" and \"Exposed! Confidential Memo to Take Down Trump and Silence Conservatives!\"\n\nBy August, when the full text of many of her blog posts become available, she was establishing her fierce devotion to gun rights and Donald Trump, and her antipathy toward conventional Republican politicians:\n\nSeptember saw her going after Hillary Clinton:\n\nGreene's posts, by the standards of the 2017 far-right blogosphere, were more or less the usual fare, nothing terribly new or uniquely provocative. But Greene, in her brief time posting, had already picked up on something remarkable: People liked that she was ordinary. In the present landscape of conservative politics, ordinariness was a branding opportunity. Ordinariness ensured that even her most banal reflections would sparkle. Ordinariness allowed Greene to offer conservatives what the Alex Joneses couldn't: affirmation that your neighborhood \"full-time mom\" and \"female business owner\" and \"patriot\" was fed up too. In the fall of 2017, Greene created a new Facebook page exclusively for the dissemination of her political thoughts.\n\nThe Republican base was in the market for a Marjorie Taylor Greene-a suburban woman who not only didn't recoil from Trump but was full-throated MAGA. All over the internet, it seemed, were women who claimed to be conservative and yet could do nothing but choke on their pearls and complain about Trump's tweets. But now here was regular Marge, who would put America first. Sweet southern Marge, who loved \"family, fitness, travel, shooting, fun, and adventure,\" and who, as would soon be clear, wanted very much to save the children.\n\nPerhaps, decades from now , what will stand out most is how easily the dominoes fell.\n\nImagine it like this: #SaveTheChildren, right there at the top of the feed. You click on the hashtag-because who, given the choice, would not want to save the children?-and then, suddenly, you are looking with new eyes at the chevron Wayfair rug beneath your feet. It had been 40 percent off during the Presidents' Day sale, but now you're wondering: Had this one been used to transport a child, a trafficked innocent rolled up inside? And then not 10 clicks later you find yourself wondering about other things, too-other conspiracies, other dark forces. Because it is curious, now that you're here, now that you're wondering, that you can't recall any CCTV footage of the airplane as it hit the Pentagon on 9/11. You had gone online to check if Theresa had posted photos from the baby shower and now, 20 minutes later, you log off with an entirely new field of vision, the unseen currents of the world suddenly alive.\n\nPerhaps, for Marjorie Taylor Greene, the rug had been houndstooth and the baby shower had been Kerrie's. But you don't need the site-by-site search history to understand the narrative of Greene's descent into QAnon, because the basics are so often the same.\n\nQAnon followers subscribe to the sprawling conspiracy theory that the world is controlled by a network of satanic pedophiles funded by Saudi royalty, George Soros, and the Rothschild family. Though Republican officials have insisted that QAnon's influence among the party's base is overstated, former President Trump has come to embrace the movement plainly, closing out rallies with music nearly identical to the QAnon theme song , \"WWG1WGA\" (the initials stand for the group's rallying cry, \"Where we go one, we go all\"). Yet since its inception, in the fall of 2017, when \"Q,\" an anonymous figure professing to be a high-level government official, began posting tales from the so-called deep state, no politician has become more synonymous with QAnon than Greene. To an extent, Greene had already signaled her attraction to conspiracy theories, questioning on American Truth Seekers whether the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas was a false-flag operation to eliminate gun rights. But with Q, Greene was all in. She has gone so far as to endorse an unhinged QAnon theory called \"frazzledrip,\" which claims that Hillary Clinton murdered a child as part of a satanic blood ritual.\n\nRamon Aponte, a right-wing blogger known as \"The Puerto Rican Conservative,\" became friendly with Greene soon after she began posting about Pizzagate, the conspiracy theory that a Washington, D.C., restaurant was involved in a Democratic-run child-sex ring. \"Even though the mainstream news media 'debunked' it, nobody ever conducted an investigation on it,\" Aponte told me. \"And Marjorie Taylor Greene knew this ... She was a voice for the silent majority.\" (After a North Carolina man's armed raid of the restaurant, in December 2016, Washington police did, in fact, investigate, and pronounced the theory \"fictitious.\")\n\nWas Greene a true believer? Her early outpouring of breathless posts gives that strong impression-she comes across as a convert intoxicated by revelation. But in time, her affiliation with QAnon brought undeniable advantages. It was not until she latched on to Q and Q-adjacent theories that Greene's political profile achieved scale and velocity. The deeper she plunged, the larger her following grew. And the more confident she became.\n\nAs the months passed, she started experimenting with a new tone; she would still be regular Marge and sweet southern Marge, but she would also be Marge who told the \"aggressive truth\"-who wasn't afraid to be real . In Facebook videos posted from 2017 to 2019, Greene talked about the \"Islamic invasion into our government offices.\" She said: \"Let me explain something to you, 'Mohammed' ... What you people want is special treatment, you want to rise above us, and that's what we're against.\" She talked about how it was \"gangs\"-\"not white people\"-who were responsible for holding back Black and Hispanic men. She objected to the removal of Confederate statues, saying: \"But that doesn't make me a racist ... If I were Black people today, and I walked by one of those statues, I would be so proud, because I'd say, 'Look how far I've come in this country.' \" The most \"mistreated group\" in America, she went on to say, was \"white males.\"\n\nBy the end of 2018, Marjorie Taylor Greene was awash in validation. Especially from men. She found herself suddenly fielding marriage proposals in the comments beneath her selfies. \"Ok ok ok so you're totally gorgeous I got that the first time I saw u,\" one person wrote, \"but you seal the deal with what's in your head, I love the message of truth u bring and inform all who will listen I'M SOLD!!!\" Greene, as she often would upon reading such comments, clicked the \"Like\" button in response.\n\nGreene began to meet up with people from her Facebook circle. In March 2019, she traveled to Washington, D.C., as the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on restrictive gun legislation. At one point, in a now-infamous confrontation, Greene began following David Hogg, a survivor of the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida. The shooting had left 17 dead, and Hogg had come to Washington to make the case for gun-control measures. Wearing a black blazer and leggings, a pink Michael Kors tote slung over her shoulder, Greene accosted the 18-year-old and, with a friend capturing the encounter on video, badgered him about his support for the bill: \"You don't have anything to say for yourself? You can't defend your stance? How did you get over 30 appointments with senators? How'd you do that? How did you get major press coverage on this issue?\" Hogg walked on in silence as Greene continued: \"You know if school zones were protected with security guards with guns, there would be no mass shootings at schools. Do you know that? The best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.\"\n\nGreene would later trace her decision to run for office to the frustration she'd felt during that trip: No one had paid her any attention. That would have to change. As she posted on a website called The Whiskey Patriots just after the Hogg incident, and just before she launched her bid for Congress: \"Let the war begin ...\"\n\nShe ran and she won, of course, in Georgia's Fourteenth District, in a largely rural outpost in the northwest corner of the state. Voters did not seem to care that Greene, who had judged the solidly conservative area to be friendlier to her chances than her home district in suburban Atlanta, had never actually lived there.\n\nShortly after she was sworn into office, in January 2021, her harassment of Hogg, as well as old social-media posts in which she endorsed the claim that the Parkland shooting was a false-flag operation , surfaced into public view. In her maiden speech on the floor of the House of Representatives, she set out to blunt the criticism she was receiving. Much of the speech was a disavowal of her own past statements. She conceded, for example, that 9/11 had actually happened, and that not all QAnon posts were accurate. \"I was allowed to believe things that weren't true,\" she protested.\n\nAs for David Hogg, she recounted an episode at her own high school when, she said, the \"entire school\" had been taken hostage by a gunman-an episode that she continues to invoke as a touchstone to explain everything that is wrong about security in schools and how she has a right to browbeat a school-shooting survivor like Hogg. But if her account failed to engender much sympathy, it was because it only nominally resembled reality.\n\nOn a September morning in 1990, during Greene's junior year, a history teacher named Johnny Tallant was holding his class at South Forsyth High School when an armed sophomore entered the classroom next door, fired a rifle overhead, and marched the students there into Tallant's classroom; for the next few hours, the sophomore held some 40 of his classmates, and Tallant, at gunpoint. The hostages later said they were initially terrified; the student threatened to kill them if his demands for candy, soda, and a school bus were not met. Eventually their nerves quieted. Many of the students knew their captor at least somewhat, and they weren't altogether surprised when he put down his gun and began sharing with them \"everything that was going on in his head,\" as one hostage recalled. \"He said he wanted to get away from things and make a point,\" recalled another, adding that the student had repeatedly promised not to hurt them. \"He said his parents were mean, that he was tired of how they treated him, and that he had no friends and just wanted to get away.\" Gradually, as police delivered the snacks he'd asked for, the sophomore let most of the hostages go, including all the girls but one, who knew the student well and stayed behind to keep talking to him. Five hours in, when the remaining hostages moved to grab his gun, he did not resist; when the police burst in moments later, he did not fight back.\n\nTallant recalls that Greene reached out to him sometime before she launched her bid for Congress, in the spring of 2019. He had no idea who she was, or why she was calling him at home. He listened that day as the unfamiliar woman explained that she wanted to speak with him about the events of 1990-that she'd been a student at South Forsyth when everything happened. Still, Tallant struggled to place her. Greene had not been in his classroom. Everyone else at the school, including Greene, had been quickly evacuated and bused away. Tallant was taken aback by Greene's intensity, her apparently sudden need, decades later, to discover flaws in the school's handling of things: \"She was asking me some crazy questions about-she was saying we should have had guns ourselves, you know ... She sounded like kind of a nut.\"\n\nTallant would not give her what she wanted. \"I told her right off, we didn't need guns,\" he said. It wasn't a political statement; for Tallant, it was just reality-the only conclusion you could draw if you took care to examine the particulars of the crisis , of the teenage boy at the center of it. The sophomore was known by classmates and teachers to struggle with seizures and other symptoms of epilepsy. As one of the hostages later put it: \"I wasn't scared of him. I was scared of what the police would do when he stepped into the hall, and I was afraid of what the police were planning to do as he walked from the room to the bus.\"\n\nBut never mind. Greene hung up with Tallant and eventually proceeded with her preferred version of the story in her speech on the House floor: \"You see, school shootings are absolutely real,\" Greene said, her navy face mask emblazoned with the words FREE SPEECH in red letters. \"I understand how terrible it is because when I was 16 years old, in 11th grade, my school was a gun-free school zone, and one of my schoolmates brought guns to school and took our entire school hostage.\"\n\n\"I know the fear that David Hogg had that day,\" she pronounced. \"I know the fear that these kids have.\"\n\nDid it even matter that Greene had not been taken hostage, or that the episode had been handled wisely and without bloodshed, or that the teacher in the classroom had told her she was wrong about her memories and her conclusions? By now, it may have occurred to Greene that performance was enough. That politics might in fact be that easy-as long as you were angry, or at least good at acting like it, most people wouldn't bother to look beneath the hood.\n\nIn late September 2022 , Perry Greene filed for divorce from Marjorie Taylor Greene on the grounds that the marriage was \"irretrievably broken.\" His timing-so close to the midterm election-did not go unnoticed in Georgia political circles. Six weeks later, on November 8, Marjorie easily won reelection to her second term in the House of Representatives.\n\nGiven her popularity among a segment of the Republican base, she is certain to play a major role in the GOP leadership , whether that role comes with a specific title and assignment or not. She wields power much like Donald Trump, doing or saying the unthinkable because she knows that most of her colleagues wouldn't dare jeopardize their own future to stop her.\n\nBarton Gellman: The impeachment of Joe Biden\n\nWhat Marjorie Taylor Greene has accomplished is this: She has harnessed the paranoia inherent in conspiratorial thinking and reassured a significant swath of voters that it is okay-no, righteous- to indulge their suspicions about the left, the Republican establishment, the media. \"I'm not going to mince words with you all,\" she declared at a Michigan rally this fall. \"Democrats want Republicans dead, and they've already started the killings.\" Greene did not create this sensibility, but she channels it better than any of her colleagues.\n\nIn her speech at the Cobb County GOP breakfast, Greene bemoaned \"the major media organizations\" for creating a caricature of her \"that's not real\" without ever, she said, giving her the chance to speak for herself. Afterward, I introduced myself, noted what she had just said, and asked if she was willing to sit down for an interview. \"Oh,\" she said, \"you're the one that's going around trying to talk to [all my friends]. This is the first time you've actually tried to talk to me.\" I explained that I had tried but had been repeatedly turned away by her staff. \"Yeah, because I'm not interested,\" she snapped. \"You're a Democrat activist.\" Some of her supporters looked on, nodding with vigor.\n\nWhether Greene actually believes the things she says is by now almost beside the point. She has no choice but to be the person her followers think she is, because her power is contingent on theirs. The mechanics of actual leadership-diplomacy, compromise, patience-not only don't interest her but represent everything her followers disdain. To soften, or engage in better faith, is to admit defeat.\n\nI think often of Greene's blog post from July 26, 2014, and the question she posed to herself during her crisis of confidence. \"Why not me?\" she had written tentatively, trying it on for size. I think of it whenever I see Greene onstage, on YouTube, on the House floor, making performance art of rage and so clearly at ease with what she is. Were the question not in writing, I'm not sure I'd believe there was a time in her life when she'd been afraid to ask.\n\nListen to Elaina Plott Calabro and Mark Leibovich discuss this article-and the future of the GOP-on Radio Atlantic:\n\nSubscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | Google Podcasts | Pocket Casts\n\nThis article appears in the January/February 2023 print edition with the headline \"Why Is She Like This?\""

      "text": "The Scariest Thing About Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nShe's proof that the terrible tropes of Trumpism aren't going away.\n\nOn January 3, 2021, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene was sworn into office. One month later, she was removed from all her House committee assignments. Perhaps it wasn't a huge shock that the representative who began her political career in 2017 writing about the \" Clinton Kill List \" for the now-defunct blog American Truth Seekers and then ran on the lie that Democrats were part of a satanic cabal (QAnon) would have so much trouble fitting in at the storied institution.\n\nBut Greene has not had any trouble fitting into Trump's Republican Party. If anything, she's become one of the most prominent voices in the GOP's antidemocratic iteration. Her permanent suspension from her personal Twitter account this week confirms as much. While Republicans with a slightly better hold on reality like Representative Adam Kinzinger and Representative Liz Cheney are called \"RINOs\" and subjected to death threats, Greene is celebrated on Fox News. Greene even joined Tucker Carlson on the May 5 episode of his Fox Nation streaming show, Tucker Carlson Today , to make fun of Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy for sharing an apartment with Republican pollster Frank Luntz, saying , \"I was more curious, like, who gets the top bunk and who gets the bottom bunk.\" The mere fact that Greene is a celebrity in the GOP is a pretty grim indictment of where the Republican Party is right now.\n\nWhen she was stripped of her committee assignments , Greene-wearing a mask emblazoned with the phrase FREE SPEECH-gave a speech on the House floor, the gist of which was that she'd left behind QAnon and the conspiracy theories she ran on. But as The New York Times later reported , \"Her contention that she broke away ... does not square with a series of posts she made in 2019 and other social media activity from that time, including liking a Facebook comment that endorsed shooting Ms. Pelosi in the head and suggesting in the same year that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had been replaced with a body double.\"\n\nBut lack of committee assignments has not slowed Greene from her real work-largely publicity stunts and further radicalizing the Republican base. Before Twitter banned her personal account, Greene used dehumanizing language to describe Democrats, according to political scientist Brian Klaas : \"Greene just referred to her political opponents as an infestation of 'termites.' In Rwanda's genocide, Hutu killers referred to Tutsis as 'cockroaches.' Such rhetoric is the language of dehumanization and it's extremely dangerous-and can incite political violence.\"\n\nWhen not using dehumanizing language, Greene is floating the idea of what she calls a \"national divorce scenario.\" Secession has historically been a kind of third rail in American political discourse, but Trumpism opened the door to the basest Republican instincts. If more mainstream Republicans don't repudiate Greene's dehumanizing and secessionist language, it will, if the last five years are any indication, get worse. Remember when Trump refused to concede the election, and one Republican official reasoned , \"What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time ... It's not like he's plotting how to prevent Joe Biden from taking power on Jan. 20\"? That was more than a year ago, and now, according to an NPR/Ipsos poll , \"Two-thirds of GOP respondents agree with the verifiably false claim that 'voter fraud helped Joe Biden win the 2020 election.'\" The road to the death of democracy is paved with Republican cowardice.\n\nGreene has also used anti-Semitism and racism to excite and further radicalize the base. In a November 2018 Facebook post, Greene blamed the California forest fires on a Camp Fire \"laser beam conspiracy theory ,\" which postulated that the blaze was started by a laser related to the Rothschild family. In February 2021, McCarthy needed to release the following statement : \"Past comments from and endorsed by Marjorie Taylor Greene on school shootings, political violence, and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories do not represent the values or beliefs of the House Republican Conference.\" In May 2021, after Greene compared the House mask mandate to the Holocaust, McCarthy released another statement , which said her \"intentional decision to compare the horrors of the Holocaust with wearing masks is appalling.\"\n\nGreene has a long history of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and racism. According to Politico , she has \"suggested that Muslims do not belong in government; thinks black people 'are held slaves to the Democratic Party'; called George Soros, a Jewish Democratic megadonor, a Nazi; and said she would feel 'proud' to see a Confederate monument if she were black because it symbolizes progress made since the Civil War.\" Greene also engaged in a disgusting transphobic stunt .\n\nTwitter permanently suspended Greene for \"repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy.\" Soon after, Greene got a 24-hour suspension from Facebook (which has a much laxer misinformation policy , as the Facebook Papers made clear). Greene was quick to try and exploit the bans, posting on Jason Miller's far-right social platform Gettr that \"Facebook has joined Twitter in censoring me.\" The press release from her office included the line , \"Twitter is an enemy to America and can't handle the truth.\" But what Greene's Twitter ban really shows is that tech companies have a higher standard than the United States Congress.\n\nAs a freshman representative, it's not yet clear if Greene is actually a zealot or a craven opportunist who sees an in with the conspiracy-loving base of the GOP. Like with Trump, what's in MTG's heart doesn't much matter. What does matter is that her own party won't censure her-it was Democrats, voting along partisan lines , who stripped her of committee assignments. If you need proof that Greene is simply a manifestation of where the Republican base is right now, just look at her fundraising numbers: According to Politico , in the first quarter of 2021 she raised $3.2 million from over 100,000 individual donors (that's an average donation of $32). Minority Leader McCarthy may say that Greene doesn't represent the GOP, but she very much does. Perhaps the scariest thing about MTG is that she is proof that many of the terrible tropes of Trumpism aren't going away."

Greene was elected in November 2020 and is a far-right conspiracy theorist who has promoted QAnon, supported the execution of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and claimed the school shootings in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, and Parkland, Florida, were staged - as was the September 11 attack on the Pentagon. She also has a history of racist, anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic comments. Bee Nguyen, a Democratic state representative in Georgia, recently joined other lawmakers in signing a resolution that calls on Greene to resign. \"The congresswoman has proven to be dangerous, not just to our state, but to our country,\" says Nguyen. We also speak with Michael Edison Hayden, senior reporter for the Southern Poverty Law Center, who says media discussions of QAnon and other far-right conspiracy theories tend to focus on how outlandish they are rather than on their hateful content. \"While some of these ideas are crazy-sounding to people, I think it's very, very helpful to start reframing it in your mind as something that is part of this drift toward anti-democratic, hard-right, authoritarian tendencies in the Republican Party,\" says Hayden.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In Washington, D.C., Republicans are facing increasing pressure to strip newly elected Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene from her new post on the Education Committee. Greene is the far-right conspiracy theorist who supported the execution of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and has claimed the school shootings at Sandy Hook, Connecticut, and Parkland, Florida, were staged, as was the September 11th attack on the Pentagon. She also has a history of making racist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic comments. At least 50 House Democrats have backed a resolution to remove her from office. Congressmember Greene was elected in November after Donald Trump called her a, quote, \"future Republican star.\"\n\nRecently resurfaced video shows Greene confronted one of the Parkland survivors, the teenager David Hogg, when he visited Capitol Hill in 2019 to lobby lawmakers to enact gun control.\n\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE : Look, I'm an American citizen. I'm a gun owner. I have a concealed carry permit. I carry a gun for protection for myself. And you are using your lobby and the money behind it and the kids to try to take away my Second Amendment rights.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Greene has claimed the massacre at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School that David Hogg survived was a false flag operation. In 2019, she liked a comment on social media that said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should be taken out and that a, quote, \"bullet to the head would be quicker,\" unquote. Greene has also publicly called for Pelosi's execution.\n\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE : She's a traitor to our country. She's guilty of treason. ... It's a crime punishable by death, is what treason is. Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason, and we want her out of our government.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : CNN reports Marjorie Taylor Greene recently removed that video from her Facebook page. In another resurfaced video, Greene talks about the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE : Is it going to be true that the child pedophilia and the elites in the Washington, D.C. - is that what we're really going to see come out? Is it true - is the type of corruption we're going to see come out - is it going to be satanic worship that possibly all these people are involved in? ... Maybe that all these scary things that people talk about on what's considered conspiracy sites and conspiracy theories really may be true. But that's what Q has been telling everyone.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In 2018, Marjorie Taylor Greene also claimed a laser beam from outer space started the deadly Camp Fire in California. Greene cited \"Rothschild Inc\" - a common anti-Semitic trope - as being responsible. In fact, Pacific Gas & Electric has pleaded guilty in the deaths of 84 people killed in the wildfire.\n\nLast week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rebuked House Republicans for putting the far-right conspiracy theorist on the Education Committee.\n\nSPEAKER NANCY PELOSI : Assigning her to the Education Committee, when she has mocked the killing of little children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, when she has mocked the killing of teenagers in high school at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, what could they be thinking? Or is \"thinking\" too generous a word for what they might be doing? It's absolutely appalling.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Friday, newly elected Democratic Congressmember Cori Bush of Missouri said she's moving her office away from Marjorie Taylor Greene's office. Bush said the move was needed, quote, \"for my team's safety.\"\n\nTo talk more about Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, we're joined by two guests. Michael Edison Hayden, senior investigative reporter and spokesperson for the Southern Poverty Law Center, is joining us. And Bee Nguyen is with us, Democratic state representative in Georgia. Her district includes Atlanta. She's joined other lawmakers signing a resolution calling on Greene to resign.\n\nState Legislator Nguyen, why don't we begin with you? Explain exactly what you're calling for. Marjorie Taylor Greene was popularly elected in your state of Georgia.\n\nREP . BEE NGUYEN : Yes. My Democratic colleagues and I have signed an urging resolution to ask members of Congress to ask Marjorie Greene to resign. The congresswoman has proven to be dangerous, not just to our state, but to our country. And she continues, as you mentioned before, to continue to spread conspiracy theories. She continues to state her allegiance to the former president. And she has continued to incite violence on Democratic members and her colleagues.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, state Representative, you're from Georgia, as she is. Could you tell us a little bit about the district that she represents and her constituents, and what led them to elect her?\n\nREP . BEE NGUYEN : She represents northwest Georgia. And she was able to win in November of 2020 without any opposition from a Democrat. It is a heavily Republican district, but the Democratic nominee dropped out before the general election because of personal reasons, so voters did not have a choice in terms of voting for somebody besides her, though she was popularly elected in that specific district. Her allegiance to the president has been something that she has used to continue her popularity in northwest Georgia, but the majority of Georgians did not vote for the former president. They voted for President Biden, they voted for Jon Ossoff, and they voted for Raphael Warnock.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And can you talk about gerrymandering and how that affected her district?\n\nREP . BEE NGUYEN : Yes. In the state of Georgia, we suffer from gerrymandering. It is a heavily Republican district. And so, there is no opportunity in the future to potentially unseat her in 2022. The numbers there are challenging. So, even if Democrats coalesced around a candidate, we know it's going to be an uphill battle.\n\nOn the other hand, with gerrymandering, what it causes is it causes extremism in the Republican Party. So, anybody running against her may feel that they have to run to the right of her. And that is what many Republicans struggle with in the state of Georgia: How far right do they go during a primary election? And then, once they go that far right, how do you begin to walk yourself back from that? And from somebody like her, it is hard to see that somebody would go to the right of her.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Democratic state Legislator Bee Nguyen, we thank you so much for being with us.\n\nWe want to turn to freshman Democratic Congressmember Cori Bush, who tweeted, quote, \"A maskless Marjorie Taylor Greene & her staff berated me in a hallway. She targeted me & others on social media. I'm moving my office away from hers for my team's safety. I've called for the expulsion of members who incited the insurrection from Day 1. Bring H.Res 25 to a vote,\" she said.\n\nWe want to bring in Michael Edison Hayden into this conversation. You are senior investigative reporter and spokesperson for the Southern Poverty Law Center. Can you talk about what Marjorie Taylor Greene represents, starting on the issue of QAnon? Talk about her calling for the execution, a bullet to the head, of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And put it in the context of what we saw January 6th, the insurrection at the Capitol.\n\nMICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN : Thanks, Amy.\n\nSo, I think the easiest way for the audience to understand how we got here with somebody like Marjorie Taylor Greene is to understand that she started sort of as a social media performer, who filled the vacuum left behind by the sort of intellectual rot of conservative media. Greene started to get likes and shares and so forth for promoting these kind of unhinged conspiracy theories, which are inherently hateful.\n\nAnd I think one thing that people misunderstand when they talk about QAnon and stuff like that is that I think the media kind of gets on this topic of discussion about just like how crazy it is, that this is like, oh, you know, these nutjobs or whatever, something like that. And understand, this is really hateful stuff that we're talking about here. Marjorie Taylor Greene has embraced explicitly anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. She once claimed that the Christchurch terror attack was a false flag. You can't get more anti-Muslim than that. And she aligns herself with anti- LGBTQ groups.\n\nSo, you know, while some of these ideas are crazy-sounding to people, I think it's very, very helpful to start reframing it in your mind as something that is just part of this drift toward anti-democratic, hard-right, authoritarian tendencies in the Republican Party, that is something we need to take very, very seriously and something that's very concerning for me.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: You've mentioned the impact of an algorithm-driven ecosystem of online right-wing commentary as helping to build a following for Marjorie Taylor Greene. Could you explain?\n\nMICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN : Yeah, Juan. So, basically, these social media companies have - you know, almost like the tobacco industry - created these algorithms that are meant to make you addicted to their apps and their websites. And these things, like if you look at Twitter and stuff like that, it really serves as a radicalization engine for extremists. And you look around you, and you say, like, \"Oh my god. Like, I don't remember things being like this 10 years ago or 15 years ago.\" Some of it has to do with the lies being pumped in by the Republican Party for years about things that we don't even cover, like climate change and stuff like that. But a lot of it has to do with this just radicalization engine on people's phones.\n\nAnd again, Marjorie Taylor Greene is receiving likes and upvotes and so forth for giving voice to these grievances that people in the Republican Party have, or at least their base of support has. You look at where they get their news from. I mean, Jack Posobiec of One America News is - you know, his rise as a public figure is tied to the white supremacist movement. He has collaborated with neo-Nazis. These are the type of people they're getting their news from. And it has to do with these figures taking advantage of the infrastructure of social media to get people addicted and to continue to feed this radicalization engine on people's phones.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, Michael Edison Hayden, if you can talk about the Republican leadership facilitation of Marjorie Taylor Greene? She believes what she believes, but not all congressmembers are put on committees. She has been elevated, even as Liz Cheney, number three in the leadership, is being attacked roundly for supporting the impeachment of President Trump. But what does this mean? And what do you think the Republican leadership needs to do? Apparently, Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, is going to be meeting with Greene this week, after he just went down to Mar-a-Lago to spend time with Donald Trump.\n\nMICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN : Well, I mean, if you look at the Republican Party right now, they have this inability to disavow people. And if you recall, Southern Poverty Law Center published a very large investigation about Stephen Miller's private emails, showed him connected to groups like VDARE . And it used to be, in the past, that these types of investigations, Republicans didn't want anything to do with it, because it was too toxic. But as we got closer and closer to the 2020 election, we saw this total unwillingness to disavow.\n\nAnd Marjorie Taylor Greene, I think, is going to be the most extreme test of this thought. They're going to - the issue is that she is of the base - right? - now that the base is now in power. And she's really a very - like a post-Trump extremist congresswoman, in the sense that - if you remember Steve King from Iowa, who espoused these kind of white nationalist ideas and was associated with extremist groups, he kept trying to cage his beliefs in ideas that would sound acceptable to what he perceived to be mainstream conservatives. Greene is extremely outspoken about her - the things that she hates, about her anti-democratic, hard-right, authoritarian views. I'm talking about executing politicians and so forth.\n\nThis is a new world. And the fact that they're unwilling to disavow, it's almost like there are kind of like these soft barriers that exist between violent, far-right extremists and your sort of mainstream, tea party type, you know, or at least your image of that sort of person. And these soft barriers eroded over the course of the Trump era, and eroded and eroded. And they really snapped on January 6th. And then you had these people who look like grandmothers or whatever standing with people wearing these \"Camp Auschwitz\" sweatshirt or whatever. I mean, this is really dark stuff. And I'm not particularly optimistic, to be honest with you, that McCarthy or anybody else is going to take a strong public stance and disavow, because this is what the Republican Party has become, unfortunately.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : They stripped King of his appointments, and ultimately he would lose in Iowa, when he didn't have the clout that the people of Iowa in his district needed.\n\nMICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN : That's correct.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Do you see anything like that happening with Congressmember Greene?\n\nMICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN : I mean, it's theoretically possible. But the fact that Trump incited this insurrection - and, I mean, I think that's pretty clear; that's my perception of it - and they are still willing to kind of go to bed with Trump, I think, says something about their fear of the base, that the base is actually in control of the Republican Party in some ways.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Michael Edison Hayden, we're going to leave it there. We want to thank you so much for being with us, senior investigative reporter with the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nWhen we come back, well, Black History Month has begun. We look back at the assassination of Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in Chicago 51 years ago. New documents suggest J. Edgar Hoover, head of the FBI , was involved with Fred Hampton's murder. And we'll speak to the director of a film that's premiering at Sundance called Judas and the Black Messiah . Stay with us.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"Have You Been to Jail for Justice?\" by the renowned folksinger Anne Feeney. Anne has been hospitalized with pneumonia related to COVID -19.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) accused the executives of NPR and PBS of pushing \"some of the most radical left positions,\" and \"brainwashing and trans-ing children\" while using federal funds to pursue \"their progressive, or Communist, agenda\" during a Wednesday hearing on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"NPR and PBS have increasingly become radical leftwing echo chambers,\" she said, going on to suggest the federal funds granted to both outlets be cut back.\n\nGreene serves as the chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency, which was created this year to support billionaire Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Her hearing comes at a time when President Donald Trump , a longtime critic of press freedoms, has ramped up his attacks .\n\nNPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger listened with neutral expressions throughout.\n\nAt the hearing, Greene and her Republican colleagues argued that the radio network and public broadcaster were no longer relevant due to the popularity of podcasts and YouTube. Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) pushed back, saying that platforms like YouTube were filled with ads that can be inappropriate for children, whereas PBS is not.\n\nGarcia also used his 5-minute time allotment to have some fun.\n\n\"The American people want to know: Is Elmo now, or has he ever been, a member of the Communist Party of the United States?\" he asked Kerger of the \"Sesame Street\" character. She said no.\n\n\"Are you sure, Ms. Kerger? Because he is red,\" Garcia replied.\n\nElon Musk and Marjorie Taylor Greene are trying to defund Sesame Street and dismantle PBS and NPR. Not on our watch.

Now, that might be triggering to our chairwoman and some on this committee, [and] perhaps that's also why we're here today,\" Garcia said.\n\nGarcia and other Democrats argued that Musk's activities should be scrutinized, not those of public broadcasters.\n\nMuch of the funding for NPR and PBS comes from individual donors and corporate sponsors, but both receive additional funds from the federal government. The outlets were formed under the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a publicly funded nonprofit that receives an approximately $500 million appropriation from Congress each year.\n\nMaher said specifically that NPR received around $11 million from the federal government last year, which was primarily spent to maintain the broadcast systems used by public radio stations nationwide.\n\nShe fielded the most accusations of bias from Republicans on the panel. She said that she regretted posting fiery political tweets about conservatives in America before taking her job at NPR last year, and agreed when Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) suggested NPR's editors should include more Republicans.\n\nKerger highlighted the broad public support for PBS, known primarily for its children's programming.\n\n\"For over two decades, the American public has consistently ranked public television as one of the best investments the government makes,\" she said in her opening statement.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Has Nonsensical Defense For Trump Firing Government Watchdogs\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost National Desk\n\nThe first meeting of the congressional \"DOGE\" subcommittee took place Wednesday morning, and it quickly offered a bizarre look at how Republicans are justifying President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's aggressive dismantling of the federal government.\n\nThe committee was created as a legislative counterpart to the \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" a temporary organization created by Trump and run by Elon Musk. It has flooded several federal agencies with Musk aides who have sought extensive access to sensitive technology , and has pursued deep budget and personnel cuts , despite not having congressional authorization.\n\nAs Democrats hammered the administration for illegally shuttering entire agencies, attacking civil servants and handing over enormous power to an unaccountable billionaire, Republicans largely avoided talking about the rampage. But Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), the subcommittee's chair, did occasionally offer some insight into Republican thinking about Trump and Musk's hatchet job.\n\nAfter House Oversight Committee ranking member Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) called out Trump's ( allegedly illegal ) mass firing of 17 inspectors general ― the internal investigators literally tasked with sniffing out bad behavior ― Greene bizarrely blamed the same civil servants for the entirety of the federal debt.\n\n\"If we want to be serious, we've got to have objective, neutral inspectors general who are monitoring government waste, fraud and abuse and expenditures, and I think you would find Democrats more than willing partners in that kind of enterprise if we're going to be serious,\" Connolly said. \"But a wrecking crew ― a wrecking crane, a wrecking ball ― is not going to do it.\"\n\nGreene responded by scapegoating the inspectors general.\n\n\"The president of the United States has the prerogative to fire anyone that has overseen $36 trillion in debt, enslaving the American people, and rightfully so,\" she said.\n\nInspectors general have nothing to do with the creation of federal debt, which is actually the result of bills that have been approved by Congress and then signed into law by several presidents.\n\nAs noted in a lawsuit from several recently-fired inspectors general, by law, presidents must notify Congress 30 days before removing an inspector general, and they must provide \"a substantive, case-specific rationale\" for the removal. Trump has done neither. IGs also more than earn their keep: For every dollar spent on an inspector general's office budget, $26 are returned to taxpayers, the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency reported in an analysis of fiscal year 2023.\n\nLater in the hearing, Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) asked committee witness Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, the director of government affairs at the Project on Government Oversight, what the impact was of Trump mass-firing the inspectors general.\n\n\"To put it simply, it completely undermines our ability to root out waste, fraud and abuse,\" Hedtler-Gaudette responded. He noted that the inspector general role was created after Watergate, when \"there were not cops on the beat that were internal, that were independent, that were situated in agencies to be able to find these things and expose them and do something about them.\"\n\n\"That's what inspectors general exist to do,\" Hedtler-Gaudette added. \"So it's completely anathema to any stated mission to find cost savings and to root out waste, fraud and abuse, to fire inspectors general and to undermine them. It makes no sense. Those two things do not add up.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Greg Casar (D-Texas) pointed out one inherent conflict of interest in the inspector general firings: \"At least five inspector generals that were looking into Elon Musk's companies were fired by the Trump-Musk administration,\" he said.\n\nResponding to Casar, Greene repeated her bizarre justification for the firings.\n\n\"The American people are $36 trillion in debt. It certainly seems reasonable that someone has been fired,\" she said.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Brian Glenn Is Not A Fan Of Girlfriend Marjorie Taylor Greene's Latest Move\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nRight-wing journalist Brian Glenn on Thursday explained why he was opposed to the House censure of Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) for interrupting Donald Trump during the president's speech to a joint session of Congress.\n\nGlenn's opposition to the move, though, was in stark contrast to the opinion of his girlfriend, far-right Rep.

All Republicans in the House did so .\n\n\"My take on this is probably not going to be popular,\" Glenn admitted on Real America's Voice ahead of the vote.\n\n\"I don't think that we should be censuring him for that.

      "text": "Republicans Put Marjorie Taylor Greene In Charge Of New 'DOGE' Subcommittee\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON ― House Oversight Committee chair James Comer (R-Ky.) announced Thursday that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) will chair a new subcommittee named after an internet meme from the early 2010s.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump tapped entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to head an advisory panel called the \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" or DOGE, that's tasked with identifying trillions in government waste.\n\nNot wanting to be left out, Republicans on Capitol Hill this week created a caucus (an informal group of lawmakers with shared interests) called Delivering Outstanding Government Efficiency, and now an official subcommittee, named Delivering on Government Efficiency.\n\n\"A lot of what DOGE is trying to do would fall under the legislative jurisdiction and the Oversight Committee,\" Comer said Thursday in an interview with right-wing influencer Benny Johnson .\n\nThe acronym DOGE (pronounced \"dodje\") refers to a once-popular image macro featuring a Shiba Inu dog with excerpts of its inner monologue represented by superimposed text. Here's a DOGE meme for the new subcommittee, courtesy of HuffPost:\n\n\"I'm excited to chair this new subcommittee designed to work hand in hand with President Trump, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and the entire DOGE team,\" Greene told Fox News Digital, which first reported the new committee .\n\nMusk has said he could easily cut at least $2 trillion out of the $6.5 trillion federal budget, which is an extremely unrealistic goal, especially if DOGE doesn't touch Social Security, Medicare or programs for veterans.\n\nDespite having the word \"department\" in its name, Musk's DOGE initiative is not an official federal agency, and is more like the kind of ineffectual blue-ribbon commission that policymakers have often established when they can't figure out how to solve a complex policy problem.\n\nIt's supposed to be up to Congress to decide how the government spends money, but Musk and Ramaswamy claimed this week they would pioneer new constitutional authorities for Trump to make their cuts without giving Congress a say.\n\n(Editor's note: Ramaswamy holds shares in BuzzFeed, HuffPost's parent company.)\n\nThe lawmakers getting in on the DOGE action seem to want to make common cause with Musk and Ramaswamy while reminding the duo who's actually in charge of spending.\n\n\"It takes an act of Congress to do some of the things that they want [done]. If we're going to cut anybody, or if we're going to make changes, then Congress has to act,\" Rep. Aaron Bean (R-Fla.), co-founder of the new DOGE caucus , told HuffPost.\n\n\"We're the good government committee that tries to root out waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement in the federal government,\" Comer said. \"So everything that Musk and and Ramaswamy are talking about pretty much falls under the House Oversight Committee.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

The Left should learn to replicate its tactics for egalitarian ends.\n\nAlongside Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy reacts during a vote to adjourn following a day of votes for the new Speaker of the House at the US Capitol on January 4, 2023 in Washington, DC.

If there are such things as angels, I hope that they are organized along the lines of the Mafia.\"\n\nSomething similar can be said about the American left. Democratic socialists fight for universal health care, an end to the climate catastrophe and mass incarceration, and economic democracy. But if we're going to triumph over the forces of reaction and win these changes and more, we're going to need to learn to fight harder and smarter. Today that means taking a page from the American political equivalent of the Mafia: the right wing of the Republican Party.\n\nIn the last week, the Republican right fought Kevin McCarthy's bid to become Speaker of the House and showed everyone how to play political hardball to build power. The Left, with growing socialist caucuses at the state level and a growing bench of progressive representatives in DC, needs to learn some lessons.\n\nKevin McCarthy has been at the head of the Republican's House caucus since 2019. In any other ordinary year, the position of Speaker of the House would have been his almost automatically following the Republicans' narrow victory in last year's midterm election . But a small group on the party's right wing turned a coronation into a multi-round fight.\n\nTwenty congressmembers were at the core of the right-wing rebellion; all but one are connected to the House Freedom Caucus, the ideological home of the party's rightmost flank. These Republicans are notorious for their support of Donald Trump and the January 6 riots. They deserve every decent person's scorn. But when it comes to tactics, one has to admit that they know how to play.\n\nDesperate for their support, McCarthy had to give on issue after issue. McCarthy folded early on policy questions. He fought against the 2022 lame-duck spending bill, a core right-wing priority. He called for the resignation or impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, a target of the Right's ire. McCarthy also agreed to create a new subcommittee in the House Judiciary Committee to investigate the \"weaponization\" of the federal government by the Biden administration and the FBI and CIA.\n\nMore significant in the long term, he also agreed to rules changes and committee assignments that will dramatically strengthen the Right's hand.\n\nMcCarthy agreed to add three members from the Freedom Caucus to the House Rules Committee. That will allow the far right to help shape the issues to be considered by the House. McCarthy's own PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, agreed not to intervene in open primaries against far-right candidates. McCarthy agreed to bring back the Holman Rule , which allows legislators to propose defunding specific federal programs, to fire specific federal officials, and to slash officials' pay.\n\nMost significantly, he agreed to bring back the \"motion to vacate the chair,\" which will allow just one Republican to call for a snap vote to remove the speaker. This is a rule that the right wing previously used to remove John Boehner. Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a leading conspiracy theorist from the Republican fringe, extracted a much sought-after seat on the House Oversight Committee from McCarthy in return for her support.\n\nThere will now be an investigation of the House Select Committee on the January 6 riots, another right-wing priority. And McCarthy agreed to hobble the work of the Office of Congressional Ethics and to make it harder for the office to hire investigators, a move the Right hopes will gum up further investigations into what happened on January 6.\n\nMost of these concessions granted to the Right are detestable. A few - like new investigations into the operations of the FBI and CIA, or restraining the ability of the party leadership to campaign in primaries - might be appealing to the Left. But either way, the fact that the Right was able to stack up so many wins reflects its cunning use of hardball tactics to advance its agenda.\n\nEvery one of the concessions granted to the Right bolsters the morale of its base and will strengthen its hand in Congress in the months to come. The Freedom Caucus racked up significant policy wins, and its leading cadres will now have coveted committee assignments to use as bully pulpits from which to propagandize.\n\nThe Right is also well-positioned to extract further concessions from McCarthy in the next two years. The fact that only one Republican can now call a snap vote to remove the speaker, which at a minimum will embarrass McCarthy and weaken his position inside the party, and - as happened to John Boehner - could succeed in removing him, will mean that McCarthy will constantly have to attend to the demands of the party's right wing.\n\nA new committee to investigate the Biden administration and the intelligence agencies fulfills another right-wing objective: severely constricting the room for maneuver of Biden and his team, as well as federal authorities investigating the far right. The Holman Rule, which will allow right-wingers to target federal officials, will empower the former to put pressure on the federal bureaucracy to more closely follow the priorities of the Republicans' House caucus.\n\nDemocratic leaders were quick to note how effective the Right's tactics have been. Massachusetts representative Richard Neal, the party's leader on the Ways and Means Committee, put it bluntly : \"The concessions [McCarthy has] made means that it will be a minority of a minority of the minority, because of the Freedom Caucus, that will get to dictate the outcomes of legislative achievement.\"\n\nAs the minority in Democratic caucuses in DC and in state legislatures like New York, the Left needs to think creatively about how to best strengthen our position. The Right showed the way here. Not in the demands it made - most of those are specific to its own agenda of taking an ax to the federal government - but in how it made them.\n\nTo achieve very different ends, we should be prepared to go to war against Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and others who otherwise have no sympathy for or interest in advancing our agenda. And we need to win powerful bully pulpits from which to propagandize for democratic socialist politics. To date, centrist Democrats have worked hard to keep the Left off of important committees. For example, Democratic leaders denied key committee assignments to progressive left congressmembers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib in 2019 and again going into 2021 . By playing hardball, we could change that.\n\nThe Right's attack on the Republican leadership this week may just be the opening round in an ongoing war. According to leading right-wing activist and intellectual Ed Corrigan, the Right has plans to transform the House into a \"European-style coalition government\" with three factions: \"the Democrats, the Republicans, and the Freedom Caucus.\" The speaker fight, and the concessions won from McCarthy to strengthen the Freedom Caucus in this new session of Congress, are part of a longer-term strategy to realize this vision.\n\nThe Left cannot sit back and let the far right limit the political battlefield to these three camps. We are not on the same side as the leaders of our nominal party, and we have every reason to fight them just as hard as the Right does against their leadership. We ought to sit very uncomfortably inside the Democratic fold. It is, at best, a temporary and fraught marriage of necessity, one that we should want to exit as soon as possible.\n\nAs Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has said in the past , in any other country she would not be in the same party as Joe Biden. That has never been more clear than in the aftermath of Joe Biden's decision to crush railroad workers' right to strike to win paid leave. And Democratic leaders know that we are in - at the very least - a cold war with them. Hakeem Jeffries once said that \"there will never be a moment where I bend the knee to hard-left democratic socialism.\" We should be just as clear eyed.\n\nIf we on the Left really want to build a popular alternative to the Republican and Democratic parties and the Freedom Caucus, we need to create as much daylight between us and them as possible. Using high-profile leadership fights to draw out the lines of division between us and Democratic leaders is one very appealing tactic for doing so.\n\nImagine in 2024 that Democrats retake the House of Representatives. For weeks leading up to the election to make Hakeem Jeffries the next Speaker of the House, the Left goes on the offensive, appearing on major talk shows, blanketing social media, and organizing rallies in critical districts to oppose Jeffries's ascent to leadership. Not only have right-wing Republicans shown that such a fight could strengthen a minority's hand in Congress, but such a fight would have the added value of drawing out the contrasts between the Democratic leadership's conservative agenda and the Left's much more popular program.\n\nDemocratic socialists use electoral politics and our position in legislatures to build our popular base, especially in a period like the one we're in now, where major reforms are not on the agenda. Offices in Congress and state legislatures can be bully pulpits from which to spread democratic socialist ideas and rally millions to a program of transformational change. As Bernie Sanders once said, the role of a socialist in the White House would be to serve as an \"organizer-in-chief.\" A similar job description applies to socialist legislators.\n\nFulfilling that role requires that we use every tactic available to us to get our message out there and explain to millions of people the nature of the political battles being waged. In the last few weeks, the American right showed us just how much room there is in Congress to propagandize for one's politics and build power. Take notes. Our time will come, and we should be as prepared to fight as they were.\n\nNeal Meyer is a member of New York City Democratic Socialists of America.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Yet they are simultaneously rolling back child labor laws to allow children to work in industrial laundries, construction sites, and meatpacking plants.\n\nRepublicans in multiple states have introduced strikingly similar pieces of legislation that will actively harm children by relaxing child labor regulations, putting them at greater risk of injury and exploitation. (Bettmann / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLook, it's no surprise that as Republicans are growing louder about made-up \"culture war\" issues they're also simultaneously renewing their push to give more money to the rich at the expense of everyone else. The marriage of conservative Christian social activists and Republican moneymen goes back, in its current form, at least to the 1970s , and arguably to the 1950s . Of course, the same dynamic, expressing itself in different ways, goes back much further . It's one of the most stable features of American politics.\n\nBut sometimes the flagrant sanctimony gets to be too much, even by the low standards set by the modern GOP. This is one of those times.\n\nAcross the country, Republicans have made keeping kids \"safe from transgenderism\" one of their top priorities. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has said the GOP needs to \" protect children \" from trans people and their supposed nefarious agenda. Greene, who is one of the Republican Party's ideological leaders and a key bridge between Donald Trump and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, is far from alone. So far eight anti-trans bills have already become state law in 2023, with more to come . Republicans consistently justify such bills with innuendo about protecting children from trans predators or \"groomers.\"\n\nThey have used the same rhetoric in attempts to restrict drag shows , because nothing is more dangerous for children than watching performers dressed up in costumes pretending to be someone else. The drag hysteria has led not only to legislative attempts to restrict free expression, but to dangerous protests at children's events. Meanwhile, Republicans have also made significant efforts over the past few years to eliminate discussions of homosexuality and racism from school and even university curricula. Of course Donald Trump is using the bully pulpit as the party's leading presidential candidate to try to further stoke reactionary sentiment, attacking teachers and public schools in the process.\n\nBut Republicans' professed desire to protect children disappears when faced with anything that might actually endanger them. Children are regularly murdered at school in mass shootings, a fact that has become too banal to even mention, so thoroughly have we given up hope that anyone in power will do anything to stop it. As long as the Republican Party is totally committed to allowing this state of affairs to continue, their claims about the need to protect children will remain a hollow joke.\n\nNow Republicans in multiple states have introduced strikingly similar pieces of legislation that will actively harm children by relaxing child labor regulations, putting them at greater risk of injury and exploitation. In addition, studies have found that in addition to potential dangers at specific workplaces, child labor in and of itself puts children at greater health risk.\n\nSome of the details vary by state . In Ohio and New Jersey, state-level Democrats joined with Republicans to expand the number of hours teenagers can work and allow them to work later into the night. Elsewhere Republicans alone are pushing children to work more. Minnesota wants to let sixteen-year-olds work on construction sites. Arkansas just reduced the permits required to hire minors, a move experts say will make it easier for companies to plead ignorance if they're busted violating parts of the child labor regulations that remain. Iowa legislation would let kids as young as fourteen work in meatpacking freezers, while denying them the right to workers' compensation if they get hurt. Coincidentally, a major sanitation company in Wisconsin was just fined for hiring children as young as thirteen to clean food processing facilities. The kids used dangerous chemicals to clean sharp tools, and some of them sustained serious injuries .\n\nRepublicans seem ready to push ahead with further deregulation even after the New York Times published an exposé on the extensive exploitation of immigrant children in dangerous jobs across the country. At first it might seem like simple hypocrisy that conservatives claim to be so concerned about \"protecting\" children in some ways while displaying such undisguised carelessness in others. But in fact it is perfectly consistent with their ideology. For the economy to continue to function the way it does now, some children need to be taught early on that their role in life is to do difficult, dangerous work for very little pay. If they come from poor families, that will do, but if they're also isolated, vulnerable, and beyond many legal protections because they came from another country, even better.\n\nMeanwhile the other children, who will grow up to have more influence in society, need to be presented with alternative explanations for the horrible reality of the country's history, explanations that minimize the oppression and exploitation that built it and sustain it today. This explains how the blanket opposition to \"wokeness\" in schools can coexist with a push to bring back child labor.\n\nUltimately the problem runs deeper than conservative hypocrisy. It goes all the way down to the political and economic system they're defending.\n\nBen Beckett is an American writer in Vienna.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But its defeat could open the door to long-needed progressive dissent on the war.\n\nA Ukrainian soldier shows a casing of a cluster bomb rocket. (Scott Peterson / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLast October, dozens of House progressives were slapped down by the US foreign policy establishment for floating, in the words of one congressional staffer, \"the softest trial balloon about diplomacy\" to end the Ukraine war. The episode seemed to slam the door shut on even the mildest progressive dissent from White House policy on the war, with the nine months that followed defined largely by lockstep Democratic support for the administration's wishes, with only a relatively small cohort of Republicans defying the president in the form of voting against further military aid.\n\nBut President Joe Biden's decision earlier this month to approve the transfer of cluster munitions for use by Ukrainian forces may have opened that door a crack. Last night, in a failed 147-276 House vote to ban the provision of the notoriously child-maiming weapons , forty-nine Democrats and ninety-eight Republicans voted for an amendment to that end brought forward by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). Despite the roughly 2-1 margin against Greene's measure, the vote marks one of the most significant congressional challenges to the Biden administration's approach to the war since the Russian invasion last February, and is certainly the most substantial episode of progressive dissent from the White House on the matter.\n\nThe vote is doubly significant given the underhanded maneuvering that took place to kill its backing. The original National Defense Authorization Act amendment to block the White House's cluster munitions transfer - one that Biden is embarking on using a loophole to get around an unambiguous legal ban on sending the deadly civilian-killing shells - was put forward by two Democrats, Reps. Sara Jacobs (D-CA) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and was accompanied by a letter from them and seventeen other House Democrats renouncing the move.\n\nErik Sperling, the executive director of Just Foreign Policy who has been working on drumming up support for halting the cluster munitions transfer, estimated there would have been considerable bipartisan support for the amendment had it gone to the floor. \"They got very nervous,\" he says. \"It was looking extremely likely that we could pass this.\" As evidence , Sperling points to recent statements from the Senate, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) alluding to a companion effort in the upper chamber to ban the weapons, and Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) vowing to \"work very hard to oppose\" the Jacobs amendment if it passed the House.\n\nThe amendment drew bipartisan support, with the Donald Trump-aligned Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who has shown an appetite for working with progressives on antiwar legislation in the past, cosponsoring the amendment. This cross-ideological backing reflected an unusual amount of opposition to Biden's announcement, which has been criticized by human rights groups and was met with polite nonsupport from even close US allies like the UK and Germany.\n\nTo weaken support for upholding the ban on the weapons, whose use was last year declared a war crime by the White House press secretary, House Republicans embarked on a clever gambit . All nine GOP members of the House Rules Committee voted down the Jacobs-Omar amendment and instead advanced Greene's as the one that would get a floor vote.\n\nFrom the point of view of lawmakers eager to to litter eastern Ukraine with cluster bomblets, Greene's amendment had two advantages: it applied only to cluster munition transfers in Ukraine, turning the vote into a referendum on the war, which is most enthusiastically backed by Democratic voters; and it was attached to the politically toxic Greene, an unpopular, formerly QAnon-supporting Republican congresswoman who is hated by liberals and was just booted from the stridently right-wing Freedom Caucus.\n\nAs a result, a number of Democrats who had expressed discomfort and even outright opposition to Biden's move effectively voted to uphold it. That includes Jacobs, the original sponsor of the Democratic anti-cluster munitions amendment who simply chose not to vote on Thursday, as well as three other signers of the House progressive letter against the weapons: Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-FL), Hank Johnson (D-GA), and Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), who voted \"present.\" Other Democrats who had spoken out against the White House's move but failed to follow through last night include Reps. Jason Crow and Unexploded Ordnance and Demining Caucus cochair Chrissy Houlahan (\"victory cannot come at the expense of our American values and thus democracy itself\").\n\nYet despite the political risks and major pressure to vote against the Greene amendment - including a rhetorical upping of the ante from Secretary of State Tony Blinken, who claimed Ukraine would be left \"defenseless\" if the munitions were blocked - many progressives and others stuck to their guns. Several lawmakers contacted by Jacobin in advance of the vote indicated they would back Greene's amendment and followed through. That included Republican representative Dan Bishop (\"I think it's reprehensible\") and Democratic congressman Rick Larsen (\"More than 120 countries have banned cluster bombs. The United States must do the same\"), as well as democratic socialist Squad member Rep. Greg Casar (D-TX), who had earlier warned that \"we don't want to indiscriminately harm children and families and civilians,\" and progressive Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-IL).\n\n\"I support the approach of the Jacobs amendment, which focused on the use of these weapons, not the country where they are used,\" Garcia told Jacobin . \"Still, I oppose this sale and every other sale of barbaric cluster munitions, and I will take every opportunity to prevent civilian death, including this one.\"\n\nIn the end, every member of the Squad and others associated with the cohort of young socialists and progressives - including longtime members Reps. Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), as well as more recently elected figures like Summer Lee (D-PA), Maxwell Frost (D-FL), and Becca Balint (D-VT) - held the line despite the shenanigans. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), a longtime congressional critic of US foreign policy and an outspoken opponent of the cluster munitions transfer also voted for the amendment, as did Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), one of the signers and vocal defenders of the progressives' pro-diplomacy letter last year, who said that \"thousands of kids will die because of cluster bombs,\" and that he voted \"based on the issue, not the author.\"\n\nEven some surprising names voted in support, signaling the depth of discomfort with the White House's decision. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) had been one of the more vocal members to renounce the October letter he had signed, yet voted for Greene's amendment. Maybe the most surprising vote in favor was Adam Schiff (D-CA), who has built a political brand as one of the most strident anti-Russia hawks in Congress and is currently running against Lee and Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) - another \"aye\" vote last night - for a California Senate seat. Even House Ukraine caucus cofounder and cohair Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) chose to vote \"present\" rather than an outright \"no.\"\n\nSperling says that while the strategy to associate the push with Greene was \"novel and, frankly, impressive,\" it was also a risky maneuver that let both members of Congress and activists familiarize themselves with the Blob's tactics, something they had already been doing during eight years of fights over the Yemen War. \"Every time that the White House and committee leaders have to scramble to respond to a pro-restraint initiative in Congress, the inside-outside movement learns more about the tools and tactics that hawks can use to stymie democratic participation and progress,\" he says. \"Members and advocates will be less susceptible to this gimmick going forward.\"\n\nOf course, this still means that the majority of the House, including most Republicans and Democrats, voted in favor of sending cluster munitions for use by Ukrainian forces, which means the outcome that critics have been warning about - of Ukrainian territory booby-trapped for years to come with tiny explosives that will kill and mutilate innocents - is the likely outcome. It's the latest in a long line of decisions from ostensibly friendly governments detrimental to the welfare of ordinary Ukrainians that are sold as being in their favor, from early US and British opposition to peace talks in favor of pursuing military victory against Russia to the recent decision to provide Ukrainian forces with toxic depleted uranium rounds linked to cancers and birth defects.\n\nNevertheless, the vote may signal a watershed in official progressive discourse on the war, which has been stifled for the better part of a year and a half by an often vicious pressure campaign of smears and jingoism. Whether that's the case depends on what progressives decide to do next. Perhaps it's time to dust off that pro-diplomacy letter.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAfter spending the week giving progressively more concessions to a caucus of right-wing lawmakers centered around Florida representative Matt Gaetz, Kevin McCarthy was finally elected Speaker of the House in the early hours Saturday. It took fifteen ballots.\n\nWhile such negotiations and concessions (if not this many votes) are common in many other multiparty democracies, they're rare in modern US history - all the more so because the two opposing sides were in the same party. Rarer still is the chance to see so much of it play out in public.\n\nThe spectacle left elected Republicans looking divided, at least in the short term. It took less than 10 percent of the House Republican caucus to utterly humiliate McCarthy. Noted extremists like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Donald Trump supported McCarthy from the beginning, but that still wasn't enough to satisfy an even more aggressive minority of the caucus. With a very slim majority over Democrats, and with Republicans practically coming to blows with one another on the House floor, Kevin McCarthy is set to be a historically weak Speaker of the House.\n\nBut it would be a mistake to write House Republicans off yet. They don't have enough power to pass anything on their own. But they still have plenty of power to cause chaos, and, depending on how Democrats react, force terrible budget cuts onto the country.\n\nApparently Gaetz only relented and allowed McCarthy to become Speaker when, as Gaetz said , \"I ran out of things I could even imagine to ask for.\" One reason McCarthy was willing to cave on so much is that most of Gaetz's demands were in service of things nearly all Republicans want: cutting social spending and increasing dysfunction with the hope of making the idea of the government as a social good less popular.\n\nPersonal animus between Gaetz and McCarthy was a factor in the extended negotiations - according to reports , Gaetz feels McCarthy did not sufficiently defend him when he was accused of sex trafficking a minor. It was also, in part, a factional beef, and an attempt to get members of the comparatively younger and more recently elected far-right Freedom Caucus into congressional committees of greater influence.\n\nSome of the concessions Gaetz extracted from McCarthy included increased committee seats for members of the Freedom Caucus; increased power for the House to cut government officials' salaries; a variety of rules aimed at cutting or restricting spending; and the right of any one member of the House to force a vote of no confidence in the Speaker. But perhaps the most consequential concession to Gaetz is a new requirement to pair raising the country's debt ceiling with spending cuts.\n\nThis last concession hints at the real reason McCarthy could afford to withstand Gaetz's humiliation: weakening the Speaker's power strengthens the Republican agenda. The real core of the debate was not over what Republicans should do, but how - and how aggressively - they should do it.\n\nWhile Joe Biden and a Democrat-led Senate will nominally negotiate with the new Speaker over keeping the country running, McCarthy can claim he is bound by the austerity-focused House rules he just agreed to. Beyond that, he can point to the real possibility of a member of Gaetz's clique removing him from office if he doesn't toe the line.\n\nThus a situation that appears to weaken McCarthy's hand actually strengthens it. Since he is situated with very little room to maneuver, it will be Democrats who will have to move toward him in negotiations if they want to keep the government operating. With Republicans increasingly willing to shut down the government to force through policies for which they lack a popular mandate, a Speaker incapable of disciplining his caucus puts more pressure on Democrats, but not on Republicans, to compromise.\n\nDemocrats had the chance to eliminate the debt ceiling before Republicans took office - a move even moderates like Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen support . That might not have prevented Gaetz from acting out, but it would have taken away by far the greatest piece of leverage he and the far right have in Congress. But unlike the Right, Democrats chose not to use their power. The country will live with the consequences this year and beyond.\n\nBen Beckett is an American writer in Vienna.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

The case is thin - but the scandalmongering may weaken Biden's reelection chances, especially if he doesn't give voters a positive vision to counteract it.\n\nSpeaker of the House Kevin McCarthy leaves a Republican caucus meeting at the US Capitol Building on September 13, 2023, in Washington, DC.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy opened a formal inquiry into impeaching President Joe Biden by directing GOP-controlled House committees to begin investigating him. All the evidence available now suggests that the case against Biden is exceptionally weak, and even House Republicans seem divided on whether it is worth pursuing. That is perhaps one reason McCarthy opted to begin an investigation without a vote of the full House of Representatives, reneging on a previous promise.\n\nMost of the supposed case for impeachment rests on the idea that Joe Biden was improperly influenced by the business dealings his son, Hunter Biden, had with Ukrainian and Chinese companies. The president's son also faces criminal charges that are both more substantial and unrelated to the grounds for impeaching Joe Biden. The charges don't provide any strong evidence for impeachment claims, though they do understandably raise suspicions about the Biden family's business and financial practices in general.\n\nHunter Biden certainly traded on his family name to land positions for which he had otherwise dubious qualifications, but that phenomenon is endemic to the entire ruling class, in politics and beyond . And the kind of influence-peddling the GOP is alluding to certainly happens among elite families with ties to overlapping and perhaps competing financial interests, but so far, Republicans have provided little hard evidence to suggest that the elder Biden was influenced by his son to a criminal or impeachable degree. Then there's the fact that even with a rock-solid case, the Democrats' thin majority in the Senate makes a conviction all but impossible.\n\nBut the low chance of a conviction isn't really the point. Rather, the Republicans' have two real goals. The first is to make Biden's reelection efforts more difficult by distracting him and putting his son Hunter's sleazy and potentially illegal behavior at the front of voters' minds. Pro-impeachment Republicans' sentiment is perhaps best summed up by Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who told Donald Trump that she wanted to make the impeachment process \"long and excruciatingly painful for Joe Biden,'\" according to the New York Times .\n\nThe Republicans' second, arguably more important goal is to muddy the waters around Trump's various prosecutions - both in order to create a political environment that makes his conviction more difficult and to advance his chances of defeating Biden in the 2024 election. Trump himself, of course, has been pushing hard for the legislative tu quoque, both publicly and behind the scenes with congressional allies .\n\nIn 2016, Trump defeated a moderate Democrat who had decades of experience in Washington in part because his \"Drain the Swamp\" rhetoric articulated something many voters intuitively believe but often can't quite prove: politicians are just in it for themselves and their families, and they don't have to play by the rules that everyone else does. Republicans, and Trump in particular, are no less guilty of this than anyone else. And his image as a Washington outsider will certainly be harder to maintain now that he has himself served as president. So whether Trump's \"everyone else is crooked\" line will continue to work remains to be seen.\n\nBut one thing is clear: a political moment in which inflation is eating away at wages and Democrats' response is to roll back social spending and reimpose a draconian and endless regime of student debt on forty-five million people means that these kinds of attacks from the Right carry more weight than they should. The liberal establishment's strategy of simply telling voters they're wrong about the economy does little to help.\n\nBiden's failure to provide voters with an exciting positive vision is going to make it harder for him to change the subject away from Hunter and impeachment. That means, going forward, it's going to be up to Trump and congressional Republicans how much we hear about it. If Biden wants to change that, he needs to give the country something more substantial to talk about.\n\nThere is plenty that Democrats could do here. For starters, the Biden administration could immediately cancel all federal student debt right now; at the very least, it could extend the student loan repayment pause that is set to expire October 1. Biden could also make use of various other executive orders to materially improve people's lives, as congressional progressives have urged. Instead of simply insisting that voters should thank him for their economic good fortune, Biden and Democrats could campaign on bringing back the temporarily generous COVID welfare policies that they let expire.\n\nDon't hold your breath.\n\nBen Beckett is an American writer in Vienna.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLike many Americans, you may not be aware that hundreds of US troops are currently deployed in Syria, where they've been illegally occupying small, opposition-controlled areas in the southeast and northeast. You may also not be aware that a House vote earlier this week to end their presence in the country failed 103-321.\n\nDespite hitting another brick wall, this latest attempt to pull US troops out of Syria may offer hope for the future, serving as one more sign of the emergence of an inchoate, cross-ideological antiwar coalition in Congress. Introduced by Donald Trump ally Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, the resolution drew the most GOP support for a war powers resolution so far, according to Just Foreign Policy, with forty-seven Republicans voting for the measure. By contrast, the last time a vote to end US involvement in the country was held - an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act put forward last year by Squad member Representative Jamaal Bowman, a New York Democrat - only twenty-five Republicans supported the resolution, a shift that's perhaps owed to this resolution's backing from MAGA standard-bearers like Gaetz and Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nAt the same time, this Trumpian taint - along with substantive concerns about the fate of Syrian Kurds - may also have contributed to the massive drop in Democratic support for the withdrawal, with only fifty-six voting in favor (a substantial number, but less than half of the 130 who had voted for it last year). Every one of the newly expanded Squad voted for Gaetz's resolution, aside from Florida's Maxwell Frost, who has previously been critici zed for backing away from some of his previously held progressive foreign-policy positions following his upset Democratic primary win.\n\nOther notable Democratic \"nay\" votes include Bernie Sanders ally Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, current House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, and California representatives Katie Porter and Adam Schiff, who are both currently competing for Senator Dianne Feinstein's soon-to-be-vacated seat. Representative Barbara Lee, the third big name in that race, and who's maybe best known as the only member of Congress to vote against the US war in Afghanistan, voted in favor.\n\nThe debate over the resolution served as a reminder that, much as with Afghanistan and Iraq before it, everyone wants to end the \"forever wars\" until it comes down to actually ending a specific one. Opponent after opponent got up to tell the House that they were all for getting out of Syria and ending the broad authorities that have allowed presidents to send troops to obscure conflicts - just not now and not like this.\n\n\"Though I oppose an indefinite US military presence in Syria, this measure forces a premature end to our mission at a critical time for our efforts,\" said Representative Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat.\n\n\"Now, I have been one of the most vocal proponents in this Congress on reasserting Congressional authority in matters of war and peace,\" said Representative Jason Crow, a Democrat from Colorado. \"It is time to pull it back. And it is time to reassert our authority and to have the debates that have been long overdue for many, many years. . . . But there is a good way to do it, and there is a wrong way to do it.\"\n\nSome of the objections were important, such as concerns about abandoning the Kurds that US forces have allied with in fighting ISIS, and who may be vulnerable to Turkish attack in case of US withdrawal. This was pointed to by new Squad member Representative Becca Balint, a Vermont Democrat, in an interview with the Intercept , even as she voted for the resolution. But California Democratic representative Ro Khanna told the outlet that the United States has \"enough leverage, in my view, with Turkey to help protect the Kurds,\" and that if the president wanted to make the case for a troop presence to defend them, it needed to be made through Congress. Others saw it differently.\n\n\"Withdrawing US troops might help facilitate negotiations for a power-sharing agreement between Turkey, Kurdish separatists, and the Syrian government, which could help bring stability to the region,\" says Hassan El-Tayyab, the Friends Committee on National Legislation's legislative director for Middle East policy. \"That would require leading with diplomacy, not military force.\"\n\nOther objections on the House floor were more spurious. \"Either we fight and defeat them in Syria, or we'll fight in the streets of our nation,\" warned Montana Republican representative Ryan Zinke. \"If we withdraw our troops from Syria now, we could see a resurgence of ISIS,\" said Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, who instead called for withdrawal to happen only after \"the total defeat of ISIS.\"\n\nA number pointed to Iran, suggesting how far the reasoning for US involvement has strayed. \"If we were to withdraw our troops, that increases the worry that Israel has to have about Iran,\" said Representative Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York. \"The remaining troops assist the Syrian democratic forces in deterrence of continued terrorist threats from Iranian-backed terrorist organizations,\" said South Carolina Republican representative Joe Wilson.\n\nBut there's no way countering Iran fits the already-stretched legal authorization for US intervention, which is based on the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed after September 11 to let the US military take on those responsible for the terrorist attack.\n\nThe vote follows Mark Milley's first trip to Syria as chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he used similar reasoning as those opposing Gaetz's resolution, warning that withdrawing would be \"setting the conditions for a resurgence\" of terrorism, and calling for the \"enduring defeat of ISIS.\" The trip is a sign that despite the president pledging to no longer \"fight the wars of the past\" and to launch a new era of \"relentless diplomacy,\" the Biden White House continues to view prolonging this particular war as a priority, even as US actions in Syria undermine the administration's talk of respecting sovereignty, territorial integrity, human rights, and a \"rules-based international order.\"\n\nAlso undermining this were Israel's recent air strikes on Aleppo airport, which took place to little attention and outrage. To add insult to injury, a United Nations official has warned the attack will further impede relief aid to Syria that's been desperately needed following the horrific earthquake that has killed thousands in the country.\n\nIn the midst of all these troubles plaguing Syria, the end of the illegal US occupation of the country's territory seems like it's still a ways off from happening. But the vote on Gaetz's resolution does suggest a cross-partisan consensus opposing open-ended US involvement in foreign wars is emerging, even if it's coming slower than antiwar voices would prefer.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

That depends on who you ask.\n\nWashington Post reporter Isaac Arnsdorf attempts to partially explain MAGA's recent success in Finish What We Started: The MAGA Movement's Ground War to End Democracy . Arnsdorf's book differs from much of the commentary on Trump in that it focuses squarely on the organizational machinations and ideas of the wider layer that gravitates to him.\n\nFinish What We Started follows a range of mostly low-level MAGA figures as they try to make sense of what is happening in American politics and intervene to influence it. The key focus here is the \"precinct strategy.\" It's a post-2020 blueprint to seize administrative control of local Republican party branches, then continue the process upward. The end goal is to make sure the 2024 election is won by Trump, no matter what happens on the day.\n\nArnsdorf keeps his editorializing to a minimum. He explains at the outset that he chose to focus on relatively minor MAGA leaders \"both because they are representative of thousands, maybe millions more like them, but also because they were in some ways exceptional.\" Those looking for gossip about Trump's inner circle will be disappointed: this is mostly a view of a changed party from the bottom up.\n\nArnsdorf's book serves as a nice companion piece to Ryan Grim 's The Squad: AOC and the Hope of a Political Revolution (2023) or Edward-Isaac Dovere 's Battle for the Soul: Inside the Democrats' Campaigns to Defeat Trump (2021). All three center on the interactions between political newcomers and party bureaucracies. The significance of these encounters is that they have the power to further or foreclose certain broader political possibilities.\n\nThe precinct strategy was dreamed up by an insurance lawyer from Wisconsin named Dan Schultz. It's pretty simple: stack the precincts, get MAGA chairs elected, control the administrative apparatus, purge anyone unsupportive, then refuse to acknowledge wins for non-MAGA candidates.\n\nSchultz's origin story for the plan involves being hazed in military academy and interrogating KGB agents while working in Army Intelligence. Schultz dubiously claims that at a meeting of the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps -  a neo-Nazi group terrorizing people at the US-Mexico border - a young man got up and declared that the real power in America lies with the Republican Party Precinct Committee chairs.\n\nSteve Bannon stumbled upon him in 2013 and Schultz began writing for Breitbart . But it wasn't until 2021, after Bannon began promoting him on War Room , that Schultz's content began to go viral online. Disillusioned MAGA supporters, smarting from their embarrassment after January 6, were open to new ideas. The precinct strategy offered a nice avenue for all involved to avoid embarrassment, feel productive, and engage in a bit of bloodletting.\n\nThe precinct strategy took off across America. It quickly becomes a carnivalesque suburban Cultural Revolution. Sexagenarian MAGA-red guards denounce long-standing precinct chairs as traitors. They begin prosecutory speeches with Merriam-Webster definitions of words like \"endorse,\" purging RINOs (Republican In Name Only) real and perceived with barely concealed libidinal delight. Even old folks' homes become unlikely show trial venues.\n\nFinish What We Started lets a range of MAGA diehards explain their take on the causes of contemporary polarization and what is to be done about it. But this is anticlimactic: most express little more than vague fears and suspicions, and enthusiasm for the precinct strategy.\n\nBannon is the one genuinely famous MAGA figure who features prominently, and he outlines the only developed theory (stolen in part from Bernie Sanders supporter Thomas Frank). Bannon argues that the fallout from 2008's global financial crisis immiserated the working class. \"Haves\" like the Koch brothers were for a time able to use culture war issues to manipulate the \"have-nots\" into electoral action that actually worsened the situation, but this trick has now stopped working.\n\nBannon explains that the Republicans are now really two parties in one: an elite party of big corporate interests and a working-class party of social interests. These interests are irreconcilable. MAGA, according to Bannon, is the working-class majority cohering en masse in their natural place against the pro-trade liberalization billionaires.\n\nThis is a generously focused recap: Arnsdorf also notes that Bannon's take includes mystical ideas about recurring historical epochs, clash of civilizations nonsense, and snippets from 1950s mass movement-focused pop psychology.\n\nBannon's \"analysis\" reads superficially like a structural explanation rooted in social antagonisms. This is intentional. Bannon delights in shocking fellow conservatives by calling himself a Leninist and is familiar enough with key terms to ape a class analysis. This is a fairly transparent ploy: he fully admits here that he thinks a layer of former Sanders supporters are recruitable to the MAGA movement.\n\nArnsdorf's approach in Finish What We Started is to largely let his subjects speak for themselves. This could be problematic, particularly if they were all as smooth as Bannon. It would simply be foolish to take such self-assessments at face value.\n\nFortunately, the rest of the cast inadvertently pokes holes in Bannon's account of the MAGA ascendancy. The sketches here are certainly of people who see themselves as the little guy - or at least on his side. But to call any of them working-class is a stretch. Every second character has started a weird business (of somewhat unclear purpose) in the course of their activism. These aren't exactly the gravediggers of capitalism trying to break their chains. They're more like funeral home owners offering discounts if you sign up today.\n\nThese isolated lawyers, real estate brokers, financial advisors, flag-shirt salesmen, event planners, and ad executives do seem genuinely buoyed by the human connection involved in their MAGA movement experiences. But they are absolutely not experiencing their political awakening as a worker's revolt. And why would they? They're all either general managers or proud owners of small- to medium-sized businesses.\n\nTheir pretty constant discussion of how they're going to be thrown in concentration camps makes more sense the more you get to know them. While they may not explain it exactly like this, theirs is a Taftian worldview in which freedom clearly means their own unrestricted prerogative as business owners to do as they please. They see literally anything else as totalitarian.\n\nAs the November election draws ever closer, political pundits are falling over themselves to make predictions about what a second Donald Trump presidency might look like. Some attempt to read the tea leaves of Trump's rambling speeches. Others commentate Trump's Apprentice -esque search for a vice president. Still more search among Trump's new, allegedly professionalized courtiers for clues as to what moves the once and future MAGA king might make.\n\nArnsdorf has tried something different: a narrative-based sociological study of an organizational strategy. There are certainly lots of memorable vignettes. One of Finish What You Started 's main characters declares that, while she doesn't need the stress and would rather be home watching Yellowstone ,\n\nshe was never giving up on politics. Even when it meant long nights in her windowless office at the Cobb GOP headquarters, with her signed Marjorie Taylor Greene yard sign and her poster mapping out the spiderweb connections between Karl Marx and Barack Obama, titled the AGENDA GRINDING AMERICA DOWN.\n\nUnfortunately, the sociological focus and the title are slightly at odds. The precinct strategy is supposed to be a stepping stone to getting Trump elected and then \"finishing what we started.\" But most of the players involved in this story never even speculate about what Trump might do when elected. Giving his ominous phrase the title spot feels a little cheap.\n\nBannon offers the clearest suggestion about what the phrase might mean: \"Economic nationalism . . . the second term is going to be ten-X more aggressive on the implementation of policy than the first.\" If this just means more tariffs designed to shore up profits and quick wins for Trump's buddies in select US industries , then the day-in and day-out efforts of some of the people featured here could take on a slightly sad dimension.\n\nThen again, these \" infantrymen of the lumpenbourgeoisie\" do spend an awful lot of time trying to swindle each other on the side of their organizing efforts. Characters in Finish What You Started will disappear mid-action, only to appear later and say they've dropped out of politics because their comrades scammed them out of money. Perhaps Bannon is partly right: in Trump's big grift, the shopkeepers have found their natural home.\n\nChris Dite is a teacher and union member.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

The document they created was explicitly designed to check the democratic will of ordinary people and protect the plutocratic interests of the propertied elite.\n\nThe US Constitution was designed to protect capitalist social relations from democratic challenge. (Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the notorious far-right congressperson from Georgia, recently made headlines for her call for a \" national divorce \" between red and blue states. This did not stop her, of course, from showing up in lower Manhattan to protest the arraignment of former president Donald Trump and to garner more media coverage for herself.\n\nWhether the likes of Taylor Greene actually believe what they say is somewhat beside the point. Such calls for a national breakup are a recurrent feature of US politics - we fought one of history's bloodiest civil wars in the 1860s - and remind us of the uneasy compromises that underpinned the drafting of the Constitution in 1787.\n\nUS political culture venerates the Constitution for its supposed genius in setting up a system of government that could last forever, if only we could abide by its timeless wisdom. The conflict and dysfunction that plagues our political system, in this view, stems from a heedless disregard of the framers' intentions, not the system itself.\n\nThis view still predominates, but there seems to be a growing sense that a constitutional framework established in the late eighteenth century may not be up to dealing with the challenges of the twenty-first. New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie, for example, has been writing a running commentary on our \" constitutional stagnation \" and what might be done to break out of it .\n\nRobert Ovetz is a senior lecturer in political science at San José State University. His new book, We the Elites: Why the US Constitution Serves the Few , provides a detailed but accessible critique of the Constitution as a system designed to protect capitalist social relations from democratic challenge. Our constitutional system, Ovetz argues, cannot address the many crises we face because it was designed precisely to frustrate and contain collective action, not facilitate it.\n\nHe spoke to Jacobin 's Chris Maisano about the book, whether meaningful change can be achieved through the current political system, and potential alternatives rooted in decentralized, directly democratic political institutions.\n\nThere seems to be renewed interest in constitutional questions on the Left today. Why do you think that is?\n\nWe're seeing a resurgence of class struggle in the United States. I think there's some dissatisfaction following the past two elections and the failure to get important legislation passed. Many of the people who have been involved with electing democratic socialists to Congress and trying to get Bernie Sanders the Democratic presidential nomination are turning toward labor organizing because they see things are blocked in terms of being able to elect the right person and having that result in meaningful changes in policy.\n\nAlso, the long-running crises we face continue to go unaddressed - gun violence, climate catastrophe, homelessness, explosion of housing costs, low wages, anti-union repression. As a result, people are looking for a more systematic explanation and analysis for why we can't get things done. We're starting to look at the design and organization of the political process itself.\n\nWalk us through some of the main themes and arguments of your book.\n\nWe can't understand our undemocratic constitution without understanding our capitalist constitution. Many who write about the Constitution don't take its political economy into account. As someone who teaches political science, we often focus on the rules, procedures, and processes.\n\nBut what I argue in the book is that the framers (who are also called the \"Founders\" or \"Founding Fathers,\" a term I greatly dislike) designed a system that protects the interest of property. There are what I call \"minority checks\" throughout the Constitution that constrain political democracy and prevent economic democracy. The \"minority\" they sought to protect are not who we think of today as ethnic, racial, and gender minorities, but the minority of the propertied elite.\n\nThe Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation, the country's first system of government after the end of the Revolutionary War. Historians call the 1780s the \"Critical Period\" because there was a lot of social, economic, and political conflict that put the future of the new country in question. Why did the framers feel the need to come up with a new system to replace the Articles?\n\nThe Critical Period was a time when economic elites were kicked back on their heels in many states. They were losing some significant battles in what I call the three insurrections.\n\nFirst, there were slave rebellions, which escalated during the revolution. Remember that most of the slaves that ran away joined up with the loyalists and the British, and the rebellions continued when the fighting stopped. Next, there was organized Native resistance to white settler colonialism. Out in the West, Native peoples were getting organized into a confederation to resist the theft of land and genocidal attacks.\n\nFinally, there were uprisings of small white subsistence farmers, who for the most part were outside the cash economy. They grew what they ate. They were in conflict with large commercial farmers, merchants, bankers, and traders. And in some states, they were a powerful force to be reckoned with.\n\nThey organized their own political parties, and if they could meet the property requirements to serve in office, they or their allies would get elected. They were able to pass some significant forms of economic democracy in their state legislatures under the Articles of Confederation - things like debt relief and land banks that provided cheap loans to small farmers using their land as collateral. They issued paper money and allowed it to be used to pay private and public debts. Some states taxed imported goods from other states to generate revenue and lower taxes on the local population.\n\nThe framers were extremely concerned about these three insurrections. They referred to the economic majority as the \"meaner sort of people,\" or my favorite phrase, the \"people out of doors.\" They thought the people who were literally outside working with their hands and getting them dirty should not be inside the meeting rooms with their hands on the levers of power.\n\nThis was a short period after a revolutionary period of upheaval when ordinary people shared power with elites. Because some states were unicameral with short terms, few had an executive veto, and none had judicial review, it was easier to pass new laws quickly. State laws were the final word because Congress didn't have \"supremacy\" power or judicial review. While they still had property requirements to run for and serve in office, these democratic elements are mostly missing from our current Constitution. This is not to idealize the states but to show how the Constitution was a reactionary outcome to the revolution.\n\nPeople on the Left have usually seen the state and local governments as bastions of reactionary power and sought federal government intervention against them. The Constitution created the federal government that has often played a progressive role in US history, in relation to the states in particular.\n\nDuring the 1950 to 1960s, the center left looked to the courts and the federal government. But conservatives also used federal power to intervene against liberal or progressive states to shoot down what they were trying to do. Each side uses Article VI federal \"supremacy\" power when they have it to intervene and suppress any attempts at innovation by the other side.\n\nWe should forget about the partisan use of supremacy power and think about why the federal government has it at all. The center left sees supremacy power as something we can use to push our policy demands forward. But the reality is that the framers inserted the supremacy power into the Constitution because they wanted to give a minority check to propertied interests to block innovations at the state level that threatened property.\n\nInstead of deciding which level of government is \"best,\" we need to look at why the federal government gets the final say in our system. This was intentional, because the framers wanted to have a brake on democracy from below to prevent any movement that today we would call socialism.\n\nYou briefly mentioned the national debt earlier, but it was such an important issue that we should talk about it in more depth. The country had huge debts coming out of the Revolutionary War and was having trouble paying them off. Why did the framers feel they needed an entirely new federal government to address the national debt?\n\nThe revolution was very costly. They borrowed, by Alexander Hamilton's estimates, several hundred million dollars - and that's the valuation from the 1780s, not adjusted dollars.\n\nThe states and Congress issued multiple types of IOUs and paper money. They also borrowed money from the Spanish, the Dutch, and the French. The Confederation Congress actually defaulted on a loan by the French shortly after the revolution ended. Because there wasn't enough gold and silver in circulation, paper money was needed to get economic activity going. Furthermore, economic elites were on a capital strike because they refused to borrow or invest, and foreign loans stopped. This was a period of deep fiscal and financial crisis.\n\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, Congress didn't have the power to tax. So they would tell the states, this is how much you have to contribute to the national treasury - what was then called \"requisitions.\" They didn't even have a good way of figuring out what each state's share should be. Each of the states pretty much paid its share during the revolution, but when the fighting stopped, most stopped paying in full or at all. As a result, Congress couldn't pay its debt and went into default with France. Only a few of the states were able to pay off all or some of the debts by using internal tariffs called \"imposts.\"\n\nIn some states, like Massachusetts, the conservatives tried to impose numerous taxes on the economic majority to generate the revenue to repay creditors. That triggered the famous Shays's Rebellion in 1786, by small white subsistence farmers who were Revolutionary War veterans. When creditors tried to foreclose on their farms and meager possessions, they put on their old uniforms, took up arms, and marched on local courthouses in the western part of the state to shut them down.\n\nThe taxes were very unpopular because many farmers were mad they were never paid for fighting in the revolution - they were \"paid\" with those IOUs. Desperate for cash, many small creditors sold their IOUs to creditors, and soon most of those IOUs ended up in the hands of a very small number of rich speculators. One of the most famous speculators was Abigail Adams, the wife of soon-to-be-vice-president John Adams. Although they bought the IOUs for pennies on the dollar, the speculators demanded them to be paid at their face value from when they were originally issued, not at what they paid or their depreciated value.\n\nThere was a lot of political opposition to raising taxes to enrich the speculators. This was widely seen in class terms as an attempt to redistribute wealth upward that would result in many losing their land and being forced into wage work - what Karl Marx later called \" primitive accumulation .\" Also, the Congress was unable to pay not only rank-and-file soldiers but also officers, which almost resulted in an attempted coup by military officers when the fighting stopped.\n\nThis all leads to the Constitutional Convention, in which the issue that's discussed over and over is how to address the demands of the creditors. This is achieved in the Constitution by establishing a stable government that can set up, manage, and protect the capitalist economy. In Article I, the regulation of interstate and foreign commerce and contracts and the establishment of bankruptcy laws are moved from state to federal authority. Now Congress exclusively has that power. Authority to repay debts and the power to issue money is taken from the states and given to Congress, preventing the states from printing or coining their own money anymore. Article VI says that all debts are the responsibility of the new federal government and must be paid by it.\n\nOnce Hamilton became the first secretary of the treasury, the national debt became the means of creating what he called the public credit system, which allowed the federal government to roll over outstanding debts. Hamilton received approval from Congress to consolidate the debt and roll it over into new interest-bearing bonds at very generous rates. This transformed the economic elites of the separate states with various competing interests into a single ruling class with shared economic interests.\n\nHamilton also got Congress to authorize the creation of the First Bank of the United States, a semiprivate bank that held all the federal revenue and debts of the federal government. The federal government would now collect taxes and use that revenue to pay the creditors - the same way it works today. From that revenue they also vastly expanded the military and ensured the consolidation of a stable national government.\n\nAnd as Hamilton argued, this public credit system - in actuality, a publicly funded private financial system - was a prerequisite for creating a new empire. The first targets of the newly expanded, tax-funded military were the native peoples arming themselves in the West against genocidal settler colonialism and insurrectionary white subsistence farmers resisting primitive accumulation. To understand why the United States became the dominant economic and military power in the world, you have to understand how the Constitution provided the tools by which such power was created, and Hamilton immediately put them into action.\n\nEvery US movement for social change after the founding period has run into the question of what to do about the Constitution. There were huge debates, for example, in the abolitionist movement over whether the Constitution was a proslavery or antislavery document. People like William Lloyd Garrison denounced it as a \"covenant with death,\" but others like Charles Sumner and Frederick Douglass argued that it provided resources to restrict the growth of slavery and ultimately end it.\n\nThe abolitionist debate is essentially repeated in every powerful movement of every generation: does the Constitution allow for systemic change, or tinkering around the edges with reforms that do not threaten the structure of political power and the capitalist economy? If the Constitution does not allow us to make the changes we need, should we try to bypass it and go a different direction?\n\nHere I fall on Garrison's side. He made the excellent point that slavery was well protected throughout the Constitution - it's mentioned about twenty different times without actually using the word \"slave\" or \"slavery\" anywhere. They use all kinds of euphemisms, like \"Person held to Service or Labour\" in Article IV and \"other persons\" in other places.\n\nRemember that we got the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery in 1865, at the end of the Civil War, when the Confederate states were outside the union. The film Lincoln gets a lot of things wrong, but it shows how hard it was to get the amendment through Congress even when most of the slave states weren't in Congress. Abolition ultimately required this rupture that we call the Civil War, in which hundreds of thousands of people were killed, many more maimed for life, and half of the country burned to the ground to overcome the impediments the Constitution put in the way of abolishing slavery.\n\nFast forward to today: when we attempt to change policy at the state level it's overturned at the federal level because the courts use the supremacy clause. In the last two chapters of the book, I ask what we can do about the Constitution. We essentially have three choices. Two of the options are in the Constitution itself. Article V establishes the process for amending the Constitution and for calling a constitutional convention. But those are really long shots because of the high supermajority thresholds for all four methods. We've had over ten thousand officially introduced constitutional amendments in our country's history, but only 27 of them were successful - about one-quarter of one percent. The extremely high threshold in the Article V amendment process is an effective minority check that has rarely been overcome.\n\nThe same goes for calling a constitutional convention. Right now, there's an effort to call a constitutional convention backed by the last active living Koch brother. That's very dangerous for the Left. If they succeed, we are likely to be beaten badly. They are outorganizing and certainly outspending us. A constitutional convention is not going to make any changes in our favor right now.\n\nInstead, we need to use the same strategy the framers did when they bypassed the Articles of Confederation. We need to design a new system of direct democratic self-governance. Instead of creating a new constitutional system, I argue, we can design a decentralized confederation of local and regional worker-controlled economic democracies. It would involve people organizing themselves to take over the economy in a general strike and transform it through direct democracy to serve the interest and the needs of the many rather than the interest of property.\n\nI can imagine a reader agreeing with your critique of the Constitution while also being very skeptical of the alternative strategy you just proposed.\n\nIt's occasionally possible to make change under the Constitution if it doesn't threaten the supremacy of property. We have to be careful about how our demands get diffused, diluted, and translated as they are transformed into regulations. When laws are passed, we tend to forget about them and move on to the next issue. But in the meantime, they get challenged in the courts and the regulatory bodies create new administrative law. And over time, those laws get transformed and turned into something very different.\n\nBefore we advocate for reform, we need to address the problem of why so many people become dissatisfied with the political process. Every election cycle we become hopeful and energetic. We get involved and we elect people to office who have the intention of doing many great things. And even if we do get good things done, they ultimately don't turn out to be what we expected them to be.\n\nThe Constitution was designed with all these pitfalls and roadblocks that make it very difficult to get the changes we need unless we give the economic elites what they want so they no longer block it. This is how the economic minority is empowered by the Constitution to impede political democracy and prevent economic democracy.\n\nI live in California, where we've been hit by several atmospheric rivers in the last few months. We don't have time to negotiate with the fossil fuel companies, because they have blocked everything that has been proposed or gutted it when it gets passed. We have to understand the Constitution as the main impediment to making urgently needed systemic changes. We are long past due for a new political strategy that bypasses the constitutional system altogether if we are going to survive.\n\nRobert Ovetz is a senior lecturer in political science at San José State University.

Instead, right-wing organizations will use the coming years to mobilize and radicalize while seeking to take advantage of divisions in the Republican party to change the US political landscape. Understanding the dynamic between the mainstream right and their more radical counterparts is vital to stopping their growth.\n\nIn the US context, this means contrasting figures like Trump and his imitators, like Senator Josh Hawley or Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, with right-wing militias and fascist organizations, like the III%ers or the Proud Boys, and comparing their different priorities and tactics. Different right-wing coalitions must be fought with different strategies, from government chambers to the streets, which means that the Left must pay careful attention to the nuances of right-wing politics and adjust its strategies accordingly. The same rhetoric and campaigning that worked against the mostly law-abiding right will not fare so well if it turns further toward violence.\n\nOne of the clearest differences between the mainstream right wing and the radical right is their policy priorities. For all his bombast about \" draining the swamp \" or forging an entirely new way forward in US politics, Trump's actual policy commitments weren't far from what the Republican Party has advocated for the last fifty years. From his crass nationalism to his terrible record on LGBTQ issues to his unflinching pro-business and anti-tax stances, Trump governed more or less like most of his opponents would have. Trump, like most conservatives, was fundamentally focused on maintaining the status quo.\n\nConversely, outsider right-wing organizations have a much more radical set of principles and plans. Unlike their conservative counterparts, groups like the Proud Boys want more than cynical appeals to the good old days. They actually intend to return to their imagined past, advocating for women to stay home from work en masse, or for the return of open and legal racism and discrimination. Directly critical of democracy as such, they go far beyond suggesting that this or that election was fraudulent and instead call for an end to the current system of elections in favor of authoritarianism .\n\nIn contrast to conservatives, these far-right factions want a radical break with the status quo. Some even deserve the label \"revolutionaries,\" with their goal being the complete transformation of politics and society.\n\nThe different goals of conservatives and the more radical right highlight another key difference between them: tactics. Conservatives are generally content with standing for election and gaining their power legally, whereas the forces of the far right tend to emphasize the utility of violence and insurrection. The founder of the Proud Boys, for example, has been so direct as to say that \" fighting solves everything .\" For these right-wingers, violence isn't just something that is occasionally useful , it's necessary . This is not only because their goals are more radical than conservatives' but because they think that violence is good for the violent, that it makes better party members and citizens.\n\nLike the Left, the forces of the Right are in contestation with each other over which of them will hold the hegemonic position among their comrades and allies - who will be at the forefront of the Right. Knowing which sector of the right wing is currently in control must inform the Left's tactics and rhetoric. Trump's nationalist turn in the 2016 election opened space on the Right for fascist and other far-right movements to move millions of people further to the radical right than could have otherwise been imagined. This new array of right-wing forces can't be met with appeals for a return to normalcy - it has to be fought with a positive vision of a radically different future.\n\nThinking about the Right this way changes how we should understand January 6th, and how we need to change our strategy to reflect trends on the Right. The question isn't whether the groups that stormed the Capitol building on January 6 were already large enough to take over the state or whether they had the total backing of the president. These perspectives focus overmuch on the fascist governments of Germany and Italy rather than on the ubiquitous right-wing groups, big and small, that have flourished from the genocidal militias in Indonesia to the fascist Integralists of Brazil , from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in India to the pro-Apartheid parties of South Africa , and countless other examples across the world. Though many of these groups remained too small to actually contest state power, they could still wield incredible influence on their countries' politics through murderous violence and their competition with other right-wing groups for political hegemony. They did this in cooperation with conservatives, who thought that they could use the fascists to do their dirty work - namely, stopping the growth of the Left through both organizing and violence.\n\nIn much the same way that small socialist organizations can push liberals to the left and try to get increasingly radical proposals accepted by the mainstream, fascists can push their conservative allies to the right while building their own strength within the right wing. Arguing over whether Trump is a fascist or what will become of this or that organization obscures the ongoing danger of the mounting power and influence of the far right on the Right in general. Just as we on the Left can celebrate our influence even despite individual campaigns failing, the far right can look at each of its efforts as one battle in a long war for political primacy on the Right and for social power generally.\n\nThe far right intentionally pushes the envelope of the politically acceptable, organizes at the grassroots, and works both with and against conservatives in the struggle for power. Once conservatives learn that they can use the far right to threaten and even kill their opponents, and as the far right plays that role increasingly openly, the rules of politics change. From brawls at Trump rallies to Charlottesville and the Capitol riot, the emerging alliance between conservatives and the far right is showing itself to be intentionally and strategically politically violent. If this trend continues, it will reshape what is politically possible in this country - and the Left will have to respond with a radically different strategy and vision.\n\nCraig Johnson is a PhD candidate in Latin American History at the University of California-Berkeley.

They fail because its interracial labor movement was, and continues to be, systematically suppressed.\n\nA \"UAW on Strike\" sign held on a picket line outside the General Motors Co. Spring Hill Manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, on October 30, 2023. (Kevin Wurm / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIt is commonplace to regard the US South as a political backwater. Many liberals see Southerners as irredeemable red-state voters, mired in racist parochialism or bible-thumping backwardness. It is of course true that many states in the South are today, and have been for the last century, bastions of low wages and business-friendly economics, while its political class has championed reactionary and racist social policies. But what the liberal account almost always gets wrong are the origins of Southern backwardness.\n\nSoutherners, we are told, are culturally distinct, and that culture is pathological. This has justified their abandonment by the Democratic Party and even, at times, the labor movement, both of which have often decided to dedicate their limited resources to what they view as more winnable fights in the North. If Southerners stand in the way of progress - despite that progress being in their own interests - their will must be circumvented on the journey to a more humane future.\n\nBut such popular accounts of Southern backwardness ignore several important details. Organized labor and progressive politics do not fail in the South because of some ingrained cultural irrationality. Rather, the proliferation of reactionary politics is the by-product of a labor movement that was, and continues to be, systematically suppressed.\n\nThe idea that Southerners have a pathological culture, characterized by racism, fanatic religiosity, male chauvinism, and a general disdain of outsiders, is perhaps as old as the South itself. Northern capitalists - who sometimes made fortunes dealing in the slave trade, underwriting plantation mortgages, and supplying plantations with finished consumables - often characterized Southerners as suffering from a moral defect, a defect from which they were immune.\n\nThis defect was most influentially diagnosed in W. J. Cash's 1941 study The Mind of the South . According to Cash, class conflict and working-class consciousness in the South is systematically muted if not completely absent due to the poor Southern whites' cultural commitments to individualism, violent racism, and religious fundamentalism - an uncaused germ infecting the mind of Southerners.\n\nSimilar narratives remain common in contemporary literature on the South. Arlie Russell Hochschild's Strangers in Their Own Land , which many educated liberals picked up to crack the cultural pathology of Donald Trump's 2016 win, argues that poor white workers in Louisiana reject environmental protectionism not because heavily polluting chemical companies are essentially the only employers in various regions of the state - a claim many of the book's interviewees continually insist is actually the reason they do not support environmentalism - but because of an \"irrational\" aversion to the cultural politics associated with environmentalism.\n\nIn this account, the residents of Cancer Alley - the stretch of the Mississippi River from New Orleans to Baton Rouge - have nearly a 100 percent higher chance of developing cancer than the average American because the residents themselves are irrational, not the economic system that forces workers to choose between death from cancer and death from a lack of viable employment. Hochschild conveniently ignores the vibrant coalition of chemical workers, unions, and environmentalists that flourished in the 1980s as well as the connection between the decline in union density in the chemical plants and the decrease in environmental activism. Faced with the complexity of Southern political attitudes, observers retreat to cultural explanations.\n\nLiberal accounts of Southern backwardness ignore several important details. On the one hand, Southern politics are heterogeneous, ranging from the solidly conservative 14th congressional district in Georgia, home to conspiracy theorist and Trump sycophant Marjorie Taylor Greene, to Jackson, Mississippi, where the self-described socialist and revolutionary Chokwe Antar Lumumba is mayor. On the other hand, the South has been home to some of the most valiant movements for social and economic justice of the past century, from the 1934 strikes that paralyzed the textile industry to the myriad civil rights mobilizations from Alabama to Washington, DC, to the ongoing struggle to Stop Cop City in Atlanta.\n\nThough erased from the popular imagination, the South was once home to a robust progressive politics, embodied in persons like Alabama governor Big Jim Folsom and the controversial populist Louisiana governor Huey Long , whose Share Our Wealth campaign infamously challenged Franklin Delano Roosevelt from the left. Each of these figures was bolstered by a powerful labor movement whose legacy is nearly forgotten today. In 1945, one in four Alabaman nonagricultural workers was a union member, part of a labor movement bolstered by the state's powerful interracial coal miners' union. In Louisiana, New Orleans had, since 1860, been a bastion of interracial unionism thanks to the International Longshoremen's Association.\n\nThe declining fortunes of the South's labor movement are traceable to the severe repression exacted upon unions in the wake of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act and the concomitant failure to organize Southern industries during the Congress of Industrial Organizations' Operation Dixie. Among the many odious developments Taft-Hartley facilitated, the act's mandate of anti-communist affidavits purged Southern unions of their committed anti-racist organizers.\n\nThese organizers struggled to build durable labor and civil rights coalitions that had the capacity to withstand Southern capitalists' assaults. Without them, efforts to build interracial unionism foundered. What Southern labor leadership remained after the purges were more interested in organizing predominately white industries, and figures like Long and Folsom lost their popular base in the Southern interracial working class. These are the real origins of Southern backwardness.\n\nDespite the current political orientation of the South, Southern workers are no less favorably disposed to working-class politics than workers in any other region of the country. We tested this hypothesis in New Orleans in spring 2022 with the Workplace Justice Project at the Loyola University New Orleans College of Law. In our surveys, we found that New Orleanians generally self-identified as working class, and they regarded the workplace as the most important arena in which to struggle to improve the quality of their lives.\n\nWhile other studies find that Americans tend to identify as middle class when given the opportunity, New Orleans residents preferred the working-class identification. Respondents also tended to agree overwhelmingly that big corporations held too much power in American society, and that economic fairness was a substantial problem in the city of New Orleans. Moreover, New Orleanians see employers as the primary barrier to improving on these issues, characterize the employer-employee relationship as antagonistic, and generally filter their social problems through the prism of class relations.\n\nOur polling in New Orleans suggests that the weakness of labor in the South isn't due to a lack of class consciousness; it is more likely due to the relative absence of labor unions and institutions. These results may come as a surprise to those who subscribe to the liberal cultural thesis, but the class consciousness exhibited by New Orleanians follows rather straightforwardly from the economic conditions of the South.\n\nWhile employment in manufacturing in the US South has increased substantially throughout the latter half of the twentieth century - jobs which, in the North, provided high wages and benefits - wages remained much lower in the South as a result of low union density. The South has in many ways given a \" spatial fix \" for heavy industry in the United States, providing labor for substantially lower pay - in essence, a domestic Global South. Indeed, since working conditions in the US South often substantively resemble those of the Global South, \"outsourcing\" has often meant migration to the South, not out of the country.\n\nSouthern workers are disproportionately concentrated in the low-wage sector, particularly in cities like New Orleans. As a result, the region has high rates of impoverishment despite relatively low levels of unemployment. For instance, at least half the population of New Orleans is under either the federal poverty line or the Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed (ALICE) threshold (a more wide-ranging measure that establishes location-specific incomes to afford basic necessities), yet only 4.4 percent of the population is unemployed (lower than the state unemployment rates of Nevada, Illinois, Oregon, and Delaware and on par with New York). The poor of the South are often the working poor.\n\nDespite Louisiana's low union density, the class resentment evidenced in our surveys has found expression in several recent organizing campaigns in New Orleans, particularly in the city's service industry. Workers at the city's Superdome, Smoothie King Center, and Ernest N. Morial Convention Center unionized with UNITE HERE Local 23 in the past few years and recently ratified their first contract. The union also recently organized Sodexo workers employed in the Loyola University of New Orleans cafeteria. Last year, nurses at the New Orleans University Medical Center organized with National Nurses United, the first-time nurses have organized a private hospital in Louisiana's history.\n\nThe South, if these efforts are any indication, is up for the taking. According to UnionElections.org, the number National Labor Relations Board election petitions filed across the region more than doubled between 2021 to 2023. The United Auto Workers (UAW) is on the offensive, identifying organizing the South as essential to protecting autoworkers across the country. This has made the region the site of some of the most electrifying recent developments in labor, including the UAW's victory at the Chattanooga Volkswagen plant earlier this year and their more recent victory at Spring Hill, Tennessee, electric vehicle battery manufacturer in September. We may not be in the midst of the sort of labor upsurge that swept the United States in the 1930s, but the growth of unionism over this period, and particularly its spread to the US South, is an exciting development.\n\nWhile many liberals will interpret November's election results as confirmation that they can write-off large swaths of the country, including the South, the actual electoral picture is more complicated. Even in reliably red Louisiana, where Trump won by 22 percentage points, voters overwhelmingly passed a referendum requiring federal money to be diverted to renewable energy and coastal rehabilitation. The city of New Orleans approved two referendums at roughly 80 percent, one requiring the construction of affordable housing, the other adding a \"workers bill of rights\" to the city charter, guaranteeing workers a fair wage, benefits, and the right to unionize.\n\nFrom the increase in labor mobilization across the region to the appeal of policies that improve the lives of workers and the poor, these developments indicate that the South has suffered from a lack of labor organizing, not class consciousness. Southerners are no less amenable to class politics than working-class constituencies elsewhere in the country. Any movement on the Left seeking a class realignment ignores the South and Southern workers at their own peril.\n\nCody R.

Marjorie Taylor Greene is in full celebration mode after Donald Trump's victory.\n\nAnd she's making declarations .\n\n\"The message that was shot across the bow is, guess what? The American people, the voters that voted for Trump overwhelmingly, they are MTG,\" the Georgia Republican said during an appearance on Real America's Voice . \"MTG is not radical or extreme - she's mainstream America.\"\n\nIt may surprise you to read this, but I don't totally disagree with Greene here. MAGA ideology - and all the racism, misogyny and other bigotry that comes with it - is mainstream, although I don't know what took her so long to realize this. The fact that millions of Americans voted for it in 2016 and 2020 was more than enough evidence of its popularity.\n\nBut what Greene seems to be getting at is an idea I've been thinking about - and questioning - a lot lately when it comes to policy. Fundamentally, it's an idea often promoted in media, and one that theoretically makes sense in a normal political context: that widespread support underscores a \"mandate.\" I understand why Greene, a MAGA loyalist, is making this argument. In fact, it's one that Trump himself made on election night, claiming that \"America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate.\"\n\nAmerican chattel slavery was immensely popular among the (white) people who had the legal right to weigh in on the matter.\n\nMy MSNBC colleague Steve Benen wrote a great piece on the problems with Trump's mandate claim, including the fact that many of the policies he ran on are quite unpopular. But to Greene's point, even if they were popular, anyone concerned about civil and human rights shouldn't acquiesce to an ideology or a political figure simply because a lot of people are supportive.\n\nAmerican chattel slavery was immensely popular among the (white) people who had the legal right to weigh in on the matter. Jim Crow policies and Nazism were also quite popular.\n\nAnd you might expect Greene, who h a s sa id she visited the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp when she was 19, to know that popularity isn't always a sign of prudent policy. The Auschwitz Museum's website even explains why - in a way that sounds quite familiar :\n\nThe popularity of the Nazis therefore stemmed from an accurate reading of the public mood; the adoption of a program that combined a rather dissonant assortment of nationalist, socialist, and anti-Semitic slogans; and the fact that, in Adolf Hitler, the party had a charismatic leader.\n\nSo Greene is right that MAGA has become mainstream. But history tells us that popularity, in and of itself, doesn't mean that an ideology must be accepted or respected as a set of principles to live by. Sometimes it's just a sign that toxic views have metastasized.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger. He previously wrote The ReidOut Blog.

Marjorie Taylor Greene says she will force a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson next week\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nWASHINGTON - Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said Wednesday she will force a vote next week to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, daring Democrats and Johnson's GOP allies to step in and save his job.\n\nWearing a red \"MAGA\" hat, Greene accused Johnson, R-La., of betraying the GOP and going against conservative wishes on government funding bills, passing Ukraine aid and reauthorizing the foreign intelligence surveillance program without new warrant requirements, among other issues.\n\n\"So next week, I am going to be calling this motion to vacate. Absolutely calling it,\" Greene said at a news conference outside the Capitol. \"I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker and have to go home to their primaries and have to run for Congress again.\"\n\nMinority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and his Democratic leadership team issued a rare statement Tuesday announcing that Democrats would band together to protect Johnson by voting to \"table,\" or kill, a motion by Greene to oust him to promote bipartisan cooperation and return to normalcy.\n\n\"House Democrats have aggressively pushed back against MAGA extremism. We will continue to do just that. At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction,\" the Democratic leaders said in their statement Tuesday.\n\n\"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed,\" they said.\n\nEven some of Johnson's other conservative critics have opposed Greene's push to depose Johnson and say it will go nowhere . She has just two co-sponsors.\n\nMoments after Greene's news conference, Johnson released a terse statement: \"This motion is wrong for the Republican Conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country.\"\n\nGreene has been threatening to move against Johnson for months, warning him not to pass emergency foreign aid for Ukraine while thousands of migrants cross the southern border . But last month, Johnson, after negotiations with the White House, pushed through a $95 billion national security package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, along with a potential ban on the social media app TikTok. President Joe Biden quickly signed it into law.\n\n\"Now we have Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats coming out, embracing Mike Johnson with a warm hug and a big, wet, sloppy kiss. And they are ready - they have endorsed him, they are ready to support him as speaker,\" Greene said. \"They want to keep it going, keep the band together. Why? Because Mike Johnson is giving them everything they want.\"\n\nGreene labeled Johnson a member of the \"uniparty,\" a term hard-right Republicans use to disparage Republicans who work with Democrats to pass bipartisan measures. Behind Greene was a large poster of a photo of Johnson and Jeffries, with Jeffries passing the speaker's gavel to Johnson. A hat sat on top of the poster with the acronym \"MUGA,\" which Greene said stands for \"Make Ukraine Great Again.\"\n\nThe dynamic was much different with Johnson's predecessor as speaker, Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Last fall, Democrats decided to join with just eight House conservatives to make McCarthy the first speaker in history to be removed by a vote in the middle of the congressional term.\n\nHad Democrats decided to do the same thing this time, Greene would have had enough GOP support to topple Johnson given the GOP's razor-thin, two-seat advantage. Democrats' decision to stand by Johnson undermines Greene's efforts while at the same time giving her more political ammunition against Johnson and his allies.\n\nBoth Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., have signed on to Greene's motion. On Wednesday, Massie stood next to Greene and defended her from charges that she wasn't behaving like a serious lawmaker.\n\n\"She's the most serious representative up here,\" Massie said.\n\nAsked by NBC News whom she has in mind to replace Johnson as speaker, Greene replied: \"I'm not naming names, but I think we have people that are capable.\"\n\n\"Anybody that's willing to fight for our agenda. Anyone that refuses to share the power with Hakeem Jeffries,\" she said.\n\nI have covered Capitol Hill for the past 15 years and joined NBC News as a senior congressional reporter in 2022.

This is, after all, the first Congress to ever impeach a sitting Cabinet secretary without cause - before also launching an impeachment inquiry against a sitting president without cause.\n\nIt was also a Congress in which House Republicans introduced impeachment resolutions targeting Vice President Kamala Harris, Attorney General Merrick Garland, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and FBI Director Chris Wray, among others.\n\nBut there was always one name on the GOP's impeachment list that stood out as odd, not just because he hadn't done anything wrong, but also because his name was unknown to most Americans: Matthew Graves.\n\nGraves may have been the least recognized of the Republican Party's impeachment targets, but in some far-right circles, the lawyer was very important, indeed: He was the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, which put him in a position of prosecuting criminal cases against accused Jan. 6 defendants. It's precisely why Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia - and four other GOP lawmakers - introduced an impeachment resolution going after the federal prosecutor .\n\nNot surprisingly, the crusade against Graves was largely ignored, and it's poised to become a moot point: Like most of the Biden administration's U.S. attorneys, Graves is poised to step down from his position after more than three years on the job.\n\nBut the prosecutor's most rabid Capitol Hill critic isn't prepared to let her preoccupation go. Earlier this week, Greene appeared on a conservative media outlet called Real America's Voice and declared , \"[Graves resigned], but this is not the end for him. Because we are about to take over and we're going to be in charge, and he should pay for what he's done to [Jan. 6 criminal defendants.]\" The Georgian added :\n\nHe doesn't get to resign and run away. He should be held accountable for the absolute misery and lives that have been destroyed from these Jan. 6 defendants and their families. We're talking about marriages have been destroyed, families have been destroyed, careers have been destroyed, and these people have spent time - years now - in prison.\n\nIn other words, to hear the GOP congresswoman tell it, a federal prosecutor should be punished for prosecuting criminals, some of whom were found to have committed violent crimes, and many of whom pleaded guilty.\n\nIn a news release issued earlier this week, the Justice Department noted, \"Because politically motivated violence and destruction rip at the fabric of our society, Mr. Graves made federally prosecuting such crimes a priority.\" Oddly enough, it's also why Greene wants to go after him.\n\nIt's too soon to say with confidence what, if anything, House Republicans intend to do with regard to Graves in the new Congress, and it's at least possible that Greene's interest won't amount to much of anything. After all, her impeachment resolution was ignored.\n\nBut amid talk of GOP enemies lists and pre-emptive White House pardons, it's worth keeping Graves' name in mind in the coming weeks and months.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., is struggling to find allies in her push to overthrow Speaker Mike Johnson after he put Ukraine funding to a vote , with many fellow hard-right Republicans saying they oppose her cause after a weeklong recess.\n\n\"I oppose a motion to vacate at the current time,\" said Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who led the \"motion to vacate\" that ousted Kevin McCarthy as speaker and has been critical of Johnson, R-La.\n\n\"I think that's pretty much not gonna happen. We're at too much of a slim majority,\" added another Florida Republican, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, who has been highly critical of Johnson but is worried Democrats could end up in the majority after another chaotic coup.\n\n\"I don't support what he's doing; he went back on his word to us,\" she said of Johnson. \"However, I'm not going to risk giving the gavel to a Democrat.\"\n\nGaetz and Luna weren't alone. Numerous conservative lawmakers who have blasted the recent Johnson-blessed spending bills and foreign aid package said as the House returned from a weeklong recess that they aren't ready to support Greene's push to remove Johnson. They cited a number of reasons: They worry it would disrupt GOP unity ahead of the election, they fear there isn't a better replacement, they believe it'd fail due to a thinning majority, and some say the time isn't right.\n\n\"I'm not hearing a lot of critical mass for it,\" said Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., who added that he doesn't expect the motion to come to the floor. \"I'm not hearing any chatter.\"\n\nAsked if he'd vote to remove Johnson as he did McCarthy, Biggs told reporters on Monday: \"I won't answer a hypothetical. What I've said is: It's not the time. Although I'm profoundly frustrated, disappointed and disgruntled, it's not the time.\"\n\nHe echoed Luna's worries that the House might end up electing a Democrat as speaker because Republicans are on the brink of a \"one-vote majority\" and if \"one person is out sick,\" they could end up being in the minority that day.\n\nRep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., said the motion would fail if it came up.\n\n\"I've left the door open, but, one I don't think it's good timing. Two, if it was triggered, I don't think it would pass,\" he said. \"I think that the Democrats would keep Speaker Johnson. I think they would save him. So I don't think it would pass. And furthermore, even if it did pass, I don't have much confidence with the conference that we have that we could get a more conservative speaker for the American people.\"\n\nCrane said he doesn't expect it to come to a vote, though he hadn't heard that directly from Greene. \"It's the little rumor mill,\" he said. \"I have not talked to Marjorie about this.\"\n\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said he's deeply frustrated by the speaker's actions. \"You just funded Ukraine. You just funded Israel. You just funded Hamas while you were funding Israel,\" he said, referring to humanitarian aid for Gaza civilians. \"You just funded a $1.7 trillion massive expenditure of government. You gave up all leverage that you have to deal with the border. So now we've got to get busy trying to convince people to elect us so we can do better next year.\"\n\nStill, Roy said he's more focused on the upcoming issues like passing a farm bill and the next round of government funding in October.\n\n\"We've been home, we've been talking to constituents. My constituents fully agree with my concerns, and frankly, made it known that they're angry about it,\" Roy said. \"They also want us to unify and beat Democrats. So we've got to do those two things. I think we can unify and beat Democrats with a clear agenda. And I think that's what we got to focus on right now.\"\n\nRepublicans in competitive districts are eager to put the issue to rest and focus on the upcoming election.\n\n\"If this is real, it's ridiculous, absurd and it undermines the institution and our work. If it's a bluff, it's a horrific abuse and waste of time,\" said Rep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y. \"And either way, put it to bed. Let's move on.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the top three House Democrats, led by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., issued an extraordinary joint statement Tuesday vowing that they would vote to save Johnson if Greene brought up her motion, saying \"the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction.\"\n\n\"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed.\"\n\nGreene missed votes on Monday, avoiding a pack of reporters searching for her, and her office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the Democrats' statement. But she hasn't taken the threat of ousting Johnson off the table.\n\n\"Johnson will do whatever Biden/Schumer want in order to keep the Speaker's gavel in his hand, but he has completely sold out the Republican voters who gave us the majority,\" Greene wrote on X .\n\n\"His days as Speaker are numbered,\" she continued.\n\nOnly two conservative colleagues - Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. - have co-sponsored her resolution. But neither gave clear answers about whether a vacate vote would happen soon.\n\n\"My understanding is Democrats are going to cover for him, so we'll play the psychological game,\" Gosar told NBC News, adding of Johnson's future: \"The seeds have been sown.\"\n\nMassie also had no updates when asked if or when it would come up.\n\n\"We're not going to talk about it right now,\" he said, adding that he's talked to constituents and \"I haven't gotten any blowback.\"\n\nBut Massie held his ground that Johnson should go.\n\n\"He's not inspiring anybody to give us the majority if he's going to be sharing the majority with Democrats,\" he said, accusing Johnson of deploying \"weapons of mass distraction\" from his policies, like his visit to Columbia to chastise campus protests.\n\nMassie said Trump's lukewarm support for Johnson is revealing.\n\n\"Sometimes by faintly praising somebody, you can kind of doom them. And I haven't seen a full-throated defense of Mike Johnson because, ultimately, Trump doesn't like a loser. And he's, I think he's worried about Mike Johnson and tying his future to that. And it would be a bad move to even campaign with him,\" the Kentucky Republican said.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is only going to drag Trump down.\"\n\nI'm a reporter for NBC News covering Capitol Hill, elections and the intersection of politics and public policy in Washington.

Greene rants about 'bravery' of anti-abortion protesters as GOP tries to win back women\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Ja'han Jones\n\nEarly voting began in Georgia on Tuesday with a historic number of early ballots cast . In the home stretch of election season, it's safe to say campaigns are making their final pitch to voters. So it's notable that the Trump campaign chose as its introductory speaker at Trump's rally there ... Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nFrom a strictly political standpoint, it seems unwise for the Trump campaign to platform the fringe-iest of MAGA only weeks out from Election Day. Greene's speech was chock-full of conspiracy theories, including that Covid-19 is a \"man-made virus that came from Wuhan, China, that the Democrats used against you\" (at 3:30 in the video below) and that FEMA has discriminated against Republicans in doling out aid following Hurricanes Helene and Milton (at 7:38).\n\nBut it was her remarks about reproductive freedom that struck me as particularly counterproductive to Trump and the MAGA movement's electoral hopes.\n\nA September report from The 19th suggests many Georgians have abortion on their minds as they prepare to cast ballots, and Trump and Vance have been trying, however haplessly , to woo women voters. Part of that effort has involved Vance obscuring his past anti-abortion positions and Trump downplaying his role in shaping the Supreme Court that opened the door to the abortion bans now gripping states across the country.\n\nIt's against that background that Greene told Georgians:\n\nPro-life protesters - the bravest people in the country that stand in front of an abortion clinic praying for these women to save their baby - to keep their baby. To be a mother. The greatest blessing that God has bestowed on women is motherhood. And I'm here to tell you today: An abortion is not reproductive rights. It is murder, and it's killing a baby. They lie to women - oh, they lie to women. And it's disgusting. But these pro-life protesters are in prison today because they prayed for these women and they prayed for these babies.\n\nIt's not clear exactly which anti-abortion activists Greene was referring to. In the past, she's been accused of lying repeatedly about an anti-abortion activist who invaded and blockaded an abortion clinic in 2020. That activist, Lauren Handy, was discovered to have taken fetuses illegally from a clinic to keep at her home, for which she received a five-year prison sentence in May . In a separate case, four anti-abortion activists in Tennessee received varying sentences in July for their roles in a 2021 blockade of an abortion clinic.\n\nBut Greene's closing message to Georgia voters - and to women in particular - was that motherhood is \"greatest blessing that God has bestowed on women,\" that abortion is always and only \"murder,\" and that vigilantes who take it upon themselves to stop women from exercising their reproductive freedom are \"the bravest in the country.\" That sure doesn't seem like the kind of centrist messaging likely to assuage voters' concerns about the MAGA movement's archconservative policy goals.\n\nWhile the GOP campaign has seemingly homed in on two goals -  soften its image with women and appear less extreme on  abortion - Greene's extremism undermines both of those goals. I hope Georgia voters were listening.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger. He previously wrote The ReidOut Blog. He is a futurist and multimedia producer focused on culture and politics.

Marjorie Taylor Greene criticized PBS for featuring a drag queen named Lil Miss Hot Mess in its children's programming.\n\nBy Talya Minsberg\n\nIn her opening remarks at Wednesday's hearing on public media, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene accused PBS of using \"taxpayer funds to push some of the most radical left positions like featuring a drag queen on the show.\"\n\nThe Republican from Georgia pointed at a photo of Lil Miss Hot Mess, a drag queen, calling her a \"monster.\"\n\nIt was a line of attack that was somewhat expected by the chief executives of the biggest media networks in the United States. Ms. Greene had shared a video on social media before the hearing that included a clip from a \"PBS NewsHour\" segment about drag queens.\n\nBut Lil Miss Hot Mess was never featured on PBS's children's programming, according to Paula Kerger, the chief executive of PBS who testified on Wednesday. Instead, she was featured in a project from the WNET Group, the parent company of New York's public television stations, in conjunction with the New York City Department of Education.\n\n\"The drag queen was actually not on any of our kids' shows,\" Ms. Kerger responded when Representative William Timmons, Republican of South Carolina, asked her if she thought it was \"inappropriate to put the drag queen on the kids' show.\"\n\nThe image the chairwoman showed, Ms. Kerger said, was from a digital segment.\n\nThe segment, which is part of a YouTube video series called \"Let's Learn,\" now opens with a statement, dated May 24, 2021, that notes the partnership between the WNET group and the New York City Department of Education. The statement also says that the series was not funded or distributed by PBS.\n\n\"It was not for PBS,\" Ms. Kerger said in response to Mr. Timmons. The video was mistakenly put on our website by our New York City station, she said, but it was not intended for a national distribution, nor was it ever aired on PBS.\n\nIn her closing statement, Ms. Greene showed a video of Lil Miss Hot Mess reading her book, \"The Hips on the Drag Queen Go Swish, Swish, Swish.\"\n\n\"That's repulsive, that's not what children ages 3 to 8 should ever be watching,\" she said.\n\nTalya Minsberg is a Times reporter covering breaking and developing news.\n\nAdvertisement"

Trump's most loyal allies will occupy prominent posts next year.\n\nRepresentative James Comer of Kentucky, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, is planning to create a new subcommittee to partner with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to \"eliminate government waste.\" The committee, which has yet to be created, will work with the new Department of Government Efficiency, known as \"DOGE,\" and leading Republicans have agreed to allow Ms. Greene to serve as its chairwoman.\n\nRepublicans said the committee would be charged with investigating waste and corruption within the federal government.\n\nEven though she is not yet the chairwoman of a committee that does not yet exist, Ms. Greene's new position appeared to be a done deal, with top Republicans confirming it would be hers to lead when the new Congress convenes in January.\n\n\"I'm excited to chair this new subcommittee designed to work hand in hand with President Trump, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and the entire DOGE team,\" Ms. Greene said in a statement on Thursday. \"We will identify and investigate the waste, corruption and absolutely useless parts of our federal government.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Is Not as Powerful as She Thinks She Is\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nDavid French\n\nBy David French\n\nOpinion Columnist\n\nIn an interview last week , NewsNation's Blake Burman asked Speaker Mike Johnson about Marjorie Taylor Greene, and before Burman could finish his question, Johnson responded with classic Southern scorn. \"Bless her heart,\" he said, and then he told Burman that Greene wasn't proving to be a serious lawmaker and that he didn't spend a lot of time thinking about her.\n\nStrangely enough, Johnson's dismissal of Greene - on the eve of her potential effort to oust him from the office he won in October - spoke as loudly as his decision to put a vote for Ukraine aid on the floor in the first place. In spite of the Republican Party's narrow majority in the House and the constant threat of a motion to vacate the chair, he will not let MAGA's most extreme lawmaker run the place.\n\nTo understand the significance of this moment, it's necessary to understand the changing culture of the MAGAfied Republican Party. After eight years of Donald Trump's dominance, we know the fate of any Republican politician who directly challenges him - the confrontation typically ends his or her political career in the most miserable way possible, with dissenters chased out of office amid a hail of threats and insults. Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney are but a few of the many Republicans who dared to defy Trump and paid a high political price.\n\nBut there's an open question: Does the MAGA movement have the same control over the Republican Party when Trump isn't directly in the fray? Can it use the same tactics to impose party discipline and end political careers? If the likes of Greene or Steve Bannon or Matt Gaetz or Charlie Kirk can wield the same power, then the transformation of the party will be complete. It won't be simply in thrall to Trump; it will be in thrall to his imitators and heirs and perhaps lost to the reactionary right for a generation or more.\n\nI don't want to overstate the case, but Johnson's stand - together with the Democrats' response - gives me hope. Consider the chain of events. On April 12, Johnson appeared at Mar-a-Lago and received enough of a blessing from Trump to make it clear that Trump didn't want him removed. Days before a vote on Ukraine aid that directly defied the MAGA movement, Trump said Johnson was doing a \"very good job.\"\n\nDays later, Johnson got aid to Ukraine passed with more Democratic votes than Republican - a violation of the so-called Hastert Rule , an informal practice that says the speaker shouldn't bring a vote unless the measure is supported by a majority within his own party. Greene and the rest of MAGA exploded, especially when Democratic lawmakers waved Ukrainian flags on the House floor. Greene vowed to force a vote on her motion to end Johnson's speakership. She filed the motion in March as a \"warning\" to Johnson, and now she's following through - directly testing her ability to transform the House.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Again.\n\nIt's not simply that Ms. Greene has taken such a Putin-pleasing approach to Russia's war in Ukraine (Ukrainian Nazis? Really?) that the term \"useful idiot\" feels unavoidable. She has, in very little time, undermined the influence of her party's entire right flank, driving less unhinged Republicans - most notably the House speaker, Mike Johnson - to brush back her and her ilk like the poo-flinging chaos monkeys they are.\n\nJust look at what has come to pass in the House in the past several days: Mr. Johnson, a proud ultraconservative, pushed through a $95 billion foreign aid package , including $60 billion for Ukraine, with more Democratic votes than Republican ones. He is now counting on Democrats to save him from the Greene-led extremists' plan to defenestrate him and install yet another Republican as speaker. There is much buzz about the emergence of a bipartisan governing coalition in the House, albeit one born of desperation. Squint hard, and Congress almost looks to be functioning as intended, with a majority of members coming together to advance vital legislation.

All in good time, she said , insisting she felt moved to let her colleagues first \"go home and hear from their constituents\" over this week's House recess. \"I said from the beginning I'm going to be responsible with this,\" she said, in what may be her most laughable line in weeks - a high bar for the House member known for her keen insights on Jewish space lasers.\n\nSeriously, how responsible did Ms. Greene look Sunday on Fox News, as she ducked Maria Bartiromo's questions about her plans for ousting Mr. Johnson? (Short answer: She has no plan.) Ms. Bartiromo noted that Ms. Greene was drawing widespread criticism for \"creating drama\" and that there was concern she was making Republicans look like a bunch of squabbling incompetents unfit to run a neighborhood book club. (Those may not have been the host's exact words.) Ms. Greene's crackerjack defense was to insist, \"The people criticizing me are not the American people.\" The American people \"are outraged, and what they're saying is they don't want to vote for Republicans anymore,\" she asserted, adding that \"the Republican Party in charge right now, it's no different than the Democrat Party.\"\n\nI may be off base here, Marjo, but trashing your colleagues as no better than the other side in a high-stakes election year is not the best way to win them over to your kamikaze mission.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

He will face a maximum possible penalty of five years in prison when he is sentenced on Nov. 7.\n\n\"Threatening to kill a public official is reprehensible,\" Ryan K. Buchanan , the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, said in a statement. \"Our office will not tolerate any form of violence, threats or intimidation against public officials.\"\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Cirillo's lawyer, Allison Dawson, said that Mr. Cirillo had struggled with mental health issues and was not on his prescribed medication at the time of the incident.\n\nMs. Greene's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.\n\nAfter Mr. Cirillo was arrested, Ms. Greene said in a statement to Atlanta News First : \"Threats to murder elected officials should never be tolerated.\"\n\nDuring his phone calls to Ms. Greene's office, the F.B.I. said, Mr. Cirillo said that he was focusing on Ms. Greene through the sight of a sniper rifle. He also threatened to kill her staff members who picked up the two calls, which he made on Nov. 8 at 1:33 p.m. and 5:36 p.m., the F.B.I. said.\n\nThe next day, when the F.B.I. showed up at Mr. Cirillo's home by tracking his phone number, Mr. Cirillo admitted to making the calls, said he had made them to \"get attention\" and added that he had called \"multiple other people as well including other members of Congress,\" court records state. It is not clear who else received Mr. Cirillo's calls.\n\nMr. Cirillo's guilty plea is the latest event in a recent pattern of threats toward political figures. Last week, a man was charged with threatening to assault and kill federal officials, judges and state employees across several states, including people involved in the prosecution of former President Donald J. Trump.\n\nIn California, some elected officials said they were rethinking public office in light of increasing harassment.\n\nKirsten Noyes contributed research.\n\nHank Sanders is a Times reporter and a member of the 2024-25 Times Fellowship class, a program for journalists early in their careers.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "The Fizzled Rebellion of Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Michelle Cottle\n\nOpinion Writer\n\nUpdate : On Wednesday, Marjorie Taylor Greene brought up a motion to remove Johnson from the speaker's job. Republicans and Democrats joined together to save his position, and the motion was defeated on a 359-to-43 vote.\n\nLet's just come right out and say what pretty much everyone keeping an eye on Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to blackmail House Speaker Mike Johnson is now thinking: Way to keep screwing this up, congresswoman!\n\nAfter huddling for several hours in two days of meetings with Greene this week to discuss her elongated crusade to oust him, the speaker emerged unscathed Tuesday afternoon, apparently without having committed to any ridiculous concessions. And really, why would he?\n\nThere was no way Johnson was going to get booted by Greene and her wee band of bomb throwers over the Ukraine funding bill. A majority of House Republicans are tired of her antics, and the Democrats were prepared to step in and save the speaker in the unlikely event he found himself in real danger from the wingers.\n\nNot that there was a snowball's chance of that happening once the report started circulating that Donald Trump had basically told his Georgia minion to stand down . The MAGA king does not respond well to displays of disobedience.\n\nAnd so Greene and her wingman, Thomas Massie, were reduced to gas-bagging on the steps of the Capitol after their meetings with Johnson, insisting that this showdown isn't over. Really! They mean it! Massie boldly proclaimed that the rebel forces will be watching to make sure the speaker makes \"hourly\" progress on the sprinkling of demands put before him.\n\nI could bore you with what some of those demands are, but why bother? If Johnson is feeling indulgent, he can throw the rebels a bone or two. Assuming it won't cause him too much trouble. But it's not as if they have the upper hand - or much of any hand, really. At this point, they are less like blackmailers threatening a victim than like exhausted preschoolers begging for attention from their teacher.\n\nIndeed, what Greene & Co. seem to need more than anything is a timeout, followed by a nice, long nap.\n\nMichelle Cottle writes about national politics for Opinion and is a host of the podcast \"Matter of Opinion.\" She has covered Washington and politics since the Clinton administration. @ mcottle\n\nAdvertisement"

She accused him of fecklessly advancing President Biden's agenda and wasting opportunities to advance G.O.P. priorities.\n\nMs. Greene warned her colleagues that they risked falling out of touch with their voters if they continued to accept what she called \"a complete and total surrender\" by Republicans under Mr. Johnson.\n\nThe letter left little doubt that Ms. Greene, who filed a resolution last month calling for Mr. Johnson's removal but said it was merely \"a warning,\" intends to follow through on her threat to call a vote on unseating him.\n\n\"If these actions by the leader of our conference continue, then we are not a Republican Party - we are a uniparty that is hellbent on remaining on the path of self-inflicted destruction,\" she wrote. \"I will neither support nor take part in any of that, and neither will the people we represent.\"\n\nHer intensified threat came at a tricky time for Mr. Johnson, who has said he will soon bring up an emergency national security spending package that includes aid to Ukraine, something that has enraged the far right. He is also planning to hold a set of tough votes this week on legislation to renew a warrantless surveillance program that many in his party oppose.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Stephen Voss for The New York Times\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Robert Draper\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of investigations,\" Marjorie Taylor Greene said, describing what she anticipates if the Republicans regain the House majority this November. \"I've talked with a lot of members about this.\"\n\nIt was early September, two months before the midterm elections, and Greene, the first-term congresswoman from Georgia, was sitting in a restaurant in Alpharetta, an affluent suburb of greater metropolitan Atlanta. Among the fellow Republicans with whom Greene said she had been speaking about these investigations was the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy. Just a couple of weeks later, on Sept. 23, Greene sat directly behind McCarthy in a manufacturing facility in Monongahela, Pa., as he publicly previewed what a House Republican majority's legislative agenda would look like. Among the topics she and her colleagues have discussed is the prospect of impeaching President Joe Biden, a pursuit Greene has advocated literally since the day after Biden took office, when she filed articles of impeachment accusing Obama's vice president of having abused his power to benefit his son Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine. \"My style would be a lot more aggressive, of course,\" she told me, referring to McCarthy. \"For him, I think the evidence needs to be there. But I think people underestimate him, in thinking he wouldn't do it.\"\n\nIn Greene's view, a Speaker McCarthy would have little choice but to adopt Greene's \"a lot more aggressive\" approach toward punishing Biden and his fellow Democrats for what she sees as their policy derelictions and for conducting a \"witch hunt\" against former President Trump. \"I think that to be the best speaker of the House and to please the base, he's going to give me a lot of power and a lot of leeway,\" she predicted in a flat, unemotional voice. \"And if he doesn't, they're going to be very unhappy about it. I think that's the best way to read that. And that's not in any way a threat at all. I just think that's reality.\"\n\nThough the 48-year-old self-described \"Christian nationalist\" possesses a flair for extreme bombast equal to that of her political role model Trump, Greene's assessment of her current standing within the Republican Party - owing to the devotion accorded her by the party's MAGA base - would seem to be entirely accurate.\n\nOver the past two years, Greene has gone from the far-right fringe of the G.O.P. ever closer to its establishment center without changing any of her own beliefs; if anything, she has continued to find more extreme ways to express them. When she entered electoral politics in 2019, she had spent much of her adult life as a co-owner, with her husband, of her family's construction company. (Her husband, Perry Greene, recently filed for divorce.)\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Yet that is exactly what happened on Thursday during a meeting of the House Oversight Committee .\n\nDuring a discussion about whether Attorney General Merrick B. Garland should be held in contempt of Congress, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, told Representative Jasmine Crockett, a Democrat from Texas, \"I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading.\"\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York whose own signature red lipstick has become something of an online lightning rod, then leaped to Ms. Crockett's defense.\n\n\"How dare you attack the physical appearance of another person,\" she said.\n\nFurther name-calling ensued , culminating in Ms. Crockett's covertly returning the insult by asking the chair, James R. Comer, \"If someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody's bleach blond, bad-built butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct?\" (That description being a not-entirely-implicit reference to Ms. Greene.)\n\nAll in all, not a pretty moment.\n\nAs much as anything, however, the makeup vs. body image brouhaha reflects not just the way Capitol norms have changed over the last six years, but the way physical appearances have become weaponized against all genders since Donald J. Trump first took office, bringing with him his penchant for costumery, casting and playground insults.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Would Like to Fade Into the Bushes Now\n\nUpdate, May 8, 2024, at 4:53 p.m.: Shortly after this article was published, Greene brought to the floor her resolution to oust Johnson from the speakership. The attempt failed when the House voted 359-43 to table the resolution.\n\nThis was supposed to be the week in which Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had pledged to hold a snap vote on Speaker Mike Johnson's leadership, the culmination of a threat months in the making. She wouldn't have succeeded in ousting him, after Democrats had announced they'd provide the votes to save Johnson. But, at least in her head, she would have made some sort of point.\n\nBut Greene and her army of two other people have backed off for now, having secured a few hours of chit-chat time with Johnson as an acceptable alternative to a botched execution. Following her second meeting with Johnson in as many days on Tuesday, Greene told reporters that \"the ball is in Mike Johnson's court\" to act on her several \"suggestions\" she proposed to him. She offered no timeline on when she expected a response.\n\n\"That's up to Mike Johnson, and it can't drag out,\" she said. \"These are things that need to be done.\"\n\nThese meetings were called at Greene's request, and if Johnson is feeling any distress, he's not displaying it publicly. He called their conversations \"productive,\" downplaying them as run-of-the-mill talks he'd have with members at any time. \"I heard Marjorie and Thomas [Massie]'s ideas, just like I have every day for the last six months heard others.\" To the extent he was firm with them, though, he said this: \"It's not a negotiation.\"\n\nIndeed, the only one really dragging things out is Greene, not Johnson.\n\nAfter Johnson passed a government-funding bill disliked by Greene (and plenty of other conservatives, albeit those with more limited delusions of grandeur) in March, she warned him that his speakership was on the line. This was effectively a warning to not put Ukraine funding up for a vote next. Johnson did it anyway.\n\nBut the cavalry never arrived for Greene when Congress returned from recess last week. While plenty of conservatives were irate at Johnson for passing bipartisan bills on government funding, surveillance, and Ukraine, their prevailing impulse-with most meaningful legislative work done for the year-was just to get through November and hash out their leadership drama afterward. The party's presidential nominee, meanwhile, had no appetite for another House Republican meltdown to embarrass the party while his name is on the ballot. Greene misunderstood both how exhausted her fellow Republicans were with these shenanigans, and how quickly \"governing\" season had pivoted to campaign season following the Ukraine vote. The previous 18 months were for beating up on one another. The next six months are for beating up on leftist extravagances.\n\nSince Greene announced that she would force the vote on Johnson's speakership this week, she has spent most of her time looking for a way to back out, and to stay in Trump's good graces, while saving face. And so she brought to her meeting with Johnson a quartet of demands for the speaker : no more money for Ukraine; defunding special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into Donald Trump; only putting bills up for a vote if they have support of a majority of the majority (the unfortunately named \"Hastert rule\"); and a promise to enact \"a 1 percent across-the-board spending cut as part of stopgap funding legislation if the 12 annual appropriations bills aren't enacted by the Sept. 30 deadline .\"\n\nTo just get through 2024, Johnson could agree to the Ukraine and \"Hastert rule\" provisions without any real consequences. Ukraine assistance is done for the year, and there aren't significant, must-pass bills with limited Republican support on the horizon. The other two provisions-on \"defunding\" Jack Smith and enacting a blanket spending cut-have zero Democratic support and, if insisted upon at the next government funding deadline, could cause government shutdowns, for which Republicans would be blamed, a month before the election.\n\nThat said, rather than giving an inch, there's good reason for Johnson to just stand firm here and dare Greene to do something about it. Even if he were able to give her some things here, some things there, giving her anything would reinforce an awful, recurring trend of the 118 th Congress that needs to end: that any couple of members can blackmail the speaker into sending the party down a new, risky, and ultimately self-defeating strategic course . And there's no better time for Johnson to end it than during this brief window when Democrats are willing to bail him out.\n\nThe only question for Greene now is how she chooses to claim victory in defeat. She could take some words that Johnson says in a press conference and insist that those words were a hard-fought concession. She could turn her attention to an entirely new matter and wait for people to forget how she caved. She could still force the vote on Johnson's speakership, lose, fall out of favor with Trump for a few months, and then work her way back up. Or she could just say, \"The numbers weren't there; we'll get him in the next Congress,\" get made fun of for a few days, and move on with her life.\n\nMike Johnson, meanwhile, need only roll his eyes.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Slate's guide to the most important figures in politics this week.\n\nWelcome to this week's edition of the Surge, whose capacity for absorbing cringe expanded when Sen. Richard Blumenthal made a Taylor Swift pun .\n\nThis week, we check in on Kevin McCarthy's efforts to boot a few Democrats off committees, which are running into trouble in one case. (In Adam Schiff's case, though, it's money in the bank.) George Santos is either attempting a cunning PR strategy of laughing at himself or succumbing to an anxiety spiral, another former vice president was busted keeping classified docs as bathroom reading material, and Senate Democrats responded with a resounding \"tra-la-la\" to questions about their Arizona Senate endorsement.\n\nLet us begin, though, with a look at the ambitions of Kevin McCarthy's bestest friend in the whole wide world.\n\nBy Jim Newell\n\nThe New York Times this week had a long look at the mutually beneficial relationship that developed between Reps. Kevin McCarthy and Marjorie Taylor Greene over the past two years, which has culminated in the former's ascent to the speakership and the latter's placement on the Oversight and Homeland Security committees. (As if those committees wouldn't get her enough TV time, she was also just appointed to the new subcommittee examining the COVID response.) Greene has given McCarthy political cover with the far right, and he's mainstreamed her within the House. This effort to rebrand Greene as \"a politician who can stand astride the divide between the party's hard-liners and its establishment wing,\" as NBC News reported , was not an accident, and according to one of its sources, her \"whole vision is to be vice president.\" And really, who could you argue is better positioned for the nod right now? If Trump's the nominee, he's not going to go with a safe pick again. He'd certainly prefer the die-hard loyalist who's become an influential player in congressional Republican politics and is all over his TV set. So, yet again, we say to Kevin McCarthy: Hope it was worth it.\n\nArizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego made good on a long-simmering potential candidacy this week, announcing his 2024 bid for the Senate seat currently held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. She hasn't announced her 2024 plans yet, but she did announce in December that she would become an independent. The immediate effect of Gallego's move was to make every last Democratic senator uncomfortable. On the leadership level, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chairman Gary Peters are split between their twin directives of supporting Democratic-caucusing incumbents and actual Democrats in Senate races. But the discomfort isn't just at the top. For the next two years, all members of the Senate Democratic Caucus would like to have Sinema's vote, and appearing to shove her out before she announces any plans of her own wouldn't go over well. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders would say only that endorsing Gallego was \"something we would certainly look into.\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that it was \"too early\" to make any decisions. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, meanwhile, said, \"I suspect I'd endorse my colleague.\" What would make life easier for everyone is for Sinema to simply announce that she won't seek another term. But her colleagues know they can't rush the decision.\n\nSpeaker Kevin McCarthy made good on his pledge not to seat Reps. Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff on the Intelligence Committee this week, in a letter to Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries that says -emphasis his-\" Integrity matters more. \" (That's one way to justify a revenge play against a couple of Democrats that Fox News hates.) Swalwell will have to cool his heels on the Judiciary and Homeland Security committees for at least another couple of years, until Democrats have another shot at taking the House. Schiff will be on the Judiciary Committee. But also , Schiff this week launched a much-anticipated run for Senate in 2024, a step he was likely to take whether or not he stayed on Intel. Frankly, there's not much more he could've hoped for ahead of a Democratic Senate primary than having mean old McCarthy decide that he was too dangerous to serve on a committee. Schiff already represents rich people in Los Angeles and has $20 million in his campaign account . And now he gets to send out fundraising emails to #ResistanceNation about how Republicans kicked him off his committee because he was too close to the truth ? In other words: He will not lack for resources. And yet his fellow SoCal House-ejector, Katie Porter, may still have more.\n\nThe third GOP archvillain that McCarthy planned to kick off a committee was Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, from Foreign Affairs, because of what McCarthy described as \"repeated antisemitic and anti-American remarks.\" (Omar believes that she's being punished for being Muslim, because punishing Muslims plays well in GOP politics.) But because Foreign Affairs is a standing committee, and not a select committee, whose members are appointed by party leaders, removing Omar from it requires a House vote. And it became clear this week that McCarthy may have a math problem here. Two GOP members, Reps. Victoria Spartz and Nancy Mace, said they would not vote to remove Omar from Foreign Affairs, and others aren't comfortable with it either. McCarthy was already working with tight margins and doesn't have the vote of Florida Rep. Greg Steube for the next several weeks as he recovers at home from his fall off a ladder . There's a certain point at which McCarthy has to decide how much arm-twisting energy he wants to spend on an act of spite.\n\nThe award for Committee Assignment of the Year, though, would have to go to Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie. The Republican, nicknamed Mr. No over the years for his unwillingness to go with the flow, was appointed to the House Rules Committee, a panel whose slots are typically reserved for only the most loyal of leadership allies. The appointment of Massie, along with South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman and Texas Rep. Chip Roy, to the Rules Committee-which governs which legislation comes to the floor for a vote, and under what conditions-will make for an interesting couple of years on a committee that typically just accedes to the speaker's wishes. We could see a lot more \"open rules\" during consideration of legislation, when any member can offer amendments from the House floor. There was a taste of that this week, when a short bill to increase oil and gas production on federal lands took two days to pass on the floor, after dozens and dozens of amendment votes were considered. (The bill still passed, along mostly party lines.) It was a wonderful experiment. We'll see how long this lasts before members tire of it.\n\nOur good friend from Long Island can't defend himself on the merits of how he fabricated a persona in order to win a seat in Congress. What he can do to prolong his terminal stay in Washington is to play along with his celebrity, and make himself seem in on the joke. This week, he attempted a time-tested means of defusing the tension with the press horde staking out his office: giving them free food-Dunkin' Donuts, Chick-fil-A, and cupcakes-each day. He also accepted an invitation to hang out \"with a mix of Hill staff, reporters, lobbyists and at least one former member\" at a D.C. bar, where he quite nearly sang karaoke. We'd rate the ability of this complete fraud to lighten coverage of the very serious allegations against him by charming D.C. society through ironic stunts as ... disturbingly likely to work. Until he either quits, loses a primary or general election, or is indicted, at least.\n\nThis week, we learned that former Vice President Mike Pence had some classified documents at his house too. In a taped-up box. Mother must be so, so disappointed. We're getting the sense that just about anyone who's ever had unencumbered access to classified information, and has since left office, is still sitting on it. So, let's just get this over with. Barack Obama's house on Martha's Vineyard is probably made entirely of recycled classified documents. Lord knows what George Bush Sr. had packed into the coffin. Dan Quayle, this is your opportunity to get back in the news! Well, hey, folks, that's three jokes, and with it, the end of the newsletter.

      "text": "Slate's guide to the most important figures in politics this week.\n\nWelcome to this week's edition of the Surge, where we take you down, down, down into the depths of the wreckage of American politics. That's a metaphor about a thing that happened this week!\n\nOh boy, did politics also happen this week, or what! Hunter Biden now has to wear an ankle bracelet to the sex clubs he's been kicked out of, while Justice Samuel Alito will only go to a sex club if the sex club spot would otherwise go unoccupied. We have a new entrant in the Republican presidential primary who refuses to be cool and tell fun lies, and an old entrant on the Democratic side whose cat now runs her presidential campaign by default.\n\nBut first, let's start with a rift in the Bozo Impeachment Caucus.\n\nBy Jim Newell\n\nThe at-best useless Colorado representative found a new way this week to do nothing on behalf of her constituents while pointlessly antagonizing the rest of the House Republican conference. She introduced articles of impeachment against President Biden on two counts of not managing the southern border to her liking. What made Boebert's latest play for money and attention a problem for the rest of the Republican conference, though, is that she filed the articles as a privileged resolution, forcing floor action on it within two days. That meant that Democrats would move to table (or kill) the resolution, setting up an uncomfortable proxy vote in which Republicans would have to go on the record about impeaching Biden. It's distracting BS that neither vulnerable Republican members nor leaders want right now. Eventually, leadership got Boebert to agree to a workaround: The Rules Committee folded Boebert's impeachment articles into a resolution that punted the impeachment question to committee, which passed the House along party lines. Even though Boebert acted selfishly, and prematurely for the rest of her conference, it's worth noting that the impeachment question isn't going away. At some point, Republicans are going to want to impeach somebody -whether it's Biden or a Cabinet secretary, or somebody's dog-for, at the very least, revenge over Democrats' two impeachments of Trump. They just need to find a culprit, and a charge, on which 218 Republicans can agree.\n\nWere Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Boebert ever friends? Who's to say? When they entered Congress in 2021 together, they were, uh, naturally disruptive allies. But their paths have diverged in this Congress. Greene, while still devoted to important kook policy matters like releasing Jan. 6 criminals from jail, has cozied up to Speaker Kevin McCarthy and become more of a cooperative member of the team. As Greene has worked her way into the popular kids, though, Boebert is still skipping class to smoke cigs under the bleachers. The tensions between the two were apparent during the speaker's race in January, when they reportedly clashed in the ladies' room as Boebert was holding out against McCarthy. This week, Boebert's move to force a vote on impeachment hit a nerve with Greene: She, too, had introduced similar impeachment articles some time ago, but recognized it was too soon to force a vote on them. On Wednesday morning, Greene told reporters that Boebert had \"copied\" her work. Boebert approached Greene on the House floor later that day in response to the comments, and Greene let her have it. \"I've donated to you, I've defended you. But you've been nothing but a little bitch to me,\" Greene told Boebert, according to the Daily Beast's reporting. \"And you copied my articles of impeachment after I asked you to cosponsor them.\" Greene confirmed the account-multiple times-to reporters. And when asked whether there was any hope of reconciliation between the two, Greene said \"absolutely not.\" An American tragedy.\n\nAfter years of investigation into various alleged crimes by President Biden's comprehensively astounding fuck-up of a son, the feds cut a deal with Hunter Biden this week. He pleaded guilty to a pair of tax-related misdemeanors (he hadn't paid a bunch of taxes) while a felony charge of possessing a gun while being a very, very active drug user was dropped. He'll get a couple of years' probation. So: Did this put an end to the Republican argument that there's a \"two-tiered\" system of justice that lets Democrats off easy? Absolutely not. \"If you are the president's leading political opponent, DOJ tries to literally put you in jail and give you prison time,\" Speaker McCarthy told reporters this week. \"If you are the president's son, you get a sweetheart deal.\" (Fun fact: McCarthy and Hunter Biden both attended the White House state dinner with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday! Maybe they bonded over a dessert course of ketamine.) To be honest with you? The deal does seem a little sweethearty, reader. What Republicans should keep in mind, though, is how very, very, very difficult it will be for someone like Hunter Biden to obey probation for an entire two years. This is a guy who can't make it more than one night at the sex club SNCTM without getting kicked out. It's going to be a long couple of years for him.\n\nYou knew it would be pretty good when the Wall Street Journal opinion page posted a response, penned by Justice Samuel Alito, to allegations that hadn't been published yet. The allegations were, then, published. In 2008, according to ProPublica's reporting, Alito went on a luxury fishing trip to Alaska in which he was flown out on the private jet of one Paul Singer, a hedge fund billionaire who would later have business before the court. Alito didn't disclose the flight or the lodging, and didn't later recuse himself when Singer had business before the court. So: The usual. The best part of Alito's prebuttal, though, was how he justified taking \"what would have otherwise been an unoccupied seat on a private flight to Alaska.\" Do you ProPublica ninnies understand now ? If he hadn't taken that seat, it would've been empty ... and ... give us one second here ... and it would've been an inefficient flight that unnecessarily contributed to climate change! Isn't that what you \"haters\" all whine about, climate change? Basically, he had to get on that flight to save the dumb bears. Sorry if that's \"scandalous.\"\n\nDid the news that Donald Trump was indicted for producing dramatic one-act readings of top-secret nuclear attack documents in the Mar-a-Lago ballroom hurt him at all with Republican voters? Maybe a little! A post-indictment poll from CNN this week showed Trump's approval rating among Republican-aligned voters falling from 77 percent in May to 67 percent after the indictment, \"while the share who say they would not support him for the nomination under any circumstances has climbed, from 16% in May to 23% now.\" But that 33 percent of Republican-aligned voters can ultimately go suck an egg, because Trump still earned a commanding 47 percent support of Republican primary voters. Other findings from the poll: Americans are kind of sickos. Sixty-one percent of Americans approved of the decision to indict Trump, while majorities of Democrats, independents, and Republicans also believe politics played a role in the decision to indict. In short, Americans are overall pleased with what they believe to be a politically motivated prosecution.\n\nIt's time for the New Presidential Candidate of the Week! Enter Will Hurd, a moderate former House Republican and CIA agent. During his time in Congress, Hurd was well respected on both sides as a serious member of Congress, and in his launch video, he warned that \"if we nominate a lawless, selfish, failed politician like Donald Trump, who lost the House, the Senate, and the White House, we all know Joe Biden will win again.\" So yeah, Hurd has no chance. Were he to have even the slightest inkling of a chance, though, it would require getting on the debate stage to introduce himself to the country and attempting to make a splash. Hurd, however, has said that he will not sign the RNC's pledge to back the party's eventual nominee, a requirement for getting into the debates. \"I am not in the business of lying to the American people in order to get a microphone, and I'm not going to support Donald Trump,\" Hurd told CNN. \"And so I can't honestly say I'm going to sign something even if he may or may not be the nominee.\" Here's something Hurd should consider doing, though: Lying to the American people in order to get a microphone. It's really important to get that microphone! Just lie!\n\nNow let's look at a candidate who will almost certainly do better in her presidential primary than Will Hurd will in his: Marianne Williamson. The Orb, who's running in her second straight Democratic presidential primary, is having a little trouble keeping staff on the payroll. She lost her second campaign manager this week. The first campaign manager to leave was Peter Daou, a 2016 diehard Hillary stan turned 2020 diehard Bernie stan turned 2024 Marianimal turned ... quitter of that gig. The second campaign manager to quit this week was Roza Calderon, who-let's pass the mic to Politico here-\"ran for Congress in 2018 but lost. During that campaign, she was sentenced to probation after allegedly stealing money from a local Democratic Party group to spend on gas, movie downloads and BottleRock music festival tickets.\" Seven staffers have departed in the last month, and Williamson herself has mostly been in London with her grandchild. We're not sure she's going to be president. But again: better chance than Will Hurd.\n\nThe most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Slate's guide to the most important figures in politics this week.\n\nWelcome to this week's edition of the Surge, your local bookmaker for odds on who will be the House speaker any given Sunday.\n\nIt was a week of momentous decisions. This week, the Surge, like many other wealthy entities, decided not to cover Donald Trump's hundreds of millions of dollars in legal penalties. Mike Pence decided not to endorse the guy whose election lies brought him perilously close to a makeshift guillotine. Marco Rubio may have to decide whether to move to a new state. Peter Navarro, however, didn't have much of a decision to make about whether to show up for his jail sentence.\n\nFirst: Your favorite congresswoman decided to get mad!\n\nBy Jim Newell\n\nThe House successfully passed the second and final tranche of government funding for the remainder of the fiscal year on Friday-and this was the bigger, more challenging tranche, covering everything from border security to health programs to defense spending. And since it was a compromise that didn't do everything they wanted, the far-right was characteristically furious. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, in particular, went so far as to file a resolution to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, raising the prospect of a third speaker's race in this Congress. But don't take this too seriously yet. First, she didn't privilege-i.e., force a vote on-her resolution. \"It's more of a warning than a pink slip,\" Greene told reporters after House votes Friday. \"I'm not saying that it won't happen in two weeks or it won't happen in a month or who knows when, but I am saying the clock has started. It's time for our conference to choose a new speaker.\" Yeah. So ... we're skeptical Greene will force that vote anytime soon. Democrats don't have the same toxic history with Johnson that they had with McCarthy, and there's reason to believe they'd backstop a Johnson speakership. In fact, it could even be an opportunity for Democrats to secure a commitment from Johnson to call a vote on Ukraine aid, of which Greene is the most ardent opponent. The vast, vast majority of Greene's GOP conference, including the guy who led the last speaker's ouster, have no interest in going through another speaker's race. This is plain-old attention-seeking for now. And hey, the Surge had a last-minute switcheroo to make her No. 1 this week, so congratulations to her.\n\nIt's not just the liberal deep-state prosecutors that are being very unfair, very rude to Mr. Trump in his ongoing legal war to preserve America and its freedoms. The bond companies, too, are being very rude-frankly, disgusting. Not one of 30 bond companies, Trump's lawyers revealed this week, would put up the $454 million bond that Trump needs to secure by this Monday in the New York civil fraud case against his Legitimate Business Dealings. If he can't secure the bond, that means that New York Attorney General Letitia James could move to seize Trump assets to collect. Maybe a New York City property? Maybe a golf course or a named estate in Westchester County? It's a matter of James' tastes. As you might imagine, Trump is displeased with this, and when he's displeased, he posts. He's been on a torrent this week going after James and the judge in the case. The stray references in these spiels are still hot, such as the one to \"John Lovitz\" and \"SNL when it was good.\" How's ol' Donny Trump going to wriggle his way out of this jam? Oh, he'll figure it out. Hey look- money!\n\nNBC News reported this week that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is on Trump's shortlist for running as his vice president, an honor given to a mere several hundred people. \"Rubio is young and telegenic,\" NBC News wrote, \"he has spent more time in federal office than Vice President Kamala Harris, and, at a time when Trump is bullish on his chances of winning over Latino voters, [Rubio] would be the first Latino person on a major-party presidential ticket.\" If you've completely forgotten the 2016 Republican presidential primaries and the Rubio hype leading into it, then sure-this Rubio gent would sound like a real up-and-comer. One issue for Rubio, however, is our buzzkill of a Constitution, which prohibits electors from voting for both a president and a vice president who are from their own state. The idea being batted around, then, would be that \"Rubio could resign his Senate seat to move to another state and join the ticket.\" This would be an interesting decision for Rubio. Ditching your Senate career and the seniority that's given you a meaningful committee chairmanship for a toss-up election is a big risk. Plus, you'd have to serve as Trump's chief deputy doormat for four years if it worked out. On the other hand, serving as Trump's running mate is probably the last best chance Rubio will have to revive his dormant presidential hopes. Where should he move, anyway? The simplest thing would be to transfer his residence to Washington D.C., but we'd bet on ... Arizona, the dry Florida.\n\nFormer Trump White House aide Peter Navarro refused to comply with a House Jan. 6 Committee subpoena a couple of years ago-and made a big show of his noncompliance!-and was convicted of contempt of Congress last year. In January, he was sentenced to four months in federal prison, with the judge telling him, \"You are not a victim. You are not the object of a political prosecution. These are the circumstances of your own making.\" Navarro did not leave it there. After the D.C. district court and federal appeals court refused to delay the start of his prison sentence, the Supreme Court-Chief Justice John Roberts-also refused to save Navarro on Monday. His sentence began Tuesday. Navarro spoke one last time to reporters outside federal prison in Miami that morning-\"for 30 minutes at a gas station\"-where he said, \"I am pissed-that's what I am feeling right now.\" Well! Next time work out a deal to chat with ye olde congressional committee rather than just shouting \"executive privilege\" to the sky. Better yet, don't work for Donald Trump. In any event, it'll be a quick spell in the pokey, and his prison consultant (yes, really) hooked him up with an \"air-conditioned dormitory reserved for 'elderly' male inmates\" where you can hear the lions from the next-door zoo. Neat! Jail is fun.\n\nIt's only March, but the winner of this year's Rick Scott Award for Unnecessarily Releasing a Go-Nowhere Election-Year Plan That Would Cut Social Security Benefits goes to Rep. Kevin Hern, chairman of the Republican Study Committee. The RSC-a conservative caucus to which the vast majority of the House GOP are members-released their annual budget proposal, \"Fiscal Sanity to Save America,\" on Wednesday. Among the hits in this dandy, which the RSC could have not released at all, would be an increase in the eligibility age for Social Security benefits; a conversion of Medicare to a \"premium support\" model (Paul Ryan, control yourself! ); and an endorsement of the Life at Conception Act, the federal legislation that could put to risk the legality of in vitro fertilization nationally. Not all of these ideas are new to the RSC's latest proposal; many of the plans go back years in RSC literature. But perhaps Hern could've taken a bye this year. President Joe Biden is already seeking to tag the entire GOP with this proposal; GOP leadership is already running away from it, and so is Trump. Eyes on the prize, Hern: You win the election on \"populism\" (saying whatever gets the folks a-gruntin') and then use a reconciliation bill to cut taxes and benefit programs.\n\nLast Friday, just minutes after we had sent the previous edition of the Surge to the printers, Mike Pence announced that he would not support Trump for president. The Surge did, on net, believe that Pence would find a McConnellesque way to get back on the Trump Train this year. Too much of a party man; too much muscle memory in his salivatory glands from when he served as Trump's deputy. It's a credit to him that he was able to resist. And yet, his explanation was risible. \"During my presidential campaign, I made it clear that there were profound differences between me and President Trump on a range of issues, and not just our difference on my constitutional duties that I exercised on January 6.\" He listed Trump's soft positions on the national debt, on abortion rights, and his recent opposition to the House bill that would force a sale of TikTok. Seriously? Trump hasn't cared, at all, about the national debt or abortion, ever, in the entire time that Pence has known him. Trump's position on TikTok-whatever. Pence knows that Trump has never cared about anything beyond his own prestige and comfort. The former VP will run in zero future elections. He is free to say that he's not endorsing Trump after the 2020 election lies nearly got him killed, and Trump didn't lift a finger to stop it. Really! It's an exceptional reason to withhold an endorsement.\n\nSenate Republicans held the first of what could be many confabs to discuss the post-McConnell leadership picture. So far, just Sens. John Thune and John Cornyn are running to replace McConnell when he steps down in November, though others, like Sens. Rick Scott or Steve Daines, could enter the picture later. Cornyn has already said that he would support a new requirement of term limits for the Senate Republican leader going forward. McConnell, as you might expect from the record-holder of longest-serving Senate party leader, is strongly opposed to the idea. \"Well, we have term limits now,\" McConnell has said publicly. \"They're called elections, and I had a contest myself during my last election as leader.\" In private, at this week's Senate GOP meeting, McConnell warned senators against the idea again, arguing that term limits would \"weaken the leader's power to do their job and potentially hurt fundraising.\" Much as senators, or members of Congress, like to say that they want to \"democratize\" the place and empower individuals, they really don't. In crunch time, they both want and need a strong hand in charge to execute strategy. Immediately lame-ducking a leader wouldn't help with that. But the Senate GOP can make whatever ill-advised decisions it wants! Go nuts!

      "text": "Slate's guide to the most important figures in politics this week.\n\nWelcome to this week's edition of the Surge-an elite political newsletter, to be sure, but nowhere near elite enough to be invited to one of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Fart Dinners .\n\nThis week, the federal government spent millions of dollars to determine that it was a ghost who brought cocaine to the White House. Joe Manchin is going to New Hampshire and insists it has nothing to do with politics. Tommy Tuberville's blockade of military promotions is forcing him to talk to the press more, which isn't working out well for Tommy Tuberville. One person likes Ron DeSantis, and that makes Trump mad.\n\nLet's begin, though, with the newest member of the Conservative Sellout Establishment Swamp Creature Club. It's ... wait, who?\n\nBy Jim Newell\n\nThere was likely an edition of the newsletter a couple of years ago, when Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was fresh on the scene and crawling the walls of Capitol Hill, wailing about Jewish space lasers or jet fuel's inability to melt steel beams, when we made some go-to crack about how she'd be trashed as a RINO sellout soon enough. That time is now! After a week of mixed signals, it was confirmed that Greene is no longer part of the far-right House Freedom Caucus. Calling fellow conservative Rep. Lauren Boebert a \"little bitch\" on the House floor a couple of weeks ago was considered the final straw, but there is much more to the breakup. Greene has aligned herself quite closely with Speaker Kevin McCarthy this year, supporting him throughout the speakership vote process in January and trashing his conservative detractors. She sided with McCarthy most recently on the debt ceiling deal too. Greene told reporters this week that she won't miss the caucus. \"'I enjoy being a free agent a lot better,\" she said. \"I'm interested in getting accomplishments done, not doing things just to disrupt and fight leadership. And that's a major difference.\" LOL that is such RINO sellout talk. Ick! And here was McCarthy defending her this week: \"I think Marjorie Taylor Greene is one of the best members we have. I think she's the one of the most conservative members and one of the strongest legislators.\" This is so gross!\n\nAlabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville's monthslong blockade of typically quick military confirmations, in protest of a new Pentagon abortion policy , hit a milestone this week: The Marine Corps now does not have a Senate-confirmed leader for the first time in over 100 years. The Surge can exclusively report that the Marine Corps is temporarily being led by two experimental dolphins our source describes as \"advanced,\" and-ahh, man, hearing now that China just defeated the dolphins and has taken control of U.S. Marine Corps. Eh, can't win 'em all. Tuberville also made a mess of himself in an interview with CNN this week. First, he said that \" there is nobody more military than me.\" (One thing the Surge and Tuberville have in common is that we have done precisely zero troop work in our lives.) Second, Tuberville continues to get hung up on the term \"white nationalists,\" thinking that it's a label the Woke Military will ascribe to all white people in the military to punish them. In the same interview, when host Kaitlan Collins said, \"A white nationalist is a racist, senator,\" Tuberville said, \"Well, that's your opinion. That's your opinion.\" By the following day, he was telling reporters that white nationalists are indeed racists. With the exception of perhaps the last sentence, not a thing in this entry has been bad politics for Tuberville among his home base.\n\nThe centrist group No Labels, which has been toying around with getting a third-party candidate on the ballot, is holding what it terms a \"Common Sense Town Hall\" at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire on Monday. It definitely could be worth checking out, if you're ordered to do so at gunpoint. Headlining the event will be Jon Huntsman Jr., the embodiment of unrealized political aspiration , and one West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. It's the latest episode of Manchin, who still hasn't announced his 2024 plans yet, attaching himself closely with the would-be No Labels third-party bid without saying if he would seek it. When asked about the New Hampshire event this week, Manchin was Manchining especially hard. \"No, no, this is nothing about a third party. This is nothing about bringing up any office at all. It's about a dialogue for common sense, which is very hard to have here, finding commonality,\" Manchin told CNN of his involvement in the event. Typical media and its wild suppositions! The man who continually refuses to rule out a presidential bid is going to St. Anselm College, the effective welcome center for the New Hampshire presidential primary, and the media thinks that this might have something to do with his presidential aspirations? Such \"swamp\" thinking.\n\nThe real Surge was disgusted last week to see its substitute newsletter writer place an abstraction -\"anonymous Washington, D.C., cocaine enthusiast\"-on this list. The Surge is a serious newsletter, not a frivolity. But alas, we're running with it again this week because we have an update in the Great White House Cocaine Caper: The vast arsenal of the federal national security apparatus has looked into the matter of whose baggie fell out in the White House and come up with a definitive shrug. We encourage you to read the entire Secret Service statement , which goes into great depth about the expensive-sounding CSI -esque methods it used to find the culprit before determining that it had no clue whatsoever. Though the investigation is over, we have a feeling this will be a wellspring of conspiracy theorizing throughout the presidential campaign. The Secret Service said the FBI lab to which the drugs were sent couldn't trace fingerprints or DNA, and that \"there was no surveillance video footage found that provided investigative leads or any other means for investigators to identify who may have deposited the found substance in this area.\" In other words, Republicans will assume that this is a cover-up, by both President Biden and the corrupt FBI, to protect Hunter Biden. If only one of the dozen Randys who got lost on a White House tour could have left more-defined fingerprints, all this could've been avoided.\n\nOver the past few weeks, there's been consensus around the idea that Ron DeSantis doesn't have what it takes. (Caveat: Beware when there's consensus, six months before a single primary, around the idea that the second-highest-polling candidate will lose.) He's just flatly unlikable, and-this is a first-we're going to quote the New York Times' Bret Stephens: \"He makes Trump seem tolerant, Ted Cruz seem likable, Mitch McConnell seem moderate, Lauren Boebert seem mature and Rick Santorum seem cool.\" Donors, both concerned about DeSantis' viability and generally creeped out by the guy, are starting to look elsewhere. But there were also multiple reports this week that News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch, who swore he was done with Trump and assigned his media outlets to shine a favorable light on DeSantis, is also getting cold feet . DeSantis has recently received more hard-hitting interviews on Fox News than he's accustomed to, and the New York Post and Wall Street Journal have begun to cover him less favorably. The question for Murdoch is: What's the backup plan? The New York Times reported that Murdoch would like to see Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin get into the race . The thing about Youngkin, though, is that everyone would also make fun of him for being a stilted weirdo if he entered the race, and he, too, would lose to Trump. All roads lead to Murdoch and Trump brokering peace.\n\nOne person who hasn't been completely creeped out by DeSantis yet is Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds. And while the governor is formally staying neutral in the race, the Times reported in a piece this week that she \"seems to be softening the ground in Iowa for Mr. DeSantis\"-something that has not gone unnoticed by Trump and his team. On Monday, Trump confirmed the reported suspicions about Reynolds in his usual manner: by screaming about her on social media. \"I opened up the Governor position for Kim Reynolds, & when she fell behind, I ENDORSED her, did big Rallies, & she won,\" Trump wrote . \"Now, she wants to remain 'NEUTRAL.' I don't invite her to events! DeSanctus down 45 points!\" It should be noted that the playbook for winning the Iowa Republican caucuses does not suggest feuding with the popular Iowa Republican governor; aspirants typically queue to wash the governor's feet. But Trump's specific playbook requires him to assert dominance over the traditional political gatekeepers; once he starts sucking up to them, he's no longer Trump. He'll be just fine.\n\nWe recently noted that Senate Republicans, who are playing a much more active role in primaries this cycle following their 2022 meltdown, landed their top recruit for the Montana Senate race in businessman and former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy. Now, the \"Washington establishment\" getting its preferred candidate is always a double-edged sword. Yes, you get someone in the primary who is theoretically more electable against Sen. Jon Tester than awful Rep. Matt Rosendale. But that Washington-backed candidate immediately gets labeled Mitch McConnell's hand-picked candidate , which invites its own messaging issues. And this week, Insider reported that a photo used on Sheehy's \"Issues\" page for the agriculture section was actually taken in ... Kentucky . Hey, that's where Mitch McConnell lives! Sheehy's campaign changed the one stock photo to another stock photo, which was actually taken in Montana, very quickly. Yup, that's about it! We needed a seventh entry and did not want to write about Jim Jordan.

      "text": "\"He May Pick You Up for a Ride\"\n\nHe knew there'd be trouble when he heard Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene utter his name. \"He may pick you up for a ride,\" Greene intoned in a live video in June. \"Then he'll dress in women's clothing and read stories to your kids and sell sex toys to college students.\"\n\nBenjamin Gentry-who goes by Courtney Chanel Stratton as a drag queen and works at the Rome, Georgia, adult store the Love Library-was scheduled to perform at Rome's inaugural pride festival nine days later, reading books to children. Greene represents Georgia's 14 th district, which includes Rome.\n\nGreene showed a picture of Stratton on screen, the queen's curly blonde hair framing sumptuous eyelashes and a glittering necklace. Off camera, Greene's producer intoned, \"His real name is Benjamin Gentry, and the bad news is that he's a ride-share driver in Rome, Georgia.\" She flashed a picture of Gentry's Facebook profile on screen and suggested people send him a friend request. That same day, Greene, who is poised to win another term in Congress in next month, tweeted to her nearly 1 million followers, \"Protecting your children from drag queen child predators is not a hate crime.\"\n\nGentry learned what was happening quickly. The death threats began right away. \"If I catch any one of these sick perverts around my grandkids, they will die,\" a typical user wrote on Gab, the far-right social network. Gentry knew Greene's claims about predatory drag queens were absurd. But it was less clear what to do about them.\n\n\"It's not every day that you get targeted by a political figure, so it's like, how do I handle this?\" he told me. \"It sent me into a really deep depression, and I just didn't want to do anything. I'd just go to work and stay at home because I'm like, 'What if I go out and someone attacks me?'\"\n\nGentry quit driving for Uber. He wouldn't even go grocery shopping. But he had spent months planning pride with the other founding members of Rome's committee, and he and the others were faced with a conundrum: Should they cancel the city's first-ever pride-or proceed and find out what happens when Marjorie Taylor Greene tells people you're a predator going after their children?\n\nGentry is 22 and has spent his whole life in Rome. Growing up a low-income gay kid there could sometimes be \"hell,\" he said. In elementary school he had a teacher, Mrs. Moss, who stood up for him. But when he got to middle and high school, no adults did. At his public high school, when he got called to the assistant principal's office after fighting back against a bully, the principal told him, \"You knew what you were choosing when you chose this lifestyle, so you can't get upset and react the way you do.\"\n\nGentry started doing drag at 18. He drove to the nearest big city, Atlanta, and competed at talent nights. \"I was a busted fucking mess my first two years,\" he said, when he was flitting between drag personas in Atlanta and Chattanooga. Now he has settled on a persona that is \"glam camp,\" a regular in Rome as part of the drag group Sizzling Sisters.\n\nIn 2018, Gentry was part of an informal pride celebration at a Rome bar spearheaded by Justin Deal, another young man from the Rome area. About 150 people came. The next year, another pride event saw 350 people show up.\n\nBy 2021, Deal, Gentry, the leader of PFLAG Rome , and others believed that Rome was ready for its first real pride. They formed a pride board and spent months coordinating a three-day event, which included a march, a church service, and a drag queen storytime.  Twenty-five local businesses agreed to sponsor it. The city commission officially declared June Rome's pride month.\n\nThen came Greene's live stream. Gentry told the others about the threats. Some supporters questioned whether it was a good idea to go forward. Someone claiming to be a Rome citizen wrote to them, \"Go back to Portland!\"\n\nOne day while Gentry was working at the sex shop, he picked up the phone and the caller said, \"I don't have a question about a product. But is it true that y'all are sponsoring this deplorable event that's happening, the drag queen storytime?\" Gentry responded, \"Actually, you're in luck. This is the host of that. How may I help you?\"\n\n\"'How can you do such a horrible, disgusting, despicable thing,'\" Gentry recalled her saying. \"I'm like, does this bitch think she's Cher in The Witches of Eastwick ?\"\n\nThe call continued. \"Finally, I was like, 'This line is being recorded right now,\" he said, \"and she hung up.\"\n\nFliers announcing an anti-pride rally circulated with a red slash mark through Gentry's face. A flag outside the sex shop was slashed and burned.\n\nGentry decided it wasn't safe for him to perform at pride. He told the board. They debated whether to cancel drag queen story hour altogether. Then one board member, Camilla Carter, 41, stepped in. Carter insisted that the story hour go on. \"Maybe we need a more seasoned queen to do drag queen story time,\" she said, referring to herself. \"Because honestly, everything that people have been saying to them I've heard from family, so it's just like water off a duck's back.\"\n\nLike Gentry, Carter is from Rome. She got married to a woman in her early 20s and had two kids. When Carter got a divorce and came out as gay in her late 20s, her mother didn't talk with her for years. (Carter asked to use only her drag name in this article for her family's privacy.)\n\nThe rest of the board welcomed Carter's offer, and they came up with a plan: reschedule the story hour and hold it at another location. They didn't alert the public until the last minute. \"Safety was the top priority,\" Deal said, but \"we knew it was important to not back down to that fear and misinformation.\"\n\nCarter asked her employer, Summit Hill Foods, makers of Better Than Bouillon, whether they would sponsor the ride. They agreed to. Soon, Carter's face appeared on a protest flyer too.\n\n\" I just kind of put myself in the line of fire,\" Carter said. \"My character is an old lady. So we laughed about it, because it was like, what can they find to say? That I'm sexualizing children? I'm the least sexy thing you could see.\"\n\nThen another threat emerged. An organization reached out to the pride committee warning of an anti-Semitic group that had been on the rise in the area who they feared might show up at pride. (Perhaps the organization had seen the anti-Jewish comments that had appeared under Greene's post. \"Fuck Israel and the filthy Jews behind this depravity,\" one person wrote.) The board quadrupled the number of officers at the event from two to eight.\n\nThe day of the rainbow march, the group anxiously awaited the tide of protestors near Rome's gazebo where attendees were flocking in adorned in rainbow skirts and hoisting signs that said \"Have a Gay Day.\"\n\nSoon the pride organizers saw Greene's impact: protestors showed up, brandishing signs that said \"Stop Indoctrinating Kids\" and waving American flags. But there were only 12 or 15 of them. \"They were honestly pretty peaceful,\" he said. No members of the anti-Semitic group showed up.\n\nA post shared by Rome Georgia Pride (@romegapride)\n\nBy the time of the story hour, in the afternoon, the protestors had left. Carter wasn't worried. \"I kept a smile on and I went for it,\" she said. \"I expected to show up with my little chair and sit over in the shade with about 10 kids and read my book. And when I got over to the park. The whole hill was full of families and kids\"-about 100 people total. With her gray wig atop her head, wearing grandma glasses and a rainbow skirt, she cracked open The World Needs More Purple People, by Kristen Bell and Benjamin Hart. \"Purple is a magic color when red and blue work together,\" Carter read.\n\nGreene's attempt to target her constituents had largely failed-barely anyone showed up beyond comments online. But soon, Greene told another story.\n\nFive days after Rome's drag queen story hour, she posted a video. \"Well, we had a big victory,\" she said. \"It got cancelled.\" She went on, \"Guess what? People around here we don't want our kids confused about gender. And we don't want men who are selling sex products and all kind of disgusting filthy things to people to dress up like a woman and read gender-confusing books to kids.\"\n\nGreene insisted that most of the people at Rome pride were from out of town, based on research from a member of her team that showed many vehicle tags in the area came from outside the city. Deal's survey data at the event showed opposite. \"If she had lived here longer than an election cycle, she would know that if you're from Rome, and there's an event at Heritage Park, you never park at Heritage Park,\" Deal said.\n\nIn Rome, plans for next year's pride celebrations are already underway. It's going to be even bigger. Carter now holds drag queen story hour weekly at a local taco shop. \"We had twice as many people show up for storytime this past Thursday,\" Carter said. The attention Greene drew wasn't always in the direction she wanted. (Greene didn't respond to questions for this article.)\n\nEven so, Greene's star is rising. She's likely to be among a new group of far-right Republicans who deny the 2020 election results and may have more power than ever in Congress .\n\nThough few showed up in person to threaten her constituents in Rome, Greene likely achieved her political end. Her comments sparked an online storm, an inflamed base mostly far from Rome. Around the same as the celebration, Greene claimed she would introduce a bill to make it illegal to \"expose\" children to drag queens -and quickly sought donations off of her comments. She's now among the top 10 fundraisers in the House this election cycle.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Mike Johnson Finally Found the Gumption to Stand Up to the Freedom Caucus. It Could Cost Him His Job.\n\nDuring a House vote Thursday, Speaker Mike Johnson found himself surrounded by members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, demanding answers about rumored rules changes that would go a long way toward defanging the Freedom Caucus' veto power over the body. As Johnson was being berated, Wisconsin Rep. Derrick Van Orden interjected to defend the speaker. He began hurling insults at the Freedom Caucus members, including calling Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz \" tubby .\" Of all the things to say about Gaetz ... tubby?\n\nWhy is everyone so mad ? Well, getting mad is just what Van Orden does, whether the target of his opprobrium is Gaetz, Joe Biden , or a group of teens enjoying themselves .\n\nThe most right-wing members of the House GOP, however, were furious at Johnson for threatening to finally do what's necessary to retake control of his chamber after 15 months of gobsmacking dysfunction.\n\nAfter months of delays, Johnson has finally found the gumption to allow a package of bills providing security assistance to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan to move through the House. He's organized it in a clever way. There will be separate votes on each of those three measures, allowing some Republicans to vote for the Israel portion alone and some Democrats to vote for the Ukraine portion alone , with plenty of crossover voting for both. There will also be a separate, fourth vote on a piece of \"sidecar\" legislation , intended as a legislative sweetener to move certain House priorities through the Senate. It would include measures seizing Russian foreign assets and forcing the Chinese company ByteDance to sell TikTok, among other things. Whatever passes will be rolled into one bill for the Senate to take up.\n\nNo sweetener, however, can satisfy the hard-right Republicans who've made abandonment of Ukraine a top priority. And Johnson's decision to push through Ukraine aid-a policy choice he's now passionately advocating for in a way we hadn't previously seen -all but guarantees that Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, or some other fellow traveler , will force a vote on removing Johnson from his job, as she threatened to do several weeks ago .\n\nAnd so Johnson's maneuver to pass the aid package, and to keep his job, would rely on votes from the opposition party to a very, very unusual extent. Under the process Johnson has laid out, Democratic votes could be needed in every step of the process. That would mean Democrats would vote to advance a rule governing floor debate in the Rules Committee, on that rule in a full House vote, during votes on the legislative package itself, and, perhaps, in a vote to sustain Johnson's speakership afterward. There is little if any precedent in modern times of a minority party bailing out the majority leadership on procedural votes like this. But Democrats may be willing to swallow it if that's what it takes to re-arm Ukraine.\n\nWhat really teed off the right, though, beyond Johnson relying on Democrats to assist Ukraine, was a story about something else Johnson was considering. Punchbowl News reported Thursday morning that House Republican leaders were \"discussing using the debate over the $95 billion foreign aid package to make it harder to oust Speaker Mike Johnson.\"\n\nUnder current House rules, any individual member can force a vote to oust the Speaker. This was the process by which ex-Speaker Kevin McCarthy was removed, and it is the move that Greene has been threatening to deploy against Johnson. It is the central source of the far right's control over the speaker: Rely on Democratic votes to pass something we disapprove of, and you will lose your job .\n\nIt's poison, and rank-and-file House Republicans are at their wits' end with the crippling effect it's had on the ongoing, internationally embarrassing session of Congress. The change under discussion, then, would have raised the threshold for what it takes to force a vote on ousting the speaker. Johnson, then, wouldn't have needed Democrats to bail him out repeatedly when his speakership would come up for a vote, putting everyone in an unsustainable position.\n\nThis is what the Freedom Caucus members-even the ones who previously hadn't supported an ouster of Johnson-confronted Johnson about on the House floor on Thursday.\n\nMatt Gaetz, who was among those confronting Johnson, told reporters that they \"sought clarification\" from Johnson that he wouldn't attempt to change this, and \"we did not get the answer that we wanted.\" Johnson, Gaetz said, was \"equivocating.\" (As for the interaction with Van Orden, Gaetz said \"the only thing I gleaned from it is that Mr. Van Orden is not a particularly intelligent individual.\")\n\nGaetz, who led McCarthy's ouster, had been outspoken against ousting Johnson, even as he was staunchly against sending additional aid to Ukraine. But the rumors of a rule change to release the speaker, once and for all, from the Freedom Caucus' grip got him to reconsider that.\n\n\"My hope was that the motion to vacate would be an elixir that only required one dose for effectiveness,\" Gaetz told reporters Thursday. \"But sometimes, there are some therapies that require more than one dose. And I hope that's not the case with the motion to vacate, but we'll administer that elixir as many times as necessary to save the country.\"\n\nBy late Thursday afternoon, Johnson had decided against pursuing the rule change. \"Any rule change requires a majority of the full House, which we do not have,\" he said . \"We will continue to govern under the existing rules.\" His gumption, in other words, still only goes so far. But he is nevertheless risking his job and his standing among conservatives to support Ukraine, which is gumption enough for the moment.\n\nIn spite of this, paranoia is still rippling through the Freedom Caucus. Their members were also worried on Thursday that Republican leaders could attempt a sudden removal of three hardliners from the Rules Committee, another source of the right's power. Just in case, the Freedom Caucus decided to take shifts with members monitoring the House floor should leaders attempt to pass any of these changes by unanimous consent. That group of members is known as the Freedom Caucus' Floor Action Response Team- aka \"FART.\"\n\nThe debate happening in Congress now is a weighty one. Members are fighting about America's role in the world: whether it has an obligation to prop up an independent country facing aggression from its neighbors, and whether it should help other allies defend themselves against a concerted effort from Russia, China, and Iran and its proxies to destabilize the Western-led order. It's a serious moment.\n\nBut also: \"FART.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Marjorie Taylor Greene has been tapped to chair a new congressional subcommittee aimed at eliminating government waste under the newly formed \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" which is set to be led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy -- and firing government employees could be part of her plan.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer announced the creation of the new GOP-controlled \"Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE)\" subcommittee in the next Congress, and Greene, a loyal supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, will chair it.\n\nGreene said in the new position, she will work to \"identify and investigate the waste, corruption, and absolutely useless parts of our federal government.\"\n\n\"Our subcommittee will provide transparency and truth to the American people through hearings,\" she said in a statement. \"The goal of DOGE is to bring accountability and GUT useless government agencies.\"\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee, slammed the committee and Greene's involvement in it.\n\n\"So now a noted student of American government, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, will chair a subcommittee to work with two unvetted billionaires who stand to receive billions more in government contracts and subsidies from the government under Trump,\" Raskin said in a statement.\n\nThe Georgia Republican has pledged to carry out Trump's agenda in the role and \"rooted out every penny of waste and abuse\" -- signaling that government employees' jobs could be on the chopping block.\n\n\"In the private sector, if you're not doing a good job, you get fired. But for some reason, in government, bad employees-whether they're failing to do the job they were hired to do or working in roles that are no longer needed-never get fired,\" Greene wrote in a post on X on Thursday . \"This is incredibly unfair to the hard-working taxpayers of our country, and it's about to change.\"\n\nTrump himself has made no secret of his plans to cut what he sees as government waste by calling for the dismantling for the Department of Education and selecting Cabinet picks who talk about abolishing entire agencies and firing tens of thousands of federal workers at a time.\n\nHelping in that effort could be the new Department of Government Efficiency -- helmed by Musk and Ramaswamy, both staunch allies of the president-elect. While DOGE will not be a federal agency in the U.S. government, Trump said it will provide advice and guidance \"outside of government\" and partner with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to \"drive structural government reform.\"\n\nThe president-elect did not detail how this new department would be funded.\n\nLawmakers involved in the future subcommittee have already met with members of the White House DOGE team, including Ramaswamy, who support the Oversight Committee's endeavor and are already working together, according to a source.\n\nRamaswamy posted on X that he is \"looking forward\" to working with Greene and with Congress in that effort.\n\nGreene's time in the House has been marked by several controversies -- including her involvement in a raucous House Oversight Committee meeting that included name calling and her plot to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson from the job earlier this year.\n\nShe has been on the House Oversight Committee since 2023 -- but in 2021, the House voted to remove her from her assigned committees because of her record of making incendiary remarks ranging from allegedly supporting violence against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats, to spreading baseless claims that mass school shootings were staged.\n\nABC News' Will Steakin contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Timeline: Marjorie Taylor Greene's feud with Speaker Mike Johnson\n\nGreene met with Johnson three times before calling a vote to oust him.\n\nFor more than a month, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has threatened to demand a vote to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, and has been leading a public charge to try to make that a reality.\n\nAfter weeks of meetings with the speaker and making demands, the Georgia Republican triggered her motion to vacate on May 8.\n\nHere's what has happened so far:\n\nGreen makes it official and files a motion to vacate the speaker saying he \"betrayed our conference and broke our rules\" by working with Democrats to pass a $1.2 trillion package to fund the government but does not make it \"privileged\" -- requiring a House vote.\n\nJohnson addresses Greene's accusations in an interview with Fox News. \"I think that all of my other Republican colleagues recognize this is a distraction from our mission,\" he said.\n\nThe congresswoman sends a letter to her Republican colleagues explaining why she filed a motion to oust Johnson, calling his actions \"a complete and total surrender.\"\n\nGreene meets with Johnson, telling reporters she's closely watching his next moves on the reauthorization of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) -- which allows the U.S. government to collect electronic communications of non-Americans located outside the country without a warrant -- and Ukraine aid.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, a key ally of Greene, holds a news conference with Johnson at Mar-a-Lago. The former president says Johnson is \"doing a very good job ... He's doing about as good as you're going to do. And I'm sure that Marjorie understands that.\"\n\nFISA reauthorization passes in the House . Johnson casts a deciding vote to kill an amendment that would require warrants for certain surveillance -- a priority of Greene and other GOP hard-liners. The congresswoman expresses anger but doesn't call for a vote to vacate the speaker.\n\nA $95 billion foreign aid package passes , including assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Greene says she's giving colleagues the weeklong recess to \"think about\" whether Johnson should go. She signals she wants to call a vote to oust him when the House returns from a recess.\n\nGreene doesn't trigger a vote to oust Johnson after the House returns from its recess.\n\nHouse Democratic leaders announce they'll vote to save Johnson if a motion to vacate is brought to the floor for a vote. After this statement is released, Greene signals she will trigger a vote on a motion to vacate.\n\nGreene and her co-sponsor Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky hold a press conference outside the Capitol, where the congresswoman announces she would trigger a motion to vacate vote \"next week\" to allow GOP colleagues to weigh their support through the weekend.\n\nTrump brings Johnson on stage at a Republican National Committee spring retreat luncheon and praises the speaker. He emphasizes \"the need for party unity, collaboration and expanding the GOP's House majority.\"\n\nTrump also calls Greene and tells her to drop her push to oust Johnson, sources told ABC News.\n\nGreene does not immediately call a vote when the House resumes its session. At Greene's request, she meets with Johnson for more than two hours. After the meeting, Greene says they had a long discussion but does not divulge further details. Johnson said he had \"a lengthy, constructive meeting\" with Greene and Massie.\n\nGreene and Massie meet with Johnson for a second time in as many days. The meeting lasts about 90 minutes. Following this meeting, Greene says she's giving the speaker time to meet her list of four demands: no future funding for Ukraine; implementing the Hastert rule, which states the majority of the majority must support any bill; defunding special counsels and passing a continuing resolution to enact a 1% spending cut if not all 12 appropriation bills are passed individually.\n\nThe congresswoman did not impose a deadline for when the speaker must get back to her.\n\nGreene officially triggered a vote on her motion to remove Johnson on the House floor.\n\nDemocratic and Republican House members booed Greene as she listed off her previously mentioned grievances against Johnson in her resolution.\n\nThe House voted to table -- or effectively kill -- the resolution with by a 359-43 vote, with 163 Democrats joining 196 Republicans to reject Greene's move. Seven Democrats voted present.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene says she's moving ahead with effort to oust Speaker Johnson\n\nHer plan seems doomed to fail as Democrats said they would help save Johnson.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced Wednesday she will move ahead with her attempt to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from the House's top job -- though her plan seems doomed to fail.\n\nThe Georgia Republican, who first introduced a motion to vacate the speaker's chair in March , held a high-energy news conference outside the U.S. Capitol to say she will trigger a vote on the House floor next week.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is not capable of that job,\" she said. \"He has proven that over and over again.\"\n\nGreene, joined by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, aired a litany of grievances she has with Johnson, who she described as a Democratic speaker working against former President Donald Trump's agenda. At one point, Greene donned a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat as she addressed reporters and denied she was defying Trump, who hosted Johnson at Mar-a-Lago last month and said he was doing a \"good job.\"\n\nGreene and Massie were flanked by two blown-up poster boards featuring photos of Johnson embracing House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nShe criticized Johnson for working across the aisle to avoid a government shutdown, passing a FISA extension and his recent ushering of $95 billion in foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan through Congress. She called them three \"betrayals\" against the GOP caucus.\n\nJohnson released a short statement in response to Greene's continued threat to try to remove him.\n\n\"This motion is wrong for the Republican Conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country,\" Johnson said.\n\nGreene's press conference came one day after House Democratic leadership announced that if a motion to vacate Johnson is brought to the House floor for a vote, they would vote to table the effort -- effectively saving the speaker from ouster.\n\nThe motion to vacate is unlikely to succeed as most Republicans have joined Democrats in vowing to spike it.\n\nGreene has already passed up several opportunities to force a vote on her motion, which she said she initially filed as a warning to Johnson.\n\nStill, Greene said she wanted lawmakers to go on record on this issue.\n\n\"I think every member of Congress needs to take that vote and let the chips fall where they may,\" Greene said. \"And so next week, I am going to be calling this motion to vacate. Absolutely calling it. I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker, and have to go home to their primaries and have to run for Congress again having supported a Republican speaker.\"\n\nGreene continued, \"And I also can't wait to see my Republican conference show their cards and show who we are because voters deserve it.\"\n\nAsked why Greene is pledging to move forward with this in defiance of Trump, Greene told ABC News' Correspondent Elizabeth Schulze, \"We have to have a Republican majority in January and under Mike Johnson's leadership we are not going to have one.\"\n\nGreene's threat against Johnson has been looming for weeks. She did not specify what day next week she would force a vote. Asked by a reporter why she was not bringing it to the floor on Wednesday, Greene said she was giving members time to prepare.\n\nMassie said they were also giving Johnson time to think and suggested, again, that he resign. Johnson flatly rejected Massie's previous call for him to step down.\n\nJohnson has defended himself against the threat by stating that he's doing his job within the confines of the narrowest House majority in history. In a recent interview with NewsNation, Johnson said he didn't believe Greene was \"proving\" herself to be a \"serious lawmaker\" and that he didn't spend much time thinking about her.\n\nAsked for her response to Johnson's comment, Greene said she was \"not into personal attacks.\" Massie came to her defense, saying she \"is the most serious representative up here.\"\n\nJohnson was elected speaker in October after three weeks of a leaderless House following the historic removal of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The chaotic elections to replace McCarthy included unsuccessful runs from House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer.\n\nGreene declined to name who she would like to see hold the gavel instead of Johnson.\n\n\"Anybody that's willing to fight for our agenda,\" she said. \"Anyone who refuses to share the power with Hakeem Jeffries.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Marjorie Taylor Greene's Georgia home demonstrates the growing danger of swatting, police and experts said.\n\nSwatting refers to when a false threat is made to draw police and first responders to a location.\n\nThe woman, identified by police as Tammie Pickelsimer, was killed after crashing into a bomb squad member who was responding to the call, according to a statement from the Rome Police Department.\n\nAccording to police, the threat was sent by email to them last week, but it was re-routed to a junk folder. Police on Monday discovered the email which correctly listed the congresswoman's home address.\n\nGreene was not home at the time, but the message from the email specifically targeted the congresswoman's mailbox, Greene posted on X.\n\nThe email spurred a response from police who then sent an officer to monitor the mailbox while waiting for the bomb squad.\n\nRome police sergeant and bomb squad member David Metroka was en route to join the bomb squad at their headquarters when he crashed into the 66-year-old Pickelsimer, Georgia State Patrol said.\n\nPicklesimer suffered significant injuries and later died at the hospital, according to GSP. The officer had minor injuries and was later released from the hospital.\n\nPolice did not find a bomb at Greene's home. In a statement, the Rome Police Department addressed the dangers of swatting incidents.\n\n\"The Rome Police Department continues to work closely with Congresswoman Greene's staff to address the growing concern of swatting incidents and has implemented protocols to ensure that emergency responses are only triggered when truly necessary,\" the police department said in a statement. \"This particular situation did not require an emergency response.\"\n\nThe police department added, \"The Rome Police Department extends its heartfelt condolences to the Pickelsimer family during this difficult time. The department holds the individual responsible for sending the threatening email fully accountable for setting this tragic chain of events into motion. In collaboration with Congresswoman Greene's office, the Rome Police Department is working with federal authorities to ensure the perpetrator is apprehended and brought to justice.\"\n\nThe Rome Police Department told ABC News the email had an IP address linked to Russia.\n\nGreene said she \"felt heartsick,\" and expressed her concern over violent political threats in a statement on X .\n\n\"These violent political threats have fatal consequences,\" she said. \"It's an undue strain on our law enforcement who must treat them seriously. The officer was responding to protect my life. And now, a woman has lost her life because of this despicable act.\"\n\nAccording to John Bandler, an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, swatting is a harassment tactic used to dispatch an \"arm of government\" for emergency services.\n\nBandler believes the uptick in swatting stems from cyber crimes allowing criminals to commit a crime against someone else without having to get close to it, he said.\n\n\"It is a way people can do a crime and they think they won't get caught doing it,\" Bandler said. \"And it seems much more an indirect way of doing it.\"\n\nMost people are never going to be swatted, Bandler said. But he notes it will be hard to protect yourself from this sort of crime, just like it is to protect yourself from all crime, he said.\n\nBandler calls for all swatting attempts to be prosecuted as a felony in every state and on the federal level. Swatting becomes a felony on the federal level when it crosses state lines.\n\nHe said swatting is extremely dangerous and scatters police efforts.\n\n\"Not only are you wasting law enforcement's time, but you're triggering that emergency response and that is always going to be dangerous,\" Bandler said.\n\nGreene said her office is cooperating with local law enforcement and the FBI as they investigate the threat.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene files motion to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson\n\nThe threat to oust Johnson comes just months after he ascended to the position.\n\nGeorgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Friday filed a motion to vacate the speaker's chair, threatening to oust Speaker Mike Johnson just months after he ascended to the speakership.\n\n\"I filed the motion to vacate today, but it's more of a warning and a pink slip,\" Greene told reporters outside the U.S. Capitol. \"I respect our conference. I paid all my dues to my conference. I am a member in good standing and I do not wish to inflict pain on my conference and to throw the House in chaos.\"\n\n\"But this is basically a warning and it's time for us to go through the process, take our time and find a new speaker of the House that will stand with Republicans and our Republican majority instead of standing with the Democrats,\" Greene added.\n\nAn aide to the speaker's office said Greene hasn't made her motion privileged, which means that it can't be considered until after the congressional recess ending on April 9. Greene has not said when she would call the resolution up for a vote.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson always listens to the concerns of members, but is focused on governing,\" said Raj Shah, a spokesman for Johnson, in response to the news. \"He will continue to push conservative legislation that secures our border, strengthens our national defense and demonstrates how we'll grow our majority.\"\n\nAsked by ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott if she has the support of the GOP conference to oust Johnson, Greene didn't say.\n\n\"I won't give you a number, but I have talked to many who probably won't go public, but silently they are breathing a sigh of relief,\" she responded.\n\nThe congresswoman did not specify who she would want as speaker instead of Johnson.\n\n\"I am saying the clock has started,\" she said. \"It's time for our conference to choose a new speaker.\"\n\nThe move from Greene comes amid frustration from the House Freedom Caucus on Johnson's approach to passing funding bills to avert a government shutdown.\n\nEarlier Friday, the House passed a $1.2 trillion package to fund Defense, Financial Services, Homeland Security and other agencies before a midnight deadline. Johnson did so under a suspension of the rules, which required him to rely on Democrats to get the bills across the finish line.\n\nJohnson applauded its passage in a statement, calling it \"an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory\" that \"represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.\"\n\nMore Democrats than Republicans voted for the spending package on Friday. The final vote was 286-134, with more than 100 Republicans opposing the measure.\n\nGreene accused Johnson of helping pass a \"Democratic budget\" in the House on Friday, and criticized him for bringing the package up for a vote under suspension of the rules and without allowing votes on amendments.\n\nJohnson's predecessor Kevin McCarthy was removed from the post by Republican hard-liners who were similarly upset that he worked with Democrats on an eleventh-hour deal to keep the government open last fall.\n\n\"Frankly, I can't defend the speaker,\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., said earlier Friday when asked about a motion to vacate. \"It is the speaker's decision to bring this to the floor for a vote. You guys ask us every day about the status of the speaker. But I don't think anybody here talked cavalierly or flippantly about the speaker a year ago. We focused on policy, we focused on actions, we focused on performance or lack thereof. And we're doing the same thing today.\"\n\nABC News' Alexandra Hutzler contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "House quickly kills Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Johnson\n\nDemocrats joined almost all Republicans in rejecting Greene's move.\n\nRepublican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Wednesday officially triggered a vote on her motion to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, but within minutes Democrats joined almost all Republicans to overwhelmingly reject her move.\n\nThere were audible boos from lawmakers in the chamber as Greene spoke at length about her grievances with Johnson as she called for a vote.\n\nThe Georgia congresswoman, flanked by co-sponsor GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, asserted Johnson had \"not lived up to a single one\" of the promises he made the Republican conference after he was elected to the top post in October.\n\n\"By passing the Democrats' agenda and handcuffing the Republicans' ability and influence legislation, our elected Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has aided and abetted the Democrats and the Biden administration in destroying our country,\" Greene said.\n\nJohnson was on the House floor with his leadership team as Greene read her resolution.\n\nThe House quickly moved to hold a vote on a motion to table, or effectively kill, Greene's effort to oust Johnson. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise rose to request the vote on tabling Greene's resolution, which passed with bipartisan support.\n\nThe final vote to dismiss Greene's motion was 359-43 with seven lawmakers voting present. Lawmakers cheered when the tally was read out.\n\nEleven Republicans and 32 Democrats voted against killing Greene's motion.\n\nJohnson joked with reporters after the vote, saying, \"it's just another Wednesday on Capitol Hill.\"\n\nThe speaker called Greene's resolution a \"misguided effort,\" and thanked his colleagues for supporting him.\n\n\"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress. It's regrettable. It's not who we are as Americans and we're better than this. We need to get beyond it,\" Johnson said.\n\nGreene told ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott after the vote that she was not surprised by the vote against her motion to vacate the speaker's chair.\n\n\"I think this is exactly the American people needed to see,\" she said.\n\n\"I didn't run for Congress to come up here and join the uni-party, and the uni-party was on full display today,\" she added. \"As a matter of fact, [the Republican Party] proved they're ready to do everything with the Democrats.\"\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said his party's decision to help save Johnson's job was aimed at restoring common sense and quelling chaos in Washington.\n\n\"Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene, from plunging the House of Representatives and the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems for everyday Americans in a bipartisan manner,\" the New York congressman told reporters. \"We need more common sense and less chaos in Washington, D.C. Marjorie Taylor Greene and extreme MAGA Republicans are chaos agents.\"\n\nWhen asked repeatedly whether Democrats would vote to save Johnson again if further motions to remove him are filed -- or if Democrats would demand concessions from Johnson to do so in the future -- Jeffries said \"the vote clearly speaks for itself.\"\n\n\"It was a vote of conscience. It was overwhelming. It was decisive. And we need to move forward as a Congress,\" he added.\n\nGreene did not answer when asked if she plans on trying to kick out Johnson again.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump , who has backed Johnson during his feud with Greene, said in a post on Truth Social that now was not the time to be making motions to vacate.\n\n\"If we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything! Mike Johnson is a good man who is trying very hard. I also wish certain things were done over the last period of two months, but we will get them done, together,\" he said.\n\nNevertheless, Greene said she was thankful for Trump's support.\n\nGreene's move Wednesday was a sudden shift in tactics after she appeared to be backing off her weekslong threat, following back-to-back meetings with Johnson on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nIn between meetings, she had given Johnson a list of demands she wanted implemented, which included no more aid to Ukraine and defunding special counsel Jack Smith's office.\n\nABC News' Allison Pecorin and Rachel Scott contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene says she'll meet with Speaker Mike Johnson again Tuesday amid threat to oust him\n\nJohnson said he had \"a lengthy, constructive meeting\" with Greene and Massie.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie met privately on Monday, amid Greene's looming threat to try to oust him.\n\nEmerging from a nearly two-hour meeting inside the speaker's office, Greene said on camera they will have another meeting with Johnson on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"I just want to thank you all for waiting -- we just had a very long discussion with the speaker. We are going to be meeting again tomorrow based on the discussion that we've had. And so, we really don't have any news to report at this time,\" Greene said Monday.\n\nWhen pressed by ABC's Rachel Scott if Greene still plans to move forward with a motion to vacate, the congresswoman said: \"Again, we had a very long discussion with Speaker Johnson. We will be meeting with him again tomorrow based on the discussion that we had and then I'll have more information for you.\"\n\nAsked again if she plans to force a vote on a motion to vacate, Greene said: \"I have been patient. I have been diligent. I have been steady. And I have been focused on the facts. And none of that has changed.\"\n\nGreene said the meeting Monday afternoon was about \"ways to move forward for a Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\"\n\nJohnson said he had \"a lengthy, constructive meeting\" with Greene and Massie Monday afternoon.\n\n\"We have discussed some ideas, and we are going to meet again tomorrow,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson said he told Greene and Massie he understands their frustration, saying, \"I would really like to advance much more of our conservative policy on a daily basis here. But the reality is we are working with the smallest majority in U.S. history with a one-vote margin.\"\n\n\"We are going to keep this team together and work for the American people,\" Johnson added.\n\nThe meeting comes as Greene has said she will force a vote to remove Johnson from the leadership post this week .\n\nThe timing of when Greene plans to trigger the motion to vacate, however, remains unclear. The House held votes later Monday evening, and Greene did not act on the motion to vacate.\n\nThe Georgia congresswoman said last week she was moving ahead with her ouster effort despite pushback from many Republicans and a statement from Democrats that they would step in to help save Johnson .\n\n\"Mike Johnson is not capable of that job,\" Greene said in a fiery press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on May 1 alongside her co-sponsor Massie of Kentucky. \"He has proven that over and over again.\"\n\nGreene and Massie continued their criticisms of Johnson publicly on social media on Monday.\n\n\"This week we vote on whether Mike Johnson should remain as Speaker,\" Massie said in a statement on X . \"If you're happy with what he's done this year and if you're looking forward to what he will do the remainder of the year, you should join the Democrat leader Hakeem Jeffries in supporting Mike Johnson.\"\n\nGreene has dangled the motion to vacate the speaker's chair for more than a month. Johnson's defended himself from her criticism -- namely that he's worked with Democrats to keep the government open, provide foreign aid and more -- by emphasizing that he's a lifelong Republican, but must do his job to serve the entire House with an extremely thin Republican majority.\n\n\"This motion is wrong for the Republican Conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country,\" Johnson said last week of the ouster threat.\n\nJohnson also received a boost over the weekend from former President Donald Trump, who brought Johnson on stage at the Republican Nation Committee's spring retreat luncheon at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump praised Johnson \"for his leadership and work in the US House,\" emphasizing \"the need for party unity, collaboration, and expanding the GOP's House Majority,\" according to Trump's campaign.\n\nLast week, Greene denied she was defying Trump in pushing ahead against Johnson.\n\n\"I'm the biggest supporter of President Trump and that's why I fight every single day. And that's why I'm fighting here against my own Republican conference to fight harder against the Democrats,\" she told ABC News Correspondent Elizabeth Schulze.\n\nABC News' Alexandra Hutzler and Soorin Kim contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Johnson slams raucous congressional hearing sparked by Marjorie Taylor Greene's 'fake eyelashes' comment\n\n\"It was not a good look for Congress,\" Johnson said.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson on Friday said he is disappointed in the chaos and name-calling that happened during a raucous House Oversight Committee markup on Thursday night when Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez clashed over Greene's comments that Rep. Jasmine Crockett wore \"fake eyelashes.\"\n\n\"It was not a good look for Congress,\" the speaker told ABC News. \"We all -- I think -- need to control the emotions better and get the job done.\"\n\nTensions flared Thursday night during the committee's markup of a resolution to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over the audio recording of President Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur. However, the drama had nothing to do with that, and led to a nearly hourlong disruption where lawmakers shouted over each other.\n\n\"I think the decorum in the House is an important tradition to maintain,\" said Johnson, the top Republican in Congress who is known for his civility. \"So we'll be talking about that with our members. I think Hakeem Jeffries needs to do the same on the Democrat side.\"\n\nIt all began when the Georgia Republican made a crack about the Texas Democrat's eyelashes -- \"I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading\" -- which was made when Crockett pushed back to a line of questioning from Greene.\n\nDemocrats called for Greene's eyelash comment to Crockett to be stricken from the record and the congresswoman to be barred from speaking for the rest of the proceedings. Greene repeatedly shouted she was \"not apologizing.\"\n\n\"That is absolutely unacceptable, how dare you attack the physical appearance of another person,\" Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, said.\n\n\"Are your feelings hurt?\" Greene responded.\n\n\"Oh baby girl ... don't even play,\" Ocasio-Cortez shot back.\n\nThe proceedings devolved then into further chaos with lawmakers shouting over each other and Democrats repeatedly trying to force Greene to apologize. At times, House Oversight Committee chair James Comer said he struggled to hear over the shouting and repeatedly worked to bring order to the proceedings. Comer even called a brief recess to figure out how to parliamentary respond to Greene's remarks.\n\n\"Why don't you debate me ... you don't have enough intelligence,\" Greene said to Ocasio-Cortez during the exchange.\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., made a crack about Democrats on the committee not wanting to work.\n\nRep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., shot back, \"like showing up for a vote?\" -- presumably a jab at the fact that Luna and several other members missed much of Thursday on Capitol Hill attending former President Donald Trump 's criminal trial in New York .\n\n\"You have a lot to say being that you're on retainer for the judge's daughter. Sorry trust fund kid,\" Luna replied -- a reference to the daughter of Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing Trump's trial. The judge's daughter has been the target of Trump and Republican's criticism over her work for a digital consulting firm that they claim creates an \"ongoing financial interest\" tied to the former president's criminal trial .\n\nLuna also said Democrats should be disciplined for making unspecified cracks about \"Marjorie's body.\"\n\n\"I hope you brought your popcorn,\" Greene added, then moved on to talking about how her \"body is pretty good\" given how she is \"going to turn 50 this month.\"\n\nAfter a vote to strike Greene's comments failed along party lines, Greene eventually continued her remarks and the hearing continued.\n\nOn Friday, Ocasio-Cortez issued a statement on X criticizing Republicans and the failing of the vote to strike Greene's comments.\n\n\"Republicans VOTED in [committee] to allow the rhetoric that was used against Ms. Crockett last night,\" she wrote. \"Notice that when Dems have the majority, these things don't happen.\"\n\nLuna said Friday that \"a lot of people didn't realize there's a lot of disrespect early on against Ms. Greene.\"\n\n\"But look, I don't think it should ever elevate to the point of personal insults,\" Luna added.\n\nRanking member of the House Oversight Committee Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said the level of personal attacks were \"not acceptable.\"\n\n\"It was a radical breach of decorum to engage in personal insults based on physical appearance, and when [Greene's] words were not taken down immediately, it led to a lot of chaos, and it reflects very poorly on the whole institution, but certainly on the majority,\" Raskin said.\n\nDespite the chaos and disorder that unraveled during the markup on, the GOP-led House Oversight Committee ultimately voted 24-20 late Thursday to approve a report recommending a contempt of Congress resolution against Attorney General Merrick Garland for his failure to turn over audio recordings of the Special Counsel Robert Hur interview with President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Garland contempt resolutions now head to the full House for a vote.\n\nABC News' Sarah Beth Hensley contribute to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene attacks NPR and PBS as 'communist,' calls for funding to 'end'\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFollow:\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Wednesday used a DOGE subcommittee hearing to call for the defunding and dismantling of the company that provides NPR and PBS with federal funds.\n\nFor Taylor Greene and other House Republicans, today's hearing was about tarnishing PBS and NPR with accusations of bias and targeting them for defunding. For the broadcasters, today was about defending their existence.\n\nThe hearing, titled \"Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the heads of NPR and PBS Accountable,\" started at 10 am ET, and featured testimony from NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger, as well as a local station operator and a conservative critic of taxpayer-funded media.\n\nThe hearing, which was chaired by Taylor Greene, was meant to advance long-held Republican arguments against PBS and NPR, including that their programming is \"communist.\"\n\nIn the final minutes of the two-hour hearing that saw repeated conservative attacks on the public broadcasters, Taylor Greene said that \"we can look no further than the Corporation for Public Broadcasting\" as the culprit for US debt.\n\n\"After listening to what we've heard, today, we will be calling for the complete and total defund and dismantling of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,\" Taylor Greene said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on said Tuesday that the networks are a \"waste of money\" and claimed \"he would love to\" defund them. And yet the funding bill passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump earlier this month included $535 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the entity that disburses funds to 1,500 local radio and TV stations. Congress budgets money for CPB two years in advance, so the recent bill means public broadcasting is funded through 2027.\n\nThroughout the hearing, legislators pressed Maher and Kerger on their roles in allegedly circulating disinformation, accusing the pair of fostering newsrooms that cater to elite audiences.\n\n\"NPR and PBS have increasingly become radical left-wing echo chambers for a narrow audience of mostly wealthy, white urban liberals and progressives who generally look down on and judge rural America,\" Taylor Greene said at the hearing's overture before accusing the pair of \"grooming and sexualizing\" children, using DEI for listener demographics, and wasting taxpayer dollars.\n\nMaher and Kerger also faced attacks from Rep. James Comer, who, in addition to accusing NPR and PBS of peddling \"disinformation\" and \"propaganda,\" claimed the public broadcasters are obsolete in an age marked by a \"menu of media options\" that includes podcasts and satellite radio.\n\nCongressional Republicans repeatedly peppered Maher and Kerger with accusations regarding their coverage of the COVID-19 origins lab leak theory, Russian collusion, and Hunter Biden's laptop.\n\nMaher said that the public broadcaster was \"mistaken\" in \"failing\" to cover the Hunter Biden laptop story sooner and more aggressively. When Cloud asked Maher about the lab leak theory, the NPR boss emphasized that the outlet's current editorial leadership recognizes that \"the new CIA evidence is worthy of coverage,\" stressing that it has reported just that.\n\nMaher and Kerger spent the two-hour hearing defending their respective organizations, pushing back against conservative claims by stressing that most Americans trust public broadcasters to service local communities and provide a wide variety of reporting and educational programming. To elucidate her point, Maher noted that more than 60% of all Americans - and more than half of Republicans - trust public broadcasting to deliver fact-based news. Kerger noted \"there's nothing more American than PBS as a membership organization.\"\n\nLocal TV and radio stations also used the opportunity to justify their federal funding. From North Country Public Radio in upstate New York, to New Mexico PBS in Albuquerque, to Hawaiʻi Public Radio in Honolulu, publicly supported stations are using the right's political attacks to galvanize grassroots support and raise money from donors.\n\nHawaiʻi Public Radio CEO Meredith Artley, the former editor in chief of CNN Digital, wrote that her news and classical music stations are \"94% community supported,\" with the remaining 6% coming from CPB. If the federal funds were diminished, the Hawaii stations would survive, but \"there would likely be damage to the nationwide system that provides programming and infrastructure that HPR and many other stations rely on,\" she wrote.\n\nThat's the key point: It's a system. And smaller stations tend to need more help from the system. At KTOO Public Media in Alaska, for example, fully 30% of the budget comes from CPB. \"This federal funding is essential in ensuring that Juneau's only local-owned newsroom can continue to deliver you the news from our community,\" the station said.\n\nCongressional Democrats came to the public broadcasters' aid throughout the hearing, stressing that journalism and the free press are currently under attack by \"extremists\" and are needed \"more than ever.\"\n\n\"Public broadcasting is a tool for education, for emergencies, and a cherished part of our national fabric,\" Rep. Robert Garcia said. \"The majority and our chairwoman should drop this attempt to silence media voices they don't like.\"\n\nRep. Greg Casar chastised the committee for focusing on defunding NPR and PBS instead of DOGE's head, Elon Musk, whose companies - which include X, SpaceX, Tesla, and Starlink - make billions each year while still taking home $3 billion per year in government contracts.\n\n\"That's six times the money that goes to all of public broadcasting. Private insurers and Medicare Advantage overcharged taxpayers $83 billion,\" Casar said. \"Just last year, that could pay for public broadcasting 160 times over.\"\n\n\"To borrow a phrase from Sesame Street, the letter of the day is C and it stands for corruption,\" he said.\n\nPress freedom groups have also defended the public broadcasters. Ahead of the hearing, the Center for Democracy & Technology's president and chief executive, Alexandra Reeve Givens, called the meeting an attempt by the Trump administration \"to bully their perceived enemies and silence legitimate journalism.\" Reporters Without Borders executive director Clayton Weimars said he was \"deeply concerned the House hearing on bias in NPR and PBS is a political stunt that will create a slippery slope towards politicians dictating the programming of public news outlets.\"\n\nStations large and small also highlighted their local responsibilities.\n\n\"Whatever happens in Washington, DC - WQED is not going anywhere,\" Jason Jedlinski, CEO of Pittsburgh's PBS station, wrote on LinkedIn. His post listed recent features (segments about a local farm, a reading club, and so on) that, quite frankly, few other media outlets would spend time on.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misspelled PBS CEO Paula Kerger's last name.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene files surprise motion to oust Speaker Johnson, a sign of growing revolt from the right\n\nFollow:\n\nGOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia on Friday filed a motion to oust Mike Johnson from the speakership, according to sources familiar with the matter, amid anger about the government funding bill from the House Republican Conference's right flank.\n\nThe House would have to consider Greene's motion within two legislative days after she is recognized. The chamber is heading for a two-week recess, and Greene told reporters she would not call up the resolution Friday, which means the clock to force a vote has not yet started.\n\nGreene's motion is the most strident challenge to the Louisiana Republican's leadership to date, and is a sign of a growing revolt from the right.\n\nThe effort is a significant escalation of the inter-party divisions that have grown increasingly contentious since Johnson took over the speaker's gavel last year following the historic ousting of Kevin McCarthy. Greene's motion is the first official step toward launching that process again, a messy procedure that created a leadership vacuum and brought all House floor action to a standstill for weeks.\n\nJohnson controls one of the narrowest margins in House history and has had to rely on Democratic votes to advance some key legislation - including Friday's government funding package - leading to bills that reflect bipartisan compromise, which conservative hardliners reject as too liberal.\n\n\"I filed the motion to vacate today, but it's more of a warning and a pink slip,\" Greene said to reporters after filing the motion. \"I respect our conference. I paid all my dues to my conference. I'm a member in good standing, and I do not wish to inflict pain on our conference and to throw the House into chaos.\"\n\nGOP lawmakers who spoke with Greene told CNN that her plan is to use the two weeks of recess when the House is not in session to figure out when to bring the motion to vacate.\n\nAsked for a reaction by CNN, Johnson didn't respond, dismissing the question with a wave.\n\nAfter Greene filed the motion, she was swarmed by her Republican colleagues. A source close to the conversations told CNN that a number of fellow GOP lawmakers were trying to convince the Georgia Republican not to bring the motion. Two of the lawmakers who were there, GOP Reps. Barry Loudermilk and Kat Cammack, were observed to be in an extended conversation with Greene.\n\nShortly after Greene took the floor, GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin announced that he will step down in April, months before the end of his term, raising concerns that Greene's motion and GOP infighting could cause Republicans - who will hold a mere one-vote majority in the House following Gallagher's departure - to lose the chamber.\n\nNew York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler, a moderate, told CNN that Greene's effort is \"idiotic\" and \"does not do anything to advance the conservative movement.\"\n\nLawler added that while he doesn't believe the infighting will cost the GOP the majority, \"idiotic stunts don't help.\"  But GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma - a former House member who maintains close ties to his colleagues in the other chamber - warned that Republicans can lose the House due to Greene's motion.\n\n\"I think this causes real issues - real issues - for the incumbents and for our challengers out there, for the Republican Party if this goes through, because chaos in the House is 100% on us at this point, if this thing moves forward and they don't have a speaker,\" Mullin said.\n\nOn the other hand, Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, who chairs the Senate GOP's campaign arm, said the threat to Johnson and the GOP's slim majority \"illustrates the point that the House needs to expand its majority\" and will help turn out voters.\n\n\"(T)he American people are going to say, with the chaos right now in the House, it's very important that Speaker Johnson increases his majority in the House, and that the Senate is controlled by the Republican majority,\" he told CNN.\n\nMeanwhile, Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville was sympathetic to Greene's concerns.\n\n\"We're all disappointed with a lot of things that are in this bill. And I know she is, as conservative she is,\" Tuberville said. He dismissed concerns that the infighting makes it appear that Republicans can't govern, adding, \"We are fighting for the American people.\"\n\nLast fall, all Democrats voted alongside eight Republicans to oust McCarthy. But Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland signaled Friday that he would be open to helping Johnson if he was to take steps to put aid to Ukraine and Gaza on the floor.\n\n\"I'm not invested in the particular career aspirations of particular Republican colleagues. That's for them to sort out,\" Raskin told CNN. \"But I will make common cause with anybody who will stand up for the people of Ukraine, anybody who will get desperately needed humanitarian assistance to Gaza, and anybody who will work for a two state solution. I'm up for conversations with anybody.\"\n\nThis story and headline have been updated.\n\nCNN's Haley Talbot, Sam Fossum, Morgan Rimmer and Ted Barrett contributed to this story.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene silenced by GOP-led committee after calling Mayorkas a 'liar'\n\nHouse Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green barred GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from speaking further in a hearing after she called Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas a \"liar\" - a stunning example of how Greene's extreme rhetoric led even members of her own party to shut her down, creating tensions inside the House GOP.\n\nThe outburst took up considerable time during the hearing and threatened to overshadow Mayorkas's testimony - to the frustration of Republican committee members.\n\nA source close to Green said the chairman was furious with the congresswoman's behavior and planned to privately reprimand her, and also said he would encourage Speaker Kevin McCarthy to remove her from the committee if she ever had an outburst like that again.\n\nGreene told CNN on Thursday she was \"surprised and angered\" over the incident and said she already spoke to McCarthy. \"He agreed with me,\" Greene said, indicating the speaker believed she shouldn't have silenced. She also said McCarthy would never agree to pulling her off the committee. \"Speaker McCarthy is never going to let that happen,\" she said.\n\nGreene told CNN later Thursday that she and Chairman Green had a chance to talk but that they disagreed about what happened at Wednesday's committee meeting.\n\n\"He basically said that we have two different styles so we have a disagreement still about what took place yesterday, but, you know, I am still new to committees so I will make sure I am following the rules, which I do think is important, but at the same time I am still going to keep pushing,\" Greene said.\n\nGreene, a Georgia Republican, began her time during Wednesday's hearing by going after Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, who had shown an Instagram photo of her calling to defund the FBI. Greene brought up an incident from several years ago, when Swalwell was targeted by a suspected Chinese intelligence operative as part of a broader effort to establish ties with US politicians. Swalwell cooperated with investigators and was never accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nBut Greene, without evidence, accused Swalwell of having an intimate relationship with the Chinese operative.\n\nImmediately, Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman of New York moved to have those words removed from the record, calling them \"completely inappropriate.\" But the Republicans on the panel overruled and Greene refused to retract her comments.\n\nWhen Greene began speaking again, she accused Mayorkas of letting fentanyl deaths occur and called him a \"liar.\"\n\nWhen Mayorkas began to say, \"Congresswoman, let me assure you that we're not letting it go on,\" Greene shot back with, \"No, I reclaim my time. You're a liar. You are letting this go on. And the numbers prove it.\"\n\nThe top Democrat on the panel, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, interjected, seeking to get Greene's words taken down from the record for a second time. Even when given an opportunity to withdraw her remarks, Greene refused.\n\nThe panel's Republican chairman then ruled that Greene could not speak the rest of the hearing.\n\n\"It's pretty clear that the rules state you can't impugn someone's character. Identifying or calling someone a liar is unacceptable in this committee and I make the ruling that we strike those words,\" said Green, a Tennessee Republican.\n\n\"When we strike it does terminate the time of the individual who is speaking, so the gentlelady is no longer recognized,\" he added when Goldman asked for clarification.\n\nGreene left shortly after she was silenced.\n\nGreen defended his decision to silence the congresswoman, telling CNN Thursday her comments were a clear violation of the rules. But he also seemed to refute that McCarthy agreed with Greene's contention that she shouldn't have been silenced.\n\n\"I had a conversation that was maybe a little different with him,\" Green said. Asked if the speaker agreed with his decision to silence Greene, the chairman said: \"We didn't really get into the details of it.\"\n\nGreen also indicated she won't lose her committee spot. \"She understands and will comply with the rule.\"\n\nGOP lawmakers on the committee, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN that Greene's behavior was an unnecessary distraction and complained they had to waste valuable hearing time over the dust-up.\n\nRep. Tony Gonzales of Texas, who called Greene a \"friend\" that he has hosted in his district, said the incident was \"unfortunate\" and supported the chairman's decision to silence her.\n\n\"I thought he did a good job managing the committee as best as he could. But the sooner we can get back to kind of civility amongst colleagues, the better for everybody,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"Maybe we need to get everybody on a plane and take a CODEL somewhere and not be in Washington,\" he added.\n\nRep. Dan Bishop of North Carolina, who said he was not in the room when the incident occurred, told CNN he disagreed with Greene's rhetoric but stood by her sentiment.\n\n\"The rules about parliamentary conduct are such so that we can maintain this body and continue to have a dialogue that is difficult to have, but you do it without hurling insults. But the issue that drove it is real,\" Bishop said.\n\nAnother GOP committee member, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, said the party needs to keep its message focused on the border and dismissed questions about potential consequences for Greene's behavior as \"a McCarthy issue\" and said it's the \"speaker's call.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN's Manu Raju, Lauren Fox and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene calls far-right activist Laura Loomer's rhetoric 'huge problem' that 'doesn't represent MAGA'\n\nFollow:\n\nGOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene criticized far-right activist Laura Loomer on Thursday, saying that her \"rhetoric and hateful tone\" is concerning and a problem and \"doesn't represent MAGA as a whole.\"\n\nThe comments from Greene, a Georgia Republican who has her own high-profile history of incendiary and inflammatory remarks , come after the congresswoman called on Loomer to take down an X post, in which Loomer said if Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who is half Indian, wins, \"the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.\"\n\nGreene called the post \"extremely racist,\" and wrote in response on X, \"This does not represent President Trump.\"\n\nAsked by CNN's Manu Raju if she would encourage Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump not to keep close contact with Loomer, Greene said, \"This is such an important election. I don't think she has the experience or the right mentality to advise a very important presidential election.\"\n\nIt's the latest sign of infighting on the far-right as the presidential election nears, highlighting tension and divisions among Trump supporters over how the Republican Party and its presidential nominee should position itself to voters.\n\nAppearing dazed and flustered by an unfamiliar and fast-changing political landscape upended by Harris becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Trump has unleashed a torrent of mean-spirited missives, race-baiting insults and conspiratorial broadsides that even close allies and donors have acknowledged as unproductive in recent days.\n\nLoomer has been on a handful of trips with Trump, appears often at events where he is speaking and there have been times her bombastic social media posts have appeared to preview Trump's next line of attack.\n\nLoomer told CNN of the post: \"It's interesting how the media wants to, once again, falsely accuse me of being a racist. This is a woman who is on video cooking Indian food with Indian celebrities talking about how she likes cooking with curry.\"\n\nAsked by Raju about Loomer, Greene said on Thursday, \"I have concerns about her rhetoric and her hateful tone. To me, many of the comments that she makes and how she attacks Republicans like me, many other Republicans that are strong supporters of President Trump, I think they're a huge problem. And that doesn't represent MAGA as a whole.\"\n\n\"I just felt like it was time to call it out. I think it's wrong. We're not a party of identity politics,\" Greene said, adding that Republicans need to focus on policy, \"not attacking people for their race.\"\n\nAsked if she has reached out to Trump about Loomer, Greene said, \"I've spoken with President Trump, but I'm not going to go into the details of our personal conversation.\"\n\nGreene has faced her own criticism for racially charged and incendiary comments throughout her time in Congress.\n\nIn May, Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett criticized Greene, calling her \"racist,\" following a tense House Oversight markup that quickly devolved into personal attacks.\n\nGreene sparked outrage when she commented on Crockett's appearance. \"I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading,\" Greene said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters about the incident, Crockett said, \"That's all it is, it is racism. And she decided that she was going to be that person out loud and out front on yesterday.\"\n\nWhen asked by CNN's Abby Phillip why she believes Greene's comments were racist, Crockett said the Georgia Republican was echoing criticisms of her appearance that she often hears from MAGA supporters online and said that while other women in Congress wear lashes, she felt she had been singled out as a Black woman.\n\nAsked for comment by CNN at the time, Greene's office said, \"The only member that brought up any reference to color was congresswoman Crockett.\"\n\nHouse Democrats - along with some Republicans - voted in 2021 when they controlled the chamber to remove the congressomwoman from her committee assignments in the wake of unearthed incendiary and violent past statements from Greene that triggered widespread backlash from Democrats and divided congressional Republicans.\n\nGreene defended herself ahead of the vote in a speech on the House floor and attempted to distance herself from the dangerous and debunked QAnon conspiracy theory, which she has previously embraced.\n\nCNN's Alayna Treene, Kristen Holmes, Steve Contorno and Kit Maher contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene creates headaches for House GOP as leaders weigh how much attention to give the Trump loyalist\n\nFollow:\n\nGOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was a team player and a reliable Republican leadership ally for nine months under former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, willing to swallow tough votes and fall in line even when it meant defying her right-wing colleagues.\n\nAll of that has changed.\n\nNow, under Speaker Mike Johnson, Greene is increasingly acting out, from outbursts at committee hearings to unsuccessfully trying to oust Johnson from the speakership to pressuring House Republican leaders to take uncomfortable votes. Those actions have made the Georgia Republican - who was kicked out of the far-right House Freedom Caucus last year after feuding with members - persona non grata inside the House GOP Conference, where there is little patience for her tactics and where some Republicans have even been calling for Greene to face repercussions.\n\nIn the last two weeks alone, in the wake of former President Donald Trump's conviction in his hush money case, Greene has pressured Johnson to put on the floor a long-shot impeachment resolution against President Joe Biden and has called on the speaker to shut down the government this fall rather than continue to fund the Department of Justice - two ideas that more centrist Republicans are against.\n\n\"This is supposed to be a collaborative body, at least within your own conference, and she doesn't play nice in the sandbox,\" GOP Rep. Carlos Giménez of Florida told CNN.\n\nBut Greene is largely embracing her lone-wolf status and feels increasingly emboldened because of the backing she still has from MAGA supporters across the country - including from Trump, who recently endorsed her for reelection and tapped her to warm up the crowd during his rally in Las Vegas over the weekend.\n\nThose dynamics were on full display last month at a House Oversight Committee meeting that devolved into chaos that overshadowed its purpose, which was to vote on a resolution holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress - a top Republican priority.\n\nDuring the markup, Greene sparked outrage when she commented on Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett's appearance . But when Democrats requested that she apologize, Greene privately delivered a blunt message to House Oversight Chair James Comer.\n\n\"There's no f**king way I'm doing that. I won't apologize. And I'm not leaving,\" Greene told CNN of what she relayed to Comer, a Kentucky Republican. \"I don't care what happens in this committee room - I will not leave.\"\n\nSeveral sources who witnessed the interaction say Greene brought up her support with Republican voters as Comer debated how to defuse the tension, with Greene remarking that her \"people\" would not appreciate any effort to silence her - which some interpreted as an indirect threat that the MAGA base would turn on anyone who stands in her way.\n\nThe megaphone that comes from her mobilized following, sources say, impacts how her Republican colleagues handle Greene - even when they disagree with her or don't believe she has much sway, at least within the House GOP.\n\n\"They are over her, but they still fear her, because she has an incredible audience and fundraising mechanism and could turn that against you,\"  a GOP lawmaker told CNN.\n\nFor her part, Greene does not seem to care what her colleagues think of her. She has been openly warring with GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado , who sided with Democrats in a recent committee vote trying to silence Greene; campaigning against fellow Republican Rep. Bob Good of Virginia , who endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over Trump; and even called her own conference \"feckless, useless\" and one that \"does nothing.\"\n\n\"I've really gotten past all that,\" Greene said. \"I'm not interested in angering anybody or upsetting anyone. What I am interested in is being a part of a Republican conference that does something for a change.\"\n\nBut even as the internal disagreements with Greene stack up, she still has her share of close allies in the House, and some colleagues believe she brings benefits to their conference.\n\n\"You agree and disagree. Different issues come up,\" GOP Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina told CNN. \"She's with us more than she's against us.\"\n\nThe recent shift in Greene's behavior, in large part, can be attributed to the very different management styles of the GOP's two most recent speakers.\n\nAfter the controversial congresswoman first came to Congress in 2021 and was kicked off her committee assignments by Democrats and some Republicans for past racist and antisemitic remarks that appeared to promote violence , Greene was poised to become a loose cannon in the Republican conference. But McCarthy made a conscious decision early on to bring her into the fold, meeting with her regularly one-on-one and trying to make her feel involved. In turn, Greene saw the benefits of playing the inside game - such as getting her preferred committee assignments when Republicans won the majority - and McCarthy was able to largely rein her in.\n\n\"(McCarthy) kept her in Bubble Wrap,\" a GOP lawmaker, granted anonymity to speak freely, told CNN.\n\nJohnson, however, came onto the scene without the time or patience to build up good will with Greene. With a building-the-plane-as-it-was-taking-off mentality, the speaker had to navigate his unruly majority through the threat of multiple government shutdowns and did not have the luxury of laying groundwork with members who could cause him headaches. Now, as he looks to pivot into campaign mode ahead of November, Johnson is contending with just how much attention to give Greene as she dangles threats - serious or not - over his head.\n\nGOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska framed the internal debate over how to handle Greene in familial terms: \"You can only do so much. I have four kids, eight grandkids. You can't give all the attention to the one who is not behaving.\"\n\nAfter Greene's effort to remove Johnson from his job failed spectacularly , Republican leaders are less worried about her disruptive tactics and believe the failed vote exposed just how little following she has inside the House GOP.\n\nBut the GOP's narrow majority gives any single member the power to have at least some sway over the conference's agenda. Plus, though Trump disagreed with Greene's effort to depose Johnson as speaker, it doesn't appear to have impaired her standing in MAGA world. And Greene being untethered to any group dynamics adds to the likelihood that she could prioritize personal vendettas over what the rest of the conference wants.\n\n\"She is not part of any group,\" one GOP lawmaker said of Greene. \"She's kind of an island unto herself.\"\n\nWhile Johnson has not shown much of an appetite to play by Greene's rules, he has also made an effort to at least hear her out. Last week, he met with Greene in his office, where she laid out a wish list of actions she wants the speaker to take in the wake of Trump's conviction.\n\nThat includes putting a long-shot and politically dicey resolution on the floor impeaching Biden over problems at the southern border, defunding the special counsel's criminal investigations into Trump, and even letting government funding lapse - all in response to the former president's guilty verdict in New York.\n\n\"We aren't a serious country anymore. We're literally a banana republic. So what does it matter funding the government? The American people don't give a sh*t,\" Greene told CNN last week after her meeting with Johnson.\n\nIt's not the first time Greene has tried the unpopular move of undermining the committee process and House GOP leadership. Late last year, she threatened to force a vote on impeaching Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas before the committees leading the investigation had concluded their work. GOP leadership under Johnson ultimately convinced her to back off after they vowed to put it on the floor in the new year.\n\nBut impeaching Mayorkas, which failed on the first attempt on the House floor , was seen as an easier lift than impeaching Biden. Now, Johnson wants to avoid a snap impeachment vote against the president that would be doomed in the Senate anyway and would put the speaker's most vulnerable members in a difficult position that their Democratic opponents could use as a cudgel in November.\n\nA sweeping response to Trump's conviction like what Greene has proposed doesn't sit well with many of her Republican colleagues, even those who support the former president and believe the verdict against him was politically motivated.\n\n\"I don't think that you cure one hasty ill-advised action with another,\" GOP Rep. Nick LaLota of New York said of Greene's proposals. \"I think that she feels that the score will be settled if we do something equally as hasty here, and I don't think that's how the government should work.\"\n\nJohnson, who is under immense pressure from his right flank to go after the Justice Department in response to the Trump verdict and who has warmed to the idea of defunding the special counsel's investigation, defended his approach as he weighs different options.\n\n\"This is not retribution,\" Johnson told CNN last week. \"This is about trying to reset the parameters and to make the people trust our system again.\"\n\nThe day after her Johnson meeting, Greene again ruffled feathers among Republicans - this time, at a committee hearing about the origins of Covid-19, where she refused to call Dr. Anthony Fauci a \"doctor.\" That prompted the panel's GOP chairman, Rep. Brad Wenstrup, to reprimand Greene in the moment and instruct her to address Fauci by his proper title, which she refused to do.\n\nBut after the fact, Wenstrup was careful not to criticize Greene directly.\n\n\"I don't appreciate that both sides of the aisle seem to have some people that have different tactics,\" the Ohio Republican told CNN when asked about Greene's behavior.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Greene says she will force vote over Speaker Johnson's ouster next week\n\nFollow:\n\nGOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced Wednesday she will force a vote over House Speaker Mike Johnson's ouster next week - a move that comes after Democrats have said they will vote to kill the effort and ensure Johnson doesn't lose his job.\n\n\"I think every member of Congress needs to take that vote and let the chips fall where they may and so next week, I am going to be calling this motion to vacate. Absolutely, calling it,\" she said at a news conference.\n\nGreene's decision puts an end to weeks of speculation over whether she would move forward to trigger the consequential vote. The move escalates pressure on Johnson and sets up a major showdown on the House floor, even though the vote is expected to fail.\n\nJohnson has defended his leadership against the threat, saying that he will not resign and warning that a vote to oust him could cause chaos in the House.\n\n\"This motion is wrong for the Republican Conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country,\" the speaker said in a statement after Greene's announcement.\n\nMany Republicans oppose the push to oust Johnson and do not want to see the House GOP Conference devolve into disarray like it did after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a historic and unprecedented vote last year.\n\nGreene on Wednesday insisted she is \"absolutely not\" defying former President Donald Trump, even though Trump has defended Johnson, by forcing the vote.\n\n\"I'm the biggest supporter of President Trump,\" she said. \"I fight for his agenda every single day, and that's why I'm fighting here against my own Republican conference.\"\n\nGreene also said she has not made a decision yet if she will force repeated votes on the issue if the vote fails next week.\n\n\"I haven't made a decision on that yet,\" she said.\n\nGreene originally filed the motion to oust Johnson in March amid conservative anger over the Louisiana Republican's handling of the government funding fight.\n\nA floor vote to oust Johnson would require a majority to succeed, but it can still be preempted. A motion to table - or kill - the resolution could be offered and voted on first. That would also only require a simple majority to succeed.\n\nHouse GOP leaders plan to quickly take up and kill Greene's motion, according to GOP sources. Greene has yet to specify which day she plans to go to the floor and call for a vote. GOP sources say they could vote the same day she offers it, depending on attendance.\n\nAfter Johnson moved last month to pass a major foreign aid package that included aid for Ukraine, House Democratic leadership announced that Democrats would help Johnson keep his job by voting to table if the issue arose.\n\n\"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed,\" House Democratic leaders said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nBut on Wednesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would not commit to having Democrats save Johnson from multiple attempts to oust him if there are repeated attempts.\n\nJeffries said the Democratic caucus \"will take it one step at a time.\"\n\nGreene railed against Johnson on Wednesday for roughly 10 minutes, taking issue with his support for Ukraine aid and focusing on the recent announcement that House Democrats would vote to kill her effort to oust him.\n\n\"Now we have (House Democratic leader) Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats coming out, embracing Mike Johnson with a warm hug and a big, wet, sloppy kiss,\" she said.\n\nGreene said she didn't trigger the motion previously because she was being \"controlled\" and \"responsible.\"\n\n\"I was being conscious and caring about my conference in our majority. It was a warning to stop serving the Democrats and support our Republican conference and support our agenda. And he didn't do it. And we all went home and Republican voters everywhere, Americans were raging at Mike Johnson.\"\n\nDuring the news conference, Greene put a \"Make Ukraine Great Again\" hat on a photo of Johnson and Jeffries.\n\nA wide range of House Republicans immediately pushed back on Greene's plan.\n\n\"I disagree with that,\" said Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus. \"She had every right to do it, but it's not the time.\"\n\n\"Who's in line to take over, who wants the job? And I really hate, you know, with all the problems we're facing now - you see what's going on at campuses - you know, we got an election coming up,\" he continued.\n\nHowever, Norman acknowledged that he is still frustrated with Johnson's job performance so far.\n\n\"We expected more when Mike took office - and I like him personally, he's a very devout man - but the reason he's getting the criticism ... is because they expected him to fight,\" Norman said.\n\nRep. Marc Molinaro, a vulnerable Republican from New York, accused Greene of simply \"wanting more attention.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Mike Johnson will sustain the speakership. The speaker acknowledges the reality that we live in, and has been focused on conservative principles, acknowledging that we have to negotiate with another branch and another house that don't see the world, all the issues the same way we do.\"\n\nRep. Greg Pence of Indiana was also disappointed with Greene's announcement. \"I wish she wouldn't,\" he said, calling the speaker fight \"terribly painful\" and \"unproductive.\" \"We've got more important things to work on instead of that.\"\n\n\"Let's just move forward,\" Pence added. \"You know, God put our eyes in the front of our head so we would always look forward, and she's looking back.\"\n\nLater Wednesday, Greene dismissed concerns that her effort will hurt Republicans in November and said she doesn't give a \"rat's a**\" about what other members think of her actions.\n\n\"What you guys need to know is I really don't give a rat's a** what anybody up here says about what I'm doing,\" Greene told CNN. \"I care completely about the people in this country, and I cannot wait to put the entire party on record.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN's Morgan Rimmer, Melanie Zanona and Ailee﻿n Graef contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene testifies for more than 3 hours in hearing about whether to disqualify her from seeking reelection\n\nRepublican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia testified under oath for three hours Friday at an unprecedented disqualification hearing that focused on whether she is constitutionally barred from holding office because of her role in the January 6 insurrection.\n\nOn the witness stand, Greene repeated debunked claims that former President Donald Trump won the 2020 election, and even brought up false-flag conspiracy theories that the US Capitol was attacked by rogue FBI agents or racial justice activists who \"dressed up as Trump supporters.\"\n\nHer testimony, during an extraordinary all-day hearing in Atlanta, makes Greene the first member of Congress to answer questions under oath about their activities related to January 6.\n\nThe candidacy challenge was initiated by a group of Georgia voters , who are working with a coalition of liberal activists and constitutional scholars. They face an uphill climb to remove Greene from the ballot, and the judge on Friday appeared skeptical of some of their arguments.\n\nTheir lawyers grilled Greene about her ties to the far-right provocateurs and extremist groups who fueled the carnage at the Capitol. But her testimony did not establish that she had been aware of plans for violence or that she had coordinated with any rioters - and she deflected many questions about her activities before January 6 by saying more than 50 times that she couldn't remember.\n\nRelated article What to know about Friday's January 6-focused hearing on the bid to disqualify Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\n\"I was asking people to come for a peaceful march, which is what everyone is entitled to do under their First Amendment, but I was not asking them to actively engage in violence or any type of action,\" Greene testified, pushing back on the assertion that she had aided the insurrection.\n\nThe case revolves around a Civil War-era provision of the 14th Amendment, which says any American official who takes an oath to uphold the Constitution is disqualified from holding any future office if they had \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\" But how this applies today is a hotly debated legal question.\n\nState Judge Charles Beaudrot, who presided over the all-day hearing, is expected to issue his recommendation within the next few weeks. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, will then take Beaudrot's findings and decide whether to disqualify Greene from the May 17 primary.\n\nThe outcome in the case could have national implications, because liberal attorneys have said they will mount a similar challenge against Trump if he runs again for president in 2024.\n\nWithout direct evidence linking Greene to any rioters, the challengers focused on her rhetoric and how her calls to action in the weeks before January 6 had potentially inspired the insurrection.\n\n\"She was one of several leaders who gathered the kindling, who created the conditions, who made it possible for there to be an explosion of violence at the Capitol on January 6. And then, she dropped the match,\" Andrew Celli, lawyer for the challengers, said in his closing arguments. \"Now, she comes into this courtroom and says she's surprised and appalled that a fire burned.\"\n\nAt times, the proceedings felt like a legalistic cat-and-mouse game, with the challengers trying to pin Greene down on her previous comments, including some that appeared to stoke violence.\n\nShe said she didn't remember saying she opposed the peaceful transfer of power to President Joe Biden - right before lawyers for the challengers played a video of her saying just that. She denied calling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a \"traitor\" who might deserve the death penalty, but backtracked and acknowledged the comment when the challengers started to play the footage.\n\nCelli asked Greene if she had liked a Facebook post that said, \"a bullet to the head would be a quicker way to remove\" Pelosi. ( CNN previously unearthed the liked post, and others where Greene indicated supported for executing prominent Democrats.)\n\n\"I have had many people manage my social media account over the years,\" Greene replied, in reference to the threatening post about Pelosi from 2019. \"I have no idea who liked that.\"\n\nShe said she had never intended to promote violence on January 6 and that she didn't recall any conversations with lawmakers or Trump officials about disrupting the Electoral College count.\n\n\"I only believe in peaceful demonstration,\" Greene said. \"I do not support violence.\"\n\nShe also denied giving any tours of the Capitol complex before the attack, rejecting the still unproven allegation from some Democratic lawmakers that the rioters had insider assistance.\n\nGreene entered the courtroom to rousing applause and cheers from supporters. A court security official swiftly chastised the crowd and the judge later warned that outbursts would not be tolerated. Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who has joined Greene at events in support of the January 6 defendants, sat with her legal team for most of the proceedings.\n\nHer attorney, James Bopp Jr., called the hearing a \"political show trial\" and said the affair was a massive violation of her constitutional rights. When the challengers questioned Greene, Bopp repeatedly interrupted with objections - and the judge agreed on several key occasions, leading him to rein in the challengers and telling them at one point, \"You are pushing the envelope.\"\n\nBopp briefly questioned Greene on the witness stand, calling her a \"victim\" of January 6 and focusing on the fear she had felt while she was escorted to safety that day. She was on the House floor, objecting to Biden's electoral votes from Arizona, when the mob breached the building.\n\n\"i was scared,\" Greene testified, even though she later said that some of the rioters were patriots. \"I was concerned. I was shocked. ... I had no idea what was going on. ... I did not want to see anyone get hurt. It was very upsetting. I was very upset.\"\n\nThe hearing itself was something Greene had hoped to avoid. She had filed a federal lawsuit to shut down the state process - which is how GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn fended off a similar challenge in North Carolina. But in a blistering 75-page ruling on Monday, a federal judge rejected many of Greene's legal arguments and cleared the way for Friday's hearing.\n\nThe challenges against Greene and Cawthorn are backed by Free Speech for People, a legal advocacy group, and Our Revolution, a left-wing group founded by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. They are appealing the court ruling in North Carolina, which effectively killed their anti-Cawthorn efforts.\n\nThe burden of proof is on the challengers to show by a \"more likely than not\" standard that January 6 was legally an insurrection and Greene actively aided the insurrectionists.\n\nBeaudrot, the judge, said the legal questions at play were \"deadly serious\" and repeatedly tried to maintain some level of order during the circus-like hearing. Post-trial briefs are due next Thursday, and Beaudrot is expected to issue his recommendation sometime within the next few weeks.\n\nThe decision whether to disqualify Greene will be made by Raffensperger, who was infamously on the receiving end of a call where Trump pressured him to \"find\" enough votes to overturn Biden's surprise victory in Georgia.\n\nGeorgia's primary ballots are already being printed, so if Greene is disqualified, state officials will post notices at polling places announcing that she is not an eligible candidate and votes for her will not be counted. Greene can appeal a disqualification in state courts.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.\n\nCNN's Christian Sierra and Sonnet Swire contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "What does Marjorie Taylor Greene do all day?\n\nThe news that one of Marjorie Taylor Greene's Twitter accounts has been permanently suspended is a bigger blow to the Georgia Congresswoman than you might think.\n\nWhy? Because Twitter has been her preferred method of communication since she came to Congress in 2021. (Yes, it seems like she has been around Washington longer than that to me too!) Taking away one of her accounts then effectively cuts off a major communications tool for Greene. (Her official congressional Twitter account - @RepMTG - is still up and running.)\n\nThe suspension of Greene's main Twitter presence also raises another question: What does she do all day?\n\nRemember that Greene was removed from all of her committees by the Democratic-led House in February 2021 after a series of past posts advocating the execution of Democratic members of Congress and embracing elements of the QAnon conspiracy were unearthed online.\n\nCommittee work - particularly for a freshman in the minority party - is the backbone of many Members' experience.  It's how you learn the intricacies of how Congress works. And it's how you build relationships - both in and out of your party - with your colleagues.\n\nGreene has none of that. Sworn in on January 3 , 2021, she was ousted from her committees roughly a month later.\n\nWhich leaves Greene a whole lot of free time during her days as a member of Congress.\n\nTHE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of being removed from her committees, Greene spent her time filing motions to adjourn the House - a time-wasting maneuver with no real objective other than to annoy her colleagues. Four times in the space of two weeks in late February and early March of last year, Greene filed four separate motions to adjourn. Each time, every single member of the House had to come to the House floor and vote on whether the House should go out of session. Greene's tactic failed every single time.\n\nAsked by CNN back then why she kept using the time-wasting measure, Greene responded this way :\n\n\"Unfortunately there are some Republicans that are unhappy with these type of floor procedures because it messes up their schedule. But Republican voters really don't like that type of Republican mentality up here. They really want Republicans to stand up and stop these radical crazy policies. \"\n\n(Side bar: A motion to adjourn does nothing to \"stop these radical crazy policies.\" But, I digress.)\n\nIn search of what else Greene does with her days in Congress, I searched through Congress.gov to find out how much - and what - legislation she has sponsored since coming to Congress in early 2021. The answer? Sixteen total bill and resolutions . Here they are:\n\n1. A bill to award Kyle Rittenhouse a Congressional Gold Medal\n\n2. A bill to eliminate the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\n\n3. A bill to give Congressional Gold Medals to police officers who served during various Black Lives Matters marches around the country in 2020.\n\n4. The No Funding for Terrorists Act\n\n5. The We Will Not Comply Act (The bill would ban any discrimination based on whether or not you've received the Covid-19 vaccine.)\n\n6. The Fire Fauci Act\n\n7. The Protect America First Act\n\n8. The Gun Owner Privacy Act\n\n9. The Second Amendment Preservation Act\n\n10. A bill that would impeach President Joe Biden for his role in the pullout of American troops from Afghanistan\n\n11. A bill that would impeach Biden\n\n12. A(nother) bill that would impeach Biden\n\n13. A bill to remove California Rep. Maxine Waters from the Financial Services Committee\n\n14. A bill that would expel Waters from Congress\n\n15. A bill honoring Michael D'Angelo Garigan\n\n16. A(nother) bill that would impeach Biden\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nSo, one quarter of Greene's legislative action over the past year has been aimed at impeaching the sitting president. And more than a third of her overall efforts are either about impeaching Biden or getting Waters thrown off of committees and/or expelled from Congress. Not one of the nine bills she proposed became law. Not one of the seven resolutions she proposed were approved by the full House.\n\nWhich, of course, doesn't matter to Greene. Her goal, legislatively and otherwise, is to get attention. Media attention primarily.\n\nGreene is a new breed of Republican Members of Congress. She uses her platform not to legislate or move up the ranks of seniority or even to befriend colleagues but rather to build her brand. And that brand is as a unrepentant defender of former President Donald Trump and his \"America First\" policies.\n\nAnd it's worked. Greene is now, despite being just halfway through her first term, one of the most recognizable Republicans in the country. She is a constant presence on conservative media. She raised more than $6 million in just the first nine months of 2021.\n\nAgain, Greene is the new breed of Republican House member - one who has little interest in actually doing the job she was elected to do.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Marjorie Taylor Greene files motion to oust Mike Johnson as House speaker\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - Far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Friday filed a motion to oust Speaker Mike Johnson, doing so just as the House voted to avoid a government shutdown .\n\nJohnson, R-La., has served as speaker for five months, having taken over for Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted from the top job under a similar process.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the House would act on her motion, which requires just a majority vote to remove the speaker. Greene, R-Ga., did not file the motion as privileged - which would force a vote within two legislative days - but instead as a regular motion, which could be referred to a committee, where it would likely languish.\n\nGreene told reporters that her motion to vacate was \"more of a warning than a pink slip,\" saying she does not want to \"throw the House into chaos,\" like the three and a half weeks that the chamber was without a speaker when McCarthy, her close ally, was ousted.\n\n\"I'm not saying that it won't happen in two weeks or it won't happen in a month or who knows when. But I am saying the clock has started. It's time for our conference to choose a new speaker,\" she said.\n\nShe also said she had not discussed the motion with former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe House left for a two-week recess Friday and won't consider the motion until after it returns, an official familiar with the process told NBC News. The House will return to session April 9.\n\nRaj Shah, a spokesman for Johnson, said the speaker's focus is \"on governing. He will continue to push conservative legislation that secures our border, strengthens our national defense and demonstrates how we'll grow our majority.\"\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who forced the vote to remove McCarthy as speaker, told reporters Thursday that he doesn't support a motion to vacate the chair and evict Johnson.\n\n\"If we vacated this speaker, we'd end up with a Democrat,\" Gaetz told reporters. \"When I vacated the last one, I made a promise to the country that we would not end up with the Democrat speaker. And I was right. I couldn't make that promise again.\"\n\nAsked how that could happen, Gaetz said, \"We'd have Republicans cross over. I worry that we've got Republicans who would vote for Hakeem Jeffries at this point. I really do. I take no joy in saying that. But you can only vacate the speaker if you know that the party leadership won't change hands. I knew that with certainty last time. I don't know it with certainty this time.\"\n\nGaetz's move against McCarthy led to the first time in U.S. history that a House speaker was removed in the middle of a session. It sparked weeks of chaos in the thin Republican majority as they scrambled to find a replacement before settling on Johnson.\n\nSome moderate Democrats have previously said they would vote to save Johnson if someone attempted to oust him, not out of love for the current speaker but to avoid another fight over replacement that would bring all business in the House to a halt.\n\nRep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., said he'd be among the Democratic votes for Johnson.\n\n\"This is a comedy routine, the idea that they're trying to kick the speaker out for trying to keep the government open. It's absurd. So I'm fed up with it and I'll vote to keep him the speaker,\" he said.\n\nAnd vulnerable Rep. Susan Wild , D-Pa., said she, too, was leaning strongly toward rescuing Johnson though she hasn't made up her mind.\n\n\"I do not think that Speaker Johnson has been a model speaker or serves as a model for future speakers,\" Wild said in an interview outside the Capitol. \"Having said that, I really, absolutely, want to see us get work done, and the last thing in the world I want is another two- or three-week hiatus because it's really hard for me to imagine who would be next in line.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine that the Democrats would let this motion to vacate be successful,\" she added.\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called several times Friday for Democrats to join the majority of Republicans in saving Johnson. He said that Greene's motion would \"make chaos and create unnecessary distractions.\"\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., who voted to oust McCarthy, said Friday he wouldn't support a motion to remove Johnson. \"No, he's not lied to me,\" he said.\n\nBut Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., remained noncommittal on the motion to vacate, saying he wants to hear a plan from Greene for who would take over as speaker if Johnson is ousted.\n\nGreene had been dropping hints about her plans. Asked about a motion to vacate on Steve Bannon's podcast Friday, before the spending vote, she said: \"We are making that decision on a minute-by-minute basis today, Steve, and I think you can stay tuned. I urge you to watch what happens.\"\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Greene told NBC News, \"There's a lot of people talking about a motion to vacate.\"\n\nBut she didn't elaborate on whether or when she would actually file a motion. When asked why, she replied, \"All kinds of issues.\"\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\nJulie Tsirkin is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\nKyle Stewart is a field producer covering Congress for NBC News.\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., is struggling to find allies in her push to overthrow Speaker Mike Johnson after he put Ukraine funding to a vote , with many fellow hard-right Republicans saying they oppose her cause after a weeklong recess.\n\n\"I oppose a motion to vacate at the current time,\" said Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who led the \"motion to vacate\" that ousted Kevin McCarthy as speaker and has been critical of Johnson, R-La.\n\n\"I think that's pretty much not gonna happen. We're at too much of a slim majority,\" added another Florida Republican, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, who has been highly critical of Johnson but is worried Democrats could end up in the majority after another chaotic coup.\n\n\"I don't support what he's doing; he went back on his word to us,\" she said of Johnson. \"However, I'm not going to risk giving the gavel to a Democrat.\"\n\nGaetz and Luna weren't alone. Numerous conservative lawmakers who have blasted the recent Johnson-blessed spending bills and foreign aid package said as the House returned from a weeklong recess that they aren't ready to support Greene's push to remove Johnson. They cited a number of reasons: They worry it would disrupt GOP unity ahead of the election, they fear there isn't a better replacement, they believe it'd fail due to a thinning majority, and some say the time isn't right.\n\n\"I'm not hearing a lot of critical mass for it,\" said Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., who added that he doesn't expect the motion to come to the floor. \"I'm not hearing any chatter.\"\n\nAsked if he'd vote to remove Johnson as he did McCarthy, Biggs told reporters on Monday: \"I won't answer a hypothetical. What I've said is: It's not the time. Although I'm profoundly frustrated, disappointed and disgruntled, it's not the time.\"\n\nHe echoed Luna's worries that the House might end up electing a Democrat as speaker because Republicans are on the brink of a \"one-vote majority\" and if \"one person is out sick,\" they could end up being in the minority that day.\n\nRep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., said the motion would fail if it came up.\n\n\"I've left the door open, but, one I don't think it's good timing. Two, if it was triggered, I don't think it would pass,\" he said. \"I think that the Democrats would keep Speaker Johnson. I think they would save him. So I don't think it would pass. And furthermore, even if it did pass, I don't have much confidence with the conference that we have that we could get a more conservative speaker for the American people.\"\n\nCrane said he doesn't expect it to come to a vote, though he hadn't heard that directly from Greene. \"It's the little rumor mill,\" he said. \"I have not talked to Marjorie about this.\"\n\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said he's deeply frustrated by the speaker's actions. \"You just funded Ukraine. You just funded Israel. You just funded Hamas while you were funding Israel,\" he said, referring to humanitarian aid for Gaza civilians. \"You just funded a $1.7 trillion massive expenditure of government. You gave up all leverage that you have to deal with the border. So now we've got to get busy trying to convince people to elect us so we can do better next year.\"\n\nStill, Roy said he's more focused on the upcoming issues like passing a farm bill and the next round of government funding in October.\n\n\"We've been home, we've been talking to constituents. My constituents fully agree with my concerns, and frankly, made it known that they're angry about it,\" Roy said. \"They also want us to unify and beat Democrats. So we've got to do those two things. I think we can unify and beat Democrats with a clear agenda. And I think that's what we got to focus on right now.\"\n\nRepublicans in competitive districts are eager to put the issue to rest and focus on the upcoming election.\n\n\"If this is real, it's ridiculous, absurd and it undermines the institution and our work. If it's a bluff, it's a horrific abuse and waste of time,\" said Rep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y. \"And either way, put it to bed. Let's move on.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the top three House Democrats, led by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., issued an extraordinary joint statement Tuesday vowing that they would vote to save Johnson if Greene brought up her motion, saying \"the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction.\"\n\n\"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed.\"\n\nGreene missed votes on Monday, avoiding a pack of reporters searching for her, and her office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the Democrats' statement. But she hasn't taken the threat of ousting Johnson off the table.\n\n\"Johnson will do whatever Biden/Schumer want in order to keep the Speaker's gavel in his hand, but he has completely sold out the Republican voters who gave us the majority,\" Greene wrote on X .\n\n\"His days as Speaker are numbered,\" she continued.\n\nOnly two conservative colleagues - Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. - have co-sponsored her resolution. But neither gave clear answers about whether a vacate vote would happen soon.\n\n\"My understanding is Democrats are going to cover for him, so we'll play the psychological game,\" Gosar told NBC News, adding of Johnson's future: \"The seeds have been sown.\"\n\nMassie also had no updates when asked if or when it would come up.\n\n\"We're not going to talk about it right now,\" he said, adding that he's talked to constituents and \"I haven't gotten any blowback.\"\n\nBut Massie held his ground that Johnson should go.\n\n\"He's not inspiring anybody to give us the majority if he's going to be sharing the majority with Democrats,\" he said, accusing Johnson of deploying \"weapons of mass distraction\" from his policies, like his visit to Columbia to chastise campus protests.\n\nMassie said Trump's lukewarm support for Johnson is revealing.\n\n\"Sometimes by faintly praising somebody, you can kind of doom them. And I haven't seen a full-throated defense of Mike Johnson because, ultimately, Trump doesn't like a loser. And he's, I think he's worried about Mike Johnson and tying his future to that. And it would be a bad move to even campaign with him,\" the Kentucky Republican said.\n\n\"Mike Johnson is only going to drag Trump down.\"\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Thom Tillis, R-N.C., went after Rep.

She is a total waste of time,\" Tillis said in a recording reported by CNN and aired Tuesday evening.\n\n\"She is a horrible leader. She is dragging our brand down. She - not the Democrats - are the biggest risk to us getting back to a majority,\" the senator added.\n\nTillis' comments come after Greene has criticized the House's move to pass a long-stalled foreign aid bill . The $95 billion bill, which was passed by the Senate on Tuesday and signed by President Joe Biden on Wednesday, includes aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan as well as provisions that could bring about a national ban on the popular video-sharing app TikTok .\n\nThe package sets aside $60 billion in aid to Ukraine, $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian relief in Gaza. An additional $8 billion would go toward security in Taiwan and around the Indo-Pacific. The new legislation would also give TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, nine months to sell the platform or be banned in the U.S., a time frame that Biden could extend to a year.\n\nGreene did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment on Tillis' remarks. She has adamantly opposed further aid to Ukraine, calling Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., a \"traitor to our country\" after the House passed the bill and introducing a motion to oust him as speaker for his role in advancing the funding.\n\n\"Mike Johnson betrayed America once again,\" Greene wrote in a post on X following the House's passage of the aid on Saturday.\n\n\"House Republicans and the American people would be stronger without his disloyalty and betrayal of his principles,\" Greene continued. \"We need a new Speaker of the House!\"\n\nGreene had also criticized her GOP colleagues, writing on X , \"Here are the 139 Republicans who just voted against my amendment to strip every penny of your tax dollars from Mike Johnson's $61 BILLION Ukraine war spending bill.\"\n\nJohnson on Saturday said: \"I've done here what I believe to be the right thing, and that is to allow the House to work its will.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said Wednesday she will force a vote next week to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, daring Democrats and Johnson's GOP allies to step in and save his job.\n\nWearing a red \"MAGA\" hat, Greene accused Johnson, R-La., of betraying the GOP and going against conservative wishes on government funding bills, passing Ukraine aid and reauthorizing the foreign intelligence surveillance program without new warrant requirements, among other issues.\n\n\"So next week, I am going to be calling this motion to vacate. Absolutely calling it,\" Greene said at a news conference outside the Capitol. \"I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker and have to go home to their primaries and have to run for Congress again.\"\n\nMinority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and his Democratic leadership team issued a rare statement Tuesday announcing that Democrats would band together to protect Johnson by voting to \"table,\" or kill, a motion by Greene to oust him to promote bipartisan cooperation and return to normalcy.\n\n\"House Democrats have aggressively pushed back against MAGA extremism. We will continue to do just that. At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction,\" the Democratic leaders said in their statement Tuesday.\n\n\"We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed,\" they said.\n\nEven some of Johnson's other conservative critics have opposed Greene's push to depose Johnson and say it will go nowhere . She has just two co-sponsors.\n\nMoments after Greene's news conference, Johnson released a terse statement: \"This motion is wrong for the Republican Conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country.\"\n\nGreene has been threatening to move against Johnson for months, warning him not to pass emergency foreign aid for Ukraine while thousands of migrants cross the southern border . But last month, Johnson, after negotiations with the White House, pushed through a $95 billion national security package that included aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, along with a potential ban on the social media app TikTok. President Joe Biden quickly signed it into law.\n\n\"Now we have Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats coming out, embracing Mike Johnson with a warm hug and a big, wet, sloppy kiss. And they are ready - they have endorsed him, they are ready to support him as speaker,\" Greene said. \"They want to keep it going, keep the band together. Why? Because Mike Johnson is giving them everything they want.\"\n\nGreene labeled Johnson a member of the \"uniparty,\" a term hard-right Republicans use to disparage Republicans who work with Democrats to pass bipartisan measures. Behind Greene was a large poster of a photo of Johnson and Jeffries, with Jeffries passing the speaker's gavel to Johnson. A hat sat on top of the poster with the acronym \"MUGA,\" which Greene said stands for \"Make Ukraine Great Again.\"\n\nThe dynamic was much different with Johnson's predecessor as speaker, Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Last fall, Democrats decided to join with just eight House conservatives to make McCarthy the first speaker in history to be removed by a vote in the middle of the congressional term.\n\nHad Democrats decided to do the same thing this time, Greene would have had enough GOP support to topple Johnson given the GOP's razor-thin, two-seat advantage. Democrats' decision to stand by Johnson undermines Greene's efforts while at the same time giving her more political ammunition against Johnson and his allies.\n\nBoth Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., have signed on to Greene's motion. On Wednesday, Massie stood next to Greene and defended her from charges that she wasn't behaving like a serious lawmaker.\n\n\"She's the most serious representative up here,\" Massie said.\n\nAsked by NBC News whom she has in mind to replace Johnson as speaker, Greene replied: \"I'm not naming names, but I think we have people that are capable.\"\n\n\"Anybody that's willing to fight for our agenda. Anyone that refuses to share the power with Hakeem Jeffries,\" she said.\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nJulie Tsirkin is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

A question about discussing a member's \"bleach blond, bad-built butch body.\"\n\nA House Oversight Committee meeting Thursday night devolved into chaos amid personal attacks and partisan bickering in a rare evening session that was supposed to center on a resolution recommending Attorney General Merrick Garland be held in contempt of Congress.\n\nThe already tense hearing was derailed when Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., responded to a question from Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, by saying, \"I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading.\"\n\nDemocrats, led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, immediately moved to strike Greene's words from the record and make her apologize to Crockett.\n\n\"That is absolutely unacceptable,\" Ocasio-Cortez said over cross talk. \"How dare you attack the physical appearance of another person?\"\n\nGreene taunted Ocasio-Cortez, asking, \"Are your feelings hurt?\"\n\n\"Oh, girl? Baby girl,\" Ocasio-Cortez shot back. \"Don't even play.\"\n\nGreene attacked a second member just minutes after she criticized Crockett, asserting that Ocasio-Cortez did not have \"enough intelligence\" for a debate.\n\nGreene had asked Ocasio-Cortez, \"Why don't you debate me?\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez responded that she thought \"it's pretty self-evident.\"\n\n\"You don't have enough intelligence,\" Greene said as members of Congress audibly groaned at her attack.\n\nGreene agreed to strike her comments toward Crockett but vehemently refused to apologize for the evening's attacks, declaring, \"You will never get an apology out of me.\"\n\nAmid repeated demands from Democrats to strike Greene's words from the record and force her to apologize, Comer eventually ruled that Greene's insult of Crockett did not violate House rules against engaging in \"personalities\" during debate. When Democratic ranking member Jamie Raskin of Maryland sought to appeal the ruling, Republicans offered a motion to table, or kill, his appeal.\n\nAfter the vote, Crockett asked Comer for clarification to understand his ruling about personal attacks on members of Congress.\n\n\"I'm just curious, just to better understand your ruling,\" Crockett said. \"If someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody's bleach blond, bad-built butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct?\"\n\nChaos erupted again, with a member instructing Crockett to \"calm down.\"\n\n\"I have two hearing aids. I'm very deaf,\" the committee's chairman, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., said after cross talk took over. \"I'm not understanding - everybody's yelling. I'm doing the best I can.\"\n\nAfter Comer agreed to strike Greene's insult of Ocasio-Cortez, Democrats sought to enforce committee rules that would have prevented Greene from speaking for the rest of the hearing. Republicans voted to allow her to speak.\n\nComer ultimately called for a short recess amid debate over questions about a rule for members who have had comments struck from the record but wished to speak. Upon return, he reminded members to observe \"the House's standard of decorum.\"\n\nGreene was ultimately recognized to speak for more than four minutes, during which she reiterated that she would not apologize.\n\n\"I will not apologize for my words, and I will not change them,\" she said.\n\nNearly an hour after the hearing was derailed, the committee got back to debating whether Garland should be held in contempt of Congress for refusing to hand over audio recordings of President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur over his handling of classified documents.\n\nTensions were already running high after a long day, with Republicans peppering Raskin's opening remarks with interruptions.\n\nThe meeting had originally been scheduled for 11 a.m., but it was moved to 8 p.m. after several committee members traveled to New York to attend the trial of former President Donald Trump .\n\nThe committee voted 24-20 along party lines to recommend holding Garland in contempt following the contentious meeting. House Speaker Mike Johnson's office has not yet said when it would put the contempt resolution before the full House.\n\nRebecca is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the House.\n\nMegan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., accusing Democrats of \"worshiping\" George Floyd, a Black man who was killed four years ago at the hands of Minneapolis police.\n\n\"This is unhinged even for @RepMTG,\" the caucus wrote in a post on X. \"George Floyd did not deserve to die, and a member of Congress should have the decency to acknowledge his humanity.\"\n\nThe caucus' comments come after Greene posted a video on X of her answering questions from NBC News in the Capitol hallways about her defense of former President Donald Trump. In the video, Greene described Floyd as a \"convicted felon\" whom Democrats are \"still worshiping.\" It came during a rebuke of Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who suggested during a congressional hearing on the origins of COVID that some Republicans \"blindly worship\" convicted felons, days after Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nAddressing Dr. Anthony Fauci, who appeared for testimony before the panel on Monday, Raskin apologized for his Republican colleagues whom he said were treating him \"like a convicted felon.\"\n\n\"Actually, you probably wish they were treating you like a convicted felon. They treat convicted felons with love and admiration. Some of them blindly worship convicted felons,\" Raskin said.\n\n\"We have Jamie Raskin in there accusing us of worshiping Trump. Worshiping a 'convicted felon',\" Greene told NBC News in the clip.\n\nWhen pressed on the fact that Trump will be a convicted felon, Greene said, \"Well yeah, so is George Floyd and everybody - and you all too - the media - worship George Floyd. Democrats worship George Floyd. There were riots burning down the f---ing country over George Floyd.\"\n\n\"I'm tired of Democrat antics claiming Republicans worship Donald Trump,\" Greene wrote in the post accompanying the clip. \"I worship God!

Chauvin was convicted of murder and Floyd's death awakened a nationwide reckoning on racism and police violence.\n\nA spokesperson for Greene did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday night.\n\nTrump was convicted Thursday on 34 counts of falsifying business records tied to reimbursing his former attorney Michael Cohen for hush money paid to porn actress Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 campaign.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., emerged from his office and said the two will continue their discussions Tuesday morning amid her threats to force a vote to depose him .\n\n\"We're going to be meeting again tomorrow based on the discussion that we've had,\" Greene said, standing in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, though she did not elaborate on what she and the speaker discussed.\n\nShe would not answer any questions about whether she was backing off forcing a vote on a so-called motion to vacate the speaker's chair.\n\nBut the continued talks between Johnson and his loudest critic in Congress suggest that the two could strike a deal to avert a vote on Johnson's future that would be an embarrassment for the party six months before the November election.\n\n\"I have been patient, I have been diligent, I have been steady, and I have been focused on the facts. And none of that has changed,\" Greene said, surrounded by a phalanx of photographers and reporters. \"So I just had a long discussion with the speaker in his office about ways to move forward for a Republican-controlled House of Representatives. We're talking to him tomorrow based on our discussion today.\"\n\nThe meeting Monday afternoon came at Greene's request, GOP sources said. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. , one of only two Republicans who publicly support her effort to topple Johnson, also joined the meeting.\n\nSpeaking to reporters moments after Greene, Johnson called the meeting \"productive\" and said they had discussed several ideas.\n\n\"I told them, and I've said this repeatedly, that I understand the frustration; I share it,\" Johnson said. \"I would really like to advance much more of our conservative policy on a daily basis here but the reality is we are working with the smallest majority in U.S. history with a one-vote margin.\"\n\n\"It makes it very difficult for us, to use my football metaphor as I often do, [to] throw touchdown passes on every single play,\" he added.\n\nAt a news conference last week, Greene vowed to file a motion to vacate the speaker's chair this week - a move that would effectively force every House member to take a position on Johnson's future.\n\nIt would mark the second time during the past year that a Republican has moved to force a vote to remove the speaker of his or her own party; in October, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., forced a successful vote to overthrow then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif., paving the way for Johnson, R-La., to succeed him.\n\nIf it is brought to a vote, Johnson and his allies are expected to defeat Greene's efforts given that Democratic leaders said last week many of their rank-and-file members will back a motion to \"table,\" or kill, her motion to vacate.\n\nBoth Greene and Johnson are allies of their party's presumptive nominee, Donald Trump. But the former president has signaled his support for Johnson; the two appeared together during the speaker's recent trip to Mar-a-Lago, and he joined Trump onstage together over the weekend at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nSpeaking to reporters and posting on the social media site X, Greene has repeatedly disparaged Johnson as a \"Democratic speaker.\"\n\n\"Speaker Johnson is under control of Jeffries and Schumer,\" Greene wrote on X on Monday, referring to the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, both of New York. \"You want your son or daughter fighting Russia in Ukraine? Keep supporting Johnson.\"\n\nJohnson explicitly said he supports aid for Ukraine, in part, because he does not want to send American fighters to Ukraine; President Joe Biden has also dismissed such an idea.\n\nJeffries, during an appearance on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday, didn't disagree with Greene that Democrats are in the driver's seat, even though they have fewer votes than Republicans.\n\n\"Even though we're in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done,\" Jeffries said in the interview. \"Those are just the facts.\"\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\nAli Vitali is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News, based in Washington.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene files motion to remove Johnson as speaker\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nRepublican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to boot Speaker Mike Johnson from his chair on Friday, shortly after the House passed a $1.2 trillion spending deal to avoid a government shutdown that drew widespread opposition from conservatives.\n\nBut it was immediately unclear how many other members supported the Georgia congresswomanâs move, or when it might lead to a no-confidence vote.\n\nGreene did not file her motion to vacate as âprivileged,â which would have forced a vote within two legislative days, effectively guaranteeing a referendum on Johnsonâs leadership after the Houseâs upcoming two-week recess. Instead, she submitted it as an ordinary motion, which will be sent to a committee for review.\n\nâI filed the motion to vacate today, but itâs more of a warning than a pink slip,â Greene said while speaking to reporters on the steps of the Capitol. She emphasized that she did plan to trigger a vote eventually, but had no specific timeline â only that âthe clock has startedâ for Republicans to begin âthe process to elect a new speaker.â\n\nâIt doesnât have to be forced and throw the house into chaos. I donât want to put any of our members in a difficult place like we were for three and a half weeks,â she added, referring to the month-long leadership battle that ensued after a small group of Republicans toppled former speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nGreene accused Johnson of violating procedural rules that House Republicans had agreed to and of failing to win concessions on the border and abortion from Democrats during the spending negotiations. The government funding deal passed earlier on Friday with support from less than half the Republican conference.\n\nâYou know when another video that everyone is watching today? Itâs the illegals rushing our border military-aged men running over Border Patrol running over the Texas National Guard,â Greene said. âAnd Mike Johnson, the Republican Speaker of the House, handed over every ounce of negotiating power to Chuck Schumer and the Democrats and went ahead and funded the government. When this was our point of leverage.â\n\nA spokesman for Johnson said that the speaker âalways listens to the concerns of members, but is focused on governing.â Johnson did not address the motion directly in a later statement to reporters, but defended the spending deal.\n\nâDuring the FY24 appropriations process, House Republicans achieved conservative policy wins, rejected extreme Democrat proposals, and imposed substantial cuts while significantly strengthening national defense,â Johnson said. âThe process was also an important step in breaking the omnibus muscle memory and represents the best achievable outcome in a divided government.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nJohnson has found himself in an increasingly precarious position with hardline Republicans in the House, whoâve complained bitterly about the lack of policy wins in this yearâs spending agreement and staged a series of mini-rebellions by tanking routine rule votes. Johnson has been forced in turn to rely on Democratic votes to pass legislation.\n\nGreene, who backed Johnson when he ran to replace McCarthy, has become one of the speakerâs most vocal critics. In January, she publicly warned that she would file a motion to vacate his seat if he passed new aid to Ukraine.\n\nBut many Republican members have found themselves exhausted and demoralized by the constant infighting that has rocked their conference over the past year, which has helped fuel a spate of retirements by members known for their governing chops.\n\nThat exodus continued to speed up as Greene made her move on Friday, as retiring Rep. Mike Gallagher, who heads the Houseâs China committee, announced he would leave his seat April, further narrowing GOPâs razor-thin majority. Rep. Kay Granger said she would also step down early as head of the Appropriations Committee, well ahead of her own departure from Congress next year.\n\nSeveral GOP members lashed out angrily at Greene for continuing the cycle of dysfunction on Friday.\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, who faces a tough re-election campaign in New York, called her motion an âidiotic stunt.â Rep. Carlos GimÃ©nez said hardliner Republicans were unlikely to win more conservative victories by toppling a second speaker, given the partyâs tiny governing margin. âThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results,â the Californian said. âTheyâre not going to get a different result.â\n\nSome members of GOP leadership also dismissed Greeneâs gesture, though in more muted fashion. âI donât know what this accomplishes,â said Rep. Lisa McClain, the conference secretary.\n\nVice Conference Chair Blake Moore told Semafor that he simply didnât âhave any reaction to it.â\n\nStill, some appeared to at least leave the door open to supporting Greene. Rep. Thomas Massie told Semafor he felt âthis speaker failed miserably today,â and didnât comment directly on whether heâd vote in favor of Greeneâs motion. âI donât think itâs trying to get leverage. I think itâs a pink slip,â he said. Rep. Ralph Norman, another high profile hardliner, told Politico âweâll seeâ when asked about potentially supporting the motion.\n\nWhile speaking with reporters, Greene said she had âsupport on this from others in my conference,â but declined to name names.\n\nEven if Greene can win over some of her GOP colleagues, the speaker could potentially find support among Democrats, some of whom are already signaling that they would help the speaker keep his job if necessary.\n\nRep. Jared Moskowitz posted to X that he âwill never stand by and let MTG to take over the peopleâs House. Rep. Tom Suozzi, a moderate who just won a special election in Long Island, told CNN he would support Johnson because âitâs absurd that heâs being kicked out for doing the right thing and keeping the government open.â\n\nOthers said he would need to demonstrate more willingness to cooperate with Democrats first, for instance by bringing Ukraine aid to the floor for a vote. âThe ball is in his court,â New Democrat Coalition Chair Annie Kuster told Axios . âIf he is a fair actor with us, weâve got no reason to get rid of him.â\n\nJoseph Zeballos-Roig contributed reporting\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nThe US House of Representatives swiftly voted to defeat an effort by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday evening, with Democrats and Republicans banding together to extend a lifeline to the embattled speaker.\n\nThe vote to table the motion was 359-43. Greene, who began threatening the motion to vacate last month, had been negotiating with Johnson for days and as of Tuesday appeared to back away from the threat. But that changed Wednesday afternoon, as she announced plans to move forward with the vote. It was short-lived.\n\nAfterwards, Johnson called the vote âregrettable.â\n\nâI appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,â Johnson told reporters. âHopefully this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress.â\n\nThe effort was widely expected to fail. House Democrats, happy with Johnsonâs decision to move aid to Ukraine, vowed to protect him from a motion to vacate last week.\n\nGreeneâs antics had frustrated rank-and-file House Republicans, some of whom worried about the political impact of a GOP embroiled in divisions. Those concerns were shared by former President Donald Trump, who has offered support for Johnson and reportedly pressed Greene to back off on a phone call last week.\n\nâI will give her this credit. We basically said âput up or shut upâ she put up, and now itâs time to shut up,â Rep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y. said Wednesday afternoon.\n\nRep. Austin Scott, R-Ga. was among the scores of Republicans caught off-guard by Greene forcing a snap vote on Johnson. He called Greeneâs effort âabsolutely counterproductiveâ and damaging to Republicans.\n\nâThe place canât function if youâre changing the Speaker of the House every six months,â he said.\n\nTrump weighed in shortly after the vote, expressing admiration for Greene while insisting that âthis is not the timeâ for a motion to vacate. He characterized Johnson as a âgood man who is trying very hard.â\n\nâI absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene. Sheâs got Spirit, sheâs got Fight, and I believe sheâll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come,â Trump wrote on Truth Social. âHowever, right now, Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country. With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, weâre not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.â\n\nTrump added: âif we show DISUNITY, which will be portrayed as CHAOS, it will negatively affect everything!â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "âFake newsâ no more: Marjorie Taylor Greeneâs journey to 60 Minutes\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene âexpected a hit jobâ when she decided to open her doors to CBSâ 60 Minutes, which gave her a star turn in their opening segment on Sunday. Itâs a program known for its sometimes strained relationship with Republicans.\n\nBut before it even aired, she was already tweeting out a tribute to âlegendary iconâ Lesley Stahl, who interviewed her, and calling it an âhonorâ to participate. And when she saw the results, she was more than satisfied.\n\nâIt wasnât bad!â she told Semafor on Sunday night. âI thought it was pretty good. And Iâve gotten nonstop text messages from, golly, so many people in my district and my family and my friends.â\n\nMTG: Friend of the press. Itâs not the look sheâs known for, but one sheâs been trying out more in recent months.\n\nâI donât call you guys âfake news.â I used to,â she said. Her last tweet using the term was in November.\n\nGreene gave her full participation to 60 Minutes, the crown jewel of TV profiles. The resulting episode mixed human interest â the Congresswoman showed off her weightlifting skills âÂ and hardball questions, with Stahl bringing up some of her most incendiary social media posts and Greene defending her use of âparty of pedophilesâ to describe Democrats.\n\nSome in the press are wary of greenlighting more deep-dive stories just because sheâs amassed more relevance â sheâs âderanged as ever,â Roll Call columnist Walter Shapiro warned earlier this year, despite âludicrous narratives of change and growthâ in recent features. The 60 Minutes segment was not without similar critics.\n\nBut Greene, who said sheâs âdefinitely open to more mainstream media interviews,â swears her latest turn is not part of some broader scheme or master plan. Sheâs just had a change of heart.\n\nIn this article:\n\nTo find out what was behind Greeneâs recent media push, I decided to join it. We agreed to a series of interviews before and after her 60 Minutes appearance.\n\nBy the time I entered Greeneâs office last Tuesday, she and her communications director Nick Dyer were already constructing a quote tweet in response to being banned by Twitter for a post referencing a âTRANS DAY OF VENGEANCE,â a radical left wing protest (later canceled ) that had gone viral on the right. A separate tweet, in which she had speculated immediately after the shooting at a Nashville Christian school about whether the attackerâs transgender identity was responsible, was drawing far more heat outside the office.\n\nFor her follow-up, she and Dyer tagged Elon Musk for an explanation as to why her government account was blocked for violating the appâs violent speech terms. She was banned again. And then a third time before the interview was over.\n\nâCan you call Tucker Carlson?â she asked her staff. Not frantically, but like someone who had been through this several times before. Greene was locked out permanently at one point, before Musk let her back. Dyer paced as she texted a contact in Speaker Kevin McCarthyâs office who she had called on before to step in after getting booted off the app.\n\nBehind her loomed an oversized American flag made of painted and stained two-by-fours gifted by a friendâs daughter. She sat in one of two upholstered wingback chairs she purchased for her newly renovated office. And to her right, atop a marble coaster, a 16 oz. can of Monster Energy Ultra, sugar-free.\n\nWhen our conversation began, she was inviting and didnât shy away from questions that, in the past, might have prompted a fierce response. Greene did not take offense to being asked whether her plan for a ânational divorceâ between red and blue areas was inspired by her own recent divorce from her husband. She knows other people are making the connection, but says her âpersonal lifeâ was not a factor.\n\nâI didnât want to say âsecessionâ because thatâs not what Iâm talking about,â she said. âAnd to me, divorce, of course, is settled in the court. So thatâs legal and lawful. Thatâs why I use that term.â\n\nThe idea, which Greene relentlessly promoted during a February House recess, got enough attention that Axios polled it (only 20% of Americans liked the concept). Few Republicans seemed eager to follow her lead. Utah Governor Spencer Cox called her rhetoric âevil.â\n\nGreene frequently lashed out at Congressional reporters in her first months in office, a period in which pro-Trump rioters attacked the Capitol and Democrats â with some Republican backing â stripped her of her committee assignments over social media activity discussing violence against political opponents, like then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Many profiles mentioned her old posts rallying against a âglobal cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophilesâ and calling Q, the anonymous figure behind the conspiracy theory, a âpatriot.â\n\nSince then, Greene has gone from pariah to power broker, with plum committee assignments, a political mentor in McCarthy, and the ongoing support of Donald Trump, who recently suggested she run for Senate. President Biden, who initially ignored her, has also raised her up as a foil in speeches and tweets denouncing âMAGA Republicans.â\n\nWhen she took office, Greene said she had renounced the Qanon-infused social media diet that made her infamous when she won her first primary. Sheâs since played it off as a relatable failing âÂ one that happens to âa lot of peopleâ before they figure things out.\n\nâI started seeing things and I was like âum, no,ââ she told me. âJFK, Jr. is not alive. Can we just be real?â\n\nAsked where she gets her information now, Greene said she relies on staff briefings, but has also become more confident in her ability to âverifyâ things she sees online before sharing.\n\nHer mood towards the press has mellowed as her influence has grown. She cites a number of factors that contributed to the change.\n\nâWell, I turned a corner sometime last year,â she said. âIt took time. It was just a shift in my thinking, just by being here and observing everything.â\n\nOne key moment came after meeting with the father and brother of Julian Assange, the Wikileaks founder who was indicted in 2019 for his alleged role in acquiring and leaking military documents from former Army analyst Chelsea Manning. Some news organizations, including The New York Times, have denounced the charges as setting a dangerous precedent.\n\nâThat weighed heavy on me and I thought, âGosh, what kind of country are we going to become if the press canât tell the truth?ââ she said. âSeeing Julian Assange be extradited by the U.S. government must be pretty scary if youâre a person working in the press because youâre like: âOh, what if you come across a big story?ââ\n\nShe credits her communications director for coordinating a press bus tour in the district as the start of her being more open to other outlets. Among the journalists who visited were Molly Ball of TIME, Robert Draper of the New York Times and The Atlanta Journal Constitutionâs Patricia Murphy.\n\nâI thought, as painful as it might be, okay, Iâm going to open the door and Iâm just going to be myself,â she said.\n\nGreene has also been dating Brian Glenn, program director for the site Right Side Broadcasting Network, since late last year and admits he has also had an influence on her outlook towards the press.Â\n\nâHeâs from the industry, so he is a great resource,â she said. âHeâs explained a lot, like how things work and yeah, itâs great. So maybe Iâm falling in love with the press. Is that whatâs happening, Kadia?â\n\nShe even had some advice for Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, whoâs expected to launch a presidential campaign but has largely shunned national media outside the conservative movement.\n\nâI think journalism is really important,â she said. âAnd I think our First Amendment and freedom of the press is something that we have to protect and we also have to respect it. So if I could give him advice, I would say: Talk to all the press.â\n\nItâs all just the latest transition for Greene, the construction company owner, turned Crossfit competitor, turned Crossfit gym owner, turned member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nSome see her newfound media tour as part of an audition to join Trumpâs ticket. Sheâs certainly absorbed his ability to set news cycles on fire and bait opponents into a response, which has continued unabated. In recent weeks, sheâs shouted âLiar!â at President Biden during the State of the Union, brought a mock Chinese spy balloon to Congress, and promoted her ânational divorceâ between red and blue areas.\n\nMost recently, she called for protests (âlawfully and peacefully,â she said) in response to Trumpâs indictment âÂ something Republicans, including McCarthy, have been very reluctant to encourage after his supporters rioted on January 6th. Even Greene initially shot down the idea when Trump first floated it.\n\nâWell, I changed my mind because we â itâs our First Amendment right,â she said. âAnd we have a right to protest. And itâs so absolutely horrible what Alvin Bragg has done, and heâs truly crossed the line with our justice system.â\n\nThe pro-Trump rally, which is scheduled for Tuesday in New York, is being organized by the New York Young Republican Club, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has condemned for hosting âwhite nationalistsâ and other extremist figures.\n\nâIf anyone shows up and tries to dress like a Trump supporter, or dresses in MAGA, and they are breaking the law or inciting or committing violence, or doing anything wrong, I will reject those people so hard and fast,â she said. âItâs not even funny.â\n\nGreeneâs self-confessed tumble down an online rabbit hole also has not kept her from associating with the kinds of dark figures currently residing at its bottom. Before Trump dined with Nazi sympathizer Nick Fuentes, Greene spoke to a conference organized by him last year alongside conservative gathering CPAC, whose organizers have banned him.\n\nThat drew a rare rebuke from McCarthy, but Greene stood her ground, saying she was not aware of Fuentesâ views, but wanted to reach his young followers.\n\nâIâm not inviting anybody into my home or my personal life or befriending them,â she told Semafor when asked about the episode. âI want to spread the right message to anyone thatâs willing to listen to me.â\n\nGreene added sheâs against âcanceling anybodyâ and that people who made âmistakesâ can be redeemed. In her eyes, sheâs putting them on a track toward more productive roles in society. But by refusing to put any guardrails on whoâs allowed on the right, it means Republican leaders also have to answer for them when they praise Adolf Hitler â something they have been less than pleased to do. And anti-hate groups worry that giving them attention expands their reach into more mainstream corners, raising the risk they infect Greeneâs audience with antisemitic and white supremacist ideas rather than Greene converting them into something else.\n\nEven as many Democrats and moderate Republicans react in horror to Greeneâs rise, she finds herself at odds lately with yet a different faction of her Congressional colleagues. Hard right members like Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo. have clashed with her over her support for McCarthy.\n\nGreene believes she was misled by some close conservative allies in the House early in her first term who tried to use her âkind of like a weapon in some wayâ by convincing her that McCarthy supported taking away her committee seats. After she determined the claim was false, the incident left her more skeptical about the rebels who would go on to oppose him for speaker.\n\nâThink about it, if the people that you trust and align yourself with told you something that you found out was a lie, and wasnât true, but they were constantly telling it to you,â she said. âI knew I was a victim of manipulation in another way.â\n\nI spoke to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., another very online member of Congress who has been intensely critical of Greene, to get her thoughts. She politely suggested the media be deliberate in deciding where to put its spotlight.\n\nâWeâve been at a point where these kinds of extreme and really just unprecedented and dangerous notions are getting platforms, without much pushback or real kind of critical analysis,â she told Semafor.\n\nMatt Gertz, who tracks conservatives for the progressive group Media Matters, also condemned 60 Minutes for their âcredulousâ profile.\n\nâAnyone who believes that the congresswoman from QAnon is serious about renouncing far-right radicalism and conspiracy theories should make me an offer on my Jewish space laser,â he said in an email. âLess than 48 hours after CBS News gives her a mainstream platform to airbrush her image, Marjorie Taylor Greene will be rallying with Jack Posobiec of Pizzagate fame and the quasifascists of the New York Young Republican Club to defend Donald Trump from what she calls the âpolitical persecutionâ of a âSoros-backedâ district attorney.

      "text": "Greene signals sheâll force vote on Johnsonâs speakership after Democrats vow to protect him\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is signaling sheâll pull the trigger on a motion to remove Speaker Mike Johnson, after Democratic leaders vowed that they would block any vote to oust him.\n\nâIf the Democrats want to elect him Speaker (and some Republicans want to support the Democratsâ chosen Speaker), Iâll give them the chance to do it,â Greene, who has bitterly feuded with Johnson over issues including the budget and Ukraine, posted to X. âIâm a big believer in recorded votes.â\n\nIn a joint statement Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Minority Whip Katherine Clark, and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar ended weeks of speculation by confirming that their party would chip in to save Johnson from a no-confidence vote. Johnson has faced the prospect of a showdown over his job since last month, when Taylor Greene introduced a motion to vacate him from the speakerâs chair. Some individual Democrats, such as Rep. Tom Suozzi, had previously said they would vote to stop the measure. But most appeared to be waiting for a signal from leadership before making any commitments, even after Johnson worked with Democrats to finally pass a bipartisan deal on Ukraine aid through Congress.\n\nâAt this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction,â the Democratic leaders said in their statement. In it, the trio promised that they would vote to table Taylor Greeneâs motion to vacate, effectively stopping it dead. âIf she invokes the motion, it will not succeed.â\n\nA Democratic leadership source said that Johnson did not know ahead of time that Jeffries and his deputies planned to release the letter, but he was aware they were possibly interested in providing him âwith a safe landing.â\n\nThe source added that Democrats saw a motion to table as more palatable than backing Johnson outright in a floor fight. âLeadership wanted to give Democratic members a less nuclear option while avoiding the appearance of whipping a vote to save another Republican speaker,â they said.\n\nNew Democrats Chair Annie Kuster told Semafor that her party would block any motion to vacate Johnson âas long as weâre working in good faith, and heâs dealing as an honest broker.â\n\nIt is unclear how much support Greene had within her own party to challenge Johnson. She has only been able to attract two other cosponsors on her motion to vacate, Reps. Thomas Massie and Paul Gosar. Other Republicans expressed little interest in participating in another party revolt six months after Kevin McCarthy lost his seat through the same procedure which knocked the House into a perilous three-week speakerless jaunt.\n\nJoseph Zeballos-Roig contributed reporting\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. isnât backing down after calling Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo. a âlittle bitchâ to her face on the House floor Wednesday during a fight over their dueling efforts to impeach President Joe Biden.\n\nAsked whether there was any chance the two would reconcile after the confrontation, Greene said: âAbsolutely not.â\n\nâShe has genuinely been a nasty little bitch to me,â Greene told Semafor. (Their fight was first reported by The Daily Beast.)\n\nGreene acknowledged that the feud between the two hard-right stars has been sizzling since the last Congress. She said Wednesdayâs explosive fight began over public comments she made earlier that day, effectively accusing Boebert of trying to hijack her own efforts to impeach the president.\n\nGreene introduced impeachment articles against Biden as early as January 2021 and then again this May . Boebert put forward her own impeachment articles more recently but has been trying to force an immediate vote on them by turning them into a so-called âprivileged resolutionâ that can go straight to the floor.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday morning, Greene said that Boebert had âbasically copied my articles,â then tried to leapfrog her. Later in the afternoon, she says Boebert confronted her about what sheâd said to the press.\n\nâI was sitting down, and so I stood up and I said, âIâm happy to clarify my public statements to your face,ââ she told Semafor. âI told her exactly what I think about her.â\n\nGreene said she told Boebert she was upset that the Colorado lawmaker had decided to imitate rather than support her own impeachment effort.\n\nâItâs purely for fundraising,â she told Semafor. âItâs throwing out red meat so that people will donate to her campaign because sheâs coming up on the end of the month, and sheâs trying to produce good fundraising numbers.â\n\nGreene said that at one point in the fight, parts of which were caught from afar on video, Boebert accused the Georgia lawmaker of accidentally spitting on her lip. Then, toward the end of the exchange, Boebert tried to re-engage her, but she cut the conversation off. âI said âyou need to shut up because the only person thatâs recognized to speak right now is Luna,ââ she told Semafor, referring to Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., who was then giving a speech on the floor.\n\nBoebert did not respond to a request for comment. Her impeachment drive suffered a setback Wednesday, however, when House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters he would refer her resolution to the House Judiciary Committee, meaning it wonât see an immediate vote.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Why you should pay attention to Marjorie Taylor Greeneâs transgender care bill\n\nKadia is a Political Reporter for Semafor, joining us from Buzzfeed News. for the daily Principals newsletter to get our insiderâs guide to American power.\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. introduced the Protect Childrenâs Innocence Act last month, which would restrict gender-affirming care, including puberty blockers and hormone therapies, for individuals under 18 years old.\n\nâItâs not about anyoneâs chosen sexuality or what adults choose to do with their bodies,â Greene told Semafor. âItâs just about protecting kids and letting them grow up before they make permanent changes.â\n\nUnder Greeneâs bill, anyone caught performing a list of targeted procedures could be charged with a Class C felony. The bill would also prohibit individuals from using federal funds to pay for gender-affirming care and revoke accreditation for higher education institutions that teach gender-affirming care.\n\nThe proposal currently has 46 co-sponsors, all Republican. Democrats, Iâm told, havenât publicly responded to Greeneâs bill for fear of boosting it.\n\nIn this article:\n\nGreeneâs not usually known for her legislation, but her bill tracks closely with similar Republican proposals at the state level, making it worth watching.\n\nIn states like Arizona, Tennessee, Texas, Florida, and Alabama, governors have either signed bills or taken executive action to restrict gender-affirming care for minors. In Arkansas, the legislature overrode a veto by Gov. Asa Hutchinson to pass a ban.\n\nConservative activists and media have fanned the flames around a variety of topics related to transgender youth this cycle, including health care, sports, and education, amid a national rise in self-identified transgender students. Should Republicans win a majority, theyâll face pressure from their base to act on these issues.\n\nThat doesnât mean Greeneâs bill would be the one that advances. Right now leadership has not promoted it and it has little support outside the House GOPâs right flank. That may have more to do with Greeneâs reputation as an extremist among her colleagues than it does with the particulars of the bill, however.\n\nâI would be on the bill if it were anyone elseâs bill,â a more centrist Republican member told Semafor. âBut itâs her, and well, hard pass.â\n\nRep. Marie Newman D-Ill., who has a transgender daughter, said Democrats are focused on securing the House majority âto keep very ugly, ineffective and hateful legislation off the House floor and the Senate floor.â\n\nNewman and Greene have neighboring congressional offices. The two made news last year after posting dueling Twitter videos . First Newman shared footage of her placing a transgender flag outside of her office door to protest Greene trying to delay a vote on the Equality Act. Greene responded by posting a sign outside of her door that read, âThere are TWO genders: Male & Female. Trust The Science.â\n\nTransgender health care has been a major debate across Europe among policymakers â as well as a rallying cry for politicians on the right.\n\nIn England, the National Health Service has been reviewing and reorganizing its youth treatment programs in response to reported concerns ranging from long wait times to inconsistent care. In June, it announced plans to close the stateâs only dedicated hub for youth gender care and replace it with a system of regional clinics.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greeneâs votes could play a starring role in Democratic ads\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nGet ready to hear a lot about Marjorie Taylor Greene as next yearâs congressional elections rev up.\n\nDemocrats are looking to make the Republican from Georgia one of their chief foils as they attempt to wrestle back control of the House next year, and one major political group is already laying the groundwork to link other GOP members with Greene.\n\nThe new âMAGA Scorecardâ released Thursday from the Center for American Progress Action Fund stacks up all 222 House Republicans against Greeneâs voting record. The report indicates that the vast majority of the House GOP conference has voted alongside her 92% of the time. The figure varies little for the five vulnerable swing-district members from New York, who voted with her at least 85% of the time.\n\nâThey are continuing to move further and further towards the extreme parts of their party and their voting record shows it,â Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash. and chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told Semafor.\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe White House has been eager to cast Greene as the face of âultra-MAGAâ Republican extremism, so itâs no surprise to see Democratic campaign outfits join the effort. Theyâre essentially betting that they can tie relatively moderate swing-district Republicans to her positions much the way the GOP cast even middle-of-the-road Democrats as far-left activists yearning to strip funding from law enforcement in 2020.\n\nâIt certainly had an impact on us when they were painting us as âdefund the police.â They were taking the democratic socialist message and applying it to Abigail Spanberger,â Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va. told Semafor. âWe got really hurt.â\n\nIn last yearâs midterms, though, Democrats pivoted to portraying Republicans up and down the ballot as âMAGA extremistsâ âÂ and experienced the strongest showing from a party controlling the White House in decades. They seem eager to build on that strategy again in 2024.\n\nFor Democrats, Greene will likely serve as a useful face for negative ads while pitching voters on their partyâs achievements on infrastructure, clean energy and domestic manufacturing in positive spots. Some individual candidates have already begun tracking her votes along with their opponents.\n\nRep. Ann Kuster, D-N.H. told Semafor that she believes it will boost campaigns like hers ( ranked likely Democrat by Cook Political Report) by forcing moderate GOP incumbents to put distance between themselves and unpopular positions held by conservatives.\n\nâThey have a problem that their leadership has succumbed to the extreme wing of the party,â Kuster said.\n\nâI really donât know whatâs extreme about strong borders, strong economy, protecting our kids, caring about America first instead of more foreign wars,â Greene told Semafor on Wednesday. âI canât imagine whatâs extreme about that.â\n\nRepublicans in swing districts argue the Democratic attacks will do little damage to their re-election campaigns. They expect their own individual brands to carry the day.\n\nâTheir campaign tactics last cycle didnât work,â Rep. Nick LaLota, a freshman from New York, told Semafor. âThey spent more than $3 million trying to call me somebody who I wasnât. If they try that again this year theyâre probably going to burn the same amount of money.â\n\nNot every vulnerable Democrat is thrilled at the idea of inserting Greene into their race either. âI think that actually people are tired of nationalized politics and want place-based relationships,â Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash. told Semafor.\n\nDemocrats are considering bringing forward censure resolutions against Greene and Rep. George Santos , R-NY . There are concerns about the idea within the caucus, Politico reports , including an expectation Republicans would respond with censures of their own against Democrats.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "'Sesame Street' in trouble? Marjorie Taylor Greene-led committee wants to defund NPR, PBS\n\nIn another DOGE -related move, a Georgia leader has a major news organization in her crosshairs.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene led a hearing at Capitol Hill called \" Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the heads of NPR and PBS Accountable.\" Here's what we know:\n\nIn her opening of the hearing, Greene threw several criticisms at the heads of NPR and PBS calling them \"radical, Left-wing echo chambers for a narrow audience of mostly wealthy, white, urban liberals and progressives, who generally look down on and judge rural America.\" She was particularly critical of their content around transgender individuals, accusing them of \"brainwashing and transing children\" and becoming \"one of the founders of the trans child abuse industry.\"\n\nShe and other committee members also claimed biases against people and issues like President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and the investigation into Hunter Biden. The latter was brought up by U.S. Rep. Brian Jack of Georgia who said NPR's failure to properly and quickly report on this raises concerns. NPR CEO Katherine Maher acknowledged mistakes were made and they have taken steps.\n\n\"We've instituted a monthly review....we have hired analysts to be able to count the number of stories we're running on any particular issue....we've moved from bringing pundits on air to bringing direct policy makers on air,\" she said. \"Those are just a few of the things we have done so far.\"\n\nThe public broadcasting officials spent more than 2 hours explaining their personal and professional ideas and actions. By the end, their opponents seemed unfazed.\n\n\"I've lost confidence in public radio,\" said Rep. James Comer of Texas. \"I don't think they should get a penny of federal funding.\"\n\nAt the end, Greene said they will be calling for the complete and total defund and dismantling of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\n\"NPR and PBS can hate us on their own dime,\" she said \"It's time American taxpayers stop footing the bill.\"\n\nNot everyone at Wednesday's hearing was against public broadcasting. Among their defenders was Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts.\n\n\"For over two decades of service on this oversight committee, I've worked with members on both sides of the aisle to investigate issues of critical importance to the safety and security of the American people, including the conduct of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" Lynch said. \"So I'm sad to see this once proud committee....has now stooped to the lowest levels of partisanship and political theater to hold a hearing for going after the likes of Elmo and Cookie Monster.\"\n\nHe wasn't the only one to bring up the \"Sesame Street\" characters. Rep. Robert Garcia brought up pictures of the various characters and satirically asked questions like \"Is Elmo now or has he ever been a member of the Communist Party?\" and \"Are Bert and Ernie part of an extreme homosexual agenda?\"\n\n\"I'm obviously using some humor here, but the fact that we're sitting here talking about defunding public television is actually not funny,\" Garcia said. \"We need public media like PBS and NPR more than ever. A large majority of Americans say they trust PBS and that's exactly what extremists are trying to tear it down.\"\n\nGreene, 50, has served Georgia's 14th congressional district since 2021. This is largely the northwest area including cities like Rome and Dalton. Greene won another term in November. She is a prominent figure within the Republican party.\n\nNPR stands for the National Public Radio. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., this is an American public broadcasting organization.\n\nPBS stands for the Public Broadcasting Service. Based in Arlington, VA, this is a free American public broadcaster.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center on Wednesday, about 24% of U.S. adults say Congress should remove federal funding from NPR and PBS. Meanwhile, 43% say NPR and PBS should continue to receive funding from the federal government, while 33% say they are not sure.\n\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting has received $535 million annually in recent federal budgets , according to Pew. The CPB helps to fund NPR and PBS both directly and through individual local public media stations, many of which pay NPR and PBS in the form of membership or programming fees .\n\nVanessa Countryman contributed to this story\n\nMiguel Legoas is a Deep South Connect Team Reporter for Gannett/USA Today.

      "text": "After speaker defeat, Marjorie Taylor Greene is back stirring the pot: What's next?\n\nWASHINGTON - Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene suffered a stinging public defeat on the House floor earlier this month when the vast majority of lawmakers in the lower chamber, tired with the Georgia Republican's antics, voted to kill her push to remove Mike Johnson, R-La., as speaker.\n\nBut that loss appeared to be just a minor blip in Greene's rising career - and it's only amplified talk she could join a future Trump administration or run for a higher office in Georgia like senator or governor.\n\nHouse lawmakers have \"a tendency to think of themselves going to the next level,\" one of Greene's fellow GOP colleagues from the Peach State, Rep. Rich McCormick told USA TODAY.\n\n\"I don't think she's any exception to that,\" he added. \"When you get a lot of media and when you raise a lot of money, there's a natural tendency to gravitate towards that, so we'll see how that plays out.\"\n\nMost of her current House colleagues have moved on from Greene's effort and threat to oust Johnson - which failed in anticlimactic fashion - and following the vote, the mild-mannered House speaker told Greene harbors no ill will toward her. The crush of reporters and cameras Greene, who turns 50 years old on Monday, attracted every day while she held back her threat have largely fizzled out as well.\n\nThat's not to say Greene, a second-term lawmaker running for a third term this November, fell into obscurity after the speaker fight. She quickly made headlines again after a contentious House Oversight Committee hearing where lawmakers threw insults at each other amid allegations of drinking.\n\nGreene took aim at Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, telling her, \"I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading.\"\n\nCrockett responded in kind: \"I'm just curious ... If someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody's bleach blonde bad built butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct?\" (Crockett soon filed a trademark application for the phrase \"bleach blonde bad built butch body.\")\n\nThe exchange went viral and soon after, Greene was the center of attention again on Capitol Hill, albeit negative coverage - Crockett, a Black woman, later called Greene a blatant \"racist\" for her comments on her eyelashes - but attention nonetheless. Her ability to almost always make news has prompted constant speculation on what lies in the ultraconservative's future.\n\nWhen approached by USA TODAY about her career plans beyond 2024 on Wednesday, Greene didn't say if she was considering launching any future bids.\n\n\"Oh my goodness, what is today? Wednesday? We're on Wednesday in May of 2024, let's do Wednesday,\" Greene responded when asked if she is considering a 2026 Senate bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff. \"Let's try to at least maybe pass a budget that doesn't fund Biden's open borders. Maybe we can defund Jack Smith.\"\n\nWhen asked about possibly running in the 2026 Republican primaries to replace term-limited Gov. Brian Kemp as well, Greene reiterated the elections are years away: \"Dude, I'm on Wednesday. I'm trying to do Wednesday.\"\n\nSince entering the House in 2021, Greene quickly rose to prominence as a hard-right lawmaker with complete fealty to former President Donald Trump, adopting his populism and creating an identity as a conservative bomb thrower. Greene became - and remains today - one of House Republicans' strongest fundraisers, commanding massive cash hauls every fundraising quarter. Her campaign wheeled in over six figures after she announced her intent to remove Johnson as speaker, NOTUS reported.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., described Greene to USA TODAY as a \"queen of the internet.\"\n\n\"In our district, she's just as strong. Specifically in the south, she's very strong and they're gonna hate on her but she's just gonna keep fighting. I think that's what makes her stronger,\" Burchett said.\n\nThe rapid pace of Capitol Hill where the news of the day is quickly forgotten the following day, her fundraising abilities and penchant for always making news despite failing in her effort to topple Johnson highlights her staying power. For Greene, it's not clear whether she wants to stay in the House or is shooting for higher office.\n\nThat could be either in another Trump administration if he wins back the White House or notably, in her home state of Georgia, both a Senate seat and the governor's seat will be up for grabs in 2026.\n\nBack in Georgia, state Republicans have mixed views on Greene's future.\n\n\"She would be smart to stay in the House. I think she serves some sort of purpose there, though I'm not sure if I know exactly what it is,\" said Skyler Akins, executive vice president of the Atlanta Young Republicans.\n\nAkins hometown is in Greene's northwestern Georgia district and he described it as \"very white, it's still very conservative, it's still very religious,\" which isn't reflective of the whole state.\n\nThe governor's seat also might not be a good fit for Greene, who has built her reputation as a rabble rouser, since it's \"a position at an executive level, like governor, would require compromise\" and \"she's shown herself to be nothing but incapable of doing that,\" Akins said.\n\nSteve Brown, former Republican mayor of Peachtree City, Georgia, and a former commissioner for Fayette County, said he could easily see Greene run for governor and that he was \"certain influential Georgians are discussing Greene as a possible gubernatorial candidate.\"\n\nGreene's failed push to oust Johnson, Brown argued, was widely appreciated by \"nearly half the voting population\" since Greene is \"someone who actually stands on her core principles, so rare in Congress ... she is still a principled star among the Trump faithful, for sure.\"\n\nAnd while it's true that 2026 is still a ways away, that doesn't mean there's high interest in the Peach State for both seats. Rep. Rick Allen, R-Ga., expects both primaries to \"be highly contested,\" and added there was a \"deep bench\" of prospective candidates waiting in Georgia.\n\nWhether that includes Greene, Allen declined to speculate saying \"I have absolutely no idea.\"\n\nMcCormick on the other hand was more than happy to muse about Greene's possible future and said he wouldn't be shocked at all if he saw his fellow Georgian make a run for either Senate or the governor's mansion in 2026.\n\nHe did note that Greene, who represents a ruby red congressional district, could have challenges in a statewide general election race, pointing to past failed candidates such as Herschel Walker for the U.S. Senate. \"We've shown that for the last three Senate races, which were very winnable, we lost. We need to make sure we choose the most electable conservative we can find,\" he said.\n\nMcCormick didn't say whether he thought Greene was fit for a statewide race: \"Anybody's electable, but the question is: What's your best shot?\"\n\nOne of Greene's antagonists (of which she has many) openly welcomed the idea of her seeking a more prestigious position if it meant she's no longer the House's problem.\n\n\"I would encourage her to run for Senate, for governor. I would encourage her to go into the Trump administration,\" Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, told USA TODAY with a smirk on his face. \"Anything that she would like to set her heart and desire on to get her out of this place would be awesome.\""

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene committed to oust the House speaker a month ago: She still hasn't\n\nWASHINGTON - When Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her plans to oust Mike Johnson from the speakership, the conservative agitator committed to follow through on her threats and call a vote on the speaker's future.\n\nBut it's been more than a month since then and Greene, R-Ga., has yet to force a House vote on removing Johnson, R-La., despite her repeated statements that she will do so - whenever that is.\n\nThe long period of time that has elapsed between Greene announcing her plans until now - where she has not moved at all - highlights the political conundrum the second-term lawmaker has found herself in: Barely anyone on Capitol Hill is supportive of her efforts but if she pulls back her threats now, her credibility evaporates.\n\nLawmakers have noticed and some say Greene has made a severe misstep just seven months after conservatives first pushed out Rep. Kevin McCarthy from the speakership and setting off a three-week scramble to find his replacement that meant a vacancy in the job that's second in the line of succession to the presidency.\n\n\"I don't know the strategy behind her,\" Rep. Mark Alford, R-Texas, told USA TODAY of Greene's push to fire Johnson. \"I know she's frustrated ... I just don't think that's the way to go about getting the results you want, but that's up to Marjorie.\"\n\n\"If she doesn't (do it), I'll tell you right now, I think she loses a lot of credibility in a lot of people's eyes,\" Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, said. \"It's like the boy who cried wolf, do it or don't do it.\"\n\nGreene's push \"utterly collapsed,\" Rep. John Duarte, R-Calif., said. \"She's not influencing anything.\"\n\nGreene filed what is known as a \"motion to vacate\" against the speaker in March, a process that could forcibly remove Johnson from the speakership. But her effort appears to have gained much more pushback than Greene might have expected.\n\nWhile it was unsurprising that the majority of House Republicans would stand by Johnson, ultraconservatives and House Democrats both also came out against Greene's removal threat.\n\nWeary of starting another leadership crisis just six months before the 2024 elections, most hard-right lawmakers have said they would rather litigate a speaker fight in the next Congress. That strategy suggests Johnson would face a direct challenge to his speakership from an alternative candidate as early as January 2025, rather than a vote on ousting him smack in the middle of the current session.\n\n\"I cannot defend the speaker or his actions over the previous six months and I do think there will be a speaker contest in November that I don't believe he will be able to win,\" Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., told USA TODAY. Good, the chair of the conservative, far-right House Freedom Caucus, called the motion to vacate a \"very foolish, self centered thing to do.\"\n\nAnd Democratic leadership has vowed to kill Greene's effort if she ever calls it up for a vote. Not only that, but Donald Trump has defended the speaker and has attempted to tell Greene to back off, according to Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., a former Interior secretary during the Trump administration. Zinke said the former president \"was in communication with Marjorie and advised her to focus on getting things done and not a distraction, removing the speaker.\"\n\nRepublicans officials also voiced opposition to Greene's motion to vacate during last weekend's GOP donor retreat in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n\"We need to flip the Senate, and we need to expand our majority in the House. We're not going to do that if we're not unified,\" Michael Whatley, the chair of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News .\n\nGreene has still noted she could call up a vote to oust Johnson at any time, but she has yet to do so even though she said last week in a press conference she would be \"absolutely calling it\" and that she \"can't wait\" to see lawmakers support Johnson.\n\nBut on Monday, Greene, along with Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who joined her campaign to oust Johnson, met with the speaker for two hours to outline a set of demands - which Massie characterized as \"suggestions\" - that could get her to cool it with the ouster threat. The two, along with Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., met with the speaker again on Tuesday for roughly an hour and a half.\n\nThose demands are: a commitment for no further U.S. aid to Ukraine, a commitment to defund special counsel investigations that brought historic federal criminal charges against Trump, a pledge to bring legislation to the floor only with support of the majority of Republicans and automatic spending cuts if Congress can not pass a full set of individual spending bills to fund the government.\n\nGreene did not offer a timeline on when she would like to see changes, saying on Tuesday it's \"pretty short.\" There are no specific bills either that Greene outlined that could appease her. When pressed on how Johnson could possibly meet her demands, Greene responded to reporters that they \"should go ask Mike Johnson how he's gonna get this done. He's speaker of the House.\"\n\n\"Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson's court,\" Greene said.\n\nJohnson, when told Greene wanted an answer quickly, seemed to roll his eyes and crack a smile: \"We're gonna process these ideas just like all ideas and all input from members.\"\n\nThe ambiguity of Greene's demands, and how they could be satisfied, has prompted speculation from members that the conservative rabble rouser is simply looking for an off-ramp to avoid a public defeat on the House floor after it became clear there is little support from anyone to remove the current speaker.\n\n\"Sleeves off your vest,\" Rep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., told USA TODAY, saying Johnson wouldn't be giving any real concessions to Greene, even if he did satisfy her. \"Sometimes in negotiation, you gotta give sleeves off your vest.\"\n\n\"It's like a horrible syndicated TV series that just won't come to an end,\" Molinaro quipped of Greene's threats to the speaker. But at least, he added, \"it sounds like we're in the final throes of cancellation and the season finale.\"\n\nContributing: David Jackson"

The crash is still under investigation.\n\nThe bomb squad ruled out any potential dangers at Greene's residence and turned over the bomb threat investigation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Madden said. The FBI Atlanta office said it is investigating and did not provide further information.\n\nThe email threat was traced to a Russian IP address, Rome police said.\n\n\"These violent political threats have fatal consequences. It's an undue strain on our law enforcement who must treat them seriously. The officer was responding to protect my life,\" Greene said on X. \"And now, a woman has lost her life because of this despicable act.\"\n\nGreene is one of several political figures to have received bomb threats and swatting calls over the last several weeks.

I don't care about your fake news.\"\n\nBut when Greene tried moving on, calling on another journalist with a pointed, \"This is an American journalist, thank you,\" she got an unexpected reality check.\n\n\"I'm an American and I'd like to hear your answer to what she's asking,\" the journalist said.\n\nAgain, Greene refused to engage-at least until the American journalist repeated back Kelner's initial question himself.\n\nThe MAGA firebrand has mirrored Donald Trump's confrontational rhetoric towards Europe in recent years.\n\nIn January, she penned an angry X post at the U.K. after it became clear that the country would not be adopting Trump's new name for the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"We have to force this to happen and we should!\" she said.\n\nLast year, she told Sky News that David Cameron-then the U.K.'s foreign minister-\"really needs to worry about his own country, and frankly, he can kiss my a--.\" Cameron had urged the U.S. to send more aid to Ukraine.\n\nGreene never directly addressed Kelner's question about Trump officials potentially endangering military personnel by using the Signal app to plan attacks, instead deflecting the issue and launching into a tirade against the Biden administration's border policies.\n\nEarlier, she had chaired a hearing in which she and fellow GOP colleagues slammed the heads of NPR and PBS , accusing the public media networks of becoming, \"radical, left-wing echo chambers.\"\n\n\"That's what this is about today,\" she said as she hurried away from Kelner and other reporters, \"not journalists from the U.K. that should care about their own country.\""

Melanie Stansbury (D-NM) was asked about her recent clash with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) during a meeting of the House Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency, where Stansbury pushed back against President Donald Trump referring to himself as a \" king .\"\n\nIn response to Greene's suggestion that her comments were threatening, Stansbury told host Alex Witt, \"I find it comical.\" The congresswoman went on to explain what actually happened: \"I pointed out and I directed my statement directly to Mr. Trump... I said that 250 years ago, we rejected an abusive king in this country and that we're not going back. And that's just the reality.\"\n\nStansbury's exact words were: \"I know that Donald Trump thinks that he's a king because of social media. Of course, he keeps repeating this, but let me say this to you, Mr. Trump: 250 years ago, the people of this great nation rejected a reckless, abusive king, and we won't go back.\"\n\nStansbury also shared a message for federal employees, pledging, \"For the thousands of federal workers out there... know that we see you. We are fighting for you, we are in the courts, we are in Congress, we are in our communities, and we will hold this administration accountable, and we will not abandon our allies or our humanity. So with that, I say to all of you, be strong. We will fight back.\"\n\nDuring the Feb. 26 meeting where the clash took place, Greene was quick to condemn Stansbury's comments, asserting that, \"Threats against the President of the United States will not be tolerated by anyone.\"\n\nGreene also defended the cuts made by the Trump administration and, more specifically, Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency , telling the committee, \"If the U.S. government operated like any other private business-which it should, by the way-it would be completely bankrupt, and it would be out of business.\" She continued, \"Government is not a charity, and it is not to be used and abused by the bureaucracy to implement the far left's agenda and impose it on the entire world.\""

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is a huge problem for Republican lawmakers. Huuuuge. And some GOP leaders are handling the challenge more adroitly than others. Rep. Greene is a rookie member of Congress with an affinity for conspiracy theories such as QAnon. Prior to her election she promoted wild social media claims that mass shootings in Las Vegas and Florida were \"false flag\" operations staged by gun control supporters. She's endorsed posts calling for the assassination of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has already seen enough. \"Loony lies and conspiracy theories are cancer for the Republican Party and our country,\" Sen. McConnell said on Monday. In many ways Rep. Greene, for elected Republicans, is a subset of the larger former President Donald Trump problem. Who and what defines the GOP? Mr. Trump - and Rep. Greene - are focused on exciting the party base, raising cash, and TV coverage. But Sen. McConnell, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, have different priorities. They are, or should be, looking ahead to the 2022 mid-term elections, when both the Senate and House could flip back to Republican control. For that to happen Republicans need to do well in purple states - and in suburbs, where Trumpian lies and bombast alienate educated voters otherwise amenable to the GOP. That's why Sen. McConnell has little patience for Rep. Greene. Sen. McConnell is shrewd and wants to wield the Majority gavel again. The Trump base isn't big enough to put him there. House Minority Leader McCarthy? The jury's still out. He tried to mollify Democrats by offering to kick Rep. Greene off one of her two committees. Democrats want her off both panels. \"It's like he's negotiating a spending bill, not signaling what's unacceptable in politics,\" tweeted HuffPost Congress reporter Matt Fuller on Wednesday. To be fair, the House GOP conference is difficult to manage. Just ask former Speaker John Boehner, Republican of Ohio, who quit in 2015, tired of dealing with squabbling factions. Today, somewhere, Mr. Boehner is reading the news and smiling.

Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments, citing her endorsements of political violence and conspiracy theories. House Republicans are split on whether to publicly defend her.\n\nLoading...\n\nFeb. 04, 2021, 12:39 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nHouse Republicans will be forced to go on the record defending or rebuking Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has drawn bipartisan condemnation over her embrace of far-right conspiracy theories and racist comments, as well as her past endorsement of violence against Democrats.\n\nDemocrats are expected to move forward Thursday with a vote that is all-but-certain to strip the Georgia Republican of her committee assignments. For Republicans, it represents a politically agonizing dilemma that underscores tension that has riven the party over its path forward since Donald Trump lost the White House.\n\nDo they support a newly elected colleague, whom Mr. Trump has praised as a \"future Republican star\"? Or do they side with Democrats and take action against Ms. Greene, who has suggested that school shootings were staged, voiced support for the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, and once said Black people \"are held slaves to the Democratic Party.\"\n\nDemocrats issued an ultimatum earlier in the week, telling House Republicans to strip Ms. Greene of her committee assignments - or they would. Bipartisan pressure built after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called Ms. Greene's \"loony lies\" a \"cancer\" for the party.\n\nBut House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Wednesday ruled out taking action. Instead, he accused Democrats of a \"partisan power grab\" for targeting Ms. Greene, who once suggested that a Jewish-owned financial firm may have been involved in a plot to spark California wildfires using a space laser.\n\n\"If this is not the bottom, I don't know what the hell is,\" House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said before a resolution was sent to the House floor to strip Ms. Greene of her posts.\n\nMr. McCarthy's decision to back Greene comes at a time when the party has been ideologically adrift after Mr. Trump's loss, struggling over whether to embrace his norm-busting divisiveness or the GOP's more traditional, policy-oriented conservative values.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Republicans blocked an effort by conservative hardliners to oust the No. 3 House Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., from her leadership role. Ms. Cheney, a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, had enraged Trump supporters by voting to impeach him over the riot at the United States Capitol.\n\nIn sticking by both women, Mr. McCarthy was attempting to placate both traditional conservatives and populists, like Ms. Greene, who emulate Trump. The moves were typical of Mr. McCarthy's preference to avoid ruffling feathers as he charts his path to someday becoming House speaker.\n\n\"You know what that's going to mean?\" he told reporters Wednesday evening. \"Two years from now, we're going to win the majority. That's because this conference is more united. We've got the right leadership team behind it.\"\n\nMr. McConnell praised his House counterparts on Thursday, telling reporters, \"I congratulate Liz Cheney on a landslide victory. It must be very satisfying to her, and it was a great win.\"\n\nBut the GOP's two wings remain concerned that the other is leading them down the wrong path, and to some, Wednesday's outcome seemed more an uneasy truce than a full-on peace treaty.\n\n\"This is about the direction of our party and whether or not we're going to be a majority who's dedicated to just one person or we're going to be a united Republican majority,\" said Rep. Jaime Herrera-Beutler, R-Wash., who with Ms. Cheney was among just 10 House Republicans to back impeaching Mr. Trump.\n\nMs. Greene has shown support for calls to violence against Democrats, bizarre fictions about faked school shootings, and unfounded QAnon theories about Democrats joining in child abuse rings.\n\nThe conspiracy theories she's embraced came up during a closed-door Republican caucus meeting on Wednesday, which attendants described as spirited with long lines of speakers at the microphones. Some said Ms. Greene apologized to her colleagues, though there were conflicting, vague versions of exactly what she'd said.\n\n\"She was contrite. And I think she brought a lot of people over to her side,\" said conservative Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky.\n\nThat's at odds with statements she's made in recent weeks on Twitter, where she has vowed to never back down or apologize and labeled her critics traitors, while using the Democratic push to punish her to raise money for her campaign.\n\nDemocrats say it's politically advantageous to tie some Republicans to the far-right Ms. Greene. This week, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee launched a $500,000 ad campaign that attempts to link eight Republicans to her and other adherents of QAnon, which focuses on the false belief that top Democrats are involved in child sex trafficking and cannibalism.\n\nMr. McCarthy condemned Ms. Greene's past endorsements of conspiracy theories - after weeks of saying little critical of her - and said the first-term congresswoman had recognized in a private conversation that she must meet \"a higher standard\" as a lawmaker.\n\n\"I hold her to her word, as well as her actions going forward,\" Mr. McCarthy said.\n\nShe burst onto the national political scene with enthusiastic support from Mr. Trump.\n\nRepublicans appointed Ms. Greene to the Education and Labor Committee, a decision that drew especially harsh criticism because of her suggestions that mass school shootings in Connecticut and Florida could be hoaxes. Ms. Greene is also on the Budget Committee.\n\nMr. McCarthy said Democrats turned down his offer to move Ms. Greene onto the House Small Business Committee instead.\n\nIt's unusual for party leaders to strip lawmakers of committee assignments, which can help them address their districts' needs and raise campaign contributions.\n\nIn 2019, House GOP leaders removed Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who had a history of racist comments, from the Agriculture and Judiciary panels after he wondered aloud in a New York Times story about when the term \"white supremacist\" became offensive. He lost the Republican primary for his seat in 2020 and is out of Congress after serving nine terms.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Marjorie Taylor Greene has been removed from both of her committees in a 230-199 House vote for spreading hateful and violent conspiracy theories. She tried to dissociate herself from her \"words of the past\" but did not explicitly apologize for her remarks.\n\nLoading...\n\nFeb. 05, 2021, 10:18 a.m. ET | Washington\n\nA fiercely divided House has tossed Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene off both her committees, an unprecedented punishment that Democrats said she'd earned by spreading hateful and violent conspiracy theories.\n\nUnderscoring the political vise her inflammatory commentary has clamped her party into, nearly all Republicans voted against the Democratic move Thursday but none defended her lengthy history of outrageous social media posts.\n\nYet in a riveting moment, the freshman Republican from a deep-red corner of Georgia took to the House floor on her own behalf. She offered a mixture of backpedaling and finger-pointing as she wore a dark mask emblazoned with the words \"FREE SPEECH.\"\n\nThe chamber's near party-line 230-199 vote was the latest instance of conspiracy theories becoming pitched political battlefields, an increasingly familiar occurrence during Donald Trump's presidency. He faces a Senate trial next week for his House impeachment for inciting insurrection after a mob he fueled with his false narrative of a stolen election attacked the Capitol.\n\nThursday's fight also underscored the uproar and political complexities that Ms. Greene - a master of provoking Democrats, promoting herself, and raising campaign money - has prompted since becoming a House candidate last year.\n\nEleven Republicans joined 219 Democrats in backing Ms. Greene's ejection from her committees, while 199 GOP lawmakers voted \"no.\"\n\nAddressing her colleagues, Ms. Greene tried to dissociate herself from her \"words of the past.\" Contradicting past social media posts, she said she believes the 9/11 attacks and mass school shootings were real and no longer believes QAnon conspiracy theories, which include lies about Democratic-run pedophile rings.\n\nBut she didn't explicitly apologize for supportive online remarks she's made on other subjects, as when she mulled about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi being assassinated or the possibility of Jewish-controlled space rays causing wildfires. And she portrayed herself as the victim of unscrupulous \"big media companies.\"\n\nNews organizations \"can take teeny, tiny pieces of words that I've said, that you have said, any of us, and can portray us as someone that we're not,\" she said. She added that \"we're in a real big problem\" if the House punished her but tolerated \"members that condone riots that have hurt American people\" - a clear reference to last summer's social justice protests that in some instances became violent.\n\nMs. Greene was on the Education and Labor committee and the Budget committee. Democrats were especially aghast about her assignment to the education panel, considering the past doubt she cast on school shootings in Florida and Connecticut.\n\nThe political imperative for Democrats was clear: Ms. Greene's support for violence and fictions were dangerous and merited punishment. Democrats and researchers said there was no apparent precedent for the full House removing a lawmaker from a committee, a step usually taken by their party leaders.\n\nThe calculation was more complicated for Republicans.\n\nThough Mr. Trump left the White House two week ago, his devoted followers are numerous among the party's voters, and he and Ms. Greene are allies. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., hopes GOP victories in the 2022 elections will make him speaker.\n\nRepublicans could undermine that scenario by alienating Mr. Trump's and Ms. Greene's passionate supporters, and Mr. McCarthy took no action to punish her.\n\n\"If any of our members threatened the safety of other members, we'd be the first ones to take them off a committee,\" Ms. Pelosi angrily told reporters. She said she was \"profoundly concerned\" about GOP leaders' acceptance of an \"extreme conspiracy theorist.\"\n\nAt one point, No. 2 Democratic leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland strode to the GOP side of the chamber carrying a poster of a Greene Facebook post from last year. \"Squad's Worst Nightmare,\" Ms. Greene had written in the post, which showed her holding an AR-15 firearm next to pictures of three of the four Democratic lawmakers, all young women of color, who've been nicknamed \"The Squad.\"\n\n\"They are people. They are our colleagues,\" Mr. Hoyer said. He mimicked Ms. Greene's pose holding the weapon and said, \"I have never, ever seen that before.\"\n\nRepublicans tread carefully but found rallying points.\n\nMr. McCarthy said Ms. Greene's past opinions \"do not represent the views of my party.\" But without naming the offenders, he said Ms. Pelosi hadn't stripped committee memberships from Democrats who became embroiled in controversy. Among those he implicated was Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who made anti-Israel insults for which she later apologized.\n\n\"If that's the new standard,\" he said of Democrats' move against Ms. Greene, \"we have a long list.\"\n\nRep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Democrats were setting a precedent by punishing lawmakers for statements made before they were even candidates for Congress. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, warned, \"You engage in wrong-speak, you're in the Thunderdome,\" a term for an enclosed wrestling arena.\n\nCommittee assignments are crucial for lawmakers for shaping legislation affecting their districts, creating a national reputation and raising campaign contributions. Even social media stars like Ms. Greene could find it harder to define themselves without the spotlights that committees provide.\n\nNot all Republicans were in forgiving moods, especially in the Senate. There, fringe GOP candidates have lost winnable races in recent years and leaders worry a continued linkage with Mr. Trump and conspiracists will inflict more damage.\n\nThat chamber's minority leader, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., this week called Ms. Greene's words a \"cancer\" on the GOP and country. On Thursday, No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota amplified that thinking.\n\nMr. Thune said House Republicans needed to issue a \"really strong\" rebuke of Ms. Greene's conspiratorial formulations. Republicans must \"get away from members dabbling in conspiracy theories,\" Mr. Thune said. \"I don't think that's a productive course of action or one that's going to lead to much prosperity politically in the future.\"\n\nThe fight came a day after Republicans resolved another battle and voted to keep Rep.

Then, in a GOP meeting behind closed doors, he lost a secret ballot 112-86 that asked if he should continue as speaker-nominee. Now, with members headed home for the weekend, the search for a speaker of the House begins anew. The conference will reportedly accept nominations by noon Sunday, with a candidate forum planned for Monday evening.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden on Friday asked Congress for an emergency national security funding package of $105 billion for Ukraine, Israel, humanitarian aid for Gaza, and the U.S. southern border. The Senate could take up the measure as soon as next week, with Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer saying Thursday his chamber will \" spring into action \" to pass the request which would then, of course, send the package to the House. Also on the calendar is the approaching Nov. 17 deadline, when the federal government is set to run out of money.\n\nTwo weeks have passed with House Republicans unable to elect a speaker, amid signs of rancor within their conference. Has an ethos of brinkmanship gone too far?\n\nBut unless the House settles on a speaker, it will be unable to act on any issues, foreign or domestic.\n\n\"We're in a very bad place right now,\" former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters Friday, in what can best be described as an understatement. \"This is getting chaotic.\"\n\nToday's speakership fight has its roots in a brinkmanship mentality that's been increasingly dominant in the Republican party for decades - a mentality that has only been strengthened by a political moment of deep partisanship and narrow margins. And with a right wing of the GOP that's been poised to fight as much with its own party establishment as the Democratic party, this moment, in some ways, seems inevitable.\n\nThe result, however - an unprecedented speakerless House that seems irrevocably divided - may be as close to an actual constitutional crisis as anything in recent memory, say some experts.\n\n\"It says in the Constitution that the House shall choose its speaker, and they're not. They can't. They won't,\" says Matthew Green, an expert on the speakership at Catholic University in Washington. \"This is an inability to fulfill a core constitutional requirement. That seems like the definition of a constitutional crisis.\"\n\nThe House has struggled to choose speakers before, with the mid-19th century coming first to historians' minds. Of the speakership races that took the most ballots, the top three took place within the span of about 10 years, between 1849 and 1859 . The record, set in 1855, took 133 ballots. These battles, of course, were \"indicative of deeper problems,\" says Mr. Green, namely the issue of slavery that led to the Civil War.\n\nThe difference now, say experts, is that the House's divide is not defined by one political issue but rather the idea of governance itself.\n\nFormer Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich pioneered the GOP's \"weaponization of the legislative branch\" in the 1990s, says Julian Zelizer, a congressional historian at Princeton University. This strategy has only been reiterated by the past decade's debt ceiling crises, when sending the nation into default became a \"standard threat\" of politics. This speaker chaos is an extension of that.\n\n\"Government is just not a priority for the party right now,\" Professor Zelizer says. \"As a result, a lot of members are willing to live in this situation without a leader of a chamber of Congress as war is unfolding. That's what makes this different. The normalization of this approach to government.\"\n\nTake Thursday on Capitol Hill, for example.\n\nMr. Jordan announced his support for temporarily empowering acting Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry for the next month or two, a potential off-ramp to the current impasse which would give Mr. Jordan more time to try and flip remaining holdouts. Yet shortly after, several of his strongest supporters - some of them fellow members of the hard-line Freedom Caucus - announced they were adamantly against this idea.\n\n\"Republican voters worked too hard to give us the majority for us to enter some sort of temporary speakership,\" Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene told reporters Thursday. \"This conference is absolutely broken,\" said Rep. Taylor Greene, a former Freedom Caucus member.\n\nBut rather than opposing a temporary speakership on procedural grounds, the departure here between Mr. Jordan's statement and the responses by \"Jordaneers\" proves that the Ohio Republican's speakership fight is a useful instrument in and of itself, says Liam Donovan, a former staffer for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and now a lobbyist.\n\n\"Jordan doesn't want to lose, but if you are Jordan's backers, you are fine with him losing if you get to kick and scream about the 'DC cartel' keeping conservatives from winning,\" says Mr. Donovan. \"They are setting up options that only fulfill their narrative.\"\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, at least nine Republicans have jumped into - or are considering joining - the speaker race ahead of (yet another) candidate forum on Monday. Oklahoma Republican Kevin Hern, who previously considered a speaker run last week, announced that he will run , as did Georgia Republican Austin Scott , who ran a quixotic campaign in a closed door meeting last week. Other members reportedly running include: Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota, Vice Conference Chair Mike Johnson of Louisiana, Freedom Caucus member Byron Donalds of Florida, and Texas Congressmen Jody Arrington and Pete Sessions.\n\nCongressman Hern used his relatively low profile as a selling point, when talking to reporters Friday afternoon. \"There's a lot of historical relationships that some [lawmakers] are not going to ever be able to work around, and I don't have those negatives out there.\"\n\nThis is the bet that some of these lower-profile candidates are making as they begin a weekend of phone calls to feel out support for their bid. Unlike House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (who was the GOP's speaker-nominee earlier this week) or Mr. Jordan, they don't have the same kind of relationship history with the conference that could thwart a campaign.\n\nBut the past few weeks have taken conference in-fighting to a new level. Not only has there been name-calling and social media unfollows, but some members have reported receiving death threats - both to themselves and family members - following their announcements that they would not support Mr. Jordan.\n\n\"It's just getting ugly,\" says Mr. Green.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nWhat it will take for any candidate to emerge from these ashes with a winning majority remains unclear.\n\n\"Even if [the speakership] is solved in a month, it's not as if all of this will go back to some default setting,\" says Mr. Zelizer. \"This is the new normal, and that's what we have to put our minds around.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

A record number of them are heading to Congress - with more races still to be called. Of the eight House seats flipped by Republicans, six have been by women.\n\n\"I've been saying 2018 is the year of the woman, and 2020 is the year of the Republican woman,\" says Olivia Perez-Cubas, spokeswoman for Winning for Women Action Fund, the first super political action committee dedicated to electing Republican women.\n\nPart of the reason for their strong performance is the good political environment for women candidates, with Republican women inspired by the Democratic women's wave, as well as by women in Republican leadership positions, such as atop the Republican National Committee. Experts on women in politics say there's a motivational effect of women running for office that crosses party lines. \"If you can see it, you can be it,\" as Ms. Perez-Cubas puts it.\n\nTwo years ago, gains by Democrats in Congress were paired with the label \"the year of the woman.\" Now 2020 brings its own new gains for gender diversity - this time on the other side of the political aisle.\n\nThese women - so far 24 in the House and eight in the Senate - were also poised to benefit from what turned out to be unprecedented turnout for President Donald Trump.\n\nThey could not have been elected had they not been on the ballot in the first place. This year, a record 227 GOP women jumped into the pipeline to run for the House, with 94 making it past the primaries to the general election, nearly double from the prior cycle. Primaries are a big hurdle for GOP women, due to fundraising and the stereotype that women are less conservative than men, but this time Republican women focused on helping female candidates win those early contests.\n\n\"What happened this year, they were inspired ... and they were more strategic,\" says Dianne Bystrom, co-president of the League of Women Voters in Nebraska.\n\nThe newcomers come from mixed backgrounds. Georgia's Marjorie Taylor Greene made headlines for her support of the QAnon conspiracy theory, while Colorado's Lauren Boebert owns a gun-themed restaurant that defied pandemic shutdown orders and where servers openly carry firearms. In Florida, Maria Elvira Salazar is a longtime journalist who worked for the Spanish-language network Telemundo. She flipped her district, as did Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma, Michelle Fischbach of Minnesota, and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, all of whom had served before in their statehouses, with Ms. Fischbach a former lieutenant governor. Meanwhile, Cynthia Lummis will be the first woman to represent Wyoming in the U.S. Senate. She is an attorney and former state lawmaker.\n\n\"The lesson here is that if you want more Republican women to serve and win, there have to be more Republican women on the ballot,\" says Kelly Dittmar, research director at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey. That's obvious, she says, but not easy to achieve for a party that eschews identity politics and lags far behind Democrats in targeted financial support for female candidates.\n\nBut two years ago, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and a cast of other Republican women took this challenge into their own hands. They had just witnessed 2018's blue wave reduce their numbers from 23 congresswomen to 13. The contrast on swearing-in day was striking: the Republican side a mass of dark suits with red ties, the Democrats a cornucopia of lively colors worn by a record-setting 89 female members.\n\nRepresentative Stefanik, the youngest GOP woman in the House, called the lack of Republican women a \"crisis.\" As the first woman to head up recruiting for House Republicans that cycle, she convinced more than 100 women to run, but only one was elected. So she changed her strategy - quitting her official recruitment role and relaunching her political action committee, known as E-PAC, so she could focus on endorsing and financially supporting women in primaries. That's something the national party steers clear of, even while primaries are the toughest hurdle for GOP women.\n\nHer move was at first called a \"mistake\" by the head of the House's Republican campaign arm, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota. But Ms. Stefanik was not cowed. \"NEWSFLASH: I wasn't asking for permission,\" she tweeted, with siren emojis. Other women stepped up, including this cycle's House GOP recruitment head, retiring Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana. They put in hours on the phone recruiting and mentoring female candidates, guiding them through everything from budgeting to the media to managing family life in Congress. \"If Elise had not stepped forward ... I don't think we would have had the success that we had,\" says former Rep. Mimi Walters of California, who lost to Democrat Katie Porter in 2018. \"It was something Elise did on her own. It was not the party saying, 'Go do this.' It was Elise saying, 'I am going to do this.'\"\n\nMs. Walters praises Ms. Stefanik for her PAC, explaining that it's typically harder for women to raise money, which discourages them from running. But \"that dynamic is changing,\" she says, mentioning other funding sources for GOP women, such as VIEW PAC, a political action committee that's more than 20 years old, and the newly formed Winning for Women Action Fund, which was formed after the 2018 congressional losses.\n\n\"We asked ourselves, why is this happening, why aren't women getting over the finish line?\" recalls Ms. Perez-Cubas, of the Winning for Women Action Fund. One conclusion: \"There's a big hole in the Republican Party ecosystem.\" Now it's starting to be filled with the first super PAC - with no limit on fundraising - directed solely at GOP women candidates. This cycle, the PAC spent nearly $3 million.\n\nBut Democrats dwarf the efforts of their Republican counterparts. For instance, EMILY's List, which recruits and supports pro-choice female candidates at all levels of government from start to finish, raised $72 million this cycle. So far this year, Democrats have elected 103 women to the House and Senate (slightly behind their 2018 record). They also shattered the glass ceiling in the vice president's office, electing the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent.\n\n\"The left does a really good job of elevating women,\" says Ms. Perez-Cubas, a former aide to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. \"We have to make sure [we] go toe to toe.\"\n\nGetting more Republican women elected challenges monolithic conceptions about what women believe, says Ms. Dittmar, and brings diversity of style, perspective, and experience to governing - not to mention a more equal representation of constituents. But it's also important for the future of the party, for its image and its ongoing battle for suburban women voters.\n\nIn California's Orange County, once a bedrock of Republicanism, GOP women are leading in two very tight races to win back House seats that Democrats flipped in 2018. Young Kim was the first Korean American Republican woman elected to the state legislature; Michelle Steel, also a Korean American, is a county supervisor.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Marjorie Taylor Greene's inflammatory opinions, to conservative uproar over \"cancellation\" by the tech giants of social media, the core issue of many of today's most consequential political struggles is speech: its power, its truth, its acceptability, and its consequences.\n\nSpeech and words matter. They move people to action. They define the parameters of democracy. Their free flow is one of the central purposes of the First Amendment, a bulwark of the U.S. constitutional system.\n\nBut this may be a dangerous time for the country, say some experts, in that today's controversies could end up setting new guardrails for speech. Is it OK for the nation's political leaders to sow doubts about the security of elections, despite lack of actual evidence? Is it OK for elected officials to use violent language or imagery in reference to their opponents? Is social media the new town square, to which all, even potentially dangerous extremists, should have access?\n\nGlance through recent political headlines, and a common thread emerges in many: questions over whether the right to free speech is being abused in dangerous ways - or, alternatively, whether it's being unfairly stifled.\n\nIn America, what is it OK to say?\n\n\"This is a super important moment, I would argue, because we're actually determining the limits and the definitions of what does it mean to be a democracy, and whether we can hold on to that,\" says Mary Stuckey, an expert on political rhetoric at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nAt former President Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate, which begins Tuesday, the question of what motivated a mob to take concrete action and storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 will be a central question. In particular, House impeachment managers will argue that rioters believed Mr. Trump's speech had indicated the assault was something he wanted them to do.\n\nMr. Trump had begun to set the stage months earlier with his false insistence that he had actually won the November election and Democrats had stolen the White House via massive voting fraud. Then, while still president on Jan. 6, Mr. Trump appeared onstage at a rally at the Ellipse and \"whipped\" the crowd \"into a frenzy,\" according to the House impeachment trial brief .\n\nHe exhorted followers to \"fight like hell [or] you're not going to have a country anymore.\" Then he aimed them straight at the Capitol, according to the House brief, and said, \"You'll never take back our country with weakness.\"\n\n\"Incited by President Trump, his mob attacked the Capitol,\" the House brief concluded.\n\nIn response, attorneys for Mr. Trump in a defense brief released Monday argue that his speech \"did not direct anyone to commit unlawful actions\" and that he should not be blamed that a small group of \"criminals\" stormed the Capitol after his rally appearance. In addition, Mr. Trump's defense claims that the articles of impeachment violate his First Amendment rights to free speech.\n\nHowever, free speech is not an absolute right, note First Amendment experts. Mr. Trump's words would not be protected if a court case determined they led to the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nProsecution of incitement is not easy, however. Ken White, a First Amendment litigator and criminal defense attorney at Brown, White & Osborn LLP, says that in court the former president would be held to the same standard as all Americans: the Brandenburg test.\n\nUnder Brandenburg the government may prohibit advocating the use of force or crime if the speech meets both elements of a two-part test: The speech is \"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action,\" and the speech is \"likely to incite or produce such action.\"\n\nDid Mr. Trump's words meet both those criteria, and cause the riot? His lawyers argue that they did not, because they did not \"specifically advocate\" for unlawful action.\n\nViewed in the full context of Mr. Trump's months of disinformation about the election and damaging rhetorical attacks on democracy prior to Jan. 6, among other things, his speech did meet Brandenburg criteria for illegality, says Mark Kende, director of Drake University's Constitutional Law Center and an expert on the First Amendment.\n\n\"We know what the results were and those results were not accidental,\" says Mr. Kende.\n\nBut Mr. Trump is not being tried in a courtroom. He is being tried in the U.S. Senate. The distinction is a crucial one, as impeachment, under the Constitution, is a political question, not a legal one, strictly speaking.\n\n\"History makes it fairly clear that high crimes and misdemeanors, for which you can be impeached, is broad and it's more or less what the House and Senate want it to be,\" says Mr. White of Brown, White & Osborn.\n\nThere is precedent for citing speech in impeachment proceedings. One of the articles of impeachment issued against President Andrew Johnson in 1868 focused on his incendiary speeches.\n\nThere are free speech norms, in addition to free speech laws, and it's the former that the Senate will be looking at in the upcoming trial of Mr. Trump, says Mr. White. While voters might like to believe that its calculations will be based on nuanced application of historical and legal precedents, that's unlikely to be the case.\n\n\"I think it's mostly a straight-up crass partisan calculation,\" says Mr. White.\n\nThe only real limit to political speech is what your voters let you say before turning against you, and in the case of Mr. Trump, his supporters give him plenty of leeway. The same is true for a new generation of politicians who are following in Mr. Trump's footsteps, such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia.\n\nRepresentative Greene is a first-term member of Congress with an affinity for conspiracy theories. Prior to election last November, she promoted wild social media claims that mass shootings in Las Vegas and Florida were \"false flag\" operations staged by gun control supporters. She's endorsed posts calling for the assassination of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nMs. Greene has been implicitly rebuked by top establishment Republicans such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , who recently condemned her \"loony lies.\" But many House colleagues have continued to support her, and last week the House GOP caucus declined to punish her by stripping her of committee assignments.\n\nThe Democratic majority in the House, with a smattering of Republican support, then voted to do just that. It was an unprecedented rebuke, given that committee slots are traditionally set by a member's own party, not the full chamber.\n\nMs. Greene last week responded that she was \"sorry\" for some of her past conspiratorial statements, but also said she was happy to be booted off her committee work, because as a member of the conservative minority she'd have been \"wasting my time\" on the panels and now she'd have more hours to talk and build support around the country.\n\nThis may be an example of a cycle of stimulus and response that is increasingly sparked by politicians who have followed Mr. Trump's lead and harnessed the power, and divisiveness, of words.\n\nThey say something their followers love, but that alienates much of the rest of the public. Their followers dig in while the opposition does too. The more outrageous the statement, the more entrenched the response.\n\nThen this equilibrium leads to a more radicalized country, says Mr. White.\n\nConservatives have their own complaints about the perceived damages of a new equilibrium. In their words, the danger is \"cancel culture,\" a loosely defined phenomenon in which jobs are lost or reputations trashed or books and speech dates withdrawn over remarks or writings that liberals deem beyond the pale.\n\n\"I think that [cancel culture] is probably the most dangerous thing to our political process, because it's almost this mob mentality,\" Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, a freshman elected in 2020 as a Trump supporter, told the Monitor's Story Hinckley late last year.\n\nSince then, speech fallout from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has included the deplatforming of then-President Trump from Twitter, Facebook, and other social media; the mass banning of QAnon and Capitol-assault-related accounts from many sites; and the collapse of Parler, which had shown promise of becoming a right-wing-dominated Twitter clone.\n\nThis is not cancel culture so much as simply culture, say some experts. The rise of the #MeToo movement and Black Lives Matter protests, and other longer-range societal changes such as the acceptance of gay marriage, have changed, among other things, the parameters of acceptable speech.\n\n\"We are seeing a world in which people are more aware of the potential harms that speech can cause that are beyond just violence,\" says Mr. Kende of Drake University.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nThe country still has work to do in terms of deciding where, exactly, to draw lines. This has not been helped by the explosion of social media, a forum that allows people, indeed encourages them in some ways, to engage in increasingly provocative speech.\n\nIt \"has contributed to an environment in which there are more outrageous statements that are being allowed,\" Mr. Kende says.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has spread the so-called great replacement theory that there's a plot to diminish the power or population share of white Americans. Many might say Mr. Walis believes a version of it himself.\n\nThe mass shooting in Buffalo last weekend has focused attention on ideas termed the \"great replacement theory\" - that there's a conspiracy to disempower white Americans. To historians, the spread of nativism today is not surprising.\n\nAccording to authorities, that idea is one of the motives Payton Gendron listed in his 180-page screed before driving 200 miles to a Buffalo supermarket and shooting 13 people - 11 of whom were Black and 10 of whom died.\n\nTo Mr. Walis, fault rests with the individual. \"If some whack job dreams up a manifesto and decides to go out and kill people, that's on him - no one else,\" he says.\n\nBut the 18-year-old Mr. Gendron listed outside influences in his document , alluding to other mass shooters apparently driven by racial or ethnic hatred in Charleston, South Carolina; Pittsburgh; and El Paso, Texas.\n\nIn the week since Saturday, the country is asking how another racially motivated mass shooting could happen. Much of the media attention has turned to replacement theory's role as a motive and, by extension, to the elites who voice it. In the process, public attention is also focusing on how strains of this thought - often in subtle forms - have taken root in America. Polling suggests millions of Americans believe some, albeit less extreme, version of replacement theory as well.\n\nAnd the range of views can be confusing: To what degree are old debates over immigration and cultural change synonymous with \"replacement\" rhetoric?\n\nRacist conspiracy theories tend to change temperature over time, says Pam Nadell, a historian at American University. And they're heating up now due to decaying institutions, political violence, economic displacement, and online radicalization. In that way, she says, replacement theory's recent change from a simmer to a boil is a sign of how Americans influence and are influenced by the political context around them.\n\n\"It boils over because of the crisis we're living in,\" says Dr. Nadell. \"It's a manifestation of the crisis.\"\n\nAnd it manifests in different ways. Replacement theory is used to refer to a wide spectrum of beliefs, including at the extreme the strident white nationalism of Mr. Gendron, but also general fears of white Americans' approaching minority status .\n\nThat variety plays out among elites. Fox News host Tucker Carlson invoked replacement theory last year in saying, \"The Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate ... with new people, more obedient voters from the Third World.\"\n\nMeanwhile Rep. Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking Republican in the House, ran a Facebook ad last year claiming Democrats wanted to use \"amnesty\" to \"overthrow our current electorate and create a permanent liberal majority in Washington.\"\n\n\"It's almost like there's a hardcore version and a softcore version,\" says Dr. Nadell.\n\nAccording to an Associated Press-NORC poll last December , 32% of respondents strongly or somewhat agreed that \"there is a group of people in this country who are trying to replace native-born Americans with immigrants who agree with their political views.\" Compared with Democrats, Republicans were almost twice as likely to agree with the statement.\n\nSome of those Republicans are like Mr. Walis.\n\nHe started believing there was an organized effort to stifle free-thinking Americans while his oldest son finished high school. In his view, Democratic-tilting coalitions like teacher unions and academics create a system where young people become obedient and close-minded.\n\nAt 18, his graduating son \"hung his head and basically held onto the tail of the elephant in front of him.\"\n\nMeanwhile Mr. Walis' youngest, at 5 years old, \"still believed he could be whatever he wanted,\" he says. \"The difference between the two broke my heart.\"\n\nAs interviews in this Georgia congressional district reveal, concerns tied to changing demographics vary and are often hard to pin down in political labels or easy cause-effect relationships.\n\nDave Shaw, a retiree doing some business at the Paulding County Courthouse, makes emphatically clear that he did not vote for Ms. Greene, and he scoffs at the use of replacement theory to fire up conservative voters. \"We stole this land from the Native Americans, so I'm not sure we can say much about replacement.\"\n\nYet he also echoes a theme voiced by some replacement theory proponents - the worry that America's political culture is straying from its Judeo-Christian roots. He believes there's a concerted behind-the-scenes effort to remove religious values from public life in order to better control the population.\n\nMr. Walis, for his part, quotes Thomas Jefferson, who once wrote about Shays' Rebellion that \"the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants.\" The quote is often used by extremist groups to imply that Democrats and globalists are part of a cabal against that liberty, justifying a violent response.\n\nToday is far from the first time that concerns about immigration and cultural change have taken on forms of replacement theory.\n\nIn the mid-1800s, the concern of American replacement theorists was Irish and German immigrants. After the Civil War, it was freed African Americans. By the end of that century, it was the Chinese, Eastern Europeans, and southern Europeans.\n\nResponses to the fear took on the characteristics of each era. Following Reconstruction, Southern states enacted Jim Crow laws excluding Black Americans from politics. With the rise in nativism during the Gilded Age and the eugenics movement of the early 1900s, Washington passed strict immigration laws, culminating in the quota-based Immigration Act of 1924.\n\nEspecially since the 2016 election of Donald Trump, which itself followed decades of failure to reform the country's immigration system, such concerns have again started to rise, says Michael Barkun, a political scientist and professor emeritus at Syracuse University in New York.\n\n\"It's not simply white supremacists who are pushing this,\" he says. \"It's one of the cycles of nativism that appear periodically in America whenever you have an upswing in immigration.\"\n\nAnd just like before, the current version of replacement theory resembles today's politics - polarized and bitter. That political situation was much of what first led Mr. Walis to support Mr. Trump and Ms. Greene.\n\nThe 14th District, where he lives, stretches from the northwest corner of the metro Atlanta area, to the Alabama border, and all the way up to the Chattanooga, Tennessee, television market. It's 90% white, and 75% of voters there picked both Mr. Trump and Ms. Greene in 2020. Mr. Walis was one of them.\n\nSome of his concerns are over immigration, from illegal entry to cities like New York allowing noncitizens to vote. But more important to him was that Ms. Greene and Mr. Trump are fighters who seemed to recognize the same system that he thinks stifled his son's dreams.\n\nThis week, Ms. Greene railed against what she often calls a corrupt and leftist media for suggesting that Republicans have mainstreamed replacement theory, and now bear responsibility for the violence in Buffalo. Before last Saturday, Mr. Walis had never even heard the term \"replacement theory.\" He now thinks Republicans like him should \"flood the polls\" to protect conservative values.\n\nBut the 14th District isn't a monolith, and to some residents replacement theory isn't new. Nor are its consequences.\n\nJasmine Dixon, a young Black woman, was raised in Paulding County and feels tension around race throughout the area.\n\nAs of last week, a group of Black parents and students is suing a local high school after it suspended students for protesting in Black Lives Matter T-shirts. White students who wore Confederate symbols were spared. It reminds Ms. Dixon of the time school officials asked her to change her Afro hairstyle during high school sports. To some, she says, equality is treated like a threat.\n\nHence, the shooting in Buffalo last weekend doesn't feel so distant from the 14th District, its politics, or even the idea that motivated Mr. Gendron.\n\n\"My sense of replacement theory is that it's driven by a sense that if minorities ever get the upper political hand, they will turn on white people - do to white people what white people have done to us,\" says Ms. Dixon.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Brian Kemp was endorsed by President Donald Trump in Georgia's 2018 Republican primary, and became a hero to many of the state's conservative voters earlier this year when he refused to impose COVID-19 restrictions. A group of conservative economic experts recently ranked him second among the nation's governors.\n\nBut at campaign rallies for Georgia's two Republicans senators this week, Governor Kemp's name generates loud boos and even chants of \"lock him up!\" - the same treatment once given to Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe governor's sin? Defending the integrity of his state's November election, which was recertified as a win for Joe Biden for the third time on Dec. 7. In the weeks since the vote, President Trump has insisted, contrary to all evidence, that he won Georgia and other key swing states, as well as the election overall. He has attacked Mr. Kemp on Twitter, calling him a RINO (Republican in Name Only) and encouraging other Republicans to run against him in 2022.\n\nAs the Peach State hurtles toward Jan. 5 runoff elections that will determine control of the U.S. Senate, Republicans are still warring over the November vote - a sign of the hold President Trump continues to exert over the party.\n\nMr. Trump has always put a premium on personal loyalty. But this postelection period - in which he has continued to press unfounded claims of fraud, even as President-elect Biden prepares to take office - has presented Republicans across the country with a stark test, and created new fissures in the party. In many cases, the divide between those who back Mr. Trump's claims of fraud and those who admit, however regretfully, that he lost the election aligns with whether those officials have actual responsibilities over elections or are simply lobbing criticism from the sidelines.\n\nIn Arizona, Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who previously had a close relationship with Mr. Trump, became the target of critical tweets by the president after he certified Mr. Biden's victory in his state. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who waited six weeks before finally congratulating Mr. Biden on his win, also found himself the subject of an angry presidential tweet.\n\nIn Georgia, the party fracture is particularly acute, and has created an awkward messaging problem for Republicans as the state moves toward two Jan. 5 runoff elections that will determine control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nIncumbent GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue have conspicuously sided with the president in bashing their own state's election apparatus and the Republican officials in charge of it. They've accused GOP Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of failing to deliver \"honest and transparent elections,\" and called for him to resign. This week, Senator Loeffler declined to rule out disputing Mr. Biden's win when Congress meets to ratify the Electoral College results next month, which could force members to vote on the matter (though the outcome would almost certainly not change).\n\nBy amplifying Mr. Trump's baseless fraud charges, the senators could undermine their own reelection efforts - since fueling doubts about the integrity of Georgia's voting could conceivably depress GOP turnout. At Mr. Trump's rally in Valdosta, when Senator Loeffler tried to talk about the importance of holding on to Georgia's Senate seats, she was interrupted with chants to \"stop the steal.\"\n\nYet both senators, like many other Republicans, seem to have calculated that their political survival depends upon remaining in Mr. Trump's and his supporters' good graces. And keeping those supporters angry over a \"stolen\" election could in fact prove to be a powerful political motivator, even after Mr. Trump has left the White House.\n\n\"The Republican Party is splintered right now, and I think it will continue to splinter more depending on what happens with President Trump,\" Marjorie Taylor Greene, representative-elect for Georgia's 14th Congressional District, tells the Monitor. \"If he's not in the White House over the next four years, you're going to see his base, the MAGA base, continue to grow.\"\n\nMs. Greene, who co-owns a commercial construction business with her husband, shocked many in America with her successful congressional campaign as an unapologetic purveyor of the QAnon conspiracy theory, which contends that many prominent Democrats are actually Satan worshippers and child sex traffickers.\n\nIn the shadow of an empty shopping mall parking lot in Duluth, Ms. Greene, who has been embraced by the president, is welcomed with cheers and selfie requests. It's one of more than a dozen scheduled stops on a \"Save America\" bus tour to rally GOP voters ahead of the Georgia runoffs.\n\n\"No matter what you hear on social media, you have to vote,\" Ms. Greene tells a crowd of a hundred or so voters with MAGA flags and shirts that read \"Stop the Steal.\" Other speakers on the tour - including former vice presidential candidate and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, and Utah Sen. Mike Lee - make similar appeals about the importance of voting.\n\nThe tour is an effort to reverse the apathy and disappointment canvassers were hearing from Republican voters after the election was called for Mr. Biden, says David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth, which organized the tour and has put $10 million toward get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nMore specifically, he says, it's an attempt to counter some of the less helpful GOP messaging around the runoffs.\n\nAt a press conference earlier this month, pro-Trump lawyers Lin Wood and Sidney Powell encouraged Republican voters in Georgia to sit out the Senate runoffs as a form of protest. In an interview with Ms. Powell, Lou Dobbs, an anchor on the Fox Business Network, said, \"If the people in Georgia are dumb enough, after what they have gone through in the Nov. 3 election to then go toward Jan. 5 in a runoff and think that changing nothing will change the outcome, then the people of Georgia aren't half as smart as I believe them to be.\"\n\nMany Republican voters attending a recent rally with Vice President Mike Pence outside the Augusta airport say they hope election officials have learned from their \"mistakes\" in November.\n\n\"Maybe now, with more attention, they won't try it again in January,\" says Rhonda McNeely, who works at Big Lots. \"But we can't take our eye off the ball.\"\n\nBecky Strobel, a medical assistant, says she does plan to vote - but anticipates that fraud will occur. \"The more of us who turn out and vote, the harder it is for them to steal it,\" says Ms. Strobel. \"Obviously they can still steal it, like they did in November, but it makes it harder to argue.\"\n\n\"It all comes down to the Peach State,\" trumpets Mr. Pence from a stage decorated with Christmas trees and big red bows. From the risers behind him, a man yells, \"Kick Kemp out!\" and the rallygoers around him laugh.\n\n\"If Kemp doesn't stand up for Trump like Trump stood up for him, I won't vote for him again,\" says Ms. Strobel. \"This will all come back to bite Kemp.\"\n\nFor the GOP officials trying to defend the integrity of the election process, refuting fraud allegations has felt like a never-ending saga - with new rumors seeming to spring up as quickly as they can be put down.\n\n\"Every day you whack one idea down - it's a rumor whack-a-mole - and then another one pops up. It's just endless,\" Mr. Raffensperger commented in a recent virtual discussion with other secretaries of state. \"But there is no proof to anything. Everything they have said, there are facts on our side.\"\n\nAs part of his ongoing effort to reassure the public, Mr. Raffensperger recently announced a signature audit in Cobb County - something President Trump had pushed for - though he said it would not change the outcome of the presidential election.\n\nFew Georgia officials straddle this line in the sand more than Sherry Barnes, an Augusta attorney who serves as both chair of the Richmond County GOP and vice chair of its Board of Elections. From her office near the courthouse in downtown Augusta, Ms. Barnes says she doesn't dispute the general claims of voter fraud. But she insists it didn't happen in her jurisdiction.\n\nRichmond County had the largest turnout in its history, she says, and the fact that they held a safe and secure election amid COVID-19 was impressive. Like Mr. Kemp, Ms. Barnes might be in a position to address any instances of fraud if actual evidence were to emerge. In the absence of any such evidence, however, she suggests that problems might have occurred elsewhere in the state - perhaps Atlanta and its suburbs - but not here.\n\n\"Even with our recount, we only came up with seven votes different out of 87,530 votes,\" says Ms. Barnes. \"What we did was right.\"\n\nShe's had voters call her office to ask about rumors of election officials hiding suitcases of ballots underneath tables, and tried to reassure them that in Richmond County, they don't allow tablecloths. But she doesn't reject the idea that something like that could have occurred elsewhere.\n\n\"We have it out in the open here. But if the other counties did that, that's wrong,\" says Ms. Barnes. \"It tends to make people question the validity of the election.\"\n\nRegardless, she adds, Georgians need to focus on reelecting Senators Perdue and Loeffler.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nRight now, it's an all-hands-on-deck effort to win the Senate runoffs, agrees Congresswoman-elect Greene. Republicans need to turn out despite any grievances they may have with other party officials. There will be time to deal with those concerns later, she says.\n\n\"Leading into the 2022 elections,\" she says, \"we'll handle our family business then.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Northern Georgia, which voted Andrew Clyde and Marjorie Taylor Greene into Congress, remains majority Republican.\n\nLoading...\n\nSept. 12, 2022, 11:57 a.m. ET | Toccoa, Ga.\n\nWhen Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp made one of his first general election campaign swings in August, he went straight to the modern heartland of the state's Republican Party.\n\nIt wasn't Buckhead, the glitzy Atlanta neighborhood where Governor Kemp lives in a governor's mansion dwarfed by other nearby estates. And it wasn't suburban Cobb County, once the bastion of Newt Gingrich.\n\nInstead, Governor Kemp kept going north, deep into the Georgia mountains that have become one of the most Republican areas in the country over the past three decades. He stopped at a gas station turned coffee shop in Toccoa to urge people to \"turn out an even bigger vote here in this county and in northeast Georgia than we've ever seen before.\"\n\n\"Ask your kids, your grandkids, your friend's kid, are they registered to vote?\" Governor Kemp told attendees. \"If they're eligible, and they're not, we got to get them registered, and we've got to go tell them to pull it for the home team.\"\n\nThe emphasis on this rural region represents a notable shift in the GOP's strategy in Georgia. The party grew into a powerhouse in Georgia once it began combining a strong performance in the Atlanta suburbs with growing dominance in rural areas. But that coalition has frayed in recent years as voters in the booming Atlanta region rejected the GOP under former President Donald Trump, turning this one time Republican stronghold into the South's premier swing state.\n\nA 41-county region, including some distant Atlanta suburbs encroaching into north Georgia, now has as many GOP voters as the core of metro Atlanta, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. Those changing dynamics have intensified pressure on Governor Kemp to maintain - or strengthen - his support in rural mountainous communities like Toccoa to offset losses closer to the capital city.\n\nGovernor Kemp won the governor's office in 2018 by defeating Democrat Stacey Abrams by just 1.4 percentage points. As the two wage a rematch for the job this year, early summer polling found a close race, with some suggesting Governor Kemp has a narrow advantage.\n\nBut his reliance on voters like those in Toccoa is driving the party further to the right.\n\nIn a diversifying state, north Georgia is overwhelmingly white. While Democrats attack and Republicans fret over abortion restrictions in the suburbs, there's little public wavering in the mountains. Voters love guns so much that they cut out the middleman and chose gun dealer Andrew Clyde as one of north Georgia's two very Trumpy members of Congress. The other member? Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\n\"It reflects a lot of the country right now, in the sense that it's very populist, very close to the vest, very isolated in the sense of distrust of government, very strong-willed, mountain Appalachian-type individuals that are very self-sufficient,\" said former Rep. Doug Collins, the Republican who preceded Mr. Clyde in representing northeast Georgia's 9th Congressional District.\n\nKathy Petrella, a Clarkesville retiree who was visiting the state Department of Driver Services in early September in Toccoa, said she's a \"true blue conservative.\"\n\n\"It means I don't believe in the government telling me anything I have to do, except law and order,\" said Ms. Petrella, who cites her Christian faith as an important anchor of her political affiliation and fears a decline into \"communism.\"\n\nLee MacAulay of the north Georgia town of Cleveland, also visiting Toccoa, said she believes Trump won the 2020 election and calls President Joe Biden \"a ridiculous joke\" and \"an idiot.\"\n\n\"I was a Trumper,\" Ms. MacAulay said. \"I am a Trumper.\"\n\nJay Doss, a Toccoa lawyer, said he feels \"working-class people are benefited more by the conservative party\" and that \"I just feel that less government is better for everybody.\"\n\nThere was once another conservative tradition in north Georgia - in the Democratic Party. While there were always some Republicans, a legacy of white mountaineers who backed the Union over the Confederacy in the Civil War, they won few elections.\n\n\"It used to be slap Democrat. If you ran Republican, you could not get elected. Now, if you run Democrat, you ain't got a chance much of getting elected,\" said Stephens County Commissioner Dennis Bell, a Republican who owns Currahee Station, the coffee shop where Governor Kemp campaigned in Toccoa.\n\nThat Democratic lineage, nourished by the 1930s-era New Deal, produced former Gov. Zell Miller, a proud son of the mountains and titan of Georgia Democratic politics a generation ago.\n\nMr. Miller rode high in the 1990s as a Democrat who combatted crime and overhauled welfare, while creating lottery-funded college scholarships. Mr. Miller even squeaked out a reelection victory in the 1994 \"Republican Revolution\" that vaulted Newt Gingrich to U.S. House Speaker.\n\nThat year, Mr. Miller actually lost his home region to Republican Guy Millner, a self-financed millionaire businessman. But Mr. Miller lost by fewer than 4,000 votes across north Georgia, and Mr. Millner's strength in suburban Atlanta wasn't enough, leaving the Republican 32,000 votes short statewide.\n\nBy 2004, as a U.S. senator, Mr. Miller was giving the keynote speech at the Republican National Convention that renominated George W. Bush. By then, Mr. Miller had written \"A National Party No More,\" a book that blamed his own party for abandoning Southern conservative Democrats.\n\n\"Obviously, southerners believe the national Democratic Party does not share their values,\" Mr. Miller wrote in the 2003 book. \"They do not trust the national party with their money or the security of the country.\"\n\nNorth Georgia was 19% of Mr. Millner's vote in 1994. It was 26% of Governor Kemp's vote in 2018. Some of that is due to population growth, but reflects a partisan shift to Republicans. Mr. Millner won less than 51% of the vote in the region. Governor Kemp won almost 72%.\n\nDemocrats, enduring steep decline, grew demoralized. June Krise, who then chaired the Democratic Party in north Georgia's White County, remembers crying when the county probate judge, clerk of court, and sheriff all switched to run as Republicans.\n\n\"'If we don't switch, we will lose because the Republicans are going to run somebody against us,'\" Ms. Krise remembers the men telling her. \"And guess why they were going to lose. Barack Obama was the Democratic nominee for president.\"\n\nRepublicans say formerly Democratic voters gravitated to their party because of cultural issues, but those who study the electorate note white voters are much more likely to be Republican, and Appalachia made a hard turn against Mr. Obama, the nation's first Black president.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) may have violated House ethics rules on Wednesday by calling on the Department of Justice and FBI to investigate protests against Tesla-a company in which she has a financial interest, buying stock in it as recently as last week.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), chair of the subcommittee on Delivering On Government ... More Efficiency (DOGE), listens during a hearing in February. (Photo by ALEX WROBLEWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nGreene owned less than $1,000 in Tesla stock at the end of 2023, but beginning in September 2024-amid Tesla CEO Elon Musk's increasingly vocal support for Donald Trump-she went on a buying spree, making nine purchases totaling between $9,000 and $135,000, according to disclosures she filed with the House Clerk's Office.\n\nAfter Trump won the presidency and the GOP clinched control of Congress, Greene announced she would chair a new House Oversight subcommittee supervising Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nFive of Greene's Tesla stock purchases came after that appointment, the most recent of which was $1,000 to $15,000 worth of shares on March 7.\n\nProtests targeting Tesla -ranging from peaceful demonstrations to arson and gunfire-have appeared across the country, seemingly fueled by concerns over Musk's deep cuts to federal government staff and spending.\n\nOn Wednesday, Greene-in her capacity as chair of the DOGE subcommittee- wrote to the Justice Department and the FBI, calling on the agencies \"to prioritize a thorough investigation\" into what she called \"the recent wave of organized attacks targeting Elon Musk and Tesla car dealerships, charging stations, and vehicles across the country.\"\n\nAfter this article was published, Nick Dyer, a spokesperson for Greene, responded to Forbes' earlier inquiry: \"It's about domestic terrorist attacks, Zach. You are nothing more than a Democrat troll. Enough out of you.\"\n\nAccording to the House's code of conduct , \"A Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer, or employee of the House may not receive compensation and may not permit compensation to accrue to the beneficial interest of such individual from any source, the receipt of which would occur by virtue of influence improperly exerted from the position of such individual in Congress.\"\n\n\"The letter could raise a serious ethics issue for Representative Greene,\" Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in campaign finance, told Forbes. \"House ethics rules prohibit a member from taking any official action that would benefit her own financial interest.\" Kappel cited a 2012 House ethics investigation into Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-Nev.) that found she violated the law by \"improperly using her official position for her beneficial interest\" by helping her husband's medical practice obtain payments from government agencies that he believed he was owed.\n\nGreene's stake in Tesla is likely valued between $7,400 and $116,000, as of Wednesday's close, based on congressional disclosure rules that require lawmakers to report holdings only in broad ranges. Her investments, however, have likely lost value- Tesla closed at $248.09 on Wednesday, below the stock's lowest price on six of the nine days she bought shares.\n\n\"🚨Attacks on Tesla must be investigated as domestic terrorism! 🚨,\" Greene wrote Wednesday on X (formerly Twitter) in a post sharing her letter. \"Today, my @DOGECommittee colleagues and I sent a letter to @AGPamBondi and @FBIDirectorKash asking for an investigation into the wave of organized attacks targeting @elonmusk, @Tesla, and the @DOGE effort. Who is behind it? Who is funding it? Is there a link with Democrat-leaning NGOs? We look forward to exposing these terrorists and bringing them to justice!\"\n\nIn January, Reps. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.) and Zach Nunn (R-Iowa) filed the No Corruption in Government Act, which would ban House members and their spouses from holding, purchasing or selling stocks, bonds, options and other securities while in office. The bill is in committee.\n\nIn June 2024, Greene introduced an amendment to the defense budget seeking to ban federal funds from being used on electrical vehicles or electrical vehicle infrastructure.\n\nBefore joining Congress in 2021, Greene held between $15,000 and $50,000 in Tesla stock. By the end of 2022, the value of her holdings had dwindled to less than $1,000-likely due to her divorce settlement that year.\n\nDespite Tesla's plummeting stock price, Elon Musk remains far and away the wealthiest person in the world, worth an estimated $327 billion.\n\nTrump SPAC Investor Rep.

In since-deleted Facebook posts, Greene reportedly claimed the Camp Fire that broke out in California in 2018 was caused by lasers fired from space. Greene posited these lasers were powered by \"space solar generators\" created from an investment from \"Rothschild, Inc.\" The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said an investigation revealed the fire was caused by electrical transmission lines. Greene has also been criticized for her earlier support of the QAnon movement, which she claimed to have stopped supporting in 2018.\n\nOne Community. Many Voices.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., criticized a first-term Democrat's \"fake eyelashes\", only to be slammed in response for her \"bleach blonde bad-built butch body,\" with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., also entering the fray.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called for \"decorum\" after a contentious stand off between Rep. ... More Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nThe standoff came during a House Oversight Committee hearing Thursday night on whether to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt for refusing to turn over audio tapes of an interview between President Joe Biden and special counsel Robert Hur where Biden reportedly showed signs of a \"significantly limited\" memory.\n\nIn that hearing, Greene asked if \"any of the Democrats on this committee\" employ the daughter of New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan, the judge overseeing former President Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial-seeming to reiterate Trump's baseless theory that the judge in the case is biased.\n\nIn response to Greene's question, Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crocket, Texas, asked if Greene knew \"what you're here for,\" prompting a tense back-and-forth ending with Greene arguing Crocket's \"fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez then shot back at the Trump-aligned Republican, calling Greene's response \"absolutely unacceptable,\" and asking, \"how dare you attack the physical appearance of another person,\" with Greene responding: \"are your feelings hurt?\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez then called Greene a \"baby girl,\" and motioned to strike Greene's comments, which Greene agreed to, though she refused to apologize and called on Ocasio-Cortez to \"debate\" her, before arguing she does not \"have enough intelligence.\"\n\nImmediately after the motion, Crocket attacked Greene for her \"bleach blonde, bad-built butch body,\" with committee Chair Jim Comer, R-Ky, saying: \"a what now?\"\n\nGreene then told Crocket to \"calm down,\" to which Crocket vehemently responded, \"don't tell me to calm down, saying: \"if I come and talk s**t about her we're going to have a problem.\"\n\nIn a statement Friday morning, Johnson lamented the fight was \"not a good look for Congress,\" arguing \"decorum is an important principle to maintain\" and adding: \"We can have vigorous debate, that's what this institution is built on...but you know, we have to treat one another with dignity and respect.\"\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa.-who himself has picked up a reputation in his first year in the Senate for his casual wardrobe and frequent political jabs-also called out the back-and-forth, saying he has \"described the U.S. House as the 'Jerry Springer Show,\" and adding that today he is \"apologizing to the 'Jerry Springer Show.'\" Ocasio-Cortez replied to Fetterman's post on X, claiming he \"likely would not have stood up for your colleague and seem to be confused about racism and misogyny being a 'both sides' issue\" (Crocket is Black).\n\nGreene was first elected to Congress in 2020, two years after Ocasio-Cortez won her election in New York. Since coming into office, the pair have become prominent voices for the far-right MAGA movement and progressive platform, respectively, often butting heads in public outbursts. Over the past year, Greene had a tense confrontation with progressive Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., when the New York Democrat called Greene a \"white supremacist,\" motioned to censure Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., over pro-Somali comments, and made headlines again earlier this month triggered a motion to vacate Johnson from the speakership. Ocasio-Cortez has also slammed Republicans, blasting the Supreme Court's conservative majority for its overturning of Roe v. Wade, calling the court \"extremist.\"\n\nOne Community. Many Voices.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., called for Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to resign after the House passed bills approving billions in aid for Ukraine and Israel on Saturday-few of her Republican colleagues have joined her, including many members of the far-right Freedom Caucus that forced out the last speaker who also worked with Democrats to pass legislation.\n\nThe Georgia representative accused Johnson of \"betraying\" the American people after he passed bills ... More to fund aid for Ukraine and Israel.\n\nGreene told reporters on Saturday that support for her motion to vacate was \"growing,\" and called Johnson a \"lame duck\" and claimed that he would \"not be speaker today\" if her privileged motion was voted on immediately.\n\nHowever, only a handful of far-right congressional Republicans have signed on to Greene's effort-including Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz.\n\nAfter the vote passed on Saturday, Massie posted a video of members of Congress waving Ukrainian flags-calling the bill as \"total capitulation with no victory for securing our border.\"\n\nBoth Greene and Massie continued their attacks on Johnson on Sunday morning-with Greene claiming Republicans will lose control of the House in 2025 with Johnson at the helm.\n\nGreene also reposted a photo of U.S. troops returning in coffins covered with American flags-with the ominous message: \"this is what is next.\"\n\n\"I am not resigning,\" Johnson told reporters at a press conference before the vote last week, calling Greene's motion to vacate \"absurd.\"\n\n\"This is the third betrayal by Mike Johnson,\" Greene told reporters on the steps of the Capitol after the vote on Friday, also criticizing him for renewing the Foreign Surveillance Act and funding the Department of Justice, which she accused of \"spying\" on former President Donald Trump's campaign and raiding his home at Mar-a-Lago. \"And then he did this b*** in here on the House floor-foreign war package that does nothing for America. It's unbelievable. I'm thankful that America gets to see who this man is, because this is the only way it's going to change. People have to see the truth.\" On Sunday, Greene doubled down on her criticism of Johnson, preemptively blaming him for voters rejecting the Republican Party. \"Republican voters will not vote for this again,\" she said in a post on X . \"We will lose the majority in 2025.\"\n\nAlthough Greene and Massie have been outspoken in their disapproval, other Republicans praised his leadership and applauded his work with Democrats to pass both aid packages and temper the opposition driven by Greene and other far-right members of the party. \"I am so proud of the speaker, Mike Johnson. He went through a transformation,\" Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday. He also received praise from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \"I am grateful to the United States House of Representatives, both parties, and personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the decision that keeps history on the right track,\" the Ukrainian leader wrote in a post on X .\n\nThe House passed two separate foreign aid bills on Saturday, approving about $61 billion for Ukraine, $26 billion for Israel, and $8 billion for Taiwan and other allies in the Pacific. Only 101 Republicans voted against the Ukraine bill-less than half of their caucus of 218 members of Congress. Even fewer voted against the Israel bill. Greene, alongside Massie and Gosar joined progressive Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., in opposing the Israel funding bill.\n\nThe foreign aid bills will now go before the Senate before heading to President Biden's desk. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer promised to hold a vote on the bills next week, with a \"tentative agreement\" to put the bills on the Senate floor as early as Tuesday, Politico reported.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus previously led the successful effort to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., after he worked with Democrats to pass a spending package to avert a government shutdown. However, none of the eight Republicans who voted alongside Democrats for McCarthy's removal have signed on to Greene's effort to remove Johnson, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C. Greene, a former member of the right-wing caucus who was ejected in July after a feud with Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Col., did not vote to remove McCarthy. He eventually resigned from Congress in December, leaving Republicans with an even slimmer majority in Congress."

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., refused to address Dr. Anthony Fauci as \"doctor\" and called for him to be jailed during an, at times, explosive hearing before Congress on the origins of Covid-19-as Republicans continue to demonize the federal government's former top infectious disease expert in their probe into the government's response to the pandemic.\n\nRep.

(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\n\nGreene told Fauci \"you're not a doctor, you're Mr. Fauci in my few minutes,\" adding that his medical license should be revoked and he should be \"in prison\" for \"crimes against humanity,\" citing mask mandates.\n\nGreene delivered the attacks as she accused Fauci and government agencies of \"making up guidelines, like six-feet distancing and masking of children,\" questioning whether \"the American people deserve to be abused like that?\"\n\nOfficials like Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have recently acknowledged the six-foot social distancing recommendation was not based on medical data, with Fauci telling Congress in a closed-door interview in January the Centers for Disease Control made the recommendation as \"an empiric decision that wasn't based on data,\" according to a transcript of the interview released Friday.\n\nRep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, who is a podiatric doctor and chairs the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, reprimanded Greene in response to the attack, instructing her to refer to Fauci as \"doctor\" and adhere by committee rules of decorum, to which she responded \"I'm not addressing him as doctor.\"\n\nFauci voluntarily agreed to testify in the hearing, which marks his first public appearance on Capitol Hill since he left government in 2022.\n\nRepublicans have zeroed in on the notion that the virus causing Covid-19 originated from a lab leak in Wuhan, China, a theory Fauci and medical experts have said is unlikely, but not improbable. Republicans have accused Fauci of trying to downplay the lab leak theory because a nonprofit \"virus-hunting\" research organization, EcoHealth Alliance, received grants from the National Institute of Health and subcontracted with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. \"Covid-19 wasn't created by bats in a wet market . . . it was manufactured in a lab funded by Fauci. He tried to cover it up,\" Greene said last year. Some of the research methods ostensibly used at the lab in Wuhan are controversial and considered risky , but no direct evidence has emerged linking that research to the coronavirus, and federal officials say the viruses studied by EcoHealth Alliance were genetically distinct from the virus that causes Covid-19. Republicans have also questioned whether Fauci flouted public records laws by sending emails from his personal account, pointing to an email one of his senior advisers, Dr. David Morens, sent to other scientists explaining that Fauci was aware of including sensitive information in emails that could be leaked, writing \"I can either send stuff to Tony on his private gmail, or hand it to him at work or his house.\" Fauci denied the accusation in his opening statement Monday, stating that \"to the best of my knowledge I have never conducted official business via my personal email.\"\n\nFauci said it was \"absolutely false and simply preposterous\" to accuse him of attempting to cover up the lab leak theory in his opening statement, in which he read an email he sent to another scientist detailing his instructions for an investigation into the theory. \"It is inconceivable that anyone who reads this email could conclude that I was trying to cover up the possibility of a lab leak. I have always kept an open mind to the different possibilities,\" Fauci told the committee.\n\nThe federal government suspended funding to EcoHealth Alliance last month after the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general released an audit alleging the NIH failed to properly monitor how the grant money was facilitating research at the lab in Wuhan.\n\nFauci: Trump's Covid-19 Response 'Very Likely Did' Cost Lives (Forbes)\n\nHere's What Dr. Fauci Has Said About Covid's Origins And The Lab Leak Theory (Forbes)\n\n'That's Nonsense': Fauci Responds To GOP Backlash Over His Emails On Covid Origin (Forbes)\n\nOne Community.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said she was \"attacked\" by an \"insane\" woman and \"screamed at by her adult son\" inside a restaurant on Monday night, days after she made headlines by re-upping her proposal for a \"National Divorce\" and criticizing U.S. aid to Ukraine.\n\nU.S. Rep.

In a series of seven messages, Joseph Morelli, 51, told Greene he would show her \"what violence truly is\" and threatened that he could \"pay someone\" to \"take a baseball bat and crack [her] skull,\" according to federal prosecutors. Morelli, whose attorney said he has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, faces up to five years in prison on three counts of transmitting interstate threatening communications. In August, police responded to two false shooting reports at Greene's home in Rome, Georgia, what law enforcement described as a dangerous \"swatting\" incident in which callers intend for police to rush to the scene in heavily armed SWAT gear.\n\nGreene, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump who was elected in 2020 on a platform that appealed to his right-wing backers, has maintained a prominent place in headlines during her time in office with her fervent criticism of left-leaning politics and lawmakers. On February 20 , she re-upped her suggestion that the U.S. needs a \"national divorce\" between Republican and Democratic states over what she called \"disgusting woke culture issues shoved down our throats to the Democrat's traitorous America Last policies.\" On Thursday, a day before the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, she called for an audit on U.S. aid to Ukraine, and likened the federal government's involvement in the conflict to its spending on the war in Iraq.\n\n'Slap In The Face': White House Condemns Marjorie Taylor Greene For Saying She 'Would Have Won' Jan. 6 Riot (Forbes)\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene Assails Ex-Twitter Execs For Banning Her Account-Accuses One Of Endorsing Child Sexualization (Forbes)\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene Faces Second 'Swatting' Incident This Week (Forbes)"

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) was fined thousands of dollars after the Federal Election Commission determined she illegally solicited contributions to a super PAC aligned with her, documents made public Friday revealed.\n\nGreene appeared in an ad for Stop Socialism Now PAC and solicited contributions for the organization ... More in violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, according to the FEC.\n\nThe complaint alleged Greene solicited non-federal funds for Stop Socialism Now PAC, a PAC aligned with Greene, when she appeared in a digital advertisement post online in late 2020 and early 2021 that contained unrestricted solicitations of contributions to the PAC.\n\nBecause Greene shared the digital advertisement-which contained requests for contributions of unrestricted funds-on her official profiles on Facebook and X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, Greene violated the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, the FEC said.\n\nThere was not sufficient information to determine whether Stop Socialism Now also violated the Act, according to the FEC.\n\nGreene did not immediately respond to Forbes' request for comment.\n\nThis is not the first time the Stop Socialism Now PAC has been wrapped up in an FEC violation. The FEC accused the PAC of making several errors in a July 2022 financial report. Among the errors was an improper $5,000 donation to Republican former U.S. House candidate J.R. Majewski, the FEC said. The FEC alleged the PAC sent the money to Majewski after the primary election, which violates federal rules.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene's PAC Is Violating Campaign Finance Rules: Federal Regulators (Business Insider)"

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene's Confrontation With Jamaal Bowman: Here's What Happened\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) slammed progressive Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) in a press conference Thursday morning, accusing Bowman of calling her a \"white supremacist\" and comparing the label to \"calling a person of color the N-word,\" following a tense confrontation Wednesday between the two representatives outside the Capitol Building.\n\nRep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) argued on the steps of the Capitol ... More after an interview with Rep. George Santos (R-NY), who faces fraud and money laundering charges.\n\nGreene, a vocal Trump ally, said in the press conference while introducing articles of impeachment against President Joe Biden she \"takes great offense\" to being called a \"white supremacist,\" which is just as \"wrong\" as calling a person of color the \"N-word\" (video of Wednesday's incident does not show Bowman, who is Black, calling Greene a \"white supremacist\").\n\nThe confrontation on the steps of the Capitol building Wednesday started during an interview with Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.), the indicted first-term representative facing calls to step down.\n\nDuring the interview, Bowman started yelling at Santos from across the steps to resign, saying \"New Yorkers need better\" and \"you've got to kick him out.\"\n\nGreene then approached Bowman as Santos stepped away, while Bowman turned his attention to Greene, shouting at her to expel Santos (a growing group of representatives, including GOP members, have voiced their support for Santos' expulsion or resignation).\n\nGreene, in response, turned to reporters, chanting \"impeach Biden\" and telling Bowman to close the U.S.-Mexico border and \"save the country,\" before the confrontation was broken up by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who told Bowman: \"She ain't worth it.\"\n\nGreene, who has come under fire for espousing conspiracy theories and attending a meeting organized by white nationalist Nick Fuentes during her first two-plus years in office, said Thursday she feels \"threatened\" by Bowman, adding his \"physical mannerisms are aggressive\" and that he \"led a mob\" to the Capitol.\n\nGreene also told reporters she \"had to have so much security there was not enough\" and that she \"was swarmed\" during the interaction with Bowman Wednesday night, though video footage shows Greene approached Bowman, and neither appeared to be in physical danger.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday, Bowman called Greene's comments \"reckless and dangerous,\" saying: \"This country has a history of characterizing Black men who are outspoken, who stand their ground and who push back as being threatening or intimidating, so she's not even using a dog whistle, she's using a bullhorn to put a target on my back.\" Bowman also compared Greene's comments to the accusations against Mike Brown and Emmett Till, saying it was \"the same reason\" they were killed.\n\nBowman, who was first elected in 2020 along with Greene, has made headlines as an outspoken critic of Republican policies. Following a school shooting in Nashville in March he called GOP members \"gutless\" and \"cowards\" in a shouting match with Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.). Greene, meanwhile, has come under fire for spreading debunked conspiracy theories, promoting former President Donald Trump's claim the 2020 election was stolen and for addressing white supremacists earlier this year at an America First Political Action Conference in Orlando, an event organized by hard-right political extremist Nick Fuentes , who has been labeled a white supremacist (Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) later said there is no place in the GOP for \"white supremacists or anti-semitism\"). That same week, Greene said an \"insane\" woman \"attacked\" her in a screaming match at a restaurant, calling her \"self-righteous, insane and completely out of control.\"\n\nGreene argued Thursday Biden should be impeached over his handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, following the expiration of the Trump-era policy called Title 42, which allowed border agents to swiftly expel migrants at both the Canadian and Mexican borders-The Biden Administration has been heavily scrutinized by GOP lawmakers, who argue the end of Title 42 caused a surge in migrants to the southern border. Speaking in a press conference, Greene accused Biden of plotting to \"systematically destroy this country.\"\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene Says She Was 'Attacked' In A Restaurant (Forbes)"

I cover breaking news at Forbes.\n\nBy Anna Kaplan ,\n\nForbes Staff.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a loud but marginal member of the Republican Party's conservative wing, appears to be doubling down on anti-LGBTQ rhetoric in the past week-calling for the end of Pride Month, wildly claiming that straight people will become extinct-and also claiming, with the usual dearth of evidence, that the Uvalde gunman was a \"cross-dressing loner.\"\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene speaks during a press conference in front of the Capitol on April 28, ... More 2022, in Washington, D.C.\n\nGreene compared \"an entire\" Pride Month to the \"only one day each year\" that Americans honor military members who died serving the country in a tweet on Wednesday-the first day of Pride Month.\n\nShe added that \"an entire\" Pride Month celebrating LGBTQ identity and millions in spending from corporations and the government \"needs to end.\"\n\nWhen asked to clarify if Greene was calling for the end of Pride Month entirely, or if she was calling for it to be shortened, Greene's communications director, Nick Dyer, said, \"Her tweet is self-explanatory,\" in a statement to Forbes .\n\nGreene baselessly claimed earlier this week that she believes straight people face extinction within 150 years during a segment on her streaming broadcast that airs on her social media accounts.\n\nOn the same broadcast, she seemed to follow the same misinformation used by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) to claim that the Uvalde shooter was transgender, using false information and photos of another person.\n\nThe attacks come in a year when a spate of legislation on gender and sex education issues in statehouses across the country have many Republicans concerned that the party has drifted into anti-LGBTQ territory.\n\n\"Probably in about four or five generations, no one will be straight anymore,\" Greene said . \"Everyone will be either gay or trans or nonconforming or whatever the list of 50 or 60 different options there are.\" (According to a Gallup Poll conducted in February, 86.3% of Americans consider themselves to be straight, and Gallup has noted it is still unclear if generational increases are due to \"a true shift in sexual orientation\" or if it \"reflects a greater willingness of younger people to identify as LGBT.\")\n\nLast year, Greene cosponsored legislation that would ban U.S. embassies from flying Pride flags. (The bill stood virtually no chance of passing.) In a statement at the time, she said, \"The federal government should only be flying the flag that represents ALL people, the American flag.\"\n\nGreene won her primary last week, even after a group of Georgia voters sued to have her removed from the ballot, arguing she \"voluntarily aided and engaged in an insurrection\" in the days between being sworn into Congress on January 3, 2021, and the January 6 attack on the Capitol-acts the group claimed was a violation of the 14th Amendment. Greene had to testify as part of the suit, though a judge ultimately recommended she should not be disqualified for being an \"insurrectionist\" and remain on the midterm ballot-a decision that was upheld by Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R). The midterm elections will be held November 8.\n\nDid Marjorie Taylor Greene Say 'Peach Tree Dish' Instead Of Petri Dish? ( Forbes )\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene To Remain On Midterm Ballot ( Forbes )"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRepublican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has claimed that nearly $1 trillion per year could be saved by cutting out fraudulent Social Security payments and that the benefits are being paid out to deceased individuals, noncitizens and criminals abroad.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump incorrectly claimed earlier this month that millions of dead people are receiving government benefits.\n\nDemocrats say that Republicans are using claims of fraud at the Social Security Administration (SSA) as a pretense for scrutiny and cuts. But Trump and his allies have repeatedly denied that they have plans to cut Social Security benefits.\n\nGeorgia Representative Greene posted on X , formerly Twitter , on Monday that using identity verification software would prevent fraudulent Social Security payments.\n\n\"During my first DOGE Committee hearing, it was exposed that nearly $1 TRILLION dollars per year of fraudulent and improper payments could be saved simply by putting identify verification software on federal government payment processors,\" she wrote.\n\n\"This would stop checks from being sent to dead people, illegals, and criminals in foreign countries just by verifying people's identity. Think about it. You have to verify your identity many times a day just to complete basic tasks.\"\n\nHer comments follow those of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk , who claimed that millions of Americans aged over 100 are receiving Social Security benefits.\n\nDuring a recent Fox News interview, Musk suggested that his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) would examine such programs.\n\n\"The waste and fraud in entitlement spending, which is most of the federal spending, is entitlements,\" he claimed, \"so that's the big one to eliminate.\" He also repeated a conspiracy theory alleging that Democrats were using these programs as a \"gigantic magnet to attract illegal immigrants and have them stay in the country.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Musk referred to Social Security as \"the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\"\n\nMeanwhile in a joint address to Congress on March 4, Trump said that his administration was investigating widespread fraud in the Social Security program, stating that government databases list millions of beneficiaries at improbable ages, including individuals over 160 years old. He claimed the database even shows one person on the rolls aged 360.\n\nHowever, the SSA said in a statement a day later: \"The data reported in the media represent people who do not have a date of death associated with their record.\n\n\"While these people may not be receiving benefits, it is important for the agency to maintain accurate and complete records.\"\n\nIn January, the U.S. Treasury recovered over $31 million in federal payments mistakenly sent to deceased individuals. The issue partly stems from outdated Social Security software, which lacks proper date handling. Reports also revealed that the agency hadn't updated its database, which still includes millions of deceased individuals' records.\n\nIn a statement on February 19, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek clarified that individuals listed as over 100 years old in the Social Security system are \"not necessarily receiving benefits\" but are instead individuals without a recorded date of death.\n\nA 2024 audit from the Office of the Inspector General found that the agency had made almost $72 billion in improper payments between 2015 and 2022, accounting for just under 1% of the $8.6 trillion in total payments during that period. Since 2015, the SSA has used an automated process to stop benefits for individuals aged 115 or older.\n\nA 2023 report from the inspector general revealed that 18.9 million people born in 1920 or earlier had no death information in SSA records and 44,000 of them were still receiving payments.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene said in her post on X: \"Our own government just blindly sends checks to anyone and everyone whether citizen, non-citizen, dead or alive.\n\n\"We must end this malpractice and outright waste, fraud, and abuse. This is the mission of DOGE.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"A previous investigation revealed the SSA paid at least $71.8 billion in improper payments. The Social Security Administration is now working to find even more waste, fraud, and abuse in the Administration's whole-of-government effort to protect American taxpayers.\"\n\nIn February 18 interview on Fox News , Trump said: \"Social Security won't be touched, other than if there's fraud or something. It's going to be strengthened. But it won't be touched.\"\n\nRight now, there are no plans to privatize Social Security. However, the SSA has announced plans to reduce its workforce by 7,000 employees this month under Trump's project to reduce the size of the federal government.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nMartha McHardy is a U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is on polling and California politics.

This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE!!! Rep Miller recognized Rep McBride as 'gentleman' and 'Mr.' NOT as 'gentlewoman' and 'Ms.' McBride is a MAN!!! No one should change Rep Miller's words!!!

The transcript has since been changed to reflect that Miller actually referred to McBride as \"the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. McBride).\"\n\nMiller, an ally of President Donald Trump who has backed recent anti-trans policies by White House, made the remark while presiding over the House of Representatives.\n\nMcBride did not respond and instead went after the Trump administration for its raft of executive orders that have resulted in the firing of thousands of federal employees, and have cut funding for dozens of federal programs.\n\nMiller, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, previously declared in a post on X that she had \"refused to deny biological reality\" on the chamber floor. \"President Trump restored biological truth in the federal government, and I refuse to perpetuate the lie that gender is open to our interpretation. It is not,\" the Republican added.\n\nMcBride is a freshman congresswoman for Delaware's at-large congressional district. She is the highest-ranking transgender elected official in United States history and the first openly trans member of the United States Congress .\n\nShe previously became the subject of an anti-trans move by South Carolina Republican Representative Nancy Mace , who filed a bill in November seeking to ban transgender women from using female bathrooms at the U.S. Capitol days after McBride was elected.\n\nIn response to the bill, House Speaker Mike Johnson released a statement in which he said, \"All single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office buildings-such as restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms-are reserved for individuals of that biological sex.\"\n\nMcBride agreed to follow the rules set out by Johnson, commenting, \"I'm not here to fight about bathrooms.\"\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X: \"This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE!!!

The Congressional Record is an official publication, and should accurately reflect my words. I refuse to participate in this lie.

At 78-year-old, Trump is now the oldest-ever sitting president.\n\nGreene posted on X: \"I'm so impressed at how good President Trump looks.\"\n\n\"He's healthy, sharp, and incredibly wise. He has more energy than everyone around him especially the nasty fake news that ask him the most America LAST pathetic questions.\"\n\nThe post had been viewed nearly 70,000 thousand times, at the time of writing.\n\nTrump became the oldest presidential nominee in history when Biden ended his reelection bid in 2024. Though there have been some concerns over his age, the scrutiny he has faced has been significantly less than his predecessor.\n\nA survey taken during the campaign from The Economist and YouGov found that a majority of voters, some 56 percent, believed Trump's age would have little to no effect on his ability to be president.\n\nIn contrast, a poll taken prior to the 2024 Presidential Election campaign in February of 2024 found that 86 percent of voters had major or moderate concerns about Biden's age or health .\n\nThough there is discourse about President Donald Trump and his age. Michael Steele, the former chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC), recently suggested during an appearance on MSNBC 's The Weekend that Trump's age is an influential factor in Elon Musk's rise within the Republican party.\n\n\"Maybe he's too old for the job now,\" Steele, who is critical of Trump, said in response to a question from The Weekend co-host, Symone Sanders-Townsend.\n\nThere were some questions raised about Trump's \"mental abilities ,\" during the election, particularly after a rally in Pennsylvania when Trump suddenly informed the crowd that he would like to \"not do any more questions\" and instead \"just listen to music.\"\n\nBut the questioning about his cognitive abilities has never been as prominent as it was for Biden, and while there have been negative headlines regarding Trump's age , there are other headlines from outlets like Fox News and the Washington Examiner which praise his mental fitness and stamina.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene on X: \"It's just so great to have a POTUS that is more than capable of making America GREAT again!!! Praise God for answering our prayers!!\"\n\nDiscourse about Trump's age, mental fitness and overall appearance is likely to continue throughout his presidency.\n\nDo you have a story Newsweek should be covering?

Those jobs are paid for by the American tax people, who work real jobs, earn real income, pay federal taxes and then pay these federal employees.\"\n\nThe Georgia Republican continued: \"Federal employees do not deserve their jobs. Federal employees do not deserve their paychecks. And these are jobs that can be fired at will.\"\n\nGreene's remarks came directly after Illinois Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi spoke out against privatizing the U.S. Postal Service, claiming this would throw \"trillions of dollars of e-commerce transactions into turmoil.\"\n\nOn February 20, The Washington Post reported that President Donald Trump plans to disband the USPC's board of governors and put the agency under the direct control of the Commerce Department, which critics say could be a first move toward privatization.\n\n\"These reports are beyond troubling, and I respectfully request that you have a hearing again on the USPS,\" Krishnamoorthi said.\n\nDemocratic Texas Representative Veronica Escobar, on X: \"Marjorie Taylor Greene believes 6,008 of her constituents are unworthy of a job or a paycheck because they work for the federal government. To quote her favorite person: SAD!\"\n\nEmma Vigeland, a political commentator who cohosts the Majority Report podcast, on X: \"Everybody should earn an honest living the way Marjorie Taylor Greene did before she became a public servant: inheriting a construction business from your dad.\"\n\nThe MAGA Voice X account shared a clip of Greene's remarks on X: \"HOLY S*** - Marjorie Taylor Greene exposes all of these Federal employees using American's Tax dollars to protest. MIC DROP.\"\n\nMusk has previously said he wants to cut federal government spending by up to $2 trillion annually .

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene , a Georgia Republican , has voiced her support for renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, introducing and pushing a bill to implement the change shortly after President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the name to be changed.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to a representative for Greene via email for comment.\n\nThe renaming of the Gulf of Mexico was one of the first decisions that Trump has made upon entering the White House. It symbolizes his \"America First\" approach to foreign policy.\n\nIn his executive order, one of several signed on his first day in office on Monday, Trump said the name change was in recognition of the Gulf's \"critical importance to our nation's economy and its people.\"\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter , Greene, a staunch Trump ally, wrote on Thursday: \"... Congress must pass my bill renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America . This funds the actual renaming on all mapping in our government. We have to force this to happen and we should! We rename post offices all the time this isn't complicated.\"\n\nThe large body of water that borders Mexico, the United States and Cuba has been called the Gulf of Mexico for more than 400 years before the U.S. existed as a country.\n\nAt a press conference held at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida earlier this month, Trump told reporters that his administration would change the body of water's name to the \"Gulf of America,\" which he said, \"has a beautiful ring\" to it \"because we do most of the work there and it's ours.\"\n\n\"That covers a lot of territory,\" Trump said, adding that \"The Gulf of America, what a beautiful name, and it's appropriate.\"\n\nGreene's support for the measure come shortly after she clashed with a reporter who asked her about Trump's recent pardons for the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol rioters .\n\n\"I'm not doing this,\" the congresswoman told a reporter from Punchbowl News when asked about the pardons. \"All of y'all's obsession with January 6 is absurd.\"\n\nThe renaming initiative has sparked discussions about its feasibility and international implications as there is no clear international law that mandates the naming of bodies of water.\n\nMexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum responded to the proposal by stating that Mexico and the rest of the world would continue to refer to it as the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSo has the United Kingdom, which according to The Telegraph , has said it will continue to call the body of water by its current name until the new title gains widespread usage.\n\nNationally, the order does not extend to state governments or private companies, meaning there's no nationwide mandate to switch to the new terminology.\n\nHowever, Trump's executive order has directed federal agencies to use the new name. Private sector maps have not yet adopted the change, with the body of water continuing to be labeled the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nFlorida, meanwhile, has become the first state to officially refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the \"Gulf of America,\" following Trump's executive order. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis used the term in an emergency declaration issued on Monday ahead of a forecast winter storm.\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene previously applauded Trump's move, writing on X, formerly Twitter, on January 7: \"President Trump's second term is off to a GREAT start. I'll be introducing legislation ASAP to officially change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to its rightful name, the Gulf of America!\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Executive Order 14170 states: \"It is in the national interest to promote the extraordinary heritage of our Nation and ensure future generations of American citizens celebrate the legacy of our American heroes. The naming of our national treasures, including breathtaking natural wonders and historic works of art, should honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans in our Nation's rich past.\"\n\nFederal agencies have been given one month to begin updating documents and maps with the new name. Additionally, following Florida's footsteps, other state governments may continue to adopt the change.\n\nThis article includes reporting from The Associated Press.\n\nDo you have a story Newsweek should be covering?

Kemp broke with President Donald Trump and his allies, including Greene , by insisting that Georgia's elections were secure and refuted claims that election fraud led to Trump's election loss in the 2020 race.\n\nIf Greene becomes governor of Georgia, which has become a crucial battleground state in recent years, it could signal another win for Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republicans will be hoping to re-take the seat occupied by Ossoff , after losing it in 2021cost them their majority.\n\nWhen Greene was asked whether she plans to challenge Ossoff for his seat in the Senate , she said: \"Of course I'm considering all possibilities. No decisions have been made, but I would be telling a lie if I didn't say I wasn't considering it.\"\n\nShe then added that she wouldn't rule out a run for governor. Newsweek contacted Kemp via email for a response.\n\nHowever, Greene did go on to praise Kemp, saying he would be a \"very solid candidate\" to go up against Ossoff.\n\nLast month, a WPA Intelligence/Club for Growth poll showed Kemp with an early 6-point lead over Ossoff in a hypothetical matchup. Kemp has not said whether he plans to run in the Senate race and has been floated as a possible 2028 presidential candidate.\n\nTrump told Greene during a 2023 rally in Texas that if she wanted to run for Senate: \"I would fight like hell for you.\"\n\nSenator Jon Ossoff said during an appearance MSNBC: \"You know, Congresswoman Greene represents [an] extremely divisive, zealous, partisan MAGA brand of politics that I think would be an electoral problem for her in Georgia. But, with the former president's support in a primary, she may very well be the general election candidate.\"\n\nHe added, \"Marjorie Taylor Greene in the U.S. Senate would be a disaster for the country.\"\n\nGreene has not officially announced any race yet, so it remains to be seen whether she will be running for either office. Georgia's Republican Attorney General Chris Carr is the only one who has officially announced he will be running for Kemp's role.\n\nThe Georgia 2026 Senate election is set to be held on November 3, 2026.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRepublican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has endorsed Mike Johnson ahead of the crucial vote for the House Speaker's gavel, providing a significant boost to his chances of political survival.\n\nNewsweek has contacted Johnson's office for comment via email outside of normal office hours.\n\nThe looming speaker vote on January 3 is set against a backdrop of GOP infighting that threatens to overshadow President-elect Donald Trump 's return to the presidency.\n\nHowever, an endorsement from a key far-right MAGA Republican may quell Johnson's fears that he won't survive the critical vote.\n\nThe key backing could signal a turning point, offering a much-needed boost to Johnson's allies as they look to return to the Speaker's office.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson enjoys the support of most House Republicans , but a few dissenters pose a threat to his effort to retain his position, given the GOP's narrow majority in the chamber.\n\nThe Louisiana Republican faces a challenging numbers game to remain speaker. When the new Congress convenes on Friday, Republicans are expected to control 219 seats in the House, with one vacancy in the seat previously held by former Representative Matt Gaetz . Gaetz, a Florida Republican, was re-elected but resigned after being nominated as Trump's attorney general.\n\nTo win the speaker race, Johnson must secure a majority of the members present. This would require 218 votes if all members are in attendance.\n\nHowever, GOP Representative Thomas Massie has already announced he will vote \"no,\" meaning Johnson must gain the backing of every other Republican unless Democrats cross party lines to support him.\n\nThe House cannot carry out official business until a new speaker is elected. If Johnson fails to secure the 218 votes needed for a simple majority on Friday to remain speaker, the chamber could be stuck in limbo until the matter is resolved.\n\nThis includes the potential delay in certifying President-elect Donald Trump's 2024 election victory on January 6.\n\nMeanwhile, Greene previously led efforts to remove Johnson from the post in 2024. Georgia representative Greene introduced an unprivileged motion to vacate against Johnson in March, after he passed a $1.2 trillion spending package with Democratic support to fund the government.\n\nJohnson has found himself increasingly at odds with some conservatives who have opposed his actions.\n\nGeorgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene said in a post on X, formerly Twitter: \" You've seen me fight against him at times. But you want to know something else? Here's what I recognize. For the past four years, all of you, and myself included, have put blood, sweat, and tears into electing President Trump.\n\n\"Let's put aside our pride. Let's put aside our egos. And let's put aside the infighting. It's time to come together as Republicans, and it's time to do whatever it takes to make sure that we deliver the mandate that the American people told us to do. That's why I'm excited tomorrow. I cannot wait to get started. I'll be voting for Mike Johnson. I will be looking ahead in complete hopefulness and working as hard as possible.\"\n\nTrump, who threw Johnson a lifeline, said in a post on Truth Social : \"The American people need IMMEDIATE relief from all of the destructive policies of the last Administration,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social media platform.\n\n\"Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hard working, religious man. He will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN. Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement. MAGA!!!\"\n\nThomas Massie on X (formerly Twitter): \"I respect and support President Trump, but his endorsement of Mike Johnson is going to work out about as well as his endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan. We've seen Johnson partner with the democrats to send money to Ukraine, authorize spying on Americans, and blow the budget.\n\nRep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said Tuesday on Fox Business: \"I remain undecided, as do a number of my colleagues, because we saw so many of the failures last year that we are concerned about that might limit or inhibit our ability to advance the president's agenda.\"\n\nMaryland Representative Andy Harris told Newsmax: \"The speaker has four days to convince people that what happened over the past year, and especially what happened two weeks ago, is not going to happen next year.\"\n\nSouth Dakota Representative Dusty Johnson told CNN: \"Mike Johnson was in a good spot before President Trump's endorsement. Clearly, he's in an even better spot now.\"\n\nThe House speaker election, where Johnson will aim to maintain his position, is scheduled for January 3, the first day of the 119th Congress.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Johnson will survive his latest political test.\n\nMeanwhile, the House and Senate are set to vote on the Electoral College certification on Monday, with Trump's inauguration planned for January 20.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nBillal Rahman is an immigration reporter based in London, U.K. He specializes in immigration policy and border security.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Introduces Measure To Oust Mike Johnson as House Speaker\n\nCongress\n\nJoe Lancaster | 3.22.2024 3:25 PM\n\nAndy Warhol once said, \"In the future, everyone will be House speaker for 15 minutes.\"\n\nWell, he didn't say that exactly . But a similar sentiment is at play in Washington, D.C.\n\nOn Friday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) introduced a motion to vacate that would remove Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) as House speaker. Johnson was memorably elected to the position in October after hard-line Republicans ousted Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) from the role-the first time the chamber had voted to remove a speaker in its history.\n\nNow, Greene is threatening to do the same to Johnson, and for very similar reasons.\n\nGreene's move came as the House voted to pass a $1.2 trillion omnibus spending bill that has proved divisive among Republicans. \"In a 286-134 vote that came down to the wire,... Democrats rallied to provide the support to overcome a furious swell of opposition by conservative Republicans,\" reported Catie Edmondson at The New York Times .\n\nOn the House floor, Greene expressed her \"extreme opposition\" to the bill and declared, \"No Republican in the House of Representatives, in good conscience, can vote for this bill. It is a complete departure [from] all of our principles.\"\n\nAfter the vote, Greene told reporters the motion was \"more of a warning\" and that \"there's not a time limit on this.\" She added that \"it's time for us to go through the process, take our time and find a new speaker of the House that will stand with Republicans and our Republican majority instead of standing with the Democrats.\"\n\nBut with the possibility that House Republicans may oust their second speaker in five months, it's worth wondering how long it will take until they find a candidate who will pass muster-or if one exists.\n\nAfter all, the case against Johnson is strikingly similar to the line of attack that took down McCarthy and gained Johnson the speakership in the first place. In removing McCarthy from power, some House Republicans called for a return to a more traditional way for the chamber to function, in which individual spending bills are brought to the floor, debated, and voted on-in contrast to the never-ending parade of omnibus bills slapped together at the last minute as a stopgap measure to fund the government for a few months at a time.\n\nA return to tradition and order was exactly what Johnson promised in a letter to colleagues days before he was elected speaker-but within weeks, he was relying on the same sort of parliamentary tricks as his predecessor, passing stopgap appropriations bills that would maintain the same levels of government spending without allowing for any debate over potential cuts.\n\nTo be clear, the holdouts' stated demands were not unreasonable: While many called those who ousted McCarthy \"wack jobs,\" \"the wack jobs have a point: The federal budget process is broken, and it's been broken for decades,\" as Reason 's Peter Suderman wrote in The New York Times . A return to normalcy would be a welcome change of pace, but Johnson was ultimately unable to deliver on his promise.\n\nIf Johnson is indeed removed, then it's worth wondering who else will try to step up to the plate. Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who served as interim speaker after McCarthy's ouster, is leaving Congress at the end of the current term. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), a logical candidate, withdrew from consideration last time after failing to win over the party's disparate factions.\n\nPerhaps, to paraphrase Warhol's famous prognostication (which was, itself, likely apocryphal ), every Republican will eventually get the chance to be speaker-until they, too, give in to politics as usual, run afoul of the rest of the caucus, and are removed from the position, allowing the next congressman to give it a try.\n\nA member of Greene's communications staff did not immediately respond to Reason 's request for comment.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene Not Disqualified from Federal Office\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nFree Speech\n\nEugene Volokh | 5.7.2022 3:17 PM\n\nYou can read the full opinion in Rowan v. Greene (Ga. Ofc. State Admin. Hearings); here's an excerpt:\n\nChallengers allege that Rep. Greene \"does not meet the federal constitutional requirements for a Member of the U.S. House of Representative1s and is therefore ineligible to be a candidate for such office.\" They assert that Rep. Greene \"voluntarily aided and engaged in an insurrection to obstruct the peaceful transfer of presidential power, disqualifying her from serving as a Member of Congress under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment ....\" ... This section of the 14th Amendment provides:\n\nNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability....\n\nTo prove that the Disqualification Clause bars Rep. Greene's candidacy, Challengers must show that:\n\nThe parties have stipulated that the first time Rep. Greene took an oath to defend the Constitution was January 3, 2021, when she was sworn in as a member of Congress. Therefore, only conduct by Rep. Greene occurring after taking that oath on January 3, 2021, is relevant in determining whether the Disqualification Clause applies. Similarly, statements made by Rep. Greene and actions taken by her prior to her taking of the oath on January 3, 2021, are only relevant, and can only be considered, to the extent they explain her conduct occurring after the taking of the oath....\n\nThere appear to be two judicial opinions that have considered the meaning of the word \"engage\" as used in the Disqualification Clause. See United States v. Powell , 65 N.C. 709 (1871) (defining \"engage\" as \"a voluntary effort to assist the Insurrection ... and to bring it to a successful [from insurrectionists' perspective] termination\"); Worthy v. Barrett , 63 N.C. 199, 203 (1869) (defining \"engage\" as \"[v]oluntarily aiding the rebellion by personal service or by contributions, other than charitable, of anything that was useful or necessary\").\n\nIt appears that it is not necessary that an individual personally commit an act of violence to have \"engaged\" in insurrection. See Powell , 65 N.C. at 709 (defendant paid to avoid serving in Confederate Army); Worthy , 63 N.C. at 203 (defendant simply served as county sheriff). Nor does \"engagement\" require previous conviction of a criminal offense. See, e.g. , Powell , 65 N.C. at 709 (defendant not charged with any prior crime); Worthy , 63 N.C. at 203 (defendant not charged with any crime); In re Tate , 63 N.C. 308 (1869) (defendant not charged with any crime); Gerard N. Magliocca, Amnesty and Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment , 36 CONST. COMMENT. 87, 98-99 (2021) (in special congressional action in 1868 to enforce Section Three and remove Georgia legislators, none of the legislators had been charged criminally).\n\nRep. Greene points to the use of word \"engage\" in a similarly-worded 1867 statute with more severe consequences (disenfranchisement) than the Disqualification Clause. The then Attorney General construed that statute to require \"some direct overt act, done with the intent to further the rebellion.\" The authority does not indicate that a prior criminal conviction is necessary to trigger the Disqualification Clause.\n\nOn balance, therefore, it appears that \"engage\" includes overt actions and, in certain limited contexts, words used in furtherance of the insurrections and associated actions. \"Merely disloyal sentiments or expressions\" do not appear be sufficient. But marching orders or instructions to capture a particular objective, or to disrupt or obstruct a particular government proceeding, would appear to constitute \"engagement\" under the Worthy - Powell standard. To the extent (if any) that an \"overt act\" may be needed, see id. , it would appear that in certain circumstances words can constitute an \"overt act,\" just as words may constitute an \"overt act\" under the Treason Clause, e.g., Chandler v. United States , 171 F.2d 921, 938 (1st Cir. 1948) (enumerating examples, such as conveying military intelligence to the enemy), or for purposes of conspiracy law, e.g. , United States v. Donner , 497 F.2d 184, 192 (7th Cir. 1974) (even \"constitutionally protected speech may nevertheless be an overt act in a conspiracy charge\").\n\nChallengers argue that Rep. Greene's speeches, texts, tweets, and appearances evidence a long-term plan to foment an insurrection on January 6 in order to prevent Congress from completing its Constitutional duties in certifying the election of President Biden. Under Challengers' view of the evidence, Rep. Greene was planning and furthering insurrection long  before she took office. This plan, they contend, began as soon as it was clear that President Trump would lose the 2020 election. Under Challengers' view of the evidence, the January 6 Invasion was \"Plan B,\" to be triggered when efforts to object to the Electoral College votes and to persuade Vice President Pence to refuse the certification of President Biden failed.\n\nThe difficulty with Challengers' theory is the lack of evidence. Whatever the exact parameters of the meaning of \"engage\" as used in the 14th Amendment, and assuming for these purposes that the Invasion was an insurrection, Challengers have produced insufficient evidence to show that Rep. Greene \"engaged\" in that insurrection after she took the oath of office on January 3, 2021. In short, even assuming, arguendo, that the Invasion was an insurrection, Challengers presented no persuasive evidence Rep. Greene took any action-direct physical efforts, contribution of personal services or capital, issuance of directives or marching orders, transmissions of intelligence, or even statements of encouragement-in furtherance thereof on or after January 3, 2021.\n\nThere is no evidence to show that Rep. Greene participated in the Invasion itself. To the contrary, the evidence shows that she was inside the Capitol building at the time, and unaware of the Invasion until proceedings were suspended at approximately 2:29 p.m. on January 6, 2021.\n\nFurther, there is no evidence showing that after January 3, 2021, Rep. Greene communicated with or issued directives to persons who engaged in the Invasion. Challengers point to Rep. Greene's apparent prior contact with certain persons, such as Anthony Aguero. They point to postings from various persons, such as Ali Alexander. But the evidence does not show that Rep. Greene was in contact with, directed, or assisted these individuals, or indeed anyone, in the planning or execution of the Invasion. Rep. Greene denies any such contact or involvement and that denial stands unchallenged by other testimony or documentary evidence.\n\nChallengers make a valiant effort to support inferences that Rep. Greene was an insurrectionist, but the evidence is lacking, and the Court is not persuaded. The evidence shows that prior to January 3, 2021, Rep. Greene engaged in months of heated political rhetoric clothed with strong 1st Amendment protections. NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. (1982); see also Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969). The evidence does not show Rep. Greene engaged in months of planning and plotting to bring about the Invasion and defeat the orderly transfer of power provided for in our Constitution. Her public statements and heated rhetoric may well have contributed to the environment that ultimately led to the Invasion. But expressing constitutionally-protected political views, no matter how aberrant they may be, prior to being sworn in as a Representative is not engaging in insurrection under the 14th Amendment.\n\nChallengers point to Rep. Greene's statement during the Newsmax Interview on January 5, 2021, as a literal call to arms to storm the Capitol. {In this interview ..., Rep. Greene discussed her plans to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election by supporting challenges to the certification of Electoral College votes. When asked, \"What is your plan tomorrow? What are you prepared for?\" Rep. Greene answered, \"Well, you know, I'll echo the words of many of my colleagues as we were just meeting together in our GOP conference meeting this morning. This is our 1776 moment.\"}\n\nThe Court finds this to be the only conduct that could even possibly be interpreted as triggering the Disqualification Clause. If this statement was in fact a coded message from Rep. Greene to her co-conspirators to go forward with a previously planned incursion into the Capitol, it might constitute an overt act and one that occurred after she took her oath as Representative.\n\nBased on the evidence, the Court is unpersuaded that Rep. Greene's ambiguous statement that \"[t]his is our 1776 moment\" was a coded call to violent insurrection on January 6, 2021. Heated political rhetoric? Yes. Encouragement to supporters of efforts to prevent certification of the election of President Biden? Yes. Encouragement to attend the Save America Rally or other rallies and to demonstrate against the certification of the election results? Yes. A call to arms for consummation of a pre-planned violent revolution? No. It is impossible for the Court to conclude from this vague, ambiguous statement that Rep. Greene was complicit in a months-long enterprise to obstruct the peaceful transfer of presidential power without making an enormous unsubstantiated leap....\n\nThe parties and the Court agree that the actions of the participants in the Invasion were despicable. The parties strongly disagree, however, as to whether the Invasion constituted an \"insurrection\" within the meaning of the 14th Amendment. They proffer competing definitions of the meaning of the term \"insurrection\" as used in the 14th Amendment and whether the events of the Invasion meet those definitions.\n\nThe events that occurred on January 6, 2021, are truly tragic. Multiple lives were lost, including those of law enforcement officers who died defending the Capitol. Many sustained injuries, some of them permanent and life-changing. The citadel of democracy, the U.S. Capitol, was violently breached in the most serious incursion in 200 years. Members of Congress, including Rep. Greene, were forced to take shelter for several hours to avoid the wrath of the invaders. Congress was unable to perform its obligations under the 12th Amendment to the Constitution. It is among the saddest and most tragic days in the history of our American Republic. The well documented images of the events of the day are painful in the extreme.\n\nWhether the Invasion of January 6 amounted to an insurrection is an issue of tremendous importance to all Americans and one that may yet be addressed. However, it is not a question for this Court to answer at this time. Because the Court finds Rep. Greene did not \"engage\" in the Invasion, either as a direct participant or in its planning and execution, after taking her oath on January 3, 2021, it is not necessary to address the question of whether the events of January 6 constituted an \"insurrection\" within the meaning of the 14th Amendment.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "'School Shootings Are Absolutely Real,' and '9/11 Absolutely Happened,' Says Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nConspiracy Theories\n\nJacob Sullum | 2.4.2021 5:50 PM\n\n\"School shootings are absolutely real,\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) declared on the floor of the House today as her colleagues debated whether to take away her committee assignments as punishment for her endorsement of wacky right-wing conspiracy theories . \"I also want to tell you 9/11 absolutely happened....It's a tragedy for anyone to say it didn't happen. I definitely want to tell you I do not believe that it's fake.\"\n\nWhen a member of Congress feels a need to say things like that, it is clear that something has gone terribly wrong with her critical thinking skills at some point. By Greene's account, it started with her enthusiasm for Donald Trump and her anger at a biased press that falsely and maliciously portrayed him as a Russian stooge. Hungry for alternative sources of information, she \"started looking things up on the internet, asking questions, like most people do every day.\"\n\nIn 2017, Greene \"stumbled across something...called QAnon,\" which posited that Trump was battling a secret cabal of Satan worshippers who eat human flesh and run an international operation that sells children for sex. But Greene said she was mostly interested in QAnon's rebuttals of the \"Russian collusion\" charges against Trump, which is what drew her in. \"I got very interested in it,\" she said, \"so I posted about it on Facebook, I read about it, I talked about it, I asked questions about it, and then more information came from it.\"\n\nDuring 2018, Greene said, \"I was upset about things and didn't trust the government...because the people here were not doing the things I thought they should be doing for us.\" She added that \"a lot of Americans don't trust our government, and that's sad.\" The problem with such distrust, she said, \"is I was allowed to believe things that weren't true, and I would ask questions about them and talk about them. And that is absolutely what I regret, because if it weren't for the Facebook posts and comments that I 'liked' in 2018, I wouldn't be standing here today, and you couldn't point a finger and accuse me of anything wrong, because I've lived a very good life that I'm proud of.\"\n\nLater that year, Greene said, \"I started finding misinformation, lies, things that were not true, in these QAnon posts.\" At that point, \"I stopped believing it\" and \"walked away from those things.\" [Update: The New York Times notes that Greene was still peddling QAnon ideas in 2019, when she suggested that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had been replaced by a body double, \"an element of QAnon's fictional story line.\"]\n\nGreene warned that \"any source of information that is a mix of truth and a mix of lies is dangerous,\" which is a problem \"on the left and on the right.\" She averred that the mainstream news media are \"just as guilty as QAnon of presenting truth and lies to divide us.\"\n\nAs mea culpas go, this one was decidedly mixed. \"None of us are perfect,\" Greene noted while acknowledging \"words that I said and I regret.\" But she said the reason she regrets her flirtation with QAnon is that it provided ammunition to her political opponents. Shouldn't endorsing crazy, defamatory lies against Democrats such as Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and George Soros be cause for regret regardless of whether it causes bad publicity for you?\n\nGreene is certainly right that many news outlets are hostile to Trump and promoted allegations about him and Russia that proved to be unfounded . But that hardly means The New York Times- which, after all, eventually reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller could not substantiate those charges-is as impervious to evidence as QAnon true believers.\n\nGreene also deflected attention from her alarming credulity by complaining about \"cancel culture,\" repeatedly condemning abortion, and accusing her Democratic colleagues of \"condon[ing] riots,\" referring to the vandalism and violence that marred many of last year's protests against police brutality. Their support of those protests, she suggested, makes her conspiracy mongering pale by comparison.\n\nThat is probably not a road Greene wants to head down, since she eagerly promoted Trump's fantasy that the presidential election was stolen through massive cheating on an unprecedented scale-the imaginary grievance that motivated last month's deadly assault on the building where Greene works. She did not say whether she still thinks Trump actually won the election by a landslide, a belief that is about as plausible as the elaborate plot described by QAnon.\n\nGreene also did not retract her charge that the Clintons killed John F. Kennedy Jr., that Obama is a secret Muslim who commissioned the murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Green, that Soros is \"a piece of crap\" who betrayed \"his own people\" to the Nazis, that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is a traitor who deserves the death penalty, or that the Rothschilds conspired with California Gov. Jerry Brown to ignite a wildfire with space lasers. Nor did she apologize for sharing a video alleging that \"Zionist supremacists\" are committing \"the biggest genocide in human history\" by flooding Europe with nonwhite immigrants. All we know for sure is that she now believes 9/11 actually happened and that children were actually murdered in Newtown and Parkland.\n\nGreene emphasized that she did not peddle QAnon fabrications during her campaign or after she was elected in November. \"These were words of the past,\" she said. \"These things do not represent me, they do not represent my district, and they do not represent my values.\" That is all well and good, but her district will have to decide whether it wants to be represented by someone this gullible and this oblivious to the implications of casually charging people with grave crimes based on nothing more than \"information\" some idiot posted online.\n\n\"Past comments from and endorsed by Marjorie Taylor Greene on school shootings, political violence, and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories do not represent the values or beliefs of the House Republican Conference,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in a statement he issued yesterday. \"I condemn those comments unequivocally. I condemned them in the past. I continue to condemn them today. This House condemned QAnon last Congress and continues to do so today.\"\n\nMcCarthy nevertheless rejected the suggestion that he should remove Greene from the committees to which she had been assigned, a demurral that set the stage for today's vote. He faulted Democrats for \"choosing to raise the temperature by taking the unprecedented step to further their partisan power grab regarding the committee assignments of the other party.\" McCarthy has a point about the risk of that precedent, which Democrats surely would not want to see evenhandedly applied to members of their own party who make controversial comments tinged by bigotry.\n\nStill, it is important for Republican leaders like McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to repudiate the poisonous views that Greene expressed before she was elected, if only to demarcate the limits of what is acceptable in polite GOP company. That criticism forced Greene, who until recently was dismissing concerns about her outlandish, inflammatory, and divisive statements as much ado about nothing, to offer an accounting of herself, however unsatisfying.\n\nGreene blames her susceptibility to conspiracy theories on her suspicion of government, which is an insult to every rational person who shares that suspicion without falling for baseless, wildly implausible claims like the ones she endorsed. Unlike Greene, I do not think distrust of government is \"sad,\" and I doubt the Framers, who carefully constructed a system designed to obstruct and frustrate politicians who seek to impose their will on the nation, would have shared her (current) view of that impulse.\n\nBut skepticism of government is rooted in a recognition of human foibles and limitations, which do not disappear in the private sector. Politicians sometimes tell the truth, gadflies sometimes tell lies, and both offer up mixtures of the two. As Greene's experience shows, telling the difference cannot hinge on the identity of the speaker or the political tribe to which he belongs.\n\nUpdate: The House on Thursday voted to remove Greene from the education and budget committees. The vote was 230 to 199, with 11 Republicans joining Democrats in approving the punishment.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "On the Pride Parade Route With the Libertarian Hoping To Challenge Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nPolitics\n\nEric Boehm | 6.28.2022 2:30 PM\n\n\"I'm at city hall,\" Angela Pence says via text message. \"By a guy with a 'Don't Tread on Me' flag.\"\n\nEven amid the vibrant scene along Broad Street in Rome, Georgia, on Saturday morning, the modified Gadsden flag-a rainbow-colored one, but with the familiar coiled rattlesnake and slogan-stands out. Before crossing the street to meet Pence, however, I have to make way for a drag queen riding in the bed of a bright red pickup truck and fist-pumping along to a blaring Lady Gaga song. It's a message of defiance as subtle as the rainbow-colored Gadsden flag-particularly here, at the first-ever Pride parade in Rome, a city of about 37,000 nestled in the state's deeply conservative northwest corner.\n\nPence is a part of that spirit of defiance even as she is hoping to capitalize upon it. A political novice, Pence is running for U.S. Congress as a Libertarian against incumbent Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the controversial first-term congresswoman who in many ways embodies the GOP's post-2016 fixation with culture war politics and conspiracy theories.\n\nEarlier this month, Greene warned that straight people could go extinct \"probably within about four or five generations.\" In another tweet , Greene claimed that \"a n entire #PrideMonth and millions in spending through corporations & our government on LGBTQ sexual identity needs to end.\" Against that backdrop, simply showing up to an event like this sends a message.\n\nBefore Pence can even start a real campaign, however, she has to gather more than 23,000 signatures from registered voters in Georgia's 14th congressional district by July 12 in order to satisfy the state's difficult ballot access rules. She came to Rome on Saturday hoping to gather some of that total. It's tedious work, one that requires volunteers to carry clipboards and the willingness to explain-over and over again-how the state's ballot access laws work to people who may not care.\n\n\"I think the people here deserve to have another choice,\" she tells me as we walk with a few hundred other parade-goers, heading for a small park along the Coosa River where the rest of the day's festivities are planned. Once there, she circulates among the attendees and vendors, working with a handful of volunteers and friends who have come along to help collect signatures.\n\nOften, all she has to do is mention that she's running against Greene to get attention, though Saturday's parade is not a true cross-section of a district that President Donald Trump won by more than 50 points last year despite narrowly losing the state as a whole. (When Trump wanted to hold a post-election rally in Georgia to pressure the state's officials into reversing the outcome, the event was held at an airstrip not far from Rome .)\n\n\"Realistically, Democrats don't have a chance here,\" Pence repeatedly tells people. A Libertarian might not either, but arguably might have a better shot of carrying the district's few blue spots (like Rome, where Trump lost every precinct in 2020) while also engaging Republicans who are fed up with Greene or open to a true small-government message.\n\nIf the state will let her on the ballot, that is. In all likelihood, Pence's effort will fail, and a ballot access law will once again deserve credit for protecting an incumbent.\n\nThere's not much love for the incumbent on display Saturday. \"I came to this just because it is in Marjorie Taylor Greene's district,\" says Melanie Kelly, who lives in Atlanta. Her wife, Krista, is open-carrying a pink and white AR-15 at the parade-the most ostentatious, but not the only, celebration of the Second Amendment at Rome's Pride event.\n\nThe Pride parade and the visitors it attracts to Rome illustrate the changing cultural tides in northwest Georgia-even in a place that's undoubtedly Trump country. \"This could never have happened here\" 10 or 15 years ago is a common refrain when I ask people to share their thoughts on the city's first Pride parade. It's easy to see how some conservatives, like those holding protest signs along the parade route, could interpret this as a triumphant march of progressive ideology that until recently was contained to more urban areas and specific subcultures. The mainstreaming of LGBT culture means a higher level of acceptance of individual autonomy and human freedom, but it's also generated a political reaction that increasingly defines the conservative movement-and one that encourages the wielding of government power to limit the self-expression and free choices of others.\n\nIt's been three years since commentator Sohrab Ahmari, then an editor at the New York Post , set off a conservative schism by calling out conservatives like The Dispatch's David French for being insufficiently militant towards drag events that include children. In that time, \"drag queen story hour\" has become a source of viral rage for a segment of the political right. Greene recently escalated the rage into a threat of using actual government force by announcing her intention to introduce a bill banning drag events that include children.\n\n\"This needs to be illegal,\" she said earlier this month. \"What's the difference in children stuffing cash in a drag queen bra and a stripper's bra? Nothing. It's wrong and it's indoctrination.\"\n\nRome's Pride festival included a drag queen story hour.\n\n\"I don't see what the harm is in drag queens reading stories to kids. Politicians do it all the time,\" Pence says with a shrug, though she also draws a line between events where reading is the main activity and taking kids to outright drag shows where provocative dancing might be the focus. \"I think that if parents want to take their kids to a drag queen story hour, that's their choice to make,\" she says.\n\nIt's the kind of sentiment that probably needs a more prominent place in our civic discourse-one fundamentally at odds with the notion that members of Congress should get to decide how anyone raises their kids. Later, when Pence crosses paths with India Mills, the head of a local drag troupe and the queen who'd led the parade down Broad Street from the back of a pickup truck, the two share a quick laugh about the heat ruining their makeup.\n\nThe fact that Rome's parade attracts crowds from outside the area actually complicates Pence's effort to get on the ballot here. Only signatures from registered voters who reside in the district count toward the tally she needs, which means her volunteers have to collect addresses as well and check them against the state's voter rolls. With redistricting having been completed in Georgia only a few months ago, she says, lots of people aren't even sure which district they reside in now.\n\nBut Pence is determined to work it. The monthslong effort to get enough signatures to become the first third-party candidate to qualify for a congressional race in Georgia since the 1950s requires the kind of grit that she might have learned from an earlier career as a professional dancer-\"Fighters Keep Fighting\" reads the tattoo on her right arm, the letters intertwined with a pair of pointe shoes-or perhaps from being a mother of eight children, all of which Pence homeschools. (A ninth is on the way, due in January.)\n\nEven if the effort ends in failure, it's worth it for the party to pursue races in what would otherwise be single-party districts with high-profile incumbents, argues Chase Oliver, the man carrying the rainbow-colored Gadsden flag and marching alongside Pence. He's the Libertarian Party's (L.P.) candidate for U.S. Senate in Georgia-and he's already on the ballot since the L.P. has done well enough in recent elections to secure automatic ballot access for statewide candidates. Bizarrely, it's more difficult to get on the ballot for a state legislative or congressional race than for a gubernatorial or senatorial race in Georgia.\n\n\"I call them 'the sexy races,'\" Oliver says. \"Having people run for those offices raises awareness about the party and helps us recruit and compete in lower-level races too.\"\n\nAmong some longtime L.P. types, there is concern that the party's new leadership will shy away from backing candidates like Pence who are challenging conservatives. Oliver specifically expresses frustration over some of the maneuvers at the recent Libertarian national convention, where the party's delegates voted to remove a longstanding plank in the L.P.'s platform condemning bigotry as \"irrational and repugnant.\" But circulating within traditionally left-wing spaces, like Pride events, and pushing for a society that's more accepting of self-expression and individuality has always been foundational for libertarians, he argues.\n\n\"I'm trying to remain myself in this whole sea of people who constantly want me to be something else,\" Pence tells the owner of the Frisky Biscuit, a Rome-based sex shop, who is enthusiastic about signing a ballot petition for someone to be challenging Greene.\n\nShe could be talking about her place in the broader spectrum of Libertarian politics or her status as the ultimate outsider in a congressional district where the outcome of November's election is practically assured by a combination of ballot access laws and partisan redistricting.\n\nThe local entrepreneur signs as Pence wraps up her pitch: \"We're here to fuck up the system.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "How Georgia's Outlandish Ballot Access Law Is Protecting Marjorie Taylor Greene (and the Two-Party System)\n\nPolitics\n\nEric Boehm | 7.13.2022 1:45 PM\n\n\"You're running against MTG? I would be so happy to sign this!\"\n\nSometimes, all Angela Pence has to do to get some attention is mention the name of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), the first-term congresswoman and conservative firebrand who's made a name for herself by trafficking in conspiracy theories. This is Greene's district, but it's not her crowd.\n\nWe're at a Pride event in the small city of Rome, Georgia, the largest population center in the state's sparse northwest corner, and Pence is trying to collect some of the roughly 23,000 signatures that she'll need to qualify for the ballot. So, technically, she's not running against Greene just yet, but she's trying to.\n\nThe exuberant petition-signer is Janet Gabler-Bearoff, a Pennsylvania transplant who now owns The Frisky Biscuit, a sex shop and personal wellness center in Rome. She's incensed about the recent Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade , announced just the day before the Pride event, and Pence shares the frustration. \"We're going in reverse,\" the prospective candidate says, nodding along as Gabler-Bearoff fills out the form that might help get Pence on the Georgia ballot in November. \"Prohibition isn't going to fix anything; it never has.\"\n\nPence says she's \"an anarchist at heart.\" America needs more immigration and a government that's less eager to control individuals' decisions, she says, whether that's a question about who to employ or who to marry. Her politics were activated by the Republican Party's turn towards authoritarianism in recent years-like many Americans, she couldn't bring herself to choose between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016-and she's no longer willing to believe conservatives who use the lingo of limited government while pushing for a more powerful state. She sees that tendency in her own representative in Congress.\n\n\"The people [in northwest Georgia] want a message of individual freedom and they want a smaller government. But if they don't have the choice to pick me, they'll vote for someone who is speaking to the message of liberty but at the end of the day isn't truly for individual freedom,\" Pence says of Greene.\n\nBefore Pence can get a fair shot at challenging Greene, she has to overcome America's toughest ballot access law-with a petition threshold that no independent or third-party candidate has successfully surpassed since the 1960s. To qualify, she has to collect more than 23,000 signatures from residents of her congressional district.\n\nIt's a law that was originally passed to keep out candidates believed to be advocating for overthrowing the American government. Ironically, that law is now protecting Greene, one of Congress' loudest cheerleaders for former President Donald Trump's attempt at subverting the results of the 2020 election.\n\nSo far, courts have upheld the high barrier to entry in Georgia's congressional races on the grounds that it keeps out unserious candidates and avoids confusing votes. A case challenging the threshold could be headed to the Supreme Court later this year, but not soon enough to help Pence.\n\nBut if Pence isn't a serious candidate, it might be fair to wonder how to categorize Greene, who has claimed 9/11 was a hoax , that John F. Kennedy Jr. was murdered by Hillary Clinton , and that COVID-19 lockdowns are comparable to the Holocaust , among other things . But Greene has one thing Pence doesn't: the nomination of one of the two major parties.\n\nPence's campaign is likely doomed anyway-Georgia's 14 th congressional district is one of the safest Republican seats in the entire country. But it's one thing to lose because voters preferred someone else. It's quite another to lose because the supposedly neutral arbiter, the state government, says you can't even try.\n\nThe deadline for Pence to submit those signatures arrived Tuesday.\n\nBanning the Communist Party\n\nIf Pence could jump back in time exactly 100 years, she'd find a much different set of rules governing who could appear on the ballot in Georgia.\n\nThe state's first ballot access law was passed in 1922, according to political historian Darcy G. Richardson, and it ensured that independent candidates, as well as the nominees of any political party, were entitled to a place on the ballot without having to pay any filing fees or submit petitions.\n\nOf course, Georgia in 1922 was not a beacon of democratic enlightenment for a variety of reasons. Women had only been given the right to vote two years earlier. Black people and other racial minorities were subject to near-total disenfranchisement. A permissive ballot access regime existed, perhaps, because a combination of strict social norms and other official policies effectively kept out anyone who might challenge the political status quo.\n\nAnd when a new political party did challenge that system, it was quickly met with some sharp elbows.\n\nIn 1940, when the Communist Party of the United States sought to place its candidates for office on Georgia's ballot, Secretary of State John B. Wilson intervened. He unilaterally barred Earl Browder, the party's presidential nominee, and all other Communist candidates from the ballot. \"It would be against public policy to place on our ballot the names of candidates of a party which seeks to overthrow our democratic constitutional form of government,\" Wilson said, according to an Associated Press report from August of that year.\n\nThe outcome of the 1940 presidential election in Georgia was never in any serious doubt. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the state's 12 electoral votes by getting more than 84 percent of the popular vote-a tally that was actually slightly worse than the percentages he'd received in 1932 and 1936. Nationally, Roosevelt easily defeated Wendell Willkie to win an unprecedented third term.\n\nWhat happened in Georgia in 1940 was not an isolated incident. Several other states similarly barred Browder and other Communist candidates from seeking office. That followed close on the heels of federal action like the 1939 passage of the Hatch Act, which forbade the hiring of public employees who advocated for overthrowing the government, and the establishment of the House Un-American Activities Committee, which would play a prominent role in America's \"Red Scare\" era.\n\nAfter the election, Wilson asked the Georgia legislature to pass a law granting his office the authority to determine which candidates and parties could qualify for the ballot. Instead, three years later, the state legislature adopted a new set of ballot access rules.\n\nNow, candidates for any political party that received at least 5 percent of the vote in the last election would be automatically included on the ballot without petitions or filing fees. Anyone else would have to collect signatures from at least 5 percent of the registered voters in the territory for which they were seeking office-for a congressional candidate, that means all the signatures must come from voters in their district.\n\nThe new rules were undoubtedly an improvement over a system where everyone was nominally allowed to participate but the secretary of state held the power to unilaterally bar certain parties. But, for Richardson, the motivation behind the 5 percent signature threshold is clear.\n\n\"One of the purposes, if not the primary purpose, of Georgia's 5-percent petition requirement was to discriminate against the Communist Party,\" Richardson testified to a federal court as part of a 2017 lawsuit attempting to overturn Georgia's ballot access requirements. He pointed to a 1943 Atlanta Constitution article that drew an explicit connection between Wilson's anti-commie crusade and the new law. \"No other justification for the petition requirement is apparent in the historical record,\" he told the court.\n\nIn the decades since it was originally created, the barriers created by the law have only gotten higher. Candidates originally had until 30 days before the general election to collect and submit signatures, for example. The deadline is now mid-July. The signatures must be notarized. Candidates must pay a $5,000 filing fee in March, which is not refunded if they don't get enough signatures to qualify.\n\nThe thresholds are so high that no independent or third-party candidate has appeared on the ballot in a Georgia congressional race since 1964, with one exception in 1982. That year, the rules were temporarily suspended because district lines in the Atlanta area had to be redrawn by court order shortly before the election.\n\nEvery other state in the country has had at least one independent or third-party candidate qualify for the ballot in the past six years, according to Richard Winger, the editor of Ballot Access News who has been tracking developments in this niche political space for decades. In Georgia, you have to go back nearly six decades.\n\n\"There has never been any state that made ballot access totally impossible for such a long period of time for a single office,\" Winger tells Reason. \"It is unlike anything else you'll find in the whole country.\"\n\nThe High Cost of a Third-Party Campaign\n\nPence doesn't campaign like someone whose chances of even qualifying for the ballot are on the low side of slim-to-none.\n\nWhen I caught up with her on June 25 at the Pride parade in Rome , she was gleefully embracing the underdog role. \"We're here to fuck up the system,\" she tells one attendee who was thrilled to sign a petition for a candidate challenging Greene. But there's no hint of a snarl in Pence's manner as she makes her pitch to everyone from a local drag queen in full regalia to a pastor protesting the event.\n\nPence exudes the boundless optimism of someone relatively new to politics-she's never run for office before and didn't think much about politics until the 2016 presidential election. By 2020, she was helping organize and plan events all across the South for Libertarian presidential contender Jo Jorgensen.\n\nOther ventures have been far more successful. Pence is a mother of eight children-\"If I can deal with eight kids, I can deal with Congress,\" she quips-with a ninth due in January, a detail that throws her robust campaigning into a whole new level of impressive. She's also a certified doula who has helped several other women through the birthing process. And she owns an apothecary shop in her hometown of Chickamauga. The tattoo on her right arm-a pair of pointe shoes with the words \"fighters keep fighting\" intertwined in the ribbons-is a reminder of an earlier career as a professional dancer and the grit that career path, like this one, required.\n\nBut this is a fight Pence isn't going to win. The deck is almost comically stacked against her. In addition to the legal hurdles created by Georgia's ballot access law , there's another complication: The state's redistricting process ran longer than usual in Georgia last year. A judge didn't give the official go-ahead for the congressional map drawn by state lawmakers until February 28 . As a result, the signature-gathering period, which ended on July 12, was shorter than usual.\n\nAnd because some of the lines shifted around, some of the people Pence is asking to sign her petition don't know which district they live in (if they ever did).\n\nThat makes the toughest ballot access law in the country an even higher barrier.\n\nEven if a candidate (and volunteers) can get 10 signatures per hour, getting to 23,000 would take more than 2,300 hours of work. \"Then, the elections office is going to tell you roughly half of them are not valid signatures, so you really need 46,000 signatures-which takes 4,600 hours,\" says Ryan Graham, a former chairman of the Libertarian Party of Georgia. \"If you wanted to pay professional petitioners to do it, it would cost roughly $3 per signature and total around $138,000. And that's just to get on the ballot before you even get to focus on campaigning.\"\n\nAt the Pride festival in Rome, I see the struggle of gathering signatures up close. It's a process. One of the volunteers helping Pence is carting around a series of clipboards-different ones for different counties. Pence approaches someone and makes her pitch. The would-be signee has to provide their name, in print and cursive, then an address and phone number. Failing to get any of those details right-or if they can't be verified later by the bureaucrats who will process the signatures after the July 13 deadline-means the effort is wasted.\n\nAfter several humid hours in Rome, Pence has a dozen or so signatures added to her tally. Coming to an event like this is important, in Pence's view, because Democrats aren't going to win in Greene's district-a district Trump won by more than 50 points last year despite narrowly losing the state as a whole. There is one trying: Marcus Flowers, a 46-year-old army veteran has raised millions of dollars and attracted widespread media attention for his quixotic and unorthodox campaign against Greene.\n\nA Libertarian might not have much of a shot, either, but the party can present a different sort of ideological competition. Even, perhaps, a true vision of small government and tolerance for differing views, Pence says.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pence and her cadre of volunteers officially hit the end of the road. They gathered about 5,000 signatures before it was done, but didn't bother submitting the pile of paperwork since it was nowhere near enough to make the cut.\n\nBut it very nearly could have been.\n\nAn Unconstitutional Burden\n\nA year ago, it looked like Georgia's ballot access law was headed to the junkyard.\n\n\"Even reasonably diligent political-body candidates who have expended considerable time and resources have failed to access Georgia's ballot,\" concluded federal Judge Leigh Martin May in a March 2021 order that invalidated the state's 5 percent ballot access threshold for being overly broad and unconstitutional. That ruling was a huge victory for the Georgia Libertarian Party, which had launched the federal lawsuit in 2017. Legal documents detailed no fewer than 27 different third-party congressional campaigns that had tried to qualify for the ballot since 1982. All had failed.\n\nAn even bigger win followed in September . After asking the state to submit alternative ballot-access rules, May ruled that the 5 percent threshold should be lowered to 1 percent-the same threshold that is applied to prospective statewide candidates. Practically, that meant that congressional candidates would have to gather between 4,600 and 6,500 signatures (depending on the number of voters in the district) to qualify for the ballot, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported .\n\n\"This remedy would alleviate the unconstitutional burden imposed upon plaintiffs, while safeguarding the state's interest in preventing ballot crowding and frivolous candidates,\" May wrote in the second ruling.\n\nIf that were the final say in the matter, Pence obviously would have had a clearer path to a place on the ballot this year.\n\nBut the state appealed Cowen v. Raffensperger to the 11th Circuit, which in January reversed May's ruling and left the 5 percent requirement in place. The ballot access requirement, wrote Judge Britt Grant for a three-judge panel that heard the case, aids the state's interest in avoiding \"confusion, deception, and even frustration of the democratic process.\"\n\nTry telling that to anyone who has to navigate it.\n\n\"You can quote me on this: That's complete bullshit,\" Pence says of the court's rationale. How can it be confusing voters when most people don't know the contours of the state's ballot access laws, she wonders. \"It's obvious what it really is; it's a way to keep us off the ballot.\"\n\nThe case could be on its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Plaintiffs have until July 29 to file a certiorari petition with the high court, Ballot Access News reported in May . Angela McArdle, newly elected chair of the Libertarian National Committee, tweeted on Tuesday night that the party is preparing an amicus brief in the case-a good indication that a petition to the Supreme Court is coming.\n\nBallot access laws that treat independent and third-party candidates differently always raise questions about fairness. Why should one party be treated differently than another in the eyes of the state?\n\nBut leave aside the question of fairness for a moment. If Georgia's ballot access scheme is constitutional, as the federal appeals court has said, then it would be equally constitutional to replicate it in every other state. And if that were to happen, then it's possible that no third-party or independent candidates would ever qualify for the ballot again. Isn't that a detail that should be part of any court's analysis of how this law operates?\n\nWinger breaks down the math. If Georgia's ballot access law were replicated across the entire country, a third party that wanted to run a candidate in every statewide race (to say nothing of congressional races) would have to gather more than 10 million signatures . With the laws as they currently stand, that figure is a less extreme (though still outlandishly large) tally of about 541,000.\n\nIf a presidential candidate had to collect more than 10 million signatures to get on the ballot, everyone would rightfully recognize that as an insane and anticompetitive barrier. Well, an equivalent barrier that's been set in front of Angela Pence-and anyone else seeking to run for office in Georgia outside the two-party duopoly.\n\nAnd don't expect relief to come from the regular lawmaking process. \"The state legislature does not seem too interested in making it easier [to qualify for the ballot],\" says Charles Bullock, a professor of politics at the University of Georgia.\n\nBullock explains that the law is more than a bit self-serving, especially in light of Georgia's rules that require candidates to get at least 50 percent of the vote to win an election-if no one does in a general election, there's a runoff between the top two candidates. From the perspective of the Democrats and Republicans in the Georgia state legislature or in Congress, then, allowing more third-party and independent candidates on the ballot would only increase the chances of requiring a run-off. And who wants to deal with that annoyance?\n\nBut a proper democratic system shouldn't prioritize the interests of two political parties at the expense of competing ideas. It shouldn't exist for the purposes of making elections as neat and tidy as possible. The goal is to translate the will of the people into an elected body of representatives-and outlandish barriers to ballot access stand in the way of that goal.\n\nThe people of northwest Georgia might very well choose to keep Greene in Congress no matter who runs against her. In all likelihood, they will. The district is rated R+27 by the Cook Political Report, making it the second-most Republican district in the state (surpassed only by the neighboring 9th district) and among the safest Republican seats in the whole country.\n\nBut Georgia's ballot access laws, ostensibly created in the name of protecting American democracy from those who would subvert it, have accomplished the opposite. They are an incumbency protection scheme meant to limit the field of acceptable candidates. As lawmakers in Washington, D.C., and Atlanta take stock of how election laws need changing to protect the country's foundational principles, laws like this must be part of that conversation.\n\nHaving failed to qualify for the ballot, Pence is mulling a write-in campaign in the fall. After all, there's still a chance that Greene could be tossed off the ballot or otherwise disqualified from office for her role in the January 6 riots, Pence reasons. (Some of Taylor Green's constituents unsuccessfully sought to have the congresswoman barred from running for office over her alleged involvement in the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.)\n\nIf that happens the race comes down to Pence vs. Flowers....hey, stranger things have happened in American political history.\n\nFor now, though, she's satisfied with this first step into politics.\n\n\"I don't see this as a failure. It was always such a long shot,\" she told me on Tuesday . \"I got to talk to hundreds, thousands of people about what a third-party candidate has to do to run for office here. It means something to get that message out.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Libertarian Candidate Faces Uphill Ballot Battle To Challenge Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nBallot Access\n\nJoe Lancaster | 3.10.2022 11:15 AM\n\nAfter finding herself unable to support either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton for president in 2016, Angela Pence ( no relation to the former vice president) started looking outside the confines of either Republican or Democratic politics. That led her to the Libertarian Party (L.P.). In 2020, she started volunteering for Jo Jorgensen's campaign and serving as political director for the Georgia L.P.\n\nFor the 2022 election cycle, Pence decided to throw her own hat into the ring, by running against Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene in the race to represent Georgia's 14th Congressional District in the House of Representatives. Greene, in just a single term, has garnered a reputation as a kook, spreading outlandish conspiracy theories ranging from defending QAnon , to suggesting that California wildfires were intentionally caused by lasers from outer space. Just last month, Greene appeared as a speaker at a white nationalist political conference. There would seem to be plenty of room for a competitor.\n\nBut before someone like Pence can make her case to voters, she has to clear another hurdle: Georgia's ballot access laws.\n\nGeorgia's laws are quite onerous : To qualify for the ballot in a race for a districted position, a candidate needs to collect the signatures of 5 percent of all registered voters in their district-for the U.S. House, that means between 20,000 and 25,000 signatures. Conveniently, the two major parties are exempt from this rule, by virtue of having been on the ballot previously.\n\nThe law was initially passed in 1943, at a time when the state was also barring Communists from running for office. Perhaps not surprisingly, since 1943, not one single third-party candidate has made it onto the ballot for a districted race in Georgia. Last year, on a challenge from the Georgia L.P., a district court tossed the 5-percent rule, replacing it with a rule only requiring signatures from one-percent of registered voters. But earlier this year, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the requirement.\n\nRyan Graham, chair of the Georgia L.P., tells Reason that the steep signature requirement handicaps the party's ability to \"build the bench,\" recruiting candidates for local races who can gain political experience and potentially go on to higher office. Pence says that after the appeals court reinstated the 5-percent rule, at least five Georgia L.P. candidates for office dropped out, citing the difficulty in obtaining that many signatures.\n\nGreene benefited from some good fortune in her initial run for Congress: After initially intending to campaign in the more competitive 6th Congressional District, the incumbent in the 14th retired, and Greene instead became the first candidate to sign up to run for his seat. Despite losing the state as a whole, former President Donald Trump won GA-14 by nearly 50 points. The less competitive a district is, the more likely it will attract fringe candidates like Greene. And Greene's Democratic opponent, Kevin Van Ausdal, moved out of state during the campaign but stayed on the ballot, allowing her to run functionally unopposed.\n\nNow, Georgia's ballot access laws are performing a similar function. While it is possible that Greene could lose to a Republican primary challenger-and she faces several -Greene coasted to victory in the 2016 primary and took in an impressive amount of individual campaign contributions, even after already receiving criticism for anti-Semitic and Islamophobic comments. And with an electorate tilted so heavily to the right, any Democratic candidate faces little chance of success, especially against a well-funded incumbent with national name recognition. Pence realizes this. \"A Democrat is never gonna win here,\" she says, while remaining hopeful that Republican voters, soured on Greene but unwilling to ever vote for a Democrat, will find her positions appealing.\n\nBut to get to that point, she has to jump through hoops that neither Greene nor her eventual Democratic opponent had to contend with. Ultimately, this unfairness impacts more than just libertarians: In Georgia, any potential alternative parties-the Green Party, the Constitution Party, Democratic Socialists of America, the still-extant Prohibition Party -face the same seemingly insurmountable task just to qualify. That disparity makes it that much more difficult for a fringe candidate in a safe seat like Greene to face a serious challenger.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the third-ranking Republican in the House, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a freshman elected in November. Cheney's sin is that she was one of 10 Republicans who voted in favor of impeaching Donald Trump for his conduct on the day of the January 6 Capitol riot. Greene's sin is that she is a loony conspiracy theorist who has endorsed nearly every crazy idea circulating among right-wing agitators, depicting her political opponents as traitors, child molesters, Nazi collaborators, and murderers.\n\nCheney's pro-Trump colleagues want her to lose her position as chair of the House Republican Conference. Democrats think Greene \"should be removed from her committee assignments in light of conduct she has exhibited.\" The New York Times says the debate about which of them should be punished and how is \"a proxy battle for the [Republican] party's future.\" If so, it is not a battle over ideology or policy; it is a battle over which should count for more in the Republican Party: blind obeisance to Trump or a basic respect for reality.\n\nAmong other things, Greene has backed Trump's wild claims of massive election fraud, saying the results in Georgia should be \"decertified\"; embraced the QAnon and Pizzagate fantasies; linked Hillary Clinton to pedophilia and human sacrifice; charged Clinton and her husband with killing John F. Kennedy Jr.; described Barack Obama as a secret Muslim who commissioned the murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich; suggested that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other leading Democrats should be executed for treason; peddled an explanation for a California wildfire involving space lasers, the Rothschilds, and Gov. Jerry Brown; called Jewish billionaire George Soros \"a piece of crap who turned in his own people over to the Nazis\" and \"a Nazi\" who is \"trying to continue what was not finished\"; shared a video alleging that \"Zionist supremacists\" are committing \"the biggest genocide in human history\" by flooding Europe with nonwhite immigrants; argued that the Parkland and Sandy Hook school shootings were \"false flag\" operations aimed at promoting gun control; claimed there was \"never any evidence\" that a plane crashed into the Pentagon during the 9/11 attacks; and declared that anyone who is an observant Muslim \"does not belong in our government.\"\n\nThis week Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) castigated Greene without naming her. \"Somebody who's suggested that perhaps no airplane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, that horrifying school shootings were pre-staged, and that the Clintons crashed JFK Jr.'s airplane is not living in reality,\" McConnell said in a statement to The Hill . \"This has nothing to do with the challenges facing American families or the robust debates on substance that can strengthen our party.\"\n\nMcConnell, who last month said Trump \"provoked\" the Capitol riot with \"lies\" about the election but nevertheless voted against trying his impeachment in the Senate, warned that \"loony lies and conspiracy theories are cancer for the Republican Party and our country.\" Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), a longtime Trump critic, says the GOP has no place for \"kooks\" like Greene. Even House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), a Trump loyalist who is trying to decide what should be done about Greene, concedes that some of her comments are \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\nGreene, who apparently recognized herself as a purveyor of \"loony lies and conspiracy theories\" even though McConnell did not name her, rejected his criticism. \"The real cancer for the Republican Party is weak Republicans who only know how to lose gracefully,\" she tweeted on Monday. \"This is why we are losing our country.\"\n\nAfter news outlets exposed her outré views, Greene dismissed the evidence as \"a few social media posts before I ran for Congress.\" She said many other people had managed her accounts and \"some did not represent my views.\" By Greene's account, then, she let other people say some of that crazy stuff while speaking on her behalf, which hardly reflects well on her judgment. But unless she also hired an unhinged Greene impersonator to do interviews and appear in online videos, that excuse gets her only so far.\n\nTrump, whose only criterion for liking people seems to be their loyalty to him, remains a fan. \"I had a GREAT call with my all time favorite POTUS, President Trump!\" Greene tweeted on Saturday. \"I'm so grateful for his support and more importantly the people of this country are absolutely 100% loyal to him because he is 100% loyal to the people and America First.\"\n\nGreene sees all the criticism of her as a validation. \"The DC Swamp and the Fake News Media are attacking me because I am not one of them,\" she tweeted on Monday. \"I am one of you.\" For Republicans, that's a problem.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Conservatives Turn Further Against War-Except Maybe With Mexico\n\nCPAC\n\nJoe Lancaster | 3.3.2023 4:50 PM\n\nAt the nation's largest gathering of conservatives, many seem to be turning against the prospect of American military interventions-at least overseas.\n\nAs part of her speech at the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) took aim at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to Greene, \"He said he wants our sons and daughters to go die [fighting] in Ukraine.\" She pledged \"no money to Ukraine\" and said, \"that country needs to find peace, not war.\" To Zelenskyy, \"You better leave your hands off our sons and daughters because they're not dying over there.\"\n\nGreene made the same claim earlier this week on Twitter , based on an out-of-context statement: Speaking of a hypothetical Russian attack against a NATO member state, Zelenskyy said the U.S. would send its \"sons and daughters\" to fight. Ukraine is not a member of NATO. Under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, an attack on one member state could spawn a request for military assistance from other members. But after her speech, in an appearance at the Real America's Voice broadcasting booth, Greene and Steve Bannon clarified that the U.S. should not acquiesce to American soldier involvement in conflict over NATO states either.\n\nThe forthrightness of Greene's position marks a noticeable shift from conservatives of years past: After all, the only country to ever invoke Article 5 was the United States. Under a Republican president, the U.S. launched multiple wars against Middle Eastern nations under the rubric of a global war on terror after the September 11 attacks. But conservatives in the last few years have shifted away from the Republican Party's past militarism, and it showed in the speeches of the party's 2024 candidates.\n\nFormer South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who recently announced a run for the presidency, addressed CPAC on Friday. She refrained from any foreign policy specifics other than to say that \"we need our military to be stronger than ever,\" as \"a strong military doesn't start wars, a strong military prevents wars.\"\n\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was another CPAC speaker who is expected to announce a presidential run. Like Haley's, Pompeo's speech was short on foreign policy specifics other than to tout his own achievements as a West Point cadet and as an Army officer. He spoke of the need for military-style \"victory\" but against enemies like \"wokeness\" rather than any particular geopolitical foe.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump announced his own reelection candidacy in November. Last month, Politico reported that Trump intended to run as an anti-war alternative to candidates like Haley and Pompeo.\n\nGiven that the post-9/11 military incursions resulted in the two longest wars in American history, we should welcome conservative skepticism toward flexing America's military might. But that's not the entire story.\n\nRepublicans often blame Mexican drug cartels and American border policy for American fentanyl deaths. Greene advocated targeting cartels by bombing Mexico, a clear act of war against another nation. Vivek Ramaswamy, who recently announced a candidacy for president as a Republican, pledged that as president he would use \"military force to decimate the cartels, Osama bin Laden-style.\"\n\nDuring a 2022 debate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) said the U.S. should \"declare the Mexican drug cartels a terrorist organization,\" a designation which he alleged \"allows our military to go to Mexico...and actually do battle with them.\"\n\nAnd earlier this year, Reps. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) and Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) introduced an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) to target cartels. The U.S. Congress has yet to repeal the AUMFs still in effect since both 2001 and 2002-not to mention the AUMFs from 1991 and 1957-but some Republicans want to pass yet another one. While Waltz said this AUMF would not authorize soldiers, the 21st century is full of presidents using AUMFs in ways other than for their intended purpose.\n\nWhile a conservative skepticism toward military aggression would be welcome, Republican standard-bearers are all too happy to sign off on war powers in other ways.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "If Republicans Want To Cut Spending, They Should Start With the Pentagon\n\nGovernment Spending\n\nEric Boehm | 1.27.2023 1:30 PM\n\nThe first major test for the new Republican majority in the House is the looming crisis involving the debt ceiling, which GOP lawmakers say they won't vote to raise unless Democrats, including President Joe Biden, agree to cut spending.\n\nAnd the first major test of whether Republicans are serious about cutting spending is their ability to identify anything they'd actually be willing to cut.\n\nSo far, that part has been the problem.\n\nCase in point, here's Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) explaining the House GOP's demands to NBC News earlier this week: \"There's gotta be cuts in spending. That has to happen.\" So far, so good. But when a reporter followed up by asking what cuts Taylor Greene would support, the congresswoman responded by saying \"I haven't really formulated an exact list.\"\n\nOK, maybe that's somewhat unfair. Taylor Greene is, after all, known more for her willingness to engage in ridiculous conspiracy theories and culture warring than for her policy chops. But the same conundrum seems to afflict a wide swath of Republicans, who have so far done a better job of identifying what they refuse to cut-Social Security, Medicare, or military spending-than specifying what they'd be willing to put on the chopping block.\n\n\"Republicans have Very Serious budget demands. Unfortunately, they can't identify what any of those demands are,\" summarizes The Washington Post 's Catherine Rampell. \"Republicans say they want lower deficits-in fact, they have pledged to balance the budget (that is, no deficit at all) within seven or 10 years. But they have not laid out any plausible mathematical path for arriving at that destination.\"\n\nThe closest thing there is to an actual plan is a one-page document published by the Republican Study Committee. It promises to balance the federal budget by the end of the decade by making \"common-sense reforms to reduce spending & the associated inflation.\"\n\nWhat are those reforms?  ̄\\_(ツ)_/ ̄\n\nThe fundamental problem for Republicans is that it's virtually impossible to balance the budget without cutting entitlements or the military. In fact, you'd have to cut 85 percent of the rest of the federal budget, according to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which advocates for lower deficits.\n\nAs much fun as that might be to watch, it's simply not politically possible.\n\nWhich means there is only one way forward, a way outlined on Wednesday by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).\n\n\"We have an opportunity here. It could be done. But it would take compromise between both parties,\" Paul said during a brief press conference held by a group of Senate Republicans. \"Republicans would have to give up the sacred cow that says we will never touch a dollar in military [spending], and the Democrats would have to give up the sacred cow that they will never touch a dollar in welfare.\"\n\nYes, Republicans. The time has come to admit that budget cuts will have to hit the Pentagon too.\n\nAs well they should. If any other department of the government couldn't account for billions of dollars in assets and had never successfully passed an audit, it would be placed right at the top of the list of wasteful spending that Republicans wanted to cut. And they'd be right to do that!\n\nDress a welfare program in camouflage,  however, and it suddenly becomes an untouchable asset. It's unpatriotic to even suggest that perhaps military contractors shouldn't get to attach 3,800 percent markups on spare parts or that the nation will still be secure if we don't blow $1.7 trillion on new fighter jets that might never work .\n\nRemember how we finally ended the war in Afghanistan in 2021? You wouldn't know it by looking at the military budget , which has continued increasing even as the war on terror winds down. \"The Congressional Budget Office has determined that, if current trends continue, the Pentagon could receive a monumental $7.3 trillion-plus over the next decade, more than was spent during the peak decade of the Afghan and Iraq wars, when there were up to 190,000 American troops in those two countries alone,\" wrote William Hurtung, a senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute, which advocates for a more realistic U.S. foreign policy, last year.\n\nRepublicans need a plan to cut spending? Here's one. The Center for International Policy, a foreign policy think tank, has outlined how the military budget could be trimmed by $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years by doing stuff conservative Republicans say they want, like avoiding foreign wars and cutting bureaucracy.\n\nThese aren't radical ideas. They should be a necessary part of any discussion about reducing the deficit and managing the bloated national debt. And, unlike changes to Social Security-which should also be on the table-they wouldn't significantly impact the working-class voters that Republicans are increasingly trying to court. No one in western Pennsylvania or eastern Kentucky is going to get upset about military-industrial contractors living in Fairfax County McMansions getting slightly less wealthy over the next decade.\n\n\"Everything would have to be looked at across the board. No one has a sacred area that would be immune,\" Paul said . \"It's a responsible thing to do.\"\n\nHe's right. But it can only happen if Republicans admit that protecting the military budget from possible cuts makes little fiscal or political sense.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Expel Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nHer lies are far more consequential than George Santos'.\n\nIf you have a few minutes, take a moment to read a piece of congressional business quickly slipping away down the memory hole: House Resolution 878 , passed by the 118th Congress on December 1, 2023. What, exactly, was House Resolution 878? It's the one that begins, \"Whereas Representative George Santos is a Member of the United States House of Representatives\" and ends by making that first sentence no longer the case.\n\nThe resolution is pretty funny reading. It talks around the real reasons Santos was expelled from the House-his embarrassing fictions about his biography and career and his risible general personal ickiness-and pretends instead that the main issue was financial wrongdoing:\n\nWhereas, on May 10, 2023, Representative Santos was charged in Federal court in the Eastern District of New York with wire fraud in connection with a fraudulent political contribution scheme, unlawful monetary transactions in connection with the wire fraud allegations, theft of public money in connection with his alleged receipt of unemployment benefits, fraudulent application for and receipt of unemployment benefits, and false statements in connection with his 2020 and 2022 House of Representatives Financial Disclosure Statements;\n\nWhereas Nancy Marks, who served as Treasurer to Representative Santos' campaign, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, falsifying records, and identity theft in connection with the Santos campaign;\n\nWhereas a superseding indictment was filed on October 10, 2023, charging Representative Santos with additional violations related to his 2022 campaign, including allegations of falsifying Federal Election Commission reports in connection with a $500,000 personal loan that was never made, falsifying the names of contributors to his campaign, engaging in aggravated identity theft and access device fraud, and enriching himself through a fraudulent contribution scheme;\n\nWhereas Sam Miele, who served as a fundraiser to Representative Santos' campaign, pleaded guilty to a Federal wire fraud charge after impersonating a senior congressional aide for the purposes of soliciting funds ...\n\nEtc., etc., et multa c.\n\nNo doubt the financial wrongdoing was a real thing. Santos is pretty obviously a small-time grifter who briefly made it to the majors before striking out. Silence of the Lambs author Thomas Harris' heroine Clarice Starling might well have been talking to George Santos rather than her fictional bureaucratic nemesis: \"You aren't fast enough to steal in Congress. You can't make up for a second-rate intelligence just by playing dirty.\"\n\nHarris, like many writers of pulp fiction, is a first-rate observer of human facts (so clear as to be off-putting; there is a reason he had to invent Hannibal Lecter as his authorial alter ego ), but I am not sure that bit of wisdom entirely stands the test of time: Washington in Anno Domini 2024 is full of people successfully making up for a second-rate intelligence just by playing dirty, and some of those people are in Congress. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is one of these. Sen. Bob Menendez is another . George Santos is one who tried and failed.\n\n(Ted Cruz, in contrast, possesses a first-rate intelligence, and so one wonders what it is he is making up for.)\n\nWe have endured a general lowering of standards in order to accommodate not Rep. Lauren Boebert but the feckless cretins and maniacs-our neighbors, our fellow Americans-who prefer to be represented by such a figure. Boebert may not be much of a capital-R Representative, but she represents her voters perfectly. Santos was an anthropomorphic (more or less) sign of the times.\n\nI claim that there has been a general lowering of standards, but please do not read me to mean that Congress in the 19th or 20th century was free of the kind of financial shenanigans, self-dealing, petty crime, corruption, venality, and pocket-lining of which Santos and Menendez stand accused. (I am always surprised how cheap it is to buy an American politician: Menendez is a man whose head apparently could be turned by a Rolex and a Mercedes C-Class, a car that can be leased for less than $600 a month. Yes, I know about the bars of gold, but imagine going fishing for senators with a Rolex and actually catching one-it is absurd.) Bribery is eternal-it has been around long enough to have been condemned in the Old Testament, along with murder and idolatry, and anything that has been around that long must be understood to be simply a part of the human condition. That sort of thing is wicked and should be punished severely when wrongdoing is discovered.\n\nMy longstanding view is that criminal offenses touching public trust should be punished much more severely than merely private money-grubbing crimes, in much the same way that a police officer who commits a murder (and I do not mean here merely a questionable shooting in the line of duty but crimes such as acting as mob assassins ) should be prosecuted much more rigorously than a regular-schmo murderer. But petty paper-stacking, even when criminal, is far from the worst thing a politician can do. And sometimes, non- criminal actions by holders of the public trust merit even more severe reactions.\n\nBy which I mean, of course, to bring up only this: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene should be expelled from Congress. Her offenses are not (so far as I know) criminal, but they are in every way worse than Santos' offenses, more corrosive to the public trust and to the institution which she (theoretically) serves. Congress has a surfeit of self-importance but only rarely can rouse itself to a display of self-respect, as in the expulsion of Santos.\n\nGreene is not the most significant of the parties who have worked to spread the wild lie that the Biden administration attempted to assassinate Donald Trump during the search of Mar-a-Lago. Donald Trump is the most important of the liars. Julie Kelly of RealClear (ha!) Investigations is another. But Greene is a member of Congress, not a social media troll. And while she is not the only member of Congress to traffic in this nonsense, she is the worst offender.\n\nIf you would like an excellent chronicle of how the Trump-assassination lie made its way from the sewers of the Internet to the halls of Congress, my colleague Mike Warren's account is unimprovable . The short version: It begins with Kelly et al. claiming that bog-standard boilerplate language regarding the use of force in serving a warrant was some kind of extraordinary plan to have FBI agents \"engage\" the Secret Service-during a search that intentionally was conducted when the former president was not at Mar-a-Lago. The imbecility worked its way up through figures such as Dan Bongino (whose enduring soreness over having failed to make the cut at the FBI is palpable every time he talks about the agency) and then to Greene, who offered this doozy :\n\nThe Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light. Does everyone get it yet???!!!! What are Republicans going to do about it? I tried to oust our Speaker who funded Biden's DOJ AND FBI, but Democrats stopped it.\n\nOh, we get it. We do. It is as plain as day: Moscow Madge is still looking for some flimsy post-hoc vindication for her risible, failed attempt to get rid of the speaker of the House , Mike Johnson, a coup-backing knee-walking MAGA grotesque and Trump enabler who is somehow not depraved and sycophantic enough for Greene. The speaker's great sin against the One True Faith was deciding, for whatever reason, that House Republicans' No. 1 priority was not not having a Department of Justice. Moscow Madge demanded that Johnson defund the police at the federal level, and Johnson, who occasionally does an almost persuasive impersonation of a functional adult human being, demurred.\n\nTaking bribes and stealing from campaign funds and all of the rest of that time-honored stuff is bad and awful and disreputable and should be punished with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch when appropriate, but the sort of thing Greene is engaged in is much, much worse. You can bomb federal buildings-and who doubts that Tim McVeigh would be an unrelenting consumer of Greene's social-media output, had we not had the good sense to poison him to death and burn what was left over-but what Greene is doing with the effort she is helping to lead will do far more harm to institutions such as the FBI and the DOJ than a mere bomb would. Perhaps you do not much care for the FBI or the DOJ-there is no shortage of legitimate criticism to make of these institutions, where there is much that is in need of reform. But let your little libertarian heart flutter for only the briefest moment before your brain rejoins the conversation to ask: What do you imagine would come to replace the FBI or the DOJ. Something good? Something better? Something more in keeping with our ancestral liberty?\n\nPlease.\n\n(It isn't that an agency cannot reach a state when replacing or abolishing it is the best option: Some agencies outlive their usefulness, and a few develop such crippling deformities of corporate culture that reforming them would be more effort than it is worth. I would argue that there are three prominent examples: One is the IRS, whose leaders and managers should be dismissed with prejudice, but even with a wide and deep and maybe even radical reform of the U.S. tax code, somebody is going to do most of the work the IRS does today. Another is the Department of Education, the main legitimate purpose of which is the dispersal of federal funds, a job that could be better done by an agency unburdened by broader policy questions best left to the states and to the educational institutions themselves. The third is the ATF, the operations of which have no meaningful effect on the violent criminal use of firearms, which has an extremely dysfunctional institutional culture, and which is tasked with overseeing a portfolio that contains an incoherent mix of retail regulation and organized-crime work.)\n\nWe know what Greene's beef with the FBI and the DOJ is: These organizations are asked to enforce the law at a time when Donald Trump and many Republicans are inclined to break it. While the Trump element goes back and forth between insisting that January 6 never happened (Julie Kelly claims it was staged by federal law-enforcement agents) or that it was an admirable exercise in patriotic protest, because, somehow, the right has gone from Barry Goldwater and William F. Buckley Jr. to ...\n\n... well, you know.\n\n(If that jabroni were a fed, he'd be wearing shiny black FBI shoes. Everybody knows. Ask Tom Wolfe .)\n\nA free society can weather many kinds of abuse and trauma: violence, wars, economic convulsions, natural disasters, the wax and wane of the Mandate of Heaven as it is filtered through the dirty laundry of democracy. But a free society cannot endure government by lie. Government by lie is not the same thing as a government that includes the usual share of lying politicians. Government by lie is what you get when lying becomes, in effect, a political creed of its own, a party and a movement unto itself.\n\nLying is unpatriotic. It is dangerous. It is corrosive. There isn't much that can be done about the lies of Donald Trump other than what's already being done, and there isn't much that can be done about the lies of such figures as Julie Kelly, because the people who read her and the people who employ her do not have the necessary self-respect to act. There is not much that can be done about social media at large or even about big, lying institutions such as Fox News, which, even though it has been chastened a bit by recent defamation judgments, is essentially only Julie Kelly writ large. (Indeed, Kelly has long been a Fox News regular.)\n\nBut Marjorie Taylor Greene is not only a social-media troll-she was that, but, thanks to the miracle of democracy, she is something more than that today: the honorable representative for the good people of Dalton, Georgia, and the surrounding area. But the House can expel her. It expelled George Santos for much less serious offenses. And, really, that's Republicans in 2024: When they can be bothered to act, it is almost exclusively in the service of the insignificant and the symbolic. But Greene is undermining the government she supposedly serves, and she is setting the stage for political violence in the wake of a Trump loss in November, if such a thing should come to pass. As somebody once demanded to know:\n\n\"What are Republicans going to do about it?\"\n\nAnd: What are Democrats going to do about it?\n\nAnybody?\n\nAdults who use the word \" scary \" to describe anything in American politics should be ... I don't know, but made to suffer something unpleasant. We should take all their pencils away until they learn how to write like grown-ups. E.g. , this Slate headline, changed since the original:\n\n\" Alito flag scandal: The second one is even scarier than the first .\"\n\nI read in vain to try to discover the part that should be scary, or even scarier. But the article offers little fortification for fear. Indeed, Molly Olmstead notes:\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, too, displays an Appeal to Heaven flag outside his office door . Johnson, though, is Southern Baptist-not a background that aligns with [Dutch] Sheets' particular Christian tradition. Alito is also not affiliated with charismatic Christianity. He comes from a Roman Catholic faith tradition. Nor is Leonard Leo, who also flew the flag . Leo, the Federalist Society figure often credited for the current makeup of the Supreme Court, is a traditionalist Catholic.\n\nRadical posturing is a real temptation for men and women in public life. God knows I've been guilty of it myself at times. There is a long tradition on the right (and a lesser one on the left) of associating Revolution-era symbols with current political contests. (Such imagery also finds many uses in non-political contexts .) The notion that Samuel Alito is some kind of closet Talibanist who fancies the idea of imposing ... what, papal sharia ? ... on the United States is implausible. Might he feel that he, and the Supreme Court, and the country at large are set upon by dangerous and irresponsible partisans? He might. He should.\n\nWould that be scary ? I don't see why it should.\n\nConsider the \"evergreen pine.\"\n\nHere is an interesting (I think so, anyway) thing that's been on my mind because of that book I keep threatening to finish but haven't quite yet. The \"Appeal to Heaven\" or \"Pine Tree\" flag, currently in the news because it flew over Justice Samuel Alito's beach house, had of course been around for a long time before it was taken up as a symbol by Trump cultists. The pine tree is a symbol of New England, and the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag, which first was displayed during the American Revolution, still is used as the naval ensign of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (without the text). The words \"Appeal to Heaven\" are from John Locke and refer to the moral legitimacy of revolution.\n\nThe flag does not belong to the Trump cultists, but it is a perfect symbol for them. Pine trees (and other evergreens) are, for obvious reasons, ancient symbols of fertility and prosperity, and they are used by all sorts of tribal chieftains as symbols for the fatherly and wealth-sharing capacity of their office. As the Trump cult grows increasingly and obviously cultlike, its character religious rather than political, such symbols take on additional urgency.\n\nThe tribal-father aspect of the evergreen was reflected in a famous Walter Scott poem that, after a few twists and turns, became our familiar \"Hail to the Chief.\"  Because, of course it did. We have been building a cult of the presidency since before they hired away an artist from the Vatican to paint The Apotheosis of George Washington on the underside of the Capitol dome.\n\nI slightly prefer the lyrics Jack Lemmon made up for the song in My Fellow Americans , but here's Scott in the pagan-chieftain mode increasingly fitting to our conception of the president:\n\nHail to the Chief who in triumph advances! Honoured and blessed be the evergreen Pine! Long may the tree, in his banner that glances, Flourish, the shelter and grace of our line! Heaven send it happy dew, Earth lend it sap anew, Gaily to bourgeon and broadly to grow, While every Highland glen Sends our shout back agen, ' Roderich Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe! '\n\nOther than being competently written verse and generally literate, there is no real reason this couldn't have been produced by a modern American president-worshiper.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has published a very interesting article arguing that Republicans may think inflation is worse than Democrats do not only out of partisan prejudice but because inflation has been higher in Republican-leaning areas than in Democratic ones.\n\nRepublicans right now think inflation is a much bigger problem than Democrats do, and a lot of that is just politics. But here's another possibility: Many of the places Republicans live indeed have had significantly higher inflation than Democratic enclaves.\n\nIn new research , economists Carola Binder, Rupal Kamdar and Jane Ryngaert examined Labor Department inflation figures for U.S. metropolitan areas, and compared them with voting data. Their finding: Metro areas with more Republicans and independent voters tended to have higher inflation in 2022 than places where Democrats live.\n\nA Wall Street Journal analysis found a similar pattern at the state level. Inflation estimates provided by Moody's Analytics, combined with voting data, show that states where Donald Trump garnered the most votes in 2020 have on balance experienced higher inflation.\n\nFor example, South Carolina has had the highest recent inflation, New Hampshire the lowest. South Carolina was a Trump state, New Hampshire a Biden state.\n\nThe kooks will of course say that the Biden administration is somehow engineering relatively high inflation in Trump-voting areas, but that is nonsense. What might actually account for the difference?\n\nAt the county level, Democratic areas tend to be wealthier and more economically productive than Republican ones do. That is because these are cities, which are, have been, and almost certainly will continue to be the great centers of innovation. Republicans would do well to think about what their terrible political position in the cities bodes for their party.\n\nThat being said, economic growth at the state level has recently been much stronger in Republican-leaning states: South Carolina had the third-fastest-growing state economy in 2023, behind No. 1 Florida and No. 2 Washington. Washington is generally Democratic-leaning, but most of the rest of the states leading the list are Republican-leaning: Florida and South Carolina, Nebraska, Kansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Idaho, etc.\n\nNew Hampshire, which is where upper-class white people go to die when they cannot afford Vermont, is not exactly an engine of dynamism. It has no major city (its largest, Manchester, would be the 15th-largest municipality in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro if it were transplanted to north Texas), its people are old, and it is less attractive to immigrants than Iowa, South Dakota, or the United States at large. With the (arguable) exception of Allegro MicroSystems, there is no company of national or international importance headquartered there. (Sorry, Planet Fitness!) But it has a higher average household income than any state save Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, all of which are behind the District of Columbia.\n\nThe general economic inertia of rich but stagnant places such as New Hampshire may act as a brake on inflation, whereas the flux and turnover of states like South Carolina-less affluent but more dynamic-may make such places more sensitive to short-term economic trends.\n\nThat's my guess, anyway. I'd love to hear yours.\n\nI am disappointed by Nikki Haley's halfhearted endorsement of Donald Trump, but I am not surprised by it. She ran a halfhearted, lily-livered campaign during which she plainly was terrified of offending the Trump element, or even being seen as insufficiently energetic in pandering to that element. Of course she was going to come around to Trump. She's a young woman by Washington standards, ambitious and gifted, and, as she sees it, she's stuck in the desert with only one horse available to ride out on. I think she has made a miscalculation-and I think well enough of Haley to reject out of hand any suggestion that she is acting out of principle here-and I suspect that miscalculation may well be the end of her political career. But, again, she is a young woman by Washington standards, ambitious and gifted. Life is long, and memory is short.\n\nWhen the time comes, I'll try to help everybody remember.\n\nYou can buy my most recent book, Big White Ghetto , here .\n\nYou can buy my other books here .\n\nYou can see my New York Post columns here .\n\nPlease subscribe to The Dispatch if you haven't.\n\nYou can check out \"How the World Works,\" a series of interviews on work I'm doing for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, here .\n\nMany thanks to those of you who keep sending me those YouTube videos of the guy who has triplets and figures out clever ways to move them around.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Is No Neville Chamberlain\n\nStop with the needless insults.\n\nIrritated by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's tireless dedication to serving Moscow's interests, Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz offered an amendment to the Ukraine aid bill that would have renamed her office the \" Neville Chamberlain Room .\" It was an ugly, stupid, juvenile insult.\n\nSay what you will about Marjorie Taylor Greene, she is no Neville Chamberlain.\n\nNeville Chamberlain was an honorable and decent man, a patriot and a statesman who led the United Kingdom during the first months of World War II before serving honorably in Winston Churchill's war cabinet for the few months he had left to live before dying of cancer. He retired, as it were, at the end of September 1940, and he was dead by November 9, having labored through the excruciating pain of intestinal cancer as the Blitz raged overhead. When Churchill, acting on behalf of the king, offered the dying Chamberlain the Order of the Garter, Chamberlain declined. \"I prefer to die plain 'Mr. Chamberlain,' like my father before me, unadorned by any title,\" he said.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene is no Neville Chamberlain.\n\nChamberlain came late to national politics. He was about to turn 50 when he was elected to the House of Commons. (No British prime minister ever has been first elected to Parliament later in life.) He had failed at one business and prospered at another, and much of his political career had been spent in unglamorous municipal government, first as a city councilman and planning commissioner and then as mayor of Birmingham during the austerity of the Great War. He cut spending, reduced the scope of his own office, and cut his own expense account by half as a seemly wartime measure. His performance in office was enough to get him appointed director of national service. In the position, he oversaw Britain's military conscription while securing an adequate workforce for war-production industries. He disagreed with the prime minister, David Lloyd George, and resigned from the prestigious and influential post.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene is no Neville Chamberlain.\n\nAfter the war, Chamberlain decided to run for the House of Commons and won a seat with a 70 percent majority. He was a legislative workhorse but declined a ministerial appointment under Lloyd George. He worked his way up to the position of chancellor of the exchequer-secretary of the treasury, approximately-and narrowly turned back an electoral challenge from Labour candidate Oswald Mosley, the future leader of British fascism. By the early 1930s, Chamberlain had helped to lead the United Kingdom from a position of debt-ridden near-ruination to a budget surplus. He quipped that the country had turned the last page of Bleak House and opened the first chapter of Great Expectations .\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene is no Neville Chamberlain.\n\nAs prime minister, Chamberlain miscalculated in what turned out to be the most consequential decision of his political career. He believed, wrongly, that he could buy off Adolf Hitler and thereby avoid an unprofitable war with a continental tyrant. Avoiding unprofitable wars with continental tyrants has historically been a considerable part of British foreign policy, and it has often been the right policy. It wasn't the right policy vis-à-vis Nazi Germany. It fell to Chamberlain to admit his error and to announce the declaration of war. He forthrightly addressed his fellow countrymen on the radio:\n\nThis country is at war with Germany. You can imagine what a bitter blow it is to me that all my long struggle to win peace has failed. ... We and France are today, in fulfillment of our obligations, going to the aid of Poland, who is so bravely resisting this wicked and unprovoked attack upon her people. We have a clear conscience. We have done all that any country could do to establish peace. ... Now may God bless you all and may He defend the right. For it is evil things that we shall be fighting against, brute force, bad faith, injustice, oppression and persecution. And against them I am certain that the right will prevail.\n\nHonor even in disappointment. Standing by his pledge to help an occupied people resist a \"wicked and unprovoked attack\" from a tyrant. Telling the truth about it.\n\nNo, Marjorie Taylor Greene is no Neville Chamberlain.\n\nWhat was Winston Churchill's judgment? He eulogized his former rival in Parliament:\n\nIt fell to Neville Chamberlain in one of the supreme crises of the world to be contradicted by events, to be disappointed in his hopes, and to be deceived and cheated by a wicked man. But what were these hopes in which he was disappointed? What were these wishes in which he was frustrated? What was that faith that was abused? They were surely among the most noble and benevolent instincts of the human heart-the love of peace, the toil for peace, the strife for peace, the pursuit of peace, even at great peril, and certainly to the utter disdain of popularity or clamour.\n\nNeville Chamberlain made the wrong decision at the most important juncture of his public life. But he was an authentic statesman who put service over self, even at the cost of his reputation, personal fortune, and health. For most of the world-and particularly for Americans, who care so little for history-all that remains of Neville Chamberlain is his worst mistake. But he did what he thought was right, received very little thanks for it in the end, and never stopped working for his country until the last few weeks of his life, when he was physically unable to continue. He died, as he wished, plain Mr. Chamberlain.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene is no Neville Chamberlain. Not on her best day.\n\nKevin D.

      "text": "No, Trump Did Not Win by the 'Biggest Margin of Any Republican Presidential Candidate'\n\nA claim by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is false.\n\nDid Donald Trump win the 2024 election by the widest margin of any Republican president in history? According to a recent X post by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, yes, he did.\n\n\"Making it real clear for House Republicans in here as we discus tax law, just told my colleagues. Trump won the election by the biggest margin of any Republican presidential candidate in history!!!\" she wrote in a post encouraging her House Republican colleagues to support the president's tax agenda.\n\nGreene's claim is false. Trump's margin of victory in both the popular vote and Electoral College rank relatively low compared to other Republican presidential victors.\n\nIn 1860, Abraham Lincoln became the first Republican to win a presidential election in the United States, winning 39.8 percent of the popular vote and defeating the nearest of his three challengers by 10.4 percent. Republican candidates have won 24 of the 41 presidential elections since, stretching from Lincoln's second victory in 1864 to Trump's victory in November.\n\nIn the 2024 election, Trump-who notably won the 2016 election despite losing the popular vote- defeated Kamala Harris by a popular vote margin of 1.5 percent and Electoral College margin of 16 percent. According to the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Trump's 1.5 percent popular vote margin is only the 19th highest of any Republican presidential victor in history, and his Electoral College margin of 16 percent is the 20th highest ever won by a Republican.\n\nBy comparison, Republican Richard Nixon won the 1972 election with a popular vote margin of 23.2 percent and Electoral College margin of 96.7 percent. Ronald Reagan earned similarly high margins in 1984, defeating Democrat Walter Mondale by popular and electoral vote margins of 18.2 and 97.6 percent, respectively. Republicans Theodore Roosevelt, Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover also won by overwhelming popular and electoral vote margins in their respective 1904, 1920, 1924, and 1928 elections.\n\nRep.

      "text": "Good and Hard\n\nConfirm Trump's nominees. All of them.\n\nBeing a writer means never being able to enjoy someone else's prose without feeling jealous.\n\nIt happens to me every time I read Kevin Williamson . What a terrific piece. The bastard.\n\nBut not all good prose comes from professionals. There's plenty of it in daily conversation for those who care to look, sometimes from people not known for intellectual bravado.\n\nThink what you want about Marjorie Taylor Greene, for example, but this is objectively good prose: \"The American people, the voters that voted for Trump overwhelmingly, they are MTG. MTG is not radical or extreme. She's mainstream America.\"\n\nConcise, vivid, forceful, and true. That's the good stuff. I wish I'd written it myself.\n\nGreene has spent the days since Donald Trump's victory hinting that she wants-and deserves-a spot in his Cabinet. Asked Wednesday about the prospect of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or Vivek Ramaswamy landing big jobs in the new administration, she complained that \"they both tried to beat [Trump] in the presidential race this year. ... It's important to realize who stood with President Trump from the beginning, never backed down, never stabbed him in the back, never tried to beat him.\"\n\nWhen Steve Bannon raised the possibility with her of taking charge of the Department of Homeland Security, which would place Trump's \" bloody \" mass-deportation program directly under her command, she didn't dismiss it .\n\nDHS Secretary Greene? If Trump made that nomination and I were a senator, I would vote to confirm.\n\nFDA Commissioner Robert F. Kennedy ? I'd be a yes on him too. Attorney General Jeffrey Clark ? Also yes. Supreme Court Justice Aileen Cannon ? I don't see why not.\n\n\"Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard,\" H.L. Mencken famously said in another bit of prose I wish I'd written. I find that logic insuperable under the present political circumstances. The American people are MTG; MTG is mainstream America. By what right should their representatives in the Senate deny them the government they've asked for?\n\nGive it to them. Good and hard.\n\nThere's more to this argument than spite. Although I will admit that spite is a big part of it.\n\nTwo years ago, Steve Hayes hosted Tim Miller of The Bulwark for a chat about Miller's book, with the conversation coming around to the fact that Trump had appointed mostly qualified deputies in his first term. I've written about their debate before. Steve was glad that President Trump had been advised by proverbial \"adults,\" noting that a government led by irresponsible people can cause immense human misery. Tim countered that Trump might not have remained politically viable after leaving office if those adults hadn't restrained his most despicable impulses until the final months of his presidency.\n\nBecause of the adults in the room, American voters never got to experience Trumpism . What they experienced was Trumpism sanitized by Mike Pompeo and John Kelly and James Mattis and Mark Milley, which wasn't that scary until election night 2020.\n\nSteve had the better of the argument at the time, I think. Many Americans didn't know what they were getting when they gambled on Trump as the lesser of two evils in 2016. In fact, most didn't vote for him at all; it was his opponent who won the popular vote. Handing the Department of Homeland Security to a creature like Marjorie Taylor Greene under those circumstances would have extracted an awfully steep price for a simple electoral mistake. Civic-minded officials in the Trump administration behaved honorably in trying to mitigate the damage of that mistake.\n\nSitting here now, three days after a sweeping Trump victory and outright popular-vote majority, the strength of Miller's argument seems overwhelming in hindsight. This morning, a Dispatch colleague said that the \"normie\" Trump supporters he spoke to this week have all tended to justify their votes the same way: \"We experienced life under a Trump presidency, and life under a Biden presidency, and the country and the world were better off under Trump.\" But they didn't experience life under a Trump presidency. They experienced life under a sanitized Trump presidency thanks to the \"adults in the room.\"\n\nIt's high time they experienced an actual Trump presidency, no?\n\nI'm being only half-cute in saying that. If you believe in democracy, you should find it earnestly troubling when a majority votes for a candidate expecting one thing and then gets something very different once he's in office.\n\nThe sole virtue of Trump's campaign this year was his honesty about his goals and the personnel he intends to deputize to achieve them. He campaigned side-by-side with America's most prominent vaccine skeptic, promising to \" let him go wild on [public] health \" after returning to the White House, then won the presidency going away. The people elected him with eyes wide open . Under what theory of democracy should Trump now break his promise to put Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in charge of America's health bureaucracy? Under what theory should the Senate reject Kennedy if his nomination is submitted?\n\nWe could navel-gaze here about the paradox of a democratic republic, in which representatives simultaneously have a duty to carry out the will of the people and a duty to ignore the will of the people when the people want to do something particularly stupid. The Founders distrusted the members of America's popular majority enough to have denied them the right to choose their own senators, leaving that job to state legislatures instead in hopes that those legislatures would select men of (giggle) virtue who'd demonstrate wisdom in the people's best interest.\n\nThat duty to behave wisely is the best case one can make, I think, for senators to reject Kennedy, Greene, Jeffrey Clark, and any other cretin who might come before them. If you believe that Liz Cheney, representing America's most Republican state, did the right thing by voting to impeach Trump after January 6, then you presumably agree. Representatives should exercise good civic judgment even when their constituents don't.\n\nBut what about their other duty, to carry out the will of the people?\n\n\"Mandate\" is a dirty word here at The Dispatch, so I won't bother arguing that Trump has earned a mandate for his agenda. He won his election, yes, but the senators and House members who prevailed on Tuesday won theirs too. They don't owe him their votes-except, maybe, for mediocrities like Bernie Moreno, who almost certainly wouldn't have prevailed in Ohio without Trump dragging them over the finish line.\n\nTrump doesn't have a mandate. But populism has something like a mandate, don't you think?\n\nRepublicans won the presidency and a Senate majority and are very likely to narrowly retain their House majority. That's total control of government, gift-wrapped and delivered on a silver platter at a moment when a legislative check on the incoming president was direly needed. Trump became the first Republican in 20 years to win the popular vote and did so by making meaningful gains with nearly every major demographic group. And he and his party achieved all of that while being remarkably forthcoming about their malevolent intentions. Tariffs, isolationism, \"retribution,\" anti-vaxxism-any and every species of woo-woo populism you can imagine, up to and including removing fluoride from the water supply , was on the menu. And more than half of this country ordered it.\n\nTrump winning wasn't a mistake this time. It was a choice, and a very deliberate one. Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it-good and hard. Who are their representatives, including representatives in the other party , to tell them that they can't have what they knowingly chose when Trump sends Marjorie Taylor Greene's nomination to lead DHS over to Congress?\n\nDo you support self-government or don't you?\n\nIf appealing to democracy doesn't sell you on rubber-stamping Trump's nominees, though, then how about deterrence?\n\nAll I've wanted since January 6 is deterrence . America needed to punish the instigator and his accomplices, I thought, not chiefly as a matter of justice but to show the fascists of tomorrow what awaited them if they ever dared try to pull what Trump pulled. You throw the book at coup-plotters for the same reason you throw it at any major criminal, to warn other degenerates in the population that crime doesn't pay.\n\nBut at every step since the insurrection, America has turned around and said that crime does pay.\n\nIt paid when Senate Republicans declined to convict Trump at his second impeachment trial because they feared retaliation from him and his crazed supporters. It paid when Trump's polling in this year's GOP primary improved following his criminal indictments as Republican voters guzzled down argle-bargle about a deep-state witch hunt. And it paid when a convicted felon, with dozens of felony charges still pending against him, easily won the presidency over a career prosecutor.\n\nThe American people have done everything they could reasonably do to weaken the taboo against authoritarian criminality. The only thing left that might work to deter them from ever doing something like this again is making them live with the consequences of their decision.\n\nGive them Trumpism red in tooth and claw, unsanitized this time. If he nominates out-and-out cranks for major Cabinet positions, confirm them. The Senate will confirm them, I think: Marco Rubio, a \"good Republican,\" all but admitted it this week when he was asked about the prospect of a Kennedy nomination. Once the GOP reached 52 seats on Tuesday night, rendering Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski irrelevant, any chance of this party of geldings resisting Trump's demands in the upper chamber disintegrated.\n\n\"The American people have chosen. They should not be insulated from the consequences of their choice,\" Jonathan Last wrote on Friday , urging Democrats not to block elements of Trump's agenda that will primarily harm his own voters. It's really that simple. If you want to stop future generations from experimenting with postliberalism, they'll need to see the results of the experiment that our generation is conducting. Let Trump carry it out.\n\nMaybe it'll turn out okay. Secretary Greene could prove as effective a public servant at DHS as she is a prose stylist. Perhaps the many fond wishes at the start of Trump's first term that he'll \"grow in office,\" briefly interrupted by his attempt to end American democracy in early 2021, will at last bear fruit in a second term. Taking fluoride out of the water and resurrecting measles outbreaks could usher in a new era of health, wealth, and prosperity, I suppose.\n\nBut if not, your kids and grandkids will benefit from the disastrous political history lesson you and I are about to live through. Assuming they survive those outbreaks, I mean.\n\nFull Trump, no limits. We'll get the deterrence I wanted in the end. It'll just be much, much more expensive than it needed to be.\n\nIt's not so simple, though, is it?\n\nIf all of us were destined to suffer the same under Trump's government, it'd be simple. We aren't. \"Despair is an elite luxury that vulnerable communities cannot afford,\" David French wrote on Thursday . \"If Trump was telling the truth about his intentions-and there is no good reason to think he wasn't-then he will attempt a campaign of retribution and mass deportation that will fracture families, create chaos in American communities and potentially even result in active-duty troops being deployed to our cities.\"\n\nIt's easy for me to say \"bring on Secretary Greene!\" when I'm at no risk of being tangled up in some inept, gratuitously brutal deportation dragnet or being shot at by regular military after joining a left-wing protest.\n\nBut look at it this way: Even if the Senate were to reject Greene in the name of defending the vulnerable, Trump would just scrape some other ruthless unqualified populist toady off the bottom of his shoe and nominate them for the position instead. We're going to get miscreants in this Cabinet one way or another. Isn't it better that they be high-profile ones, with neon reputations for crankery and incompetence, to help the public draw clear conclusions about the caliber of Trump's henchmen?\n\nThere's another problem with my argument. The prospects for deterrence depend an awful lot on the decency of the American people, no? Most of us have spent our lives taking that decency for granted, but we really should stop .\n\nIf there's a shining lesson from Trump's reelection it's that Americans no longer care even a little bit about decency in their leaders, at least not when eggs are more expensive than they used to be. \"Faith in the inherent goodness of Americans has failed us,\" attorney Ken White declared after Tuesday's results. \"Too many people saw it as a self-evident truth that the despicable rhetoric and policy of Trump and his acolytes was un-American. ... Trump came wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross (upside down, but still) and too many people assumed their fellow Americans would see how hollow that was. That assumption was fatal.\"\n\nAmericans will revolt against postliberalism, fulfilling my dreams of deterrence, if and only if Trump's policies hurt them personally. Tariff-palooza is high-risk for him because of that, since an aggressive trade war that triggers stagflation will shatter his silly mystique as some sort of economic magician. The tacit bargain he made with voters is that he'll make the trains run on time and they'll look the other way at his abuses. If he can't keep up his end of it, his supporters will wonder what they're getting in return for amorality.\n\nBut if he can , where's the problem? So long as Secretary Greene and the other goblins in Trump's Cabinet stick to harassing undesirables-immigrants, Democrats, transgender people, enemies of populism various and sundry-there's no reason to expect a sharp decline in the president's job approval or anything more than throat-clearing from the evaporating \"respectable\" right. The results of this election have given us every reason to believe Americans will tolerate Trump's brand of politics to the extent it's competent in administration and judicious in who it persecutes-\"judicious\" in this case meaning Them, not Us.\n\nWith apologies to Mencken, one might say that democracy under postliberalism is the theory that the common people get what they want while the less common people get what's coming to them, good and hard. If that's so, a Cabinet of cretins won't put most Americans off of Trump. It might be just what they're hoping for.\n\nNick Catoggio is a staff writer at The Dispatch and is based in Texas.

      "text": "Greene Calls for a 'National Divorce'\n\nPlus: Republicans begin field hearings.\n\nGood morning. Both chambers of Congress are out this week, but that hasn't stopped certain members from making news.\n\nGeorgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene spent Presidents' Day questioning whether the United States should continue to exist.\n\n\"We need a national divorce,\" she tweeted Monday morning. \"We need to separate by red states and blue states and shrink the federal government.\" She added, without offering more details of how exactly this would work: \"Everyone I talk to says this.\"\n\nGreene has been publicly discussing the idea of a national divorce for more than a year, but her post Monday was her most definitive endorsement yet. Her spokesman didn't reply to The Dispatch 's request for more details on Greene's position and how it would differ (or align) with secession.\n\nGreene argues a \"national divorce\" wouldn't be violent, and it's impossible to say what her proposal would mean given its vagueness. But states already enjoy the freedom to enact and enforce radically different laws from each other, and history suggests that pushing for division beyond what's currently allowed in America's federal system could end violently.\n\nAfter all, the secession of 11 Southern states between 1860 and 1861 prompted the Civil War. And legal scholars argue that the war answered whether states are able to secede: \"The answer is clear,\" the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in 2010. \"If there was any constitutional issue resolved by the Civil War, it is that there is no right to secede.\"\n\nGreene followed up Monday with a tweet from her official congressional account, suggesting an ultimatum: \"Impeach Biden or give us a national divorce,\" she wrote, slamming ongoing American support for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia.\n\nIt's extreme rhetoric from a sitting member of Congress and a close ally of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The speaker's office didn't respond to The Dispatch 's request for comment, but a few Republican lawmakers pushed back on her remarks.\n\n\"We live in the greatest country in the world,\" Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon told The Dispatch . \"I embrace the spirit of Reagan who sought to unify, spoke to our better angels and the love of country.\"\n\nRep. Nancy Mace quipped that she couldn't recommend divorce, citing personal experience:\n\nI've been divorced twice. Don't recommend it. Not even a national divorce... 🤷‍♀️\n\n- Nancy Mace (@NancyMace) February 20, 2023\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, responded Monday that Greene's rhetoric is \"destructive and wrong and-honestly-evil.\"\n\n\"We don't need a divorce, we need marriage counseling,\" he wrote. \"And we need elected leaders that don't profit by tearing us apart.\"\n\nRepublicans on the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing in Yuma, Arizona, on Thursday to examine the Biden administration's handling of the southern border. It's the latest push by Republican committee chairs to bring hearings outside of the nation's capital.\n\nAll Democratic members and several Republicans on the panel won't attend the proceedings, because of various scheduling conflicts. But Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the committee, will be joined by 14 Republican members, according to a release this week. Rep. Andy Biggs, who has called for impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, is expected to attend. Three local Arizona officials are slated to testify during the hearing.\n\nField hearings are nothing new, but Republicans are working to elevate them as they have new control of committees. The House Ways and Means Committee held its first hearing in West Virginia earlier this month. Members of the Energy and Commerce panel held a field hearing last week in Midland, Texas.\n\nRep. Mike Gallagher, chairman of the select committee on competition with the Chinese Communist Party, has said he wants to hold field hearings-even potentially outside the United States. He's expected to hold two early events in New York this weekend on transnational repression by the Chinese government.\n\nField hearings \"provide a unique opportunity to actually spend time in communities that are directly impacted by the issues we are talking about,\" Rep. Bryan Steil, who chairs the Committee on House Administration, said .\n\nRep. David Cicilline to resign from Congress\n\nD.C. drama: Dems weigh veto fight with Biden over crime bill\n\nReported threats on Congress remain high, but prosecutions decline\n\nDebt ceiling standoff prompts backup plans, but they face hurdles too\n\nHaley Wilt is a former associate editor for The Dispatch.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "Attorney General Marjorie Taylor Greene?\n\nTrump might have carte blanche on appointments in a second term.\n\nWe begin with two quotes, possibly related. The first comes from the New York Times' \"Trump whisperer,\" Maggie Haberman.\n\nOn #AxeFiles , @maggieNYT , author of Confidence Man; The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America, speaks to what to expect from Trump, if he is elected again. \"It's going to be a presidency of spite.\" Listen to the full Pod here: https://t.co/a8q8vytPL0 pic.twitter.com/oheX1dCpJC\n\n- David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) October 21, 2022\n\nThe second, allegedly, comes from Trump himself .  As Asawin Suebsaeng writes in Rolling Stone :\n\nAs he lays the groundwork for a 2024 presidential run, Trump has talked to close associates about who he'd tap for top government positions should he win back the White House, and [Marjorie Taylor] Greene has repeatedly made his list, two sources familiar with the matter tell Rolling Stone.\n\n\"Wouldn't she be great?\" Trump privately said earlier this year to a confidant, one of the two people says. It is unclear what specifically Trump has in mind for the severely MAGAfied Georgia Republican, be it a White House staff position, cabinet post, or agency appointment, the sources say. But, \"he loves MTG and would want her very close in a second term, that much was clear,\" one source says.\n\nThe second source recalls that over the past year, the ex-president had briefly mentioned Greene's name as someone who could be in the running to be a senior official at the Justice Department during a second Trump administration. The former president's comment confused the source, because \"I don't think she's a lawyer,\" this person says.\n\nShe is not, in fact, a lawyer. But she's blindly loyal and plenty spiteful , which makes her the ideal Trump second-term Cabinet appointee. If, like him, you live by a motto of \" for my friends, everything, for my enemies, the law ,\" you could scarcely do better than a clownish fanatic like Greene as your top law enforcement official.\n\n\"She'd never get confirmed,\" you might say. \"Even a Republican-controlled Senate wouldn't rubber-stamp her.\" Maybe. Mitch McConnell's majority did spike a few nominees during Trump's first term. But the Senate GOP caucus circa 2025 will look quite a bit different from the caucus of 2019. If a red wave sweeps the party to power next month, as seems probable , nationalists like J.D. Vance and Blake Masters-both endorsed by Greene-will join the chamber. The 2024 Senate map also heavily favors Republicans , portending more Trump flunkies flooding into McConnell's conference.\n\nBy the time Trump is sworn in again, the GOP could have 55 or more Senate seats. There may not be enough Mitt Romneys and Susan Collinses left to block a nominee like Greene. Senate Republicans who are privately leery of elevating her to an important administration job might look at the results of the recent election and conclude that populist cranks in key positions is what the American people want. It's certainly what their base wants.\n\nBut let's say I'm being too pessimistic, that even a MAGA-flavored Senate majority wouldn't stoop to confirming Greene. McConnell might refuse on principle to bring her nomination to the floor for a vote, say. Trump would therefore be unable to obtain the advice and consent of the Senate for his nominee, which means MTG as AG at the DOJ would be DOA. Right?\n\nDon't be so sure.\n\nIndulge me two more quotes. The first comes from Alexander Hamilton, writing in defense of granting the Senate a veto over the executive's nominees in Federalist No. 76 .\n\nIt would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity. In addition to this, it would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration.\n\nIt will readily be comprehended, that a man who had himself the sole disposition of offices, would be governed much more by his private inclinations and interests, than when he was bound to submit the propriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a different and independent body, and that body an entire branch of the legislature.\n\nSome 231 years later, a president governed entirely by his private inclinations and interests exulted over his ability to fill executive vacancies with unfit characters answerable only to him.\n\n\"I sort of like 'acting' [directors]\" Trump said in 2019 to reporters when asked why so few of his agency heads had been nominated for Senate confirmation. \"It gives me more flexibility; do you understand that? I like 'acting.'\" His whole life has been an exercise in unaccountability. He dislikes the Senate's power of advice and consent for precisely the reasons Hamilton celebrated it.\n\nAnd not just theoretically. As president, he walked the walk.\n\nDid you know that, in four years, with his own party in charge of the upper chamber, Trump never got someone confirmed to lead the Bureau of Land Management?\n\nOr the Drug Enforcement Administration?\n\nOr that, for nearly half his term, he had no Senate-approved secretary of Homeland Security?\n\nMidway through Trump's presidency, 22 of the 42 top Cabinet officials were serving in an acting capacity, without confirmation. Amazingly, that number accounted for more than a quarter of all acting Cabinet officials under all presidents dating back to 1977.\n\nHis insistence on promoting handpicked loyalists in \"acting\" roles despite legal barriers to doing so often led to ... creative solutions.\n\nIn 2018, you may recall, he finally hounded Jeff Sessions out of his job as attorney general. By law, Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein should have succeeded him as acting AG. But that was a nonstarter for the president, who resented Rosenstein for his role in overseeing the Mueller probe. So Trump promoted Sessions' chief of staff, Matt Whitaker, to be acting attorney general instead. Legal opinion split on whether the appointment was constitutional, with some arguing that it was valid under existing statutes because it was temporary and filled a vacancy created by a resignation, not a death. Others insisted it was unconstitutional inasmuch as Whitaker was wielding powers reserved for constitutional officers who are subject to Senate confirmation.\n\nLittle did either side know, though, that the Whitaker matter would be one of the less questionable maneuvers Trump would use to fill a major vacancy.\n\nIn 2019, chaos at DHS led to a game of musical chairs at the top that would end with multiple federal judges ruling that the department's top officials were serving unlawfully. Kirstjen Nielsen resigned as secretary, which should have cleared the way for Deputy Secretary Claire Grady to replace her as acting department head. But Trump wanted his top guy at Customs, Kevin McAleenan, as acting DHS secretary instead. (McAleenan was, at least, confirmed by the Senate for the Customs job.) So Grady resigned too, clearing the way for McAleenan. Later that year, McAleenan resigned, clearing the way for an undersecretary, Chad Wolf, to become acting secretary.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump was hellbent on making border hawk Ken Cuccinelli his new director at Citizenship and Immigration Services. When the Republican-led Senate refused to confirm Cuccinelli, a longtime critic of Mitch McConnell, the president simply rewrote the rules to get what he wanted. He had the director of CIS resign, then created a new position for Cuccinelli-\" principal deputy director \"-that leap-frogged him over the existing deputy director. That made Cuccinelli first in line to become acting director by replacing the outgoing director.\n\nAny president might be tempted to appoint a lackey to an unexpected vacancy that opened through exogenous circumstances. But firing Senate-confirmed officials in order to create vacancies that could then be filled by unconfirmable cronies was next-level authoritarian. The Cuccinelli appointment is the moment Trump tore up Federalist No. 76 and flushed it down the toilet .\n\nAll hell broke loose the next year. In March 2020, a federal judge in D.C. held that Cuccinelli's appointment violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act because he hadn't served as \"first assistant\" to the director for 90 days, as the statute requires. The Government Accountability Office ruled that McAleenan's elevation to acting DHS secretary violated the department's own regulations , which had been sloppily revised by Nielsen on her final day in office to facilitate his succession. Months later, a federal judge in New York affirmed that Wolf's appointment to the top job violated the Homeland Security Act , rendering his orders barring new applications to the DACA immigration program null and void.\n\nIt gets worse. Under the Vacancies Reform Act, an acting appointee is supposed to be limited to 210 days in office , roughly seven months. William Perry Pendley, Trump's acting BLM director, served 424 days without Senate confirmation before yet another federal judge put a stop to his tenure. Wolf served 14 months, with Trump's team arguing that his appointment was governed not by the Vacancies Reform Act but by the Homeland Security Act. (The, er, same statute his appointment violated per the ruling of the New York judge.) One analysis in September 2020 found that at least 15 vacancies in Trump's executive branch had been filled by acting officials for more than 210 days, all presumably in violation of the VRA.\n\nPendley was a rare case of a Trump official facing consequences for overstaying his welcome legally. Wolf stuck around until January 2021 despite the court ruling against him, resigning in protest only a few days before the end of Trump's term over the January 6 insurrection. Cuccinelli remained at CIS to the bitter end.\n\nIn the few instances when Trump did face some institutional pushback for appointing officials illegally, his administration did exactly what you'd expect them to do. They shrugged .\n\nThere were, in other words, few repercussions for the president for having repeatedly flouted constitutional and statutory restraints designed to vindicate Hamilton's vision of making top executive appointees accountable to the legislature. And to the extent there were repercussions, they came from the courts, never from Congress.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, despite two years of total Democratic control, Congress has done jack squat to address any of this . Instead they've been consumed with reforming the Electoral Count Act , which is understandable. Narrowly dodging death at the hands of a mob rampaging through your place of business will tend to focus your mind on that particular problem.\n\nBut they should maybe start considering the possibility that Trump will win the next election fair and square . And if he does, what will they have achieved over the past two years to make it harder for him to abuse his power while in office?\n\nAnything?\n\nDavid Frum likes to say of the prospect of another Trump term that \"the velociraptors have learned to work the doorknobs,\" alluding to one of the Jurassic Park sequels. That is, Trump and his cronies have surely learned from their first four years in office how to be more effective institutionally at implementing their corrupt schemes. The point of our trip down memory lane above is to remind you how doggedly he'd already begun working the doorknobs in his first term to get yes-men installed in positions where the Senate, or existing law, might have thwarted him.\n\nIf that's how Trump behaved when he knew he would have to face voters again, imagine the impunity with which he'll act in a second term knowing that he won't.\n\nAxios reported several months ago that his team is preparing to reinstate an executive order establishing a \"Schedule F\" employment classification for certain federal workers. Tens of thousands of career civil servants with influence over policy who enjoy job protections under federal law would become at-will employees once they're reassigned as Schedule F, leaving them to serve at the pleasure of the president. Under a normal president, conservatives might find that something to cheer about. The whole problem with government workers is that they're less accountable than those in the private sector, right?\n\nBut Trump isn't a normal politician. Schedule F is his way of laying the groundwork for a political purge of the executive branch , replacing career government officials with MAGA fanatics. Which would be alarming under any circumstances, but seems a little more than alarming when we're not two years removed from him attempting a coup.\n\nIf he and his team are willing to purge rank-and-file federal employees, it's a cinch that they'll be thinking big for his next Cabinet too. No more James Mattises and Rex Tillersons. The next Cabinet will be all velociraptors-a Cabinet of spite, in Haberman's words.\n\nAnd if the Senate won't play ball with him on that, he'll just have to work around them. One expert offered a grim preview to the Washington Post of the future of the advice-and-consent power in a Trump second term. \"If the president decides they're going to install a secretary of defense that isn't actually confirmed, and Congress isn't going to try to respond with their powers [of the purse] and try to stop that, I think the reality is that there's not much that you can do,\" he said.\n\nHere's a scenario for you. Imagine that Trump invites Marjorie Taylor Greene to be chief of staff to his new attorney general, some respectable establishment figure who's duly confirmed by the Senate. Now imagine that Trump fires that person after 90 days and elevates Greene to acting AG. How long can she serve in that role lawfully under the Whitaker strategy?\n\nUnder the Vacancies Reform Act , I'm ... not sure. Neither are most judges, I'm guessing. But by the terms of the statute itself, conceivably she could go on for well more than 210 days. Under one section , once the president nominates a permanent replacement for a vacancy, the acting director can go on serving beyond the 210 days until the Senate acts on the nomination. If it rejects the nominee, the acting director gets another 210 days from the date of the rejection. If the president offers a second nomination and the Senate rejects that too, the acting director gets another 210 days from the date of that rejection. It's unclear what would happen with a third nomination.\n\nConceivably, though, so long as Trump is willing to nominate ridiculous figures destined to be rejected by the Senate-Sidney Powell, say, or Mike Lindell-then AG MTG would remain in place.\n\nOr, instead of the Whitaker strategy, maybe he'll prefer the Cuccinelli strategy. Instead of pre-positioning Greene in an agency by giving her a subordinate job with an eye to making her acting director, he could simply force a vacancy at the top and then create a position of \"principal deputy director\" for her, vaulting her into the job.\n\nMaybe the courts would block that. Maybe they wouldn't.\n\nThe only way to deter Trump from staffing up with acting directors is for judges to do what they did with Wolf and Cuccinelli and rule that their official acts have no force of law because they were never lawfully appointed. It would be senseless for Trump to flout statutes in order to appoint yes-men if doing so means that his policies get systematically unwound in court. But it's also easy to imagine how the judiciary might get nervous and gun-shy about nullifying all acts of an improperly appointed official.\n\nFor instance, if Attorney General Greene is deemed to have been appointed illegitimately, would that mean every federal defendant convicted during her term in office must go free? If Defense Secretary Greene carries out the president's order to deploy the military somewhere, is every soldier in the field acting on illegal orders? Is the entire operation illegal?\n\nTrump being Trump, he'll do what he wants to do and dare the courts to stop him. And if they try, he'll blame them for the legal mess he made.\n\nThere are things Congress could have and should have done to address all of this but they were too busy obsessing over doomed \"messaging bills\" like H.R. 1 and codifying Roe v. Wade to worry about it, it seems. It's nothing less than dereliction of duty, civic malpractice. We're going to pay a price.\n\nNick Catoggio is a staff writer at The Dispatch and is based in Texas.

      "text": "Fact Checking a Marjorie Taylor Greene Tweet About COVID Vaccine Claims\n\nHer claim about vaccine-related deaths is misleading and a statement that Joe Biden 'is going to homes' is false.\n\nOn July 11, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican congresswoman from Georgia and a supporter of Donald Trump, tweeted that \"[T]thousands of people are reporting very serious life changing vaccine side effects from taking covid vaccines.\" She further claimed that the CDC reported \"5,946 deaths\" from the vaccine and that President Joe Biden is \"going to homes to push shots.\"\n\nThousands of people are reporting very serious life changing vaccine side effects from taking covid vaccines.\n\n5,946 deaths are reported on the CDC website.\n\nSocial media is censoring their stories & the media is silent.\n\nBiden is going to homes to push shots.\n\nJust say NO!\n\n- Marjorie Taylor Greene 🇺🇸 (@mtgreenee) July 11, 2021\n\nMany of the claims in the widely shared tweet are false or misleading.\n\nTo start, while it's true that according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) , the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System database (VAERS) \"received 5,946 reports of death (0.0018%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine,\" this doesn't mean the vaccine was the cause. Per the CDC , health care workers are required to report any death after any COVID-19 vaccination, even if the cause of death is unclear:\n\n\"FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it's unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.\"\n\nFurthermore, as noted in an earlier fact check , VAERS data includes information submitted by the public that is both unvetted and unverified. Included on the VAERS website is a disclaimer that says: \"VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The report may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable.\"\n\nThe Dispatch Fact Check 's Alec Dent also explained that: \"the reports filed through VAERS are not indicative of actual vaccine side effects, they're simply used as a jumping off point for investigating possible adverse effects. It may turn out that a previously unknown adverse effect is tied to the vaccine in question, though the reported adverse event may turn out to be entirely unrelated to the vaccine. It's also entirely possible for false reports to be filed with VAERS- Vice shared the story of anesthesiologist James Laidler, who filed a VAERS report claiming a flu shot turned him into the Hulk. Laidler did so to show why unverified reports in VAERS should be taken with a grain of salt.\"\n\nGreene's comment about Biden \"going to homes to push shots\" is also missing context. On July 6, at a press briefing on the COVID-19 response and vaccination program, Biden did say that: \"[N]ow we need to go to community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door - literally knocking on doors - to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus.\"\n\nDuring a press briefing on July 8, though, White House press secretary Jen Psaki clarified that members of the government will not be knocking on people's doors to inquire about vaccinations: \"These are grassroots voices across the country. They are not members of the government, they are not federal government employees,they are volunteers, they are clergy, they are trusted voices in communities that are playing this role and door-knocking.\"\n\nPsaki further emphasized that the federal government does not keep track of who has or has not gotten vaccinated: \"the federal government does not have a database of who's been vaccinated. That is not our role. We don't maintain a database along those lines and we have no plans to.\"\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.

How's that for an election-year bumper sticker for a party that will soon enjoy a one-vote House majority ?\n\nIt's hard to find something new and interesting to say about the state of the House GOP, particularly if you write a daily newsletter about the foibles of populism . The dysfunction had already reached historic levels by the close of business on day one of this congressional term last year before descending into truly unprecedented misery nine months later. We've all gotten used to it. Nowadays, when some House Republican calls for upwards of half of his GOP colleagues to lose their next elections , no one blinks.\n\nEven so: Do you realize just how bad things have gotten lately?\n\nFor instance, this bon mot from a certain ex-member with lots of allies in the conference circulated widely on social media on Wednesday.\n\nKevin McCarthy refers to Matt Gaetz:\n\n\"I'll give you the truth why I'm not speaker.

I don't know.\"\n\n- via @MoElleithee @GUPolitics pic.twitter.com/DFZxpdgxF9\n\n- Howard Mortman (@HowardMortman) April 10, 2024\n\nElsewhere, some Republicans have moved past merely hoping that their colleagues will be primaried and opted to actively participate in the effort to see them defeated. Matt Gaetz recently rallied Republican voters against Mike Bost of Illinois and Tony Gonzales of Texas, while in Virginia a number of House GOPers have backed an effort to oust Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good.\n\n\"Bob Good didn't come here to govern. He came here to be famous,\" Derrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican, told CNN . \"Bob Good's wearing our jersey, and he's not on the team.\" A defiant Good hit back. \"They've never heard of Derrick Van Orden,\" he said of his constituents. \"They could care less what Derrick Van Orden thinks.\"\n\nMind you, all of that came after Speaker Mike Johnson warned his members not to campaign against each other .\n\nThe starkest ugliness between members has played out on the subject of Ukraine, though. In the past week, two different Republican committee chairmen have charged elements of their own party with being useful idiots for Moscow. Russian propaganda has \"infected a good chunk of my party's base,\" Rep. Michael McCaul-chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee- claimed , pointing to right-wing media. Asked about McCaul's assessment, Intelligence Committee Chair Michael Turner pronounced it \"absolutely true\" and added, darkly, that some of that propaganda has even been \"uttered on the House floor.\"\n\nHe didn't name any names, but he didn't have to:\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene once again does Putin's bidding:\n\n\"This is a war on Christianity. The Ukrainian government is attacking Christians...Russia is not doing that. They are not attacking Christianity. As a matter of fact, they seem to be protecting it.\" pic.twitter.com/QEMYN1BLDn\n\n- Republican Voters Against Trump (@AccountableGOP) April 8, 2024\n\nCongressional conferences will quarrel internally from time to time. But accusing ostensible political allies of being dupes for Russian fascists or enemies of Christianity is the sort of bristling cutthroat animosity usually limited to knife fights between the parties, not between factions of the same one.\n\nIt's a new level of dysfunction. At the heart of it sit Mike Johnson and Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nEvery successful revolutionary movement eventually splits. One wing, the pragmatists, begins to compromise on revolutionary ideals as it confronts the realities of governing. The other, the purists, clings to those ideals and inevitably accuses the pragmatists of having betrayed the cause by moderating.\n\nMike Johnson is a pragmatist; Marjorie Taylor Greene is a purist.\n\nBut it's not that simple. The MAGA revolution is also complicated by the fact that it's never been fully clear what it's \"about.\" What would it even mean to betray the \"MAGA cause\"? What is that cause?\n\nThere is some ideological content to Donald Trump's politics. If MAGA means anything, it means sealing the border and preventing undesirables from, ahem, poisoning the blood . (Immigrants from \"nice\" countries are free to poison, of course.) There's lots of argle-bargle about \"draining the swamp\" too, although in practice \"the swamp\" has never meant much more than \"anyone who disagrees with the right generally and Trump specifically.\"\n\nAs we were reminded fewer than 72 hours ago , Trump can be maddeningly hard to pin down on most matters of policy. Even on the hot-button subject of Ukraine, he's never been so bold as to call for defunding the war effort. His big idea of late has been to package any new military aid as a loan, not a gift -as though the Ukrainians will ever conceivably have the means to repay it.\n\nThe thinness of Trump's agenda has left the nature of his movement subject to debate. He's a populist and a nationalist broadly speaking, sure, but at base Trump's revolution is about Trump: The narcissistic black hole around which the Republican Party now orbits means that members' highest duty is to support his attempts to gain and keep power for himself. Everything beyond that- abortion , foreign alliances, government spending, and so on-may or may not truly be part of \"the cause\" depending on your point of view.\n\nWhile it's clear that Trump would prefer a post-liberal form of government for America in the abstract, it's also clear that his own aggrandizement takes precedence. Given a choice between a populist, authoritarian executive branch led by Ron DeSantis and a traditional executive branch constrained by classic civic norms led by himself, is there even a faint doubt as to which he would choose?\n\nBecause Trump's movement is thin on policy and thick on \"loyalty,\" I think Mike Johnson and Marjorie Taylor Greene have different understandings of what the \"MAGA revolution\" requires of them in keeping with their pragmatic and purist sensibilities, respectively. They represent what we might call the two MAGAs. And, as tends to happen when revolutions fracture, one of them now wants to kill the other.\n\nProfessionally , I mean, not literally. This isn't Russia. Sorry, Marjorie.\n\nJohnson is an unlikely revolutionary figure. He's soft-spoken, buttoned-up, and has traditionally taken a hard line on socially conservative policies , an awkward fit for Trump's post-Christian GOP. But he also played a key role in Trump's scheme to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's victory in 2020. He may not look MAGA, but abetting a coup plot is pretty darned MAGA.\n\nGreene is more recognizably revolutionary. She's a kook of long standing, enough so to have treated this week's solar eclipse and the recent earthquake in New York City as evidence that God wants America to repent. She has a taste for violent political fantasies and an appetite for political purges: After Trump won the New Hampshire primary in February, effectively clinching the Republican nomination, it was Greene who crowed about \" eradicating \" right-wingers who don't share his agenda from the party.\n\nShe and Johnson are each loyal Trump toadies, as all proper MAGA revolutionaries must be. But Greene seems to believe that the revolution has a distinct, robust post-liberal policy program, one that begins with not undermining international authoritarian hero Vladimir Putin. Johnson, on the other hand, seems to believe that the revolution requires him to serve Donald Trump's quest for power-but not much beyond that, leaving him free to go his own way on policy.\n\nTheir respective roles within the House conference suit their different interpretations of the revolution. Johnson, the pragmatist with the gavel, worries that unpopular policies and ongoing dysfunction might damage the GOP's chances of holding onto its majority in November. He urged Greene and her sympathizers on Wednesday to accept the \"reality\" that governing with a tiny majority means Republicans can't impose their will on legislation.\n\nGreene, the purist, seems to believe that failing to impose one's will legislatively derives at best from a lack of nerve and at worst from secret establishmentarian sympathies hidden behind defeatist mutterings about \"reality.\" She doesn't worry about governing or protecting a fragile majority, especially now that her friend and patron Kevin McCarthy is out of power. She can be a revolutionary in full, raging against a corrupt leadership as though she were a member of the House minority. Perhaps, quietly, she hopes her party will be back in the minority in the next Congress, as that would suit her \"outsider\" orientation.\n\nIn fairness to her, there is reason to think Mike Johnson is more of a closet establishmentarian than he lets on.\n\nConsider this: In his six months as speaker, how many times has he taken a stance on a major policy that's aligned him with Greene's post-liberal purist MAGA faction? They're both revolutionaries; one would think he'd be pretty radical in his preferences, if not quite as radical as her. Having replaced squishy establishmentarian Kevin McCarthy in the top spot, he seemed poised to steer the Republican conference in a hard-right nationalist direction. Has he?\n\nWith one important exception, not at all. Johnson has been every bit the governing moderate that McCarthy was.\n\nHe averted a government shutdown by passing a funding bill that more than half of his own conference opposed . He backed another bill to ban TikTok from American app stores unless and until it's sold to a U.S. company, knowing that Trump was against it . This week he's lobbying his members to reauthorize the law that permits warrantless surveillance overseas (with little success thus far ), again despite opposition from Trump. And as icing on the cake, he's reportedly planning to put something on the floor next week that will provide new funding for Ukraine , a red line for the GOP's many Russia simps.\n\nUnder his leadership, the current \"Republican majority\" has functioned more like a bipartisan coalition with Democrats supplying most of the votes . That doesn't reek of \"burn it all down\" revolutionary fervor.\n\nThe one important exception when Johnson put aside his pragmatist leanings and went to the mat for some MAGA priority came when he declared the Senate's immigration compromise dead on arrival in the House . Which makes sense: If, as I've said, border enforcement accounts for most of the policy energy in Trump's revolution then Johnson truly couldn't have backed the Senate bill-or any immigration bill that failed to meet every last Republican demand -without \"betraying the cause.\"\n\nBut it makes sense for another reason. Trump strongly opposed that immigration bill , fearing that it might meaningfully reduce border traffic and boost public support for Joe Biden before Election Day, ensuring Trump's defeat. Because Johnson believes that the MAGA revolution requires him to help Trump gain power, he was therefore obliged to block that bill just as surely as he was obliged to assist Trump's coup plot before January 6.\n\nAs a further case in point, I laughed aloud when this news bulletin flashed across Twitter while I was writing this newsletter:\n\nNEWS w/ @KristenhCNN :  Speaker Mike Johnson is making plans to deliver a joint press conference with Donald Trump  at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, focused on \"election integrity,\" per sources.\n\nPlans still fluid, but comes as Johnson is facing a threat to his speakership from MTG.\n\n- Melanie Zanona (@MZanona) April 10, 2024\n\nOnce again, Mike Johnson is fulfilling his revolutionary duty to abet Donald Trump's quest for power by hook or by crook, in this case seeding doubt about the legitimacy of the coming election the same way he did the last one. But that's all that the revolution demands of him, in his view; in exchange for supporting Trump's electoral gambits, he's expecting Trump to give him and the House Republican conference a wide berth in taking conventional positions on matters like TikTok, foreign surveillance, and Ukraine.\n\nGreene believes the revolution requires more of her, and of him. \"The funding of Ukraine must end,\" she said on Wednesday following a long meeting with Johnson as her procedural sword of Damocles dangles over his head.\n\nTwo MAGAs, one purist and the other more pragmatic. How does this revolutionary disagreement end?\n\nIn the short term, it's likely to end the way most internal political disputes end. It'll get papered over.\n\nTrump's \"states' rights\" abortion gambit seems well suited to bring the two revolutionary factions together. MAGA purists don't care much about abortion on the merits; their illiberal passions lie in more tribal aspects of the culture war, as Kari Lake's sudden turnabout on federal abortion restrictions this week made clear. Wherever Marjorie Taylor Greene lands with respect to Trump's new policy, I promise his position won't trouble her the way him siding with Ukraine against Russia would. She'll accommodate him.\n\nMAGA pragmatists like Johnson, meanwhile, will be forced to reckon with the fact that Trump's abortion position is plainly designed to maximize his chances of regaining the presidency. A committed pro-lifer like the speaker might be grieved by the thought of forfeiting a chance to limit abortion nationally, but his revolutionary duty is what it is. When Trump's electoral needs conflict with pragmatism on policy, as they did with the Senate immigration compromise, then policy must yield. Johnson will accommodate him too.\n\nThe revolutionary picture is cloudier long-term for the simple reason that Donald Trump's quest for power will end one way or another on November 5. Either he'll win reelection and be term-limited ( hopefully ) or he'll lose again and retire ( hopefully ). If he wins, his desires will largely dictate the policy preferences of congressional Republicans for the next four years. Pragmatists and purists may be unhappy with some of those positions for electoral or ideological reasons, respectively, but no one's going to betray the revolution by breaking sharply with its leader.\n\nWhat if Trump loses, though, and starts to fade as a political force at long last?\n\nIt's possible the two factions would do what revolutionaries usually do amid a power vacuum, indulging in vicious recriminations and jockeying for primacy in leading the movement forward. The pragmatists would have an advantage in that case, as House Republicans who have never fully warmed to Trump's movement would doubtless prefer to be led by a Mike Johnson than by a Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nThe House GOP conference could even splinter amid a \"Trump hangover.\" Those who never quite shed their conservative sympathies might seek to revert to Reaganism; diehard revolutionaries like Greene would double down on Trumpism or an even more morally loathsome form of nationalism ; others would grope toward a reformist \"post-Trumpism\" that continues to prioritize culture-war battles but with less hugging of autocrats , threatening of judges , and saluting of insurrectionists .\n\nLeft to their devices, I think that's what Republicans would do. The two MAGAs would become three or possibly more distinct parties in microcosm, insofar as they aren't already. The diehards would probably end up marginalized due to the nascent desire among the great majority of their colleagues for a less chaotic GOP.\n\nBut if there's one organizing theme of this relentlessly pessimistic newsletter, it's that the Republican Party's journey into illiberalism is driven from the bottom up, not the top down .\n\nThe \"Trump problem\" will end sooner or later but the true problem could drag on for decades. So long as most House districts are ruthlessly gerrymandered, so long as populist right-wing media feeds the grassroots appetite for illiberalism, the electoral pressure on House Republicans will point them toward revolutionary purification.\n\nThat will lead to many more years out of power than a more pragmatic approach to politics might deliver, but oh well. Revolutions are much more romantic-and fun to participate in-when they're tearing down the system instead of running it.\n\nNick Catoggio is a staff writer at The Dispatch and is based in Texas.

      "text": "Running on the Boring Flank Against Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nJennifer Strahan campaigns to unseat the controversial lawmaker on a platform of competence over celebrity.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, freshman congresswoman from Georgia, occupies a unique position in Republican politics. Outside the Capitol, she's arguably one of the nation's most prominent Republicans: a rabid ally of former president Donald Trump, a star of the right-wing media circuit, a figure whose endorsement has been sought nationwide by aspiring politicos trying to burnish their own MAGA-mania bona fides. Inside the building, meanwhile, there's arguably not a single representative with less actual power: She sits on no committees , and her history of conspiracy theories , promotion of violence , and bizarre antics around the House have left her without legislative allies beyond her fellow rabble-rousers in the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nIt's the former element-her right-wing notoriety-that's led many to assume Greene will cruise to reelection this year in Georgia's 14th District, which remains heavily Republican despite recent redistricting. But the latter element may end up causing her trouble in her primary-where another Republican, Jennifer Strahan, is mounting a surprisingly strong challenge.\n\nIt's the first foray into politics for Strahan, a Cobb County resident who since 2017 has run a health care consulting business that contracts with hospitals and health systems. She launched her congressional bid last September, earning some attention in conservative media . But her campaign really entered the spotlight last month after Greene spoke at a conference helmed by white nationalist livestreamer Nick Fuentes in Florida. The move earned swift denunciations from a chorus of elected Republicans and figures in conservative media, many of whom put forward Strahan's name as the likeliest candidate to upset her; Erick Erickson, the prominent Georgia-based conservative radio host, dubbed her \"Marjorie with a brain.\"\n\nStrahan herself denounced Greene's appearance at the conference in a statement: \"Aligning herself with the statements made by Mr. Fuentes and his organization is incredibly sad, but not surprising. Rep. Greene has continually shown us this is who she is and what she stands for. ... Georgia's 14th Congressional District and its constituents are not represented by her.\"\n\nFor the most part, however, Strahan steers clear of dwelling on Greene's wilder moments. In a campaign video released last September, she introduced herself as a \"small business owner, a Christian, a wife, a mother ... and a no-nonsense conservative\" who is \"not a politician or a celebrity.\"\n\nLots of would-be politicians are eager to note that they're not politicians, of course, but for Strahan it's that last bit that forms the centerpiece of her pitch to voters in her district. She's not trying to unseat Greene by running to her middle, or even by trying to convince voters that Greene is on a political fringe. In fact, asked whether there were any places in which she disagreed with Greene on policy, Strahan demurred: \"I mean, we're running in a Republican primary, right? I'm conservative. I think there is no doubt that there is a lot of overlap between, you know, our beliefs. I think the core differentiation is effectiveness.\"\n\nEffectiveness rather than celebrity-that's the pitch. It isn't just that Marjorie Taylor Greene has a knack for attracting controversy, Strahan argues-it's that her attention-seeking comes at the expense of the nitty-gritty work of actually representing her district, from relatively boring committee work to basic constituent services.\n\n\"Representative Greene is literally throwing more bombs on the Republican side than she is on the Democrat side,\" Strahan said. \"That's a problem. We have very progressive agenda items that are being pushed down. We are seeing those policies come through. She's not stopping them, right? She's not on committees. We've got an administration that is infringing on our constitutional freedoms, we have significant problems across our country, and we need a serious representative who's willing to stand up and fight for our values and our beliefs.\"\n\nIt's not exactly a message calibrated to make Greene's biggest national detractors stand up and cheer, of course. But it might be the one likeliest to make Strahan immune to Greene's likely return punch-that, like the rest of Greene's right-wing critics, she's simply a RINO who's making common cause with Democrats, journalists, Communists, and other enemies of America.\n\nGreene's spokesman Nick Dyer disputed the notion that not being on committees has prevented Greene from working against progressive legislation, pointing to Greene's move last March to force a roll-call vote on an amendment to a voting bill restoring voting rights to felons that had passed on the floor via voice vote. \"Congresswoman Greene, precisely because she wasn't burdened with committees, was able to camp out on the House floor and stop this piece of Communist legislation,\" Dyer told The Dispatch .\n\n\"My impression is [Strahan] is focusing on the district and, you know, having a very clear contrast that 'I'm going to be a substantive workhorse, not a show horse,\" one former Republican congresswoman told The Dispatch. \"[Greene] is just becoming a tiresome embarrassment. And when you know you can get a normal conservative Republican ... It shouldn't be a Trump/anti-Trump sort of battle there. What it really is is, you know, you're just an embarrassment to the state.\"\n\nIn our conversation, Strahan described her decision to get involved in politics in religious terms: \"I am a Christian, evangelical Christian, really believe in everything I do I want to be in the will of God. And just started feeling a pull to do more in my relationship with God. And then eventually just started feeling direction specifically to politics. And so that kind of slowly evolved-last summer I started really investigating this pathway and God just opened up the right doors, and here we are.\"\n\nWould it still have been that way if she'd been happy with the performance of the incumbent? \"I can't speculate on what the world would've, should've, could've looked like. But I can tell you that I felt a personal calling, a personal pull to run.\"\n\nOn the issues, Strahan hews close to what you might call the traditionalist wing of Trump's Republican Party-someone who talks about supporting the MAGA agenda using the vocabulary of shrinking the government and promoting free markets.\n\nOn Russia's recent attack against Ukraine: \"It's an attack on democracy, it's an attack on humanity, and literally killing thousands of people ... This is why it's so important to have a strong leader in the White House, this is why it's important to maintain the U.S. as a global superpower and that our adversaries recognize who we are and what we stand for.\"\n\nOn some Republicans' recent flirtation with tax-and-spend policies like an expanded child tax allowance: \"I think more government's never the answer ... I think we do need to support families, I think we do need to support people getting back to work, but I don't think you do that through government handouts.\"\n\nOne substantial difference between Strahan and Greene emerged over the course of our conversation, but I had to go digging for it. Greene has long been a proponent of Trump-style conspiracies about the 2020 election. \"I know we're not a blue state,\" she said on One America News the day before Biden's inauguration last year. \"I know for a fact that President Trump won here in Georgia. I feel it 1,000 percent.\"\n\nBy contrast, Strahan didn't seem eager to enter the minefield of 2020 discussion at all. \"I think we had, as has been proven, we had a lot of issues in our election, right? That's not uncommon. Anytime you have a system that large, you're gonna have problems in process. And that is critical for us to address. ... There's a lot of mistrust in our system today across the board from individuals.\"\n\nStrahan then pivoted to talk about the importance of getting out the Republican vote and passing policies like voter ID requirements. Pressed as to whether Georgia's Republican officials had carried out a fair election with reliable results in 2020, she said only: \"Again, I think we had issues, but I do believe that Joe Biden is our current president. I'm not happy with him, his agenda and the policies he's pushing out, I'm as upset as everyone else. But I think the way we combat that is we address the problems, which we're starting to do-we're seeing that with Georgia-and we get out and vote.\"\n\nLeave aside for now the unpleasant fact that saying \"the 2020 vote was reliably counted\" apparently remains a third rail in Republican primary politics. Could Strahan win?\n\nThere's no question it's an uphill climb. Exploitable weakness or not, one thing national celebrity unquestionably does for a politician is help build a war chest; over the course of 2021, Greene's campaign pulled in about $7 million in donations, ending with roughly half that still on hand. That notoriety was a fundraising bonanza for Greene's opponents, too-on the other side of the aisle. \"All but a small share of that loot [$6.5 million] was raised by Democrats, who have very little chance of winning in one of the reddest districts anywhere,\" Intelligencer reported this week . \"And the Republican with the best chance of unseating Greene in the GOP primary barely has two dimes to run together.\" (Strahan's campaign says its fundraising fortunes have improved since 2021, which it ended with about $60,000 cash on hand, but did not provide specific numbers.)\n\nAs it happens, there's one recent example of a pitch like Strahan's working in a Republican primary: In 2020, Iowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra toppled incumbent Rep. Steve King, who had recently been stripped of his own committee assignments after wondering aloud to a reporter when language of \"white nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization\" had become \"offensive.\" In his campaign, Feenstra focused not on King's past incendiary comments but on the inability of a marooned and ostracized lawmaker to capably serve his district. But Feenstra also enjoyed other advantages: He outraised King heavily, for one, and was endorsed by a number of prominent Republican groups.\n\nThen again, at that time King had been a fixture of Iowa politics for decades, whereas Greene has represented her district for only two years.\n\nIn a January poll of 450 GOP primary voters in the district done by a Republican group and obtained by Jewish Insider , only 30 percent said they'd support Strahan if the election were held that day, while 60 percent said they'd back Greene. But the poll found that comfortable margin shrank to a statistical tie after pollsters mentioned some of Greene's past controversial comments. A Republican consultant told Jewish Insider the poll had been commissioned by \"a group of Georgia Republicans who want to show\" the possibility of a conservative alternative to Greene.\n\nOf course, that's the puzzle Strahan needs to solve-plenty of Republican voters don't agree with Greene's most out-there beliefs and statements, but to accuse a fellow Republican of making bigoted remarks is to trigger immediate suspicion in the contemporary conservative id that you're going along with Democrat/media smears-a RINO move if ever there was one. Which brings us back again to the elevator pitch of competence over celebrity. We'll find out how strong a market there is for it on May 24.\n\nAndrew Egger is a former associate editor for The Dispatch.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "Cold Cash Comfort for Democrats in 2024\n\nPlus: Will two unpopular presidential candidates dampen voter turnout?\n\nHappy Friday! Capitol Hill is experiencing its own March Madness , with Congress struggling to pass a funding agreement to avoid a government shutdown tonight. And as we were putting the finishing touches to this newsletter, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to vacate the chair -a procedural move to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson. It won't be privileged, so the House won't take up the motion immediately, but still: madness!\n\nIf you're a Democrat, it's tough to find positive signs ahead of the 2024 elections. President Joe Biden's approval rating is at historic lows for an incumbent, and Donald Trump leads him in several credible polls . The party has difficult seats to defend in the Senate and no great opportunities for pick-ups. Despite the narrow Republican majority in the House, Democrats are feeling grim about their ability to win back control there.\n\n\"We're gonna be running this election like we're behind in every way, including financially,\" Pat Dennis, the president of the Democratic rapid-response organization American Bridge, told The Dispatch .\n\nDespite Dennis' comments, Democrats have a major advantage in one key area: cold, hard cash. From the presidential race to the various super PACs on the left, Democrats are starting the general election season with more money than their Republican counterparts. They're cautious about assuming their financial advantage will translate to victory up and down the ballot, and it's possible that Republican fundraising can catch up. But the cash advantage is stark.\n\nBiden's campaign reported this week it had $71 million of cash on hand through the month of February, double the $33.3 million the Trump campaign reported having at the same time. And while both nominees' joint fundraising committees won't report their latest numbers to the Federal Election Commission until next month, the total advantage Biden has when factoring in these supportive groups, such as the Democratic and Republican national committees, is even more impressive. Including that $71 million, Biden and these coordinating groups say they have $155 million total. Trump has just recently set up his own joint fundraising committee, and between his campaign, the cash-strapped RNC, and his supportive super PACs, has just $42 million in cash on hand.\n\nBiden's authorized super PAC, Future Forward, reported starting the year with nearly $24 million cash on hand. The comparable groups supporting Trump are struggling to compete. Save America, the pro-Trump super PAC, reported having just over $4 million in cash on hand at the end of February. The group actually spent more than $5.6 million on legal fees to firms working for Trump's legal defense in multiple civil and criminal cases, which was more than the $5 million it received in February as a transfer from another pro-Trump super PAC, Make America Great Again Inc. The group itself reported $19 million in cash on hand through the end of January. According to the Associated Press , money donated to the new Trump joint fundraising agreement will be directed toward the Trump campaign and Save America before heading to the RNC.\n\nWith such advantages, the collective spending power of the pro-Biden and liberal independent expenditure groups promises to be staggering, with the New York Times reporting that several organizations have pledged political programs-ad spending, organizing, and get-out-the-vote programs-to boost Democrats that total up to $1 billion. That includes $120 million from the League of Conservation Voters; $250 million in reserved ad buys from Future Forward; $200 million from the Service Employees International Union; $239 million in ad reservations from Senate Majority PAC; and $150 million from American Bridge.\n\nEven smaller groups are promising massive budgets on campaign activities. Last month VoteVets, a liberal organization focusing on military veterans, announced a $45 million program for 2024, while the pro-Biden group Republican Voters Against Trump plans to spend $50 million on ads convincing Republican leaners to vote for the Democrat.\n\nThere are benefits to having the cash advantage now, including better rates for TV ad time. Groups that can reserve their time now won't have to spend as much as those buying up ad time later. If conservative megadonors come in later to support pro-Republican super PACs, they'll be getting less bang for their buck.\n\nSo far, there's been no indication of a commensurate united effort on the right, and some of the most powerful groups that helped turn out elements of the GOP coalition in election years past likely will play diminished roles.\n\nThe political network associated with billionaires Charles Koch and his late brother David, for example, is continuing to take the measured approach to campaign spending that it has employed since Trump first won the Republican nomination in 2016. The Koch-affiliated Americans for Prosperity, which had supported Nikki Haley's bid, has announced some targeted spending on behalf of Republican Senate candidates in Pennsylvania and Nevada. But the $1.5 million total in ad reservations so far pales in comparison to the $122 million the group spent in the 2012 presidential election cycle, a monumental figure for the time. And the National Rifle Association's political arm, once a pro-Republican force that spent $50 million in the 2016 election cycle, had just $11 million in cash on hand at the end of February.\n\nSome on the pro-Biden side say the current money disparity reflects a fundamental problem GOP donors have with the man at the top of the ticket.\n\n\"Donors know that Joe Biden is running to be president and that Donald Trump is running to stay out of jail,\" said Sarah Longwell, who runs Republican Voters Against Trump. \"Republican donors just don't seem that interested in paying Trump's legal bills.\"\n\nWith the rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump that American voters are dreading now firmly underway, campaign pollsters are searching for signs that participation in the November election is poised for a nosedive. So far, they can't find any.\n\nThe 2020 contest that saw Biden oust Trump tallied nearly 158.5 million votes for president nationwide out of almost 159.8 million total ballots cast. Those numbers equaled roughly 66 percent of eligible voters, the highest turnout for a national election in 120 years, according to the Pew Research Center. The question is whether those statistics, or anything close to them, can possibly sustain this fall amid the Biden-Trump sequel a majority of voters insist they don't want.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the answer less than eight months before Election Day is: quite possibly.\n\n\"I have seen no evidence in the data thus far that turnout will be diminished in any statistically meaningful way because of dislike for the two candidates,\" a Republican pollster with clients on the 2024 ballot told Dispatch Politics . \"My expectation is that turnout among Democrats and Republicans will not be down because partisan voters will be motivated more by hatred of the other candidate, which will keep even reluctant partisan Trump and Biden partisans engaged.\"\n\n\"I have never seen more hatred for the other party's candidate than we see right now,\" the GOP pollster added. Democratic pollsters are, similarly, failing to find any data that suggests a significant percentage of voters will sit on their hands on November 5. \"I don't assume that high levels of dissatisfaction with candidates will equal low overall turnout at this point,\" one of them told us.\n\nThe pollsters interviewed for this story requested anonymity to speak candidly out of concern about how their comments might reflect on their clients.\n\nFor the past several months, poll after poll has revealed voters were unhappy with the prospect of a Biden-Trump rematch that finally kicked off following the March 5, Super Tuesday primaries.\n\nBut it's not just the do-over aspect of the 2020 campaign that is leaving voters dissatisfied. They also disapprove of the Democratic and Republican nominees on an individual basis-considerably. Take Biden: His job approval rating is stuck at 40.3 percent and his personal favorability rating-a quality that is supposed to be his strong suit, is just as bad . Trump is doing only slightly better . Yet the political atmosphere may conspire to spike turnout levels for the fourth consecutive federal election.\n\nIn particular, said a second Republican pollster we spoke with, voters broadly are viewing the upcoming presidential contest as consequential. Indeed, this pollster explained that \"in spite of the fact that about 12 percent to 15 percent [of likely voters] hate both candidates, the sense of importance about this election remains very high.\" That view, that participating in the 2024 election matters, is the case \"even among the double haters.\"\n\nThis GOP pollster, one of about 20 who recently took part in a polling summit convened by the National Republican Congressional Committee, said none in the group \"has seen any evidence of decreased turnout, yet.\"\n\nSome Republican pollsters believe such evidence is unlikely to show up in future surveys because of high levels of negative partisanship-overwhelming opposition to Biden by Republicans and opposition to Trump by Democrats-and the proliferation of early in-person and mail-in voting that give campaigns several weeks before Election Day to badger voters into pulling the proverbial lever. But given the circumstances, they remain on high alert for this phenomenon to take hold.\n\nIt's too early to know for sure how voters are going to feel about their choices after Labor Day, when they typically begin paying closer attention. That's especially the case among independent voters, less likely to be compelled to support a candidate they don't like.\n\n\"Common sense would say to expect it,\" a Republican strategist said. \"But both sides are pretty motivated and we have been running generally unpopular picks for at least the last three cycles with the last two setting turnout records.\"\n\n\"If Donald Trump put up these kinds of numbers on The Apprentice , he'd fire himself.\"\n\n-Biden reelection campaign communications director Michael Tyler in a statement in response to Trump's fundraising numbers, March 21, 2024\n\nDavid M.

Marjorie Taylor Greene on Monday demanded that NPR and PBS bigs appear before her House DOGE subcommittee to field questions about their \"systemically biased content.\"\n\nThe Republican congresswoman, 50, highlighted the hefty federal funding that the two alleged liberal media outlets receive and groused about their coverage of various hot-button political flashpoints.\n\n\"This kind of one-sided reporting, which attacks over half the country to protect and promote its own political interests, doesn't deserve a single cent of American taxpayers' money,\" Greene wrote on X .\n\n\"I look forward to bringing the president of each of these so-called 'media' outlets before my brand-new DOGE Subcommittee to explain to me - and to the American people - why they deserve to continue receiving public funding,\" she said of a planned meeting next month.\n\nFederal funding for NPR and PBS largely goes through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is poised to receive $535 million from the government in fiscal year 2025, according to its budget .\n\nNPR estimates that around 1% of its budget comes from the federal funding it receives from CPB and other government entities.\n\nBut in reality, the actual funding is likely larger because NPR also gets money from local radio stations that receive Uncle Sam's backing and are often required to use a portion of their CPB funding to license public radio programs.\n\nSome estimates peg the real amount  of NPR funding coming from the feds at around 17%.\n\nNPR signaled a willingness to comply with Greene's demands.\n\n\"We welcome the opportunity to discuss the critical role of public media in delivering impartial, fact-based news and reporting to the American public,\" the media outlet told The Post in a statement.\n\n\"We constantly strive to hold ourselves to the highest standards of journalism,\" NPR said.\n\nThe Peach State rep took the outlet to task over its initial refusal to cover the bombshell Hunter Biden laptop story that The Post exposed in October 2020.\n\nShe recounted how NPR correspondent Uri Berliner publicly criticized the outlet over its refusal and claimed, \"There's an unspoken consensus about the stories we should pursue and how they should be framed.\"\n\nBerliner resigned last year in response to criticism he weathered from NPR CEO Katherine Maher. The ordeal triggered an outcry from Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIt is not immediately apparent how much federal funding PBS receives . The CPB doles out about $397 million for TV grants and $132 million for radio.\n\nRepublicans have mused about slashing PBS and NPR funding in the past. Famously during the 2012 presidential contest, then-Republican hopeful Mitt Romney called for cutting PBS' funds.\n\nGreene has taken issue with the outlet's coverage of tech baron Elon Musk's controversial gesture during an indoor festivity at President Trump's inauguration last month.\n\n\"Recently, PBS implied that Mr. Elon Musk made a fascist salute while addressing an inaugural celebration hours after President Donald Trump was sworn into office. The characterization was clearly false,\" Green contended in her letter to the president of PBS.\n\nShe cited the Anti-Defamation League's assessment that Musk did not intentionally make a fascist salute to back up her claim.\n\n\"This sort of bias betrays the principles of objective reporting and undermines public trust. As an organization that receives federal funds through its member stations,\" Greene added.\n\nPBS also indicated in a statement to The Post that it is willing to appear before the panel.\n\n\"PBS and our member stations are grateful to have bipartisan support in Congress, and our country,\" PBS said.\n\n\"We've earned this support from decades of noncommercial and nonpartisan work in local communities: providing all Americans with content they trust; offering a broad range of stories and programs that help citizens understand our past and shape our future; and helping children and families open up worlds of possibilities through educational programming.\n\n\"We appreciate the opportunity to present to the committee how now, more than ever, the service PBS provides matters for our nation.\"\n\nGreen pitched March 3 or March 24 as possible dates for the forthcoming hearing.\n\nHer DOGE subcommittee, which is under the House Oversight Committee, is intended to dovetail with the Department of Government Efficiency in rooting out government bloat and waste.\n\nAdvertisement"

This includes at least nine instances in which she was swatted - meaning that police were dispatched to her home over a bogus call - since she was elected to the lower chamber.Last Christmas, for instance, Greene groused about being swatted, interrupting her family's festivities.\n\nThe threats against Greene come against the backdrop of numerous security scares against members of Congress.\n\nIn September, for example, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) revealed that her office had faced a \"very serious shooting threat.\"\n\nOver Thanksgiving, several House Democrats such as Reps. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) and John Larson (D-Conn.) faced bomb threats directed at their homes. That came on the heels of several of President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet picks, such as US Ambassador to the UN designee Elise Stefanik, EPA director designee Lee Zeldin and Labor Secretary designee Lori Chavez-Deremer, facing threats as well.\n\nGreene is one of the most prominent Republicans in the lower chamber and has at times been a thorn in the side of GOP leadership, though she has recently hinted that she won't get in the way of Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-La.) bid to keep the gavel.\n\n\"I'm so grateful to every member of the Rome Police Department for your swift and professional response in ensuring my safety,\" Greene added in her statement Monday.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene reveals off-ramp she offered House speaker Mike Johnson before failed vote to oust him\n\nFirebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene revealed that she offered Speaker Mike Johnson an off-ramp before she tried to topple him in a failed mutiny.\n\nGreene (R-Ga.) met with Johnson (R-La.) at least twice last week in the run-up to her bid to oust him - a move that would've needed Democrats to side with her in order to succeed.\n\n\"I said, 'Look, if you'll defund [special counsel] Jack Smith, then I'll reconsider this motion,'\" Greene recounted on Fox News ' \"Sunday Morning Futures.\n\n\"This is something the American people are sick and tired of. They're fed up with Republicans that will not defend President Trump.\"\n\nJohnson expressed openness to reforming the rules governing special counsels last week, telling reporters, \"We're looking very intently at it because I think the problem has reached a crescendo.\"\n\nHe later told Politico point blank that he is not prepared to eliminate Smith's job via the appropriations process.\n\n\"That's not something you wave a wand and just eliminate the special counsel as a provision,\" Johnson told the outlet.\n\n\"There is a necessity for a function like that because sometimes the Department of Justice - which is an executive branch agency - can't necessarily, without a conflict of interest, investigate or prosecute the president who's their boss, or the president's family.\"\n\nJohnson doesn't have the authority to unilaterally defund Smith's office. Given Republicans' razor-thin majority in the lower chamber and the Democratic control over the Senate, the GOP lacks the power to defund the special counsel.\n\n\"It is impossible to deny the judicial system in our country has been weaponized against President Trump. I am working with Chairmen Jordan and Comer on measures to rein in the abuses of Special Counsel Jack Smith and hold him accountable,\" Johnson posted on X Sunday.\n\nStay up on the very latest with Evening Update.\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nGreene raged against the speaker's comments to Politico, saying, \"Mike Johnson's owned by the Democrats and that proved me to be right again.\"\n\nPrior to privileging her motion to oust Johnson, Greene publicly revealed her demands of Johnson, which were: to not send war-torn Ukraine any more assistance, defund the special counsel, pass 12 appropriations bills rather than an omnibus, and abide by the Hastert Rule.\n\nThe Hastert Rule is a principle in which leadership won't take up legislation on the House floor without the backing of a Republican majority. Johnson deviated from that when he pushed through the $61 billion Ukraine aid bill - something to which a majority of House Republicans objected.\n\nIronically, Greene's gambit to dethrone Johnson only had a tiny minority of House Republicans behind it. Even Trump opposed her revolt.\n\nHer longstanding threat against Johnson went up in flames last Wednesday in a 359-43 vote, with 196 Republicans and 163 voting to table her motion.\n\nDemocrats indicated they'd toss Johnson a lifeline after he elicited Greene's wrath by taking up Ukraine aid.\n\nShe would've needed Democrats to play ball like they did in the October mutiny against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) - something Greene opposed.\n\n\"I feel like this time the Democrats and the Republicans stuck together and exposed the uni-party like it's never been seen before,\" Greene further chided.\n\nGreene revealed that she spoke with Trump after her ouster bid collapsed and underscored the 45th president's assertion that a motion to vacate the chair may be warranted \"at some point.\n\n\"The most important thing everyone needs to know is that people want a Republican Party that will fight,\" Greene added.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene's lunatic case to oust Speaker Mike Johnson\n\nThe first time Republicans toppled their own speaker during this Congress, it wasn't a particularly edifying spectacle, but Marjorie Taylor Greene is reaching for new lows.\n\nTo paraphrase Marx: First as a farce, then as a more preposterous farce.\n\nGreene made her anti-Mike Johnson case on Tucker Carlson's show last week, and it was - as you'd expect - a stew of conspiratorial thinking and sophomoric ranting.\n\nYou might say the anti-Johnson forces aren't sending their best, but such is the weakness of their case that MTG is the best they've got.\n\nThere's a serious case against funding Ukraine, based on the scarcity of our matériel and the geostrategic preeminence of Asia over Europe, but Greene and her friendly and encouraging interlocutor didn't come within a hundred miles of it.\n\nGreene complained that in the space of a couple months, Johnson has gone from a good Christian conservative to being indistinguishable from Nancy Pelosi.\n\nPut aside the rank and grossly unfair exaggeration; what might have happened to change Johnson's view of his role in Congress?\n\nWould it have something to do with the fact he went from a backbencher with no responsibility to the leader of a narrow, fractious majority that, unless it can show some minimal ability to govern, is headed straight to the political dustbin?\n\nJust asking questions ...\n\nObviously, it's one thing to inveigh against spending deals when what you say or do doesn't matter much; it's another to be the one who has to decide whether to lead your party into a shutdown fight it will definitely lose, blighting its political prospects for no good reason.\n\nSimilarly, Johnson should feel a responsibility to at least get a Ukraine package to a vote.\n\nThere's a bipartisan majority in both chambers of Congress in favor of sending more aid to Ukraine, and Johnson is the one standing in the way.\n\nIf he doesn't move and Ukraine subsequently collapses on the battlefield, he will have played an outsize role in the defeat of an ally at the hands of a US adversary.\n\nThat's something to think about.\n\nGreene, who has nothing if not an inquiring mind, speculated it is really that Johnson might be getting blackmailed.\n\nIt's not clear what this insinuation is supposed to be about.\n\nJohnson is an evangelical Christian attorney who has not, as far as anyone can tell, lived a life conducive to creating material for a blackmailer.\n\nWhat did Johnson do: Mess up a citation in a brief 10 years ago? Miss a filing deadline once?\n\nSubscribe to our daily Post Opinion newsletter!\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nOn the question of Ukraine, Greene and Carlson are self-professed nationalists who apparently have no idea why people might want to defend their homeland.\n\nGreene said supporters of the war in the West care most about \"murdering\" Ukrainians, a bizarre way to characterize support for a war of self-defense.\n\nAs if we would be doing Ukraine a favor by letting it get conquered and subjected by a predatory neighbor.\n\nIf this is the standard, every leader who has ever resisted a foreign invasion has engaged in the \"murder\" of his or her own people.\n\nIf only Joan of Arc hadn't been party to the murder of so many Frenchmen as she tried to expel the English in the Hundred Years' War, and if only Elizabeth I hadn't murdered so many British sailors in the course of checking the Spanish Armada.\n\nOr, to extend the logic further, the French in World War I when they were a bulwark against Wilhelmine Germany? Reckless warmongers.\n\nThe French in World War II when they capitulated to Nazi Germany quickly? Admirable realists and humanitarians.\n\nCarlson, as he often does, made much of the Kyiv government's actions against the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.\n\nWhether you agree with what Ukraine has done or not, it is relevant to know that the church is a cat's-paw of Moscow - although, of course, that wasn't mentioned.\n\nGreene went on to say that it violates \"every tenet of our Christian faith\" to aid Ukraine, and people who support Ukraine can't even call themselves Christians.\n\nThat the United States should feel a moral compulsion to sit by and watch authoritarian states threaten the European order in pursuit of a neo-imperial and anti-Western agenda is, shall we say, an interesting interpretation of the word of God.\n\nDoing a little somnology from afar, Greene also noted that Johnson is always complaining he's tired and only getting three hours of sleep.\n\nSince she, too, has been very busy in her life but always gotten seven or eight hours of sleep a night, she believes this shows Johnson must have a guilty conscience that's keeping him up.\n\n(Carlson thanked her for making this \"deep point.\")\n\nMaybe Johnson's sleep is disturbed by the thought his majority is so small that someone like Marjorie Taylor Greene matters.\n\nAnd who can blame him?\n\nTwitter: @RichLowry"

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene bid to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson crushed by both parties\n\nWell, that didn't take long.\n\nFar-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's long-delayed drive to unseat House Speaker Mike Johnson was emphatically defeated Wednesday moments after she introduced it, with members of both parties voting to kill the effort.\n\nThe House voted 359-43 against taking up Greene's (R-Ga.) motion, with 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats voting to keep the gavel in the hands of the 52-year-old Johnson.\n\n\"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort. That is certainly what it was,\" Johnson (R-La.) told reporters after the vote.\n\n\"Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress,\" he added. \"In this moment, the country desperately needs a functioning Congress. And that's what the overwhelming majority of the members of this body demonstrated today.\"\n\nThirty-two Democrats and just 11 Republicans voted to take up the motion to vacate, with seven House members voting present.\n\nGreene had initially filed the motion against Johnson on March 22, but held off on formally bringing it forward for weeks.\n\nOn Monday, Greene and her chief ally, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), huddled with Johnson in his office for about two hours to lay out their demands.\n\nThose stipulations, which Greene made public Tuesday, included that Johnson cut off further US aid funding for Ukraine, return to individual government spending bills and defund Justice Department prosecutions of former President Donald Trump, and pledge to only put bills on the floor that had a majority of Republican support. among other stipulations.\n\nIronically, the Georgian's own motion to vacate the chair fell far short of a Republican majority.\n\nHad Greene's effort not been tabled, it would have had to be voted on within two legislative days, but House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) moved to set the measure aside right after it was read into the record by the House clerk.\n\nFollowing Johnson's Monday meeting with Greene, he publicly declared that the standoff was \"not a negotiation.\" The two met again Tuesday with no sign of what was to come.\n\nGreene rose in the packed House chamber to read her resolution just after the House had started its final vote series of the week - and was promptly showered with boos from both sides of the aisle.\n\n\"This is what the uniparty looks like,\" a grimacing Greene shot back as Massie looked on approvingly next to her.\n\nThe outcome of the vote had been determined last week after House Democratic leadership announced it would support tabling any motion to remove Johnson from the speakership.\n\nOn Oct. 3, 208 Democrats joined eight Republicans to oust Johnson's predecessor, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), which led to 22 days of paralysis in the lower chamber before the Pelican Stater was chosen.\n\nThe vote against McCarthy marked the only time a sitting House Speaker was ousted by his own party via a motion to vacate the chair.\n\nBut Democrats had grown frustrated with Johnson's intra-GOP enemies and were pleased with his decision to take up a vote last month on a $61 billion Ukraine aid package that appeared to be the last straw for Greene.\n\n\"Our elected Republican Speaker, Mike Johnson, has aided and abetted the Democrats and the Biden administration in destroying our country,\" she groused on the House floor.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump had talked to Greene and privately urged her to stand down, not wanting more chaos among congressional Republicans during an election year.\n\nHowever, Greene insisted that she was looking after the 45th president's best interest by pursuing Johnson.\n\n\"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene. She's got Spirit, she's got Fight, and I believe she'll be around, and on our side, for a long time to come,\" Trump posted on Truth Social after her revolt went up in flames.\n\n\"However, right now, Republicans have to be fighting the Radical Left Democrats, and all the Damage they have done to our Country. With a Majority of One, shortly growing to three or four, we're not in a position of voting on a Motion to Vacate.\"\n\nStill, Trump did not rule out backing such a move \"at some point,\" while making sure to praise Johnson as \"a good man who is trying very hard.\"\n\nIn addition to Greene and Massie, the nine Republicans who voted against tabling the motion to vacate were Andy Biggs of Arizona, Eric Burlison of Missouri, Eli Crane of Arizona, Warren Davidson of Ohio, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Alex Mooney of West Virginia, Barry Moore of Alabama, Chip Roy of Texas and Victoria Spartz of Indiana.\n\nProminent Democrats who voted to move forward with ousting Johnson included Jamaal Bowman of New York, Cori Bush of Missouri, Greg Casar of Texas, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Maxine Waters of California.\n\nThree other New York Democrats - Yvette Clark, Pat Ryan, and Nydia Velazquez - also voted to take up Greene's motion, as did Robert Menendez Jr. and Bonnie Watson Coleman, both Democrats of New Jersey.\n\nAdvertisement"

Marjorie Taylor Greene of making racist comments during a wild House Oversight Committee meeting the previous evening - even suggesting that alcohol may have been behind the \"Jerry Springer\"-style verbal throwdown.\n\n\"She's racist,\" Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) told reporters at the Capitol, hours after the Oversight panel's business meeting got chaotic, with Greene (R-Ga.) taking shots at the black congresswoman for wearing \"fake eyelashes.\"\n\n\"I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading,\" Greene said after Crockett asked the Georgia lawmaker if she knew why the committee was convened.\n\n\"I get attacked all the time on social media and it's usually by millions of people that follow her and Trump,\" Crockett said Friday. \"When I say something that they don't like ... they say, 'Oh well, look at her nails, look at her hair, it's fake. Look at her eyelashes.'\"\n\n\"That is them attacking me, really, as a black woman,\" added the freshman Texan, noting that Greene's ongoing spat with Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) has never descended into attacks on the latter's appearance.\n\n\"Boebert has clip-ins in her hair, and Boebert wears lashes too sometimes, it looks like,\" Crockett said, before suggesting Greene \"probably will raise money\" off of the verbal altercation \"because the racists are going to be so happy to give it to her.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) lashed out Friday at Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) for joking on social media that the hearing was worse than an episode of the long-running daytime talk staple.\n\n\"In the past, I've described the U.S. House as The Jerry Springer Show,\" Fetterman tweeted, earning Ocasio-Cortez's wrath. \"Today, I'm apologizing to The Jerry Springer Show.\"\n\n\"I understand you likely would not have stood up for your colleague and seem to be confused about racism and misogyny being a 'both sides' issue,\" the Bronx and Queens rep fired back on X . \"But I stand up to bullies, instead of becoming one.\"\n\n\"And to the women of Pennsylvania: I'd stand up for you too. Enjoy your Friday,\" she added.\n\nNeither Crockett nor Ocasio-Cortez would say for certain whether Greene's attacks were fueled by booze - but both indicated that Republicans were drinking in the committee room from Solo cups.\n\n\"I had heard that there's potentially alcohol involved. But I did not see any of that directly,\" Ocasio-Cortez told reporters about the late-night hearing. \"I did see folks with open Solo cups in there.\"\n\n\"I do know that every time we took a vote, the Republicans had been in the back on their side,\" Crockett added, mentioning members \"walking in and drinking in the committee.\"\n\n\"I don't know what they had over there,\" she added. \"We had tacos.\"\n\nCrockett got in a jab of her own Thursday night as Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) tried to restore order and allow a motion to strike Greene's remarks from the record.\n\n\"I'm just curious. To better understand your ruling, if someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody's bleached blond, bad-built, butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct?\" Crockett asked.\n\n\"A what now?\" Comer said, perplexed. \"I have no idea what you just said.\"\n\nAsked whether personal attacks would now be on the table in future Oversight hearings, Crockett told The Post, \"If they can't follow the rules, I will have to fight for myself.\"\n\n\"It's ridiculous that when you are insulted and when you have a chairman who doesn't understand the rules, or doesn't want to enforce the rules, that you're expected to sit there and take it - I'm still a grown woman,\" Crockett added. \"One thing I'm not going to do is have somebody disrespect me as a duly elected official myself.\"\n\n\"I think that we have someone who is not fit for Congress, that is currently serving, that does not adhere to the rules,\" she added of Greene. \"But in Oversight, there's just no control. It's just wild.\"\n\nA spokesman for Greene did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Oversight panel had met to hold a vote on a contempt of Congress resolution against Attorney General Merrick Garland over his failure to comply with a subpoena requesting recordings of President Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur.\n\nThat resolution, concerning Biden's willful retention of classified documents after his vice presidency, passed along party lines and has been sent to the full House of Representatives for a vote.\n\nAdvertisement"

Marjorie Taylor Greene as \"racist\" and implored House Speaker Mike Johnson to\"rein her in\" Sunday - after the two congresswomen traded barbs in a fiery Oversight Committee hearing last week .\n\n\"MAGA has historically been on social media, doing the things where they're saying, 'Oh, she's black with lashes and nails and hair and so she's ghetto,'\" the Democrat told CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday.\n\n\"So to me, this was her buying into that rhetoric and trying to amplify this for the MAGA crowd. And so yeah, I absolutely think that she only did it to be racist towards me.\"\n\nLast Thursday night, during a markup hearing in which the committee looked to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress, tensions flared between Greene (R-Ga.) and Crockett.\n\nAt one point during the hearing, Greene blasted her Democratic colleagues, asking \"if any of the Democrats on this committee are employing Judge [Juan] Merchant's daughter,\" in reference to the judge overseeing the hush money trial against former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Please tell me what that has to do with Merrick Garland,\" Crockett shot back, before adding \"Do you know what we're here for?\"\n\n\"I don't think you know what you're here for,\" Greene replied. \"I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading.\"\n\nFrom there, a shouting match erupted on the panel.\n\nDuring that mayhem, Crockett pressed for Greene's words to be cut from the record, but Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) declined.\n\n\"If someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody's bleach blond bad built butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct?\" Crockett hissed.\n\nThe Democrat has since moved to cash in on the dust-up by selling swag .\n\nCrockett also underscored Sunday that she felt targeted.\n\n\"I think her specifically doing it to me,\" the lawmaker clarified Sunday when pressed about why she felt Greene's jab was racist.\n\n\"Women wear makeup, we wear lashes. We were all types of things to beautify ourselves.\"\n\nCrockett, a first-time congresswoman, further contended that Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) \"should be inclined to rein her in,\" especially after she conspired to oust him.\n\n\"They just let Marjorie do whatever she wants to do. And I think this was the first time that someone actually said, 'No, you won't just treat me whatever way you want to and get away with it,'\" Crockett added.\n\nThe Texan lamented that Greene didn't get penalized.\n\n\"The problem with MAGA is that MAGA does not respect rules, nor do they respect the law. That is exactly why they're all running up to Trump's trial,\" she said.\n\n\"He's in trouble, not because of some big conspiracy by the Biden administration. He's in trouble because he fails to respect the law.\n\n\"The party of law in order is gone at this point in time.\"\n\nCrockett also gave some advice to President Biden amid signs in polling that he's hemorrhaging support from black voters.\n\n\"I think it's about whether or not people understand what he has done for them. It's tough to kind of connect the dots sometimes,\" she said.\n\n\"They have done so much, but I don't think that the information has been pushed out continually.\"\n\nBiden, 81, has a 71% to 13% edge with black voters over former President Donald Trump, down from the 87% to 12% score he notched in 2020 election exit polls, according to an NBC News April survey .\n\nThe Post contacted a Greene spokesperson for comment.\n\nAdvertisement"

And Americans are cheering and cheering. Everyone did vote for this,\" Greene said. \"So I think the Democrat Party just hasn't figured out who they are, but they've decided to fight against the very issue that most Americans really care about, and that's $36 trillion in debt.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers called to demand testimony from Musk to the committee, which was a point of debate among committee members.\n\nMusk's new department has begun its investigations into the federal government with some obstacles. While a lawsuit attempting to keep DOGE out of Labor Department data was dismissed, another U.S. district judge ruled against the department accessing the Treasury.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene says Republicans don't deserve to hold House majority\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) said her Republican colleagues don't deserve to maintain their slim majority in the House next year after working with Democrats to pass a temporary spending deal to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nIn an interview on Steve Bannon's War Room podcast, Greene described what she views as a \"double-edged sword\" in November: the need to control the House by reelecting many of her colleagues whom she views as not conservative enough .\n\n\"I share the anger and frustration, and I don't think Republicans deserve to be re-elected to hold the majority,\" Greene said, encouraging voters to cast their ballots for former President Donald Trump to ensure GOP control of the White House.\n\nBut, she added, \"We also have to control the House because if we don't control the House, the Democrats are going to rewrite the tax code. That happens in January 2025, so it's a nasty double-edged sword.\"\n\nGreene's comments come as the Georgia Republican has been critical of Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-LA) leadership, especially after the top House Republican has relied on Democratic support to pass key government funding legislation. The latest example came this week when the House passed a three-month continuing resolution with more Democratic support than Republicans, prompting backlash from hard-line conservatives.\n\nOther Republicans have echoed similar sentiments, with Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX) suggesting earlier this month that Republicans would lose their majority because they haven't done enough to address voter concerns.\n\n\"What is frustrating me is, I firmly believe that House Republicans are going to lose the majority. And we're going to lose it because of ourselves,\" Gonzales said at the Texas Tribune Festival. \"We're getting outraised. We're getting outspent.\"\n\nRep. Chip Roy (R-TX) has similarly lamented a lack of action among the House GOP, expressing frustration in a floor speech late last year that Republicans don't have any accomplishments to tout on the campaign trail.\n\n\"I want my Republican colleagues to give me one thing - one! - that I can go campaign on and say we did. One!\" Roy said. \"Anybody sitting in the complex, you want to come down to the floor and come explain to me one material, meaningful, significant thing the Republican majority has done besides, 'Well, I guess it's not as bad as the Democrats.'\"\n\nRep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) repeated similar comments a few weeks later, telling Newsmax in January, \"We have nothing to go out there and campaign on. It's embarrassing.\"\n\nThe latest comments from Greene come after the House adjourned for October recess and is not scheduled to return until after the November election. House Republicans are looking to maintain, and even grow, their slim majority when voters head to the ballot box next month.\n\nAll 435 House seats are up for grabs in November, with only 42 considered competitive. Most of those are held by Democrats, which gives the GOP a slight advantage as it heads into the final two months of the election cycle.\n\nBut of the 42 competitive seats, 17 are held by Republicans in districts that voted for President Joe Biden in 2020, compared to just five Democrats who must defend their seats in districts carried by former President Donald Trump. That means there are just enough vulnerable GOP-held seats to keep things competitive heading into November."

Greene opted to point to how the previous administration \"ripped our borders open\" to illegal immigrants, arguing that the Trump administration is doing a \"great job\" addressing that.\n\nMTG WARNS PBS AND NPR: 'HATE US ON THEIR OWN DIME'\n\n\"We're talking about NPR and PBS today, we're talking about fake news that was funded with federal funding from American taxpayers,\" Greene stated. \"That's what this is about today, not journalists from the U.K.\"\n\nGreene spent Wednesday railing against both NPR and PBS during a budget-cutting hearing, saying the broadcasting networks have become \"radical, left-wing echo chambers for a narrow audience.\" She also greatly criticized the latter network featuring a drag queen on the \"Let's Learn\" show."

Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) blocked newly elected Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) from all House committees, the Georgia Republican is poised to chair what is arguably the most impactful subcommittee in Congress.\n\nOn Wednesday , Greene will take the gavel in the House Oversight's Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency and open two years of investigations into federal waste, fraud, and abuse in a way that has possibly never been tried.\n\n\"We're going to take it to a deeper level,\" the three-term conservative told Secrets on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's going to be transformative because we're going to be able to bring up solutions and implement them, and we'll be able to implement them through the coordinating work that we'll be doing along with the White House,\" said Greene of her first chairwoman role.\n\nBy complimenting President Donald Trump's efforts and those of his Department of Government Efficiency head Elon Musk, Greene is expecting to make changes to how government works, chip away at the nation's $36 trillion deficit, and even help Republicans gain seats in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nFOLLOW @DOGECommittee to tune in tomorrow at 10AM! https://t.co/EHP09xNRhc\n\n\"DOGE and the effort to rein in federal spending, rein in waste, fraud and abuse, and basically forcing Washington, D.C. to care about the American people and care how hard they work and to care about the money that they pay to the federal government, has become the No. 1 issue. I think it's even above border security now, which is pretty impressive,\" Greene said.\n\n\"Essentially,\" she added, the new administration and congressional majority are \"waging what we could call maybe a second American Revolution, which is saving our own government and saving our country.\"\n\nIn her first hearing tomorrow, Greene will look at the general landscape of federal spending and potential waste. She has a hearing scheduled to get into the specifics of funding for National Public Radio and Public TV.\n\nGreene, who has a business background, said she plans to go into hearings with an open mind but will quickly decide if action is needed.\n\n\"I'll be making formal suggestions and formal announcements after each hearing. So I don't want to be on the front end, but saying this, that, and the other on the back end,\" she said.\n\nWhile she is aiming to cut wasteful spending, Greene also promised to maintain critical spending that Americans rely on.\n\n\"We're just going to have to cut programs,\" she said, explaining, \"We can do that well without cutting, you know, benefits, it's easy. It's easy. We can cut out the garbage, and we can still protect Americans.\"\n\nOnce potential cuts are identified, Greene is hoping to team up with corporate IT outlets to automate some of the savings.\n\n\"I have a business mindset, and the only way I can look at the government is through making a failing company that's about to go bankrupt into a successful company. And so you have to start with the simple things,\" she said, citing fraud such as paying dead people.\n\n\"It's easy to figure out. Those are quick cuts we can do, and we'll be able to do that by working with Elon Musk and DOGE and probably some other really great tech companies coming up with algorithms, coming up with computer programs that can easily be put in place with the payment centers within our own federal departments and agencies. And these solutions that can be implemented that any private company would do immediately to stop from making improper payments. And these are the things that must be done within the federal government,\" said Greene.\n\nFor Greene, getting the chairmanship is just the latest example of her elbowing aside old Capitol Hill traditions and challenging her critics, including the media.\n\nAfter 4 yrs, I'm fed up with Washington DC press. Your assumptions are ignorant and you are absolutely disconnected and clueless about what is important in life and to Americans. You have destroyed your credibility. With social media like X, you can't lie about me anymore. pic.twitter.com/mC1RXDfBcl\n\nAnd while she hopes for bipartisanship, she is expecting Democrats to block her, as some have to Trump's cuts with demands that liberals go to war with Republicans to save the swamp.\n\n\"This will be a congressional fight, a constitutional fight, a legal fight, and on days like this a street fight, yes we will stand,\" threatened Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-MD) on Monday.\n\n\"They don't care,\" Greene said of the Democrats, many of whom have protested in support of wasteful USAID and Department of Education funding.\n\n\"I'd love to see them wage, BLM, Antifa style riots, where they're defending the bureaucracy and they're defending $36 million in debt. Like, yeah, go ahead, burn down regular communities over that. Let's see how that plays out for you because I want to win the midterms, to be honest with you. So if they want to go that route, I'm all for it,\" she told Secrets .\n\nSEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS\n\nShe added that taxpayers \"should be angry\" at the waste she, Musk, and others have revealed so far.\n\n\"They work their tails off, and the government has wasted so much of their money and overspent. Inflation is high, and now their money has lost so much value, it doesn't go very far. And yeah, they should be furious coming up on April 15,\" the date 2024 tax forms are due, she said."

The House will continue its successful effort to responsibly fund the government when it returns from its district work period.\"\n\nThe Freedom Caucus, which Greene is a notable member of, issued a statement Monday pushing for the SAVE Act as part of the continuing resolution and urging House Republicans to use their leverage in case Democrats could \"undermine\" a second term for former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The House Freedom Caucus believes that House Republicans should return to Washington to continue the work of passing all 12 appropriations bills to cut spending and advance our policy priorities,\" the statement said.\n\nIf the House cannot meet the Sept. 30 deadline or pass a continuing resolution, the government will be shut down for the first time since the 2018-2019 shutdown during Trump's presidency.\n\nA shutdown can have dire consequences. A large number of civilian employees aren't paid and some offices can't offer services at expanded hours."

However, the race was pushed into a runoff election after neither candidate received more than 50% of the vote, leading to Harris's victory in a narrower field.\n\nDespite Greene's advantage in the district, Harris has sought to call into question her legislative legacy on Capitol Hill to persuade voters to vote her out of office.\n\n\"This race right now is in a situation where the district's Democrats, Republicans, and independents are actually now truly looking at Marjorie Taylor Greene and saying, 'She has been up there for 3 1/2 years. What has she actually done for the district?'\" Harris told the Washington Blade. \"She hates every Democrat that walks the face of the Earth, and on top of that, she doesn't have anything that she can stand on that says what she's actually done here inside the district - so we have a clear path to actually beat her.\"\n\nBut the Democratic challenger will face an uphill battle against Greene in Georgia's 14th Congressional District, as it is rated as a solidly Republican seat.

These groups receive a significant amount of funding from ActBlue, a Democrat superPAC.\n\nGreene cites several recent examples, and asks the DOJ and FBI to get to the bottom of \"who is organizing and carrying out these attacks?\" and whether \"there is a link between NGOs and the organizers of the attacks.\"\n\nAs The Epoch Times ' Katabella Roberts notes further, President Trump is considering labeling perpetrators as domestic terrorists on March 11, following multiple acts of vandalism and demonstrations at the electric vehicle company's showrooms throughout the United States.\n\nTrump made the comments to reporters outside the White House, where he was joined by Tesla's owner Elon Musk after selecting a new electric vehicle for his staff to use.\n\n\" I will do that, I'll do it.

Meanwhile, Trump faces criminal cases on several fronts.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith, appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, indicted Trump over Jan. 6 and the dispute over classified documents with the National Archives.\n\nThe Supreme Court intervened again in the Jan. 6 case, ruling that Trump enjoys presidential immunity for acts carried out while in office.

Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe statement continued, saying PBS is committed to offering \"a broad range of stories and programs that help citizens understand our past and shape our future; and helping children and families open up worlds of possibilities through educational programming.\"\n\nIn a similar Feb. 3 letter to NPR President and Chief Executive Officer Katherine Maher, Greene pointed to NPR's refusal to cover the Hunter Biden laptop story because \"we don't want to waste the listeners' and readers' time on stories that are just pure distractions\" as evidence of unacceptable bias in federally funded news coverage.\n\nAn NPR spokesman released the following statement to The Epoch Times concerning the hearing:\n\n\"Since its inception, NPR has collaborated with local nonprofit public media organizations to fill critical needs for news and information in America's communities. We constantly strive to hold ourselves to the highest standards of journalism. ... We welcome the opportunity to discuss the critical role of public media in delivering impartial, fact-based news and reporting to the American public.\"\n\nA spokesman for Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), the top Democratic member of the HOAC, did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.\n\nGreene offered the two media executives two alternative dates in March for the hearing. A subcommittee spokesman told The Epoch Times the date has not been set.\n\nIn addition to the Musk and Hunter Biden laptop incidents, Greene said the forthcoming hearing was prompted in great part by the publication in 2024 of an exposé by former NPR senior editor Uri Berliner.\n\nBerliner criticized the organization for \"only serving a liberal leaning audience and for failing to properly report major news stories-including Hunter Biden's laptop, COVID-19 origins, and the Russian collusion hoax,\" Greene said in a separate statement announcing the hearing.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Democrats Join Republicans To Block Greene's Bid To Oust Speaker Johnson\n\nBy Joseph Lord of Epoch Times\n\nThe House of Representatives on May 8 overwhelmingly voted to block a measure to strip House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) of the gavel advanced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) forced a vote on a motion to vacate after meeting with the speaker twice this week to discuss her grievances and demands.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) then offered a measure to table Ms. Greene's motion to vacate. Democrats joined Republicans to approve its shelving in a 359 to 43 vote. 11 Republicans voted to move forward with the ouster attempt.\n\nBREAKING -- THE HOUSE has resoundingly tabled a motion to oust @SpeakerJohnson 359-43 R 196Y 11N D 163Y 32N\n\nHouse Democrat leaders had earlier pledged to help protect Mr. Johnson in the event of Ms. Greene's ouster vote, citing his help in passing $95 billion foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific.\n\nSpeaking on the House floor during what was intended to be the final vote of the week, Ms. Greene unleashed a litany of complaints against Mr. Johnson.\n\nShe received a loud \"boo\" from members present when she brought the resolution to the floor.\n\nThe Georgia lawmaker was accompanied by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), one of two Republicans who openly expressed support for the measure.\n\nMr. Johnson has previously denounced Ms. Greene's attempt to oust him, calling it a \"dangerous gambit.\"\n\n\"I think it's wrong for the Republican Party. I think it's wrong for the institution,\" he said last week.\n\nMs. Greene, on the House floor, cited a series of alleged conservative failures by Mr. Johnson, alleging that he had \"aided and abetted the Biden administration in destroying our country.\"\n\nThe other wild thing about this statement is that Trump floats that he may support ousting @SpeakerJohnson but not now! \"We're not in a position on voting on a motion to vacate. At some point, we may very well be, but this is not the time.\" https://t.co/wxbG79xBsL\n\nThese included his move to allow a vote on a motion to expel Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) from the lower chamber, marking the first time in U.S. history that a member has been expelled before a conviction for a crime.\n\nMs. Greene also cited his move to pass a 1,000-page, $1.2 trillion government funding package after giving lawmakers less than 48 hours to consider it, as required by internal rules.\n\nThe Georgia Republican also noted that Mr. Johnson's move to pass billions in foreign aid for Ukraine came without any demands on border security, effectively yielding any leverage Republicans had over the issue.\n\nAdditionally, she noted Mr. Johnson's crucial vote to kill a warrant requirement for the reauthorization of a controversial surveillance power.\n\nMore in the full developing report at Epoch Times\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "'Baby Girl, Don't Even Play!': Waffle House Chaos Ensues In Fiery Congressional Catfight\n\nA heated catfight broke out Thursday evening during a House Oversight Committee hearing, during which Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) asked if any of the Democrats present were employing the daughter of Trump Judge Juan Merchan - whose progressive political consulting firm has represented VP Kamala Harris, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and other liberals.\n\nThe committee was considering whether Attorney General Merrick Garland should be held in contempt of Congress for his refusal to turn over recordings of President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur - which the White House exercised executive privilege over earlier this week - when Greene asked the Democrats about Merchan's daughter .\n\n\"I'd like to know if any of the Democrats on this committee are employing Judge Merchan's daughter,\" Greene asked.\n\n\"Please tell me what that has to do with Merrick Garland,\" shot back Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-MO).\n\n\"Oh, Goldman, that's right. He's advising,\" Greene said, ignoring Crockett.\n\n\"Do you know what we're here for?\" Crockett said back, adding \"You know we're here for AG.\"\n\nTo which Green said \"I don't think you know what you're here for ... I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading. \"\n\nThis triggered Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who moved to take down Greene's words, saying \"That is absolutely unacceptable. How dare you attack the physical appearance of another person.\"\n\n\" Are your feelings hurt? \" replied Greene.\n\nTo which ACO exclaimed \" Remove her words down.\"\n\n\"Aww,\" Greene responded.\n\n\" Oh girl, baby girl, \" AOC shot back. \"Don't even play.\"\n\nFollowing a brief recess, Crockett called a point of order and asked House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) if Greene's behavior was ok.\n\n\"I'm just curious, just to better understand your ruling,\" said Crockett. \" If someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody's bleach-blond, bad-built, butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct? \"\n\nAt this point Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) jumped into the fray, demanding Crockett's words be removed - to which Crockett exploded into a verbal tirade against Luna, shouting and using profanity .\n\n\"Calm down, please calm down,\" said Luna. \"You're out of control!\"\n\nWatch:\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Key Moments From The 118th Congress\n\nAuthored by Joseph Lord, Jackson Richman & Stacy Robinson via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nThe 119th Congress of the United States will officially sit for the first time on Jan. 3, 2025 - marking the official close of the particularly tumultuous and divided 118th Congress.\n\nThe Congress was defined by ideological splits among House Republicans, whose narrow majority meant that everything-from who held the speaker's gavel to how the government would be funded-was on the line, and Republicans needed broad agreement to advance any course of action.\n\nWith President Joe Biden in the White House and Democrats in control of the upper chamber, partisan divisions were also especially pronounced.\n\nWhile Republicans mounted investigations into the administration and executive officials, Democrats broke records in the Senate for judicial confirmations.\n\nAside from the compromise deals that resulted from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and House Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-La.) negotiations with Democrats-largely related to financial issues-there were few major legislative agreements during this Congress.\n\nHere are the highlights of the 118th Congress as it concludes its final days.\n\nIdeological divisions among House Republicans were the main story of the 118th Congress- due in large part to the razor-thin majority the party held in the lower chamber.\n\nSplits between conservatives and moderates have always defined the party. With such a narrow margin in the House, the impact of these divisions was substantially magnified. Republicans could only afford a small handful of defections on partisan votes. That meant that members of both major GOP factions were able to hold an outsized influence on the most controversial bills.\n\nThose dubbed moderates -members like Reps. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), John Duarte (R-Calif.), Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.), and others- showed a willingness to break with their party when they thought the majority was pushing too far.\n\nThe conservatives-members like Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), and Cory Mills (R-Fla.)-pushed for leadership to go further in forcing financial and other concessions from Democrats.\n\nThese splits were compounded by irregular but impactful interventions by then-candidate Donald Trump, who enjoys a far greater influence in the House than in the Senate.\n\nIn the House Rules Committee, which considers the rules governing votes and debate on bills, conservatives like Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), and Chip Roy (R-Texas) often tanked legislation that came before the panel.\n\nMassie opposed a short-term spending bill in September intended to avert a government shutdown. The bill later passed under suspension.\n\nSuspension of the rules, under which a bill can pass the House without passing the Rules Committee, became a mainstay in the 118th Congress due to the challenges posed by Massie, Norman, and Roy on the Rules panel.\n\nThe consequences of Republicans' ideological split were visible from the first sitting of the 118th Congress in January 2023, when it took 15 ballots over five days for McCarthy to be named speaker.\n\nA recognized leader in the House Republican conference since the early 2010s, McCarthy was considered the heir apparent to the speakership on the day the 118th Congress first sat.\n\nHowever, many Republicans were unhappy with McCarthy. His most prominent critic was Gaetz, with others like Roy, Norman, Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), and others opposing the California Republican.\n\nMcCarthy's conservative credentials were questioned, and he was seen by his critics as too aligned with the establishment and unable to effectively lead GOP opposition to the Biden administration.\n\nThe votes dragged on for days, raising questions about McCarthy's ability to win.\n\nUltimately, Gaetz and other holdouts relented, voting \"present.\"\n\nBut that came at a cost, as these conservatives forced several key concessions from McCarthy-a return to the one-member motion to vacate the chair, seats on the Rules Committee for conservatives, and budget-related concessions.\n\nWhile McCarthy was able to clinch a narrow victory, it may have been a pyrrhic one in the end-and it set the tone for the 118th House moving forward.\n\nWhile Democrats and Republicans rarely worked together during the Congress, certain budget issues-particularly the debt ceiling and government funding-required compromises.\n\nIn 2023, the House GOP passed the Limit, Save, Grow Act to lift the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion while implementing significant fiscal and other reforms.\n\nEven conservative Republicans backed it due to its features: clawing back COVID funds, reducing energy regulations, revoking green energy, and strengthening some federal welfare requirements.\n\nHowever, this package was unable to pass Congress due to Democrats' opposition. Instead,\n\nCongress ultimately agreed to the Fiscal Responsibility Act-a compromise between McCarthy and Biden-to suspend the debt ceiling until January 2025.\n\nAside from suspending the debt ceiling, it reclaimed unspent COVID funds, capped non-defense discretionary spending, strengthened federal welfare requirements, and streamlined energy permitting.\n\nThis bill-which 71 Republicans opposed-further disenchanted some Republicans with McCarthy's handling of the speakership.\n\nThe compromise means that the issue will come up again in the opening months of Trump's second term, and it may require negotiations with Democrats to raise or suspend the ceiling again, though the GOP could raise the debt ceiling through reconciliation, which would avoid the need to overcome the filibuster and therefore any Democrat votes. On the other hand, Trump has called for abolishing the debt ceiling.\n\nWhile the 118th Congress didn't get much done in the way of major legislation, one issue came up again and again: government funding.\n\nTo fund the government every year, each chamber of Congress must pass 12 appropriations bills by Sept. 30 to keep agencies running . Failure to do so triggers a government shutdown, when only essential services and personnel are retained.\n\nBut many conservative House Republicans take a firm stance against any spending they perceive to be wasteful and have historically refused to back government funding plans that could win Democrats' support.\n\nThat made it difficult to reach an agreement on any of the funding bills-particularly as the Democratic Senate was opposed to substantial spending cuts.\n\nThis led leadership to rely on a slate of stopgap government funding bills, dubbed a \"continuing resolution\" (CR) in Washington-talk.\n\nThe year 2024 saw multiple  CRs passed, the latest of which squeaked through on Dec. 20, just hours before the deadline.\n\nThe CR passed on Dec. 20 was the \"plan C\" version of the bill, which extends government funding until March 14. The first attempt was a massive 1500-page package that failed amid opposition by Trump and others; the second was much shorter, coming in at 118 pages.\n\nIt didn't include any provisions related to the debt ceiling, a last-minute demand put forward by Trump in an effort to avoid a showdown on the issue during his term.\n\nIt was a CR, ultimately, that cost McCarthy the gavel and his spot in Congress.\n\nDuring his relatively short time in the speaker's chair, McCarthy faced heightened scrutiny from conservative Republicans, who felt he had failed to win acceptable concessions from Democrats or to fight on budget issues.\n\nAfter McCarthy backed a continuing resolution on Sept. 30, 2023, these criticisms came to a head.\n\nGaetz, an outspoken McCarthy critic, brought to the floor a motion to vacate the speaker's chair. That motion was possible only through a rule change that allowed a single member to bring such a resolution to the floor-one of the multiple rule changes McCarthy agreed to in order to win the job.\n\nSeven other Republicans joined all Democrats to oust McCarthy, who became the first-ever speaker to be deposed by the mechanism.\n\nThis led to three weeks of paralysis as Republicans tried to find a replacement. Three candidates, including Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), and Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) each unsuccessfully sought the top spot.\n\nUltimately, Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.)-until then a little-known lawmaker-was able to win enough support to be named speaker, in part, Republicans have said, because his personality made him popular with moderates and conservatives alike.\n\nMcCarthy ultimately left Congress in December 2023.\n\nIn May, it looked as though Johnson too might be removed, a push led this time by Greene; as in the case of McCarthy, Greene's resolution was based on Johnson's decision to pursue a CR with Democrats.\n\nHowever, Greene's effort didn't gain momentum, and it failed after Democrats joined Republicans to table the motion to vacate.\n\nRead the rest here...\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Went After GOP Speaker. Guess Who Lost? She made her bones trashing other Republicans.\n\nWASHINGTON - Last week, House Speaker Mike Johnson defeated a \"motion to vacate\" his perch pushed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in a 359-43 vote.\n\nAll I can say is: Hallelujah.\n\nJohnson had math on his side. House Republicans overwhelmingly support him. Only 11 GOP members (including Greene) voted against the affable Louisianan.\n\nOf course, her loss won't stop CNN from airing MTG's every thought. With that spiteful smile of hers, she is the liberal media's ideal representative for the GOP.\n\nGreene slammed Johnson's win as a victory for the \"uni-party\" - the Georgia lawmaker's way of saying that without shameless stunts and endless procedural votes, Americans will be doomed to live under one establishmentarian party made up of Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThat ignores the parties' differences on issues such as immigration, border politics, campus protests, student loan forgiveness, abortion, states' rights, and fossil fuels.\n\n\"The most important thing everyone needs to know is that people want a Republican Party that will fight,\" the vanquished Greene told Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo on Sunday.\n\nThus Greene tapped into magical thinking found in some corners of the GOP - that fighting is good in and of itself, so results don't matter.\n\nTo embrace such a principle, you have to believe a slim House Republican majority can dictate policy even though Democrats control the White House and Senate.\n\nOne other thing about politics: Compromise isn't a dirty word. It's the way you get the most of what you want, instead of all or nothing.\n\nGreene told Bartiromo that she told Johnson she might reconsider her motion to oust Johnson if he moved to \"defund Jack Smith,\" the special counsel who has charged former President Donald Trump with conspiring to overturn the 2020 election and unlawful retention of classified documents.\n\nAlas, reality intrudes. As Johnson told Politico , \"But that's not something you wave a wand and just eliminate the special counsel as a provision.\"\n\nGreene also reportedly wanted Johnson to oppose more aid to Ukraine. To his credit, Johnson supported Ukraine funding because it is in America's national security interest.\n\nGreene made her bones trashing other Republicans. There's no better ticket to get on cable news.\n\nJohnson doesn't bite at that apple.\n\n\"I'm a Bible-believing Christian,\" Johnson told Politico . \"That's one of the first commands we have. You're supposed to love your enemies. Nobody in this building is my enemy.\"\n\nGreene defended her antics by hiding behind the former president. She told Bartiromo she stands for voters who are \"fed up with Republicans that will not defend President Trump.\"\n\nActually, Johnson has a history of backing Trump, including (and not to his credit) Trump's bogus stolen-election take on his 2020 loss.\n\nYou know Johnson has been a Team Trump stalwart because Trump backed Johnson in the speakership fight.\n\nGreene's most craven hit on the mild-mannered speaker: \"Mike Johnson's owned by the Democrats,\" she told Bartiromo.\n\nMTG was a ringleader among the rump of Republicans who would not back Johnson, even though he is a solid conservative. She is a big reason the gavel could not remain with Johnson absent the grudging support of a modicum of Democrats.\n\nSo even though Greene failed bigly, expect to see her nightly on the news channels as she shares her views on the Capitol steps with press scrums hanging on her every word.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene May Have Finished Off Lesley Stahl on Sunday Night The Democrats-as-pedophiles charge might just stick.\n\nC BS News' Lesley Stahl has been around forever, and it's a little difficult to understand why.\n\nStahl isn't a particularly good reporter. She asks a lot of dumb questions, and she's biased in a way that is often comic. There's the famous interview with Donald Trump from back in 2020 in which Stahl treated the president with utter disdain and scoffed at everything he said, in particular Trump's allegation that his campaign was spied on in 2016, only to have the facts prove Trump out.\n\nStahl sticks around mostly because she parrots elite-media narratives seemingly from the heart. And one of the usual Stahl 60 Minutes tropes, at least when political interviews come her way, is to attempt to marginalize Republican and conservative figures as freaks, oddballs, bigots, and liars in ways she and her compatriots at CBS News would never do to figures on the left.\n\nFewer and fewer Republicans will take the bait and consent to a Lesley Stahl interview now as a result. It's a high-risk, low-reward proposition at this point - when Trump released his video copy of the 2020 interview, it was fairly clear how it was cut to make him look bad.\n\nSo it was a bit of a surprise to see that GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, quite probably the most maligned member of Congress not named George Santos, agreed to an interview with Stahl on Sunday. The reflex would be to call it a mistake to go on 60 Minutes ' air and allow Stahl and her producers to cut up an interview for maximum partisan effect.\n\nExcept Greene is that rare GOP politician who just doesn't give a damn. She's had the kitchen sink thrown at her and easily won reelection, she's been stripped of committee assignments without actually having done anything to deserve such a rebuke only to become a fundraising dynamo ... she's the Notorious MTG and she owns it.\n\nSo there is nothing Lesley Stahl can do to her that would materially affect her career in a substantive way.\n\nAnd yes, the interview was as slanted and hostile as anyone would imagine. It consisted of Stahl asking Greene questions, Greene answering, and then a voiceover \"fact-checking\" her to make her out to be a nut and a liar.\n\nCBS edited out an exchange over Ukraine, in which MTG questioned whether we should fund the Ukrainian war effort without limits and Stahl responded by questioning her commitment to American national interests. One imagines when Greene responded to that back and forth by asking why a negotiated peace isn't an acceptable American policy, a position most voters would probably agree with (and eventually will if they don't today, as it's obviously how that war ends), it was seen as not suitably convenient for broadcast.\n\nSo this only made it to the digital version.\n\nMTG came off a whole lot better than Stahl. So naturally, 60 Minutes ' television viewers didn't get to see that part.\n\nInstead, what they saw was this, which wasn't any better from the media elite's perspective...\n\nI have been laughing about this for the past ten minutes.\n\nI've always opposed calling Democrats pedophiles and groomers. MTG just changed my mind, but not because of facts.\n\nI'm in for as long as Democrats label Trump supporters racists. It's a fair response. https://t.co/VtrRTxvuDx\n\n- Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) April 3, 2023\n\nThis is not the argument the Left wants to have. If more Republican politicians would take MTG's lead and press it as a matter of sheer predatory politics, it would matter on Election Day.\n\nHere's what I said Monday about this at RVIVR.com ...\n\nIs it rude? Of course it is. They hate it like poison . But calling someone a groomer is no worse than calling them a racist, and Democrats do that with impunity.\n\nThere ought to be more of this. It ought to be standard-issue GOP politics to call a Democrat opponent a groomer or a pedophile.\n\nBecause if nothing else, the Democrats nominated and elected a man as president who serially creeps on children ; there are dozens if not hundreds of video clips of him acting inappropriately around other people's kids. And the diary of his daughter Ashley contains an accusation , never answered by Biden in one of the most amazing journalistic passes of all time, that he inappropriately showered with her when she was 12.\n\nMTG is happy to hit below the belt and \"go there\" because she has nothing to lose, but also because American politics is nastier now than it's been in well more than a century and there is no fixing it while Democrats exist to do nothing but make scurrilous and defamatory accusations about the GOP and its pols.\n\nWhen a dyed-in-the-wool pot like James Carville is free to toss around charges of \"racism\" at every kettle he sees, there are no rules. And it clearly doesn't serve Republicans well to try to be \"above\" such attacks. As Ron DeSantis said in a speech over the weekend, the winners get to set the agenda and the losers go home. Those who set the agenda get to determine what's acceptable and what isn't, and right now it's the Democrats with that power. They're gleefully abusing it, as Trump's indictment - and the far more sinister federal conviction of blogger Douglass Mackey in a New York kangaroo court - shows.\n\nSo yes. If calling the soft-on-pedophilia party the Pedocrats gets votes, and it will, then more GOP pols should do it. Try to stop them from putting gay porn into the children's section at the local library and they'll slander you as a book burner. By all means call them groomers and worse.\n\nAnd let them do what Stahl did. Let them roll their eyes and whisper \"wow.\" And let them explain why they reflexively take all the positions somebody would take if they were actively trying to use culture and public policy to push pedophilia into the mainstream - sexualizing children in schools, libraries, pop culture, and elsewhere, exposing kids to Drag Queen Story Hour and worse, \"educating\" kids as young as 4 or 5 about sexual identities they aren't close to understanding, turning deviant sexual behavior into a civil rights cause (one imagines Martin Luther King might be turned into a source of electric power, so quickly is he spinning in his grave over the perversion of his movement).\n\nLet them tell us how that isn't the use of public policy and cultural hegemony for pedophiliac purposes. Let's have that argument. Let them scream \"QAnon!\" all they want, seeing as their overreaction to the Q phenomenon has already cost them the House. It's not an answer to the charge, by the way - by now, there's hardly an American alive who doesn't recognize the old saw that you might be paranoid but that doesn't mean they aren't out to get you.\n\nOr your kids.\n\nNot all Democrats are pedophiles. Not all pedophiles are Democrats. But it's clear which party is soft on the question, and it's also clear that the Democrats - or Pedocrats, if you prefer - are happy to cast aspersions not based in fact given all the names they call their opponents.\n\nAnd if they want to disprove MTG's allegations, then perhaps they can drop all of Biden's advocacy about trans kids and the like.\n\nOr maybe they can drop Biden, who looks for all the world like our most pedo-friendly president.\n\nEither way, the accusation ought to be repeated until it sticks.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene's Holocaust Comments Divide GOP - Again Republican lawmakers call her rhetoric \"insulting to Holocaust survivors.\"\n\nG eorgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's recent mask-wearing comments have drawn ire from both the public and her fellow legislators.\n\nIn a recent appearance for Real America's Voice on The Water Cooler with David Brody, Greene drew shocking comparisons between the Holocaust and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's request for proof of vaccination on the part of House members who choose to not wear a mask: \"You know, we can look back at a time in history where people were told to wear a gold star, and they were definitely treated like second class citizens, so much so that they were put in trains and taken to gas chambers in Nazi Germany, and this is exactly the type of abuse that Nancy Pelosi is talking about.\"\n\nGreene's comment attracted immediate fire, including from the American Jewish Congress, explicitly condemning her remarks:\n\nYou can never compare health-related restrictions with yellow stars, gas chambers & other Nazi atrocities.\n\nSuch comparisons demean the Holocaust & contaminate American political speech.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene must immediately retract and apologize. https://t.co/pdU8H8h2tO\n\n- American Jewish Congress (@AJCongress) May 21, 2021\n\nMost notably, Greene drew rebuke from her Republican counterparts, in a clear indication of rising tension within the party. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) scolded Greene for her comparison, stressing the House Republican Conference's condemnation of her remarks. In an official statement , McCarthy said, \"Marjorie is wrong, and her intentional decision to compare the horrors of the Holocaust with wearing masks is appalling. The Holocaust is the greatest atrocity committed in history. The fact that this needs to be stated today is deeply troubling.\"\n\nMichigan Rep. Peter Meijer joined in, condemning Greene's words: \"I don't even have words to describe how disappointing it is to see this hyperbolic speech.\" Meijer, a former intelligence adviser, went on to assert that Greene's analogy \"amps up and plays into a lot of the antisemitism that we have been seeing in our society today.\"\n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) added to the criticism, highlighting similarities between Greene's rhetoric and that of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.):\n\nRemember when we all criticized AOC for comparing detention centers to concentration camps?\n\nBecause it was so stupid and insulting to Holocaust survivors?\n\nYou're doing the same thing. Just stop.\n\nMembers of Congress should think before they speak. https://t.co/kQbmSNl2bM\n\n- Dan Crenshaw (@DanCrenshawTX) May 25, 2021\n\nFor her part, Greene has rebuffed her critics, claiming that she \"said nothing wrong.\" In an Arizona 12 News interview , Greene said, \"I think any rational Jewish person didn't like what happened in Nazi Germany & any rational Jewish person doesn't like what's happening with overbearing mask mandates and overbearing vaccine policies.\"\n\nGreene also went on in the Brody interview to call Speaker Nancy Pelosi \"mentally ill.\"\n\nHer comments, while drawing flak from Speaker Pelosi, have been met with relative silence from prominent leftist Democrats including Ocasio-Cortez and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar , even after Omar called recent proposed U.S. aid to Israel \"appalling.\"\n\nThis is far from the first time Rep. Greene's statements have caused tension within the GOP. In February, the House removed Greene from her committee assignments for numerous inflammatory statements, with Mitch McConnell asserting that \"Loony lies and conspiracy theories are cancer for the Republican Party and our country.\"\n\nA petition emerged after the Brody interview, quickly garnering more than 70,000 signatures, calling on House Minority Leader McCarthy to expel Greene from Congress, as her comments enable further division within the party.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "In Defense of Marjorie Taylor Greene Yes, she's a little out there, and yes, she says loony things. But let the Democrats clean up their act before the GOP sacrifices her.\n\nI 'll admit - I don't know a lot about Marjorie Taylor Greene, the freshman congresswoman from northwest Georgia who's become something of a bête noire on Capitol Hill in recent days.\n\nWhat I do know about her makes me want to like her. She filed an article of impeachment against Joe Biden on his first full day in the White House.\n\nThat ain't bad. It's certainly warranted, by the current standard in which Democrats have twice impeached Donald Trump on the basis of lies. Greene's impeachment argument is not a lie.\n\n\"President Joe Biden is unfit to hold the office of the presidency,\" she said when she filed her articles of impeachment. \"His pattern of abuse of power as President Obama's vice president is lengthy and disturbing. President Biden has demonstrated that he will do whatever it takes to bail out his son, Hunter, and line his family's pockets with cash from corrupt foreign energy companies.\"\n\nGreene cited the Burisma scandal, which isn't a lie. In fact, Biden is on video bragging about how he extorted the Ukrainian premier into firing the country's chief prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was looking into corruption involving that natural gas company, on which his son Hunter sat on the board. For no sensible reason other than that Hunter's daddy was the vice president of the United States and President Obama's point man on Ukraine.\n\nThat sure seems like a better count for impeachment than the one Nancy Pelosi ran up the flagpole against Trump a year ago; namely that Trump somehow did something wrong when he asked the Ukrainians to look into Biden's corruption involving their country.\n\nOh, but apparently Marjorie Taylor Greene believes kooky things and dabbles in conspiracy theories. She's played around with 9/11 trutherism and wondered aloud whether some of the mass shootings over the past several years, including the Parkland shooting, weren't false flag operations.\n\nMitch McConnell, the current avatar of the GOP establishment and perhaps the most bent politician in America (which isn't necessarily an unalloyed bad thing, as McConnell does nothing but play angles all day and some of them are even helpful to the cause), called Greene out for believing \"loony lies,\" and said that's a \"cancer\" for the Republican Party.\n\nWell, maybe he's right. And maybe Greene ought to rein in some of the weirder conversational points she's made in the past. Which is already happening. She's voiced an occasional bit of support for some of the QAnon stuff, though her communications director said last week, in emphatic fashion, that she thinks Q material is disinformation.\n\nIs she nuts? Is she misinformed? Is she undisciplined? Some of these things aren't the most sellable narratives around, sure. Nobody is asking the Republican Party to sign on to them, and the GOP certainly shouldn't.\n\nBut maybe before we all pile onto Greene and trash her as unworthy of Congress, we could consider backing up a few steps and taking a look at what's already in Congress. Because honestly, Greene doesn't look all that bad compared to what's been there for a long time.\n\nLet's ask Greene if she thinks Guam is going to tip over if we station too many Marines on it. Hank Johnson, the idiot congressman whose Atlanta-area district isn't too far away from Greene's, asked aloud about that in an on-the-record congressional hearing a few years ago.\n\nDid the Democrats' Powers That Be flip out over Johnson's buffoonery then? Hell, no - and if you made fun of Johnson for his second-grade command of geography and physics you're clearly a racist.\n\nHow about Sheila Jackson Lee, who when she's not wasting Congress' time with paeans to accused child molester and pop star Michael Jackson is bloviating about the peaceful coexistence between North and South Vietnam or insisting that Neil Armstrong planted the flag on Mars rather than the moon?\n\nNobody in the Democrat Party ever castigates Sheila Jackson Lee.\n\nNor did they castigate the ridiculous Frederica Wilson, who spent years demanding that the House allow her to pollute its chamber with her stupid plastic-and-sequins cowboy hats. Wilson called herself a \"rock star\" after the La David Johnston imbroglio, though at the time White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, a retired Marine general and gold star parent, burned her to the ground for having politicized President Trump's call to Johnston's family after she listened in. Wilson's response? Kelly was a racist.\n\nOf course he was.\n\nHave the Democrats tried to rein in Adam Schiff, the conspiracy-theory peddler they set up as the proprietor of their Trump-Russia hoax narrative? How thoroughly does Schiff have to be discredited before he loses his luster in their eyes? Joe McCarthy was run out of Washington on far less inaccuracy than Schiff is guilty of, and yet his blatant lies and insane bleatings continue unabated - and abetted by the left-wing cable news circuit.\n\nOr Eric Swalwell, another peddler of strange narratives whose own kitchen is hardly clean. Swalwell didn't even get taken off the House Intelligence Committee after it was found that he'd been compromised in a Chinese honey trap by a delightfully named female spy: Fang Fang. When you're a mark for a hostile foreign intelligence agency and they defend you as a member of the Intelligence Committee, it isn't like they get to impose standards on anyone else.\n\nWe could go on. We haven't even gotten to Maxine Waters, Mazie Hirono, Steve Cohen, Cory Booker, Emanuel \"Amen and Awomen\" Cleaver, Ilhan Omar, AOC, or the other members of the Squad, each of whom is far more bats**t crazy than Greene could ever be.\n\nThe thing is, the Democrats never discipline their loons. They weaponize them. They lionize them. They build little cults of personality around them, no matter how toxic their personalities might be. And then they sic their loons on the GOP.\n\nAOC, after all, responded to Ted Cruz's attempts to agree with her about the GameStop revolution by accusing him of trying to have her murdered. And we're going to be aghast that Greene wonders about space lasers starting forest fires?\n\nShe's on the House Education Committee. The Democrats want her off it. Considering what passes for education policy in the Democrat Party these days, highlighted by teaching little kids that biological differences between men and women are imaginary when those kids aren't held out of school based on unscientific fears of COVID spread, it's hard to see how Greene can do much harm.\n\nMcConnell and the other stuffed shirts in the Stupid Party need to wake up a little.\n\nGreene isn't a cancer. She isn't even a liability. Properly used, she's an asset.\n\nYou finally have somebody who can strike up a proper circus on Capitol Hill and blow up the other side's narrative with the proper amount of outrageous rhetoric, and you want to shut her up?\n\nWhy on Earth would you want to do that?\n\nGreene is a vessel you can fill up with every cockamamie accusation you could ever hurl at the Democrats and then pour her out all over cable news and the major newspapers. They won't be able to get enough of her. And when they call her every name in the book, the thing to do isn't to defend anything she says but to accuse her accusers of rank sexism and misogyny.\n\nThat's how it's done, isn't it?\n\nAnd please don't bore me with this business of how the GOP has to be \"better\" than engaging in such carnival barkery. That's a stinking pile of failure. It's what brought us John McCain and Paul Ryan, and the eight years of agony watching George W. Bush refuse to defend himself against a parade of calumnies such as the world had never seen.\n\nYou guys need to realize you're not better than the Democrats. Nobody thinks you are. You're politicians. Everybody thinks you're liars. The difference is the Democrats have more fun at it than you do. They're the Harlem Globetrotters and you're the Washington Generals. Most of us think that's how you like it.\n\nAnd with Marjorie Taylor Greene around, you don't even have to do anything. Just get out of the way. Say she's a nice lady and it's terrible all the mean things people say about her, shrug your shoulders, and then shut up.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "A House of Nut Jobs The media pretends Marjorie Taylor Greene is the only supposed wacko in Congress, but ignores other dangerous crazies.\n\nW hat can I say? From day to night I read Mainstream Media attacks on Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). The quotes and tweets ascribed to her raise eyebrows. Is she a nut job? The Mainstream Media agree that she is. The Democrats agree. So do Mitch McConnell and Mitt Romney. But all of those reporters and politicos, shall we say, have lost a bit of credibility over the past four years. And, besides, if McConnell is correct that Greene is a \"cancer\" for the GOP, then Rashida Tlaib is the bubonic plague and Ilhan Omar is blood-frogs-lice-mixed species-pestilence-boils-hail-locusts, etc.\n\nInasmuch as I am an Orthodox rabbi, I obviously get annoyed every time some new crazy thing is spread about Jews. Did Greene really say that \"the Rothschilds\" were going to start wild fires in California with some \"Jewish laser beam\" from the sun? Hmmm .\n\nCrazy People always go after \"The Jews.\" It's a shame because, like the boy who cried \"Wolf!\" they give an opening to others to yell false charges of \"Anti-Semitism!\" when good Americans very legitimately go after the evil George Soros. Soros indeed is evil. He has used his money for evil, in contrast from how the recently departed righteous Sheldon Adelson of blessed memory used his money to advance good in so many ways. It is not at all anti-Semitic to attack George Soros. I do it all the time, as do millions of Jews who love America. Not surprisingly, many prominent Jews call Soros an \"anti-Semite\" because he is a major enemy of Israel's policies, in league with some of her worst enemies.\n\nInasmuch as some Crazies go after \"the Jews\" in crazy ways, they create interference and protection for those on the Left eager to pounce on anyone who calls out the evil George Soros.\n\nThere are all kinds of Jews. Every single poll and survey in Israel - the only Jewish country in the world - shows that their forthcoming March 23 national election will see 70 percent of all votes cast for right-wing parties. Since that polling includes Arab voters, the polling more starkly shows that approximately 80 of the approximately 110 parliamentary seats that will be won by Jewish parties in March will go to the right wing. That is 72.7 percent right wing among the Jewish voters. Can American Catholics say that they are 72.7 percent right-wing? Can American Protestants? The Jews in the United Kingdom are the British conservative party's highest-percent demographic. The Jews of the former Soviet Union, from Russia to Ukraine to anywhere there, are the most anti-Communist people anyone ever will meet.\n\nSo it is tough to generalize about Jews. Milton Friedman , the intellectual architect of modern American conservative economic theory, was Jewish. Alice Rosenbaum - OK, pseudonymed Ayn Rand - conceived libertarianism and was Jewish. The Coalition for Jewish Values, on whose leadership executive I sit as a Senior Rabbinic Fellow, is comprised of 1,500 Orthodox rabbis who are deeply conservative on issues of American public policy. Indeed, Orthodox Jews are so deeply conservative that more than 90 percent just voted for Donald Trump. Jews include the likes of Mark Levin - the Great One broadcasting from the underground command post deep in the bowels of a hidden bunker somewhere under the brick and steel of a nondescript building. And Dennis Prager. And Ben Shapiro. And Jeff Jacoby. And Michael Savage. And Norman Podhoretz . Add to that Caroline Glick, Lucianne Goldberg, David Horowitz, Pamela Geller, Ben Stein , the late Andrew Breitbart, Noah Pollak, and Dov Hikind . Add the most powerful voices in American Orthodox public commentary, like Rabbi Aryeh Spero, Rabbi Meir Soloveichik, Rabbi Avrohom Gordimer , Rabbi Steven Pruzansky , and Rabbi Yaakov Menken . Add the National Council of Young Israel , an umbrella body of 25,000 families and 175 synagogues. The Zionist Organization of America . The largest-circulating independent Jewish newspaper in America, the Jewish Press . The prominent online English-language news source Israel National News, which covers American news in its news and opinion sections. Jewish World Review, an amazing collection of conservative voices. So the stereotype is darned unfair.\n\nOnce one starts generalizing about people, it goes in crazy ways. What do conservative Catholics think the rest of America wonders about Catholics and Catholicism when we read and see that Joe Biden defines himself as a practicing Catholic? And so does Nancy Pelosi. One after another: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, John Kerry, Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Tim Kaine, Robert O'Rourke, the Castro brothers, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, whom Biden has nominated to his cabinet, Sen. Dick Durbin, the Kennedy family of Massachusetts, Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Patty Murray, Sen. Ed Markey, Sen. Jack Reed, Sen. Bob Menendez, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, dozens of pro-abortion House members like Ted Lieu of California, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, and just so many others among American leftist celebrities, entertainers, and media personalities. In terms of overall numbers, Catholics tend to vote for Democrats over Republicans regularly .\n\nAnd, yet, reasonable and fair-minded non -Catholics do not stereotype all Catholics in the way that, in a dark American era, the Ku Klux Klan did. We see through the \"as a Catholic\" gambit and charade because there are the others who not only follow the dogma and teachings of Catholicism but who actually do live it as it is theologically constructed, and they promote their faith prominently and proudly. Our own views are impacted not only by Catholics on the left but also by those on the right, such as Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito, Rick Santorum, Jon Voight, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. James Risch, Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. John Hoeven, Rep. Peter King, Rep. Devin Nunes, Rep. Steve Scalise, Newt Gingrich, and so many others.\n\nSo it is unfair to generalize about people. And when the Crazies go for \"The Jews,\" we simply are society's \"canary in the coal mine.\" They don't stop with us. They never do.\n\nSo if dear Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene really believes what the Mainstream Media say she believes about Jews, that's not cool. If she thinks that \"Jewish lasers\" in space - under the aegis of \"Rothschild Inc.\" - start wild fires in California, then she's a nut job.\n\nThing is, I never heard of \"Rothschild Inc.\" I assumed it was a code word for - y'know - my Peeps. What would I know? I am only a synagogue rabbi of nearly 40 years, sat on the executive committee of the Rabbinical Council of America for six years, play that role at Coalition for Jewish Values, was a national vice president of the Zionist Organization of America, and other Jewish stuff. So what would I know? And then, the other day, someone told me that there actually is a company named that name. And some non-Jewish guy from the California electric utility PG&E - Pacific Gas and Electric - apparently sits on their board. And, as part of California's uber-environmental programming that causes us rolling blackouts all the time, California has required the electric company to cut back severely on maintenance and research and development of traditional electric sources, aiming instead to capture energy from the sun. So, I guess, if someone is a bit of a nut job to begin with, and hears that a PG&E guy - again not even Jewish - sits on the board of a company named \"Rothschild,\" and that guy is a biggie at PG&E, and PG&E is trying to capture solar energy from - d'uh! - the sun, I guess I can see where that craziness comes from. It's like almost all the parts: the bells are clanging, the sirens are blaring, the lights are flashing - it's just that the train ain't coming,\n\nThing also is, not every company named \"Rothschild\" is out there controlling the world for us Jews. Or, if they were, I am not sure why they keep it a secret from me, a guy who has paid his Jewish dues many times over. There is Rothschild Noritake china . ( Uh-oh : they control china?) There is the Rothschild berry farm. One Rothschild created a dance troupe. Another hanged himself, unaware he controls the world. Not long ago, some worm in the NBA, DeSean Jackson , a former professional basketball player, retweeted news that Jews were trying to divide the Black community. No better way to fight racism than to promote Jew-hatred! And in the course of apologizing to Don Lemon on CNN for all his anti-Semitic posts, Jackson said, \"You know who the Rothschilds are? They control all the banks. They own all the banks.\"\n\nEver hear of J. P. Morgan? Citibank? Bank of America? Wells Fargo? Industrial and Commercial Bank of China? China Construction Bank? Agricultural Bank of China? Bank of China? Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group? Banco Santander? Société Générale? Barclays? Deutsche Bank? Lloyds Banking Group ?\n\nAnd how come, if we Jews control all the banks, it takes two months and more - and endless demands for more documentation - for me to get approved on refinancing my mortgage?\n\nBut here's the thing : If Nancy Pelosi and Ocasio and her Goon Squad are so intent on evicting Marjorie Taylor Greene from the House of Representatives, how about all the other nut jobs and bat-crazy bigots and Jew-haters there?\n\nIt is time for parity. Republicans rapidly demote nut jobs, deny them committee assignments, and primary them out. By contrast, Democrats promote and elevate their certified loons. Maxine Waters - have you ever listened to this nut? Try this . Or take Ilhan Omar - Ilhan Omar cheated on a husband or a brother or whatever she was married to, pumped millions of campaign and COVID-relief funds into a company owned by a married guy who promoted her campaign, and then married the guy away from his wife . She also is a Jew-hater deluxe - even got voted the Year 2019 Anti-Semite of the Year . Meanwhile, Rashida Tlaib was a columnist for a Farrakhan publication and tweets a storm of anti-Israel invective with anti-Jewish tropes. When it comes to anti-Jewish hatred , no one in Congress can hold a candle to Tlaib and Omar. Thus, Rep. Burgess Owens is correct : Tlaib needs to be penalized severely over her ongoing anti-Semitism.\n\nIn a House of Representatives that has too many nut jobs who bring shame on our Congress, both Tlaib and Omar put Marjorie Taylor Greene to shame. It is a House filled with nut jobs. These are just the topping. Tlaib and Omar have been given several years to recant their hate, but those anti-Semites won't budge. Why are they treated with kid gloves? When will Mitch and Mitt demand that those two Jew-haters be ousted?\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Republicans Grill HHS Secretary After Watching Sound of Freedom New film on sex trafficking is making a difference.\n\nS ound of Freedom was released less than a month ago, but it's already having an impact in Congress.\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters that he would be holding a screening of the new film for members of Congress on Tuesday evening and that Tim Ballard, the founder of Operation Underground Railroad, who the film is based on, and actor Jim Caviezel would be in attendance.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Fla.) told Fox that she was looking forward to attending the screening, remarking, \"America is number 1 in the world in consuming child pornography and child sex trafficking, and the Biden Administration has lost over 85,000 migrant children.\" (RELATED: Sound of Freedom - Ringing Ticket Sales )\n\nThe following morning, Republican representatives swung into action during a U.S. House Energy Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations hearing . On Wednesday, they called on Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra to testify regarding the 85,000 missing children who crossed the southern border unaccompanied. Becerra dodged questions, asserting that the representatives' statements amounted to a \"misunderstanding.\"\n\n\"You and I don't agree on the policies that brought these children to our border. But I believe that no matter the policies, once they are in our care and we have taken on the responsibility for them, we must care for them properly,\" Subcommittee Chair Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) told Becerra during his opening remarks. \"It does appear that the children's welfare was not a primary concern.\"\n\nBecerra acknowledged reports indicating that companies are illegally employing and exploiting increasing numbers of children, but he claimed that the HHS has no legal responsibility for unaccompanied minors once it places them in the custody of a vetted sponsor.\n\nMorgan said that, as of March 31, 2023, the last time the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) published numbers for fiscal year 2023, they had processed almost 60,000 unaccompanied minors, \"putting the agency on pace for over 120,000 referrals for the third year in a row.\" ( VIDEO: The Absurd Media Reaction to Sound of Freedom )\n\nThe ORR and HHS are supposed to work together to identify and vet sponsors for children, placing them with close family members who live in the United States. Becerra told the subcommittee that fewer than 15 percent of children are placed with sponsors who are not their \"parent, legal guardian, or close family member.\"\n\nThe HHS performs checks on the minors, calling their sponsors a month after the children have begun living with their sponsors. According to data obtained by the New York Times , \"[T]he agency could not reach more than 85,000 children.\"\n\nThese children frequently become \"part of a new economy of exploitation.\" They frequently end up working on assembly lines or construction sites.\n\n\"Children [are] dropping out of school or never signing up as they owe a debt to the smuggler that trafficked them. Children [are] running away from their sponsors, the ones that ORR placed them with because they were being sold for sex,\" said Committee Chair Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) during the hearing .\n\nGriffith openly referenced Sound of Freedom during the hearing, citing a scene where a child sex trafficker claims to be the child's uncle, using fake documents to verify his relationship. He pointed out that the ORR uses DNA tests just 23 percent of the time to verify the relationship between children and those claiming to be their relatives.\n\nBecerra admitted that, while the department does use voluntary DNA testing, they frequently resort to using birth certificates and other documentation to verify an individual's identity.\n\n\"But a birth certificate coming from another country, just like the passports presented in the film last night, may be forged,\" Griffith said.\n\nIt's a testament to Sound of Freedom 's surprising success that the film is making waves among legislators.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) blasted a foreign reporter this week, making it clear that she should focus on the migrant issues in her own country.\n\nThe woman began asking a question, but Greene quickly asked her, \"What country are you from?\"\n\nThe reporter said she was from the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Okay. We don't give a crap about your opinion and your reporting. Why don't you go back to your country where you have a major migrant problem?\" Greene replied. \"You should care about your own borders.\"\n\n\"Do you care about American lives being put at risk?\" the reporter interjected.\n\n\"Let me tell you something. Do you care about people from your country? What about all the women that are raped by migrants?\" Greene asked.\n\n\"No, do you care - okay, you're done,\" she said as the reporter tried to interject.\n\n\"I don't care about your fake news,\" Greene said, taking a question from an American reporter who then asked for Greene to answer what the U.K. reporter was asking.\n\n\"I'm not answering her question because I don't care about her network. If you would like to ask, I can answer,\" she replied.\n\nUltimately, the American reporter asked if she had any concerns about what he described as the \"complete disregard of operational security from the top level of this administration.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"You want to know about complete disregard about operational security? You should talk about the Biden administration, how they ripped our borders open to terrorist cartel, child sex trafficking, human trafficking, and drug trafficking across our borders for four years,\" Greene replied.\n\n\"The Trump administration is doing a great job, and I stand by their statements.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) is calling on the FDA to pull approval of the coronavirus vaccines and remove them from the childhood vaccine schedule, citing links to \"permanent harm and deaths.\"\n\n\"FDA approval for COVID-19 vaccines needs to be pulled and they need taken off the childhood vaccine schedule ASAP,\" Greene began. \"COVID-19 vaccines are causing permanent harm and deaths.\"\n\nThe congresswoman noted she has been warning of this for quite some time but has been censored for expressing her concerns in the past.\n\n\"I've been saying this ever since they were created and my personal Twitter account was permanently banned for my outspoken stance against the vaccines until Elon Musk bought Twitter, changed it to X, and restored my account along with thousands of people who were censored and silenced,\" she said, concluding that the \"truth remains the same.\"\n\n\"COVID-19 vaccines should have never received approval and they've known the entire time how bad the side effects are and deaths caused by them. It's time to do the right thing,\" she added. \"Stop the COVID-19 vaccines.\"\n\nCoronavirus vaccines have been at the center of controversy since their introduction and have, indeed, been linked by some to conditions such as myocarditis.\n\nAt the time, in September 2021, former President Joe Biden said , \"This is not about freedom or personal choice ... It's about protecting yourself and those around you.\" He added that patience was \"wearing thin\" for unvaccinated Americans. And, despite his false claims , the coronavirus vaccine did not prevent transmission of the virus, nor did it prevent one from contracting it, either.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, polls indicated nearly one-third of Americans believed officials were lying about vaccine safety.\n\nFile/Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., conducts a news conference in the Capitol Visitor Center on the Fire Fauci Act, which aims to strip the salary of Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for his handling of COVID-19 on Tuesday, June 15, 2021. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\n\nBy January 2023, nearly half of Americans said it was at least somewhat likely that coronavirus vaccines had caused a \"significant number of unexplained deaths.\"\n\nFlorida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo was among those who led the way in bringing attention to the potential side effects of the vaccines, which caught little attention from mainstream outlets as the Biden administration attempted to force the jabs on millions upon millions of workers via Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).\n\nHe also made it clear that the vaccine would not be added to the child immunization schedule in the Sunshine State due to unanswered questions and lingering concerns over vaccine safety.\n\n\"CDC & FDA continue to push COVID vaccines that are not backed by clinical evidence, but blind faith alone with ZERO regard for widespread immunity,\" Ladapo said in a 2023 update, advising against coronavirus booster shots for most people.\n\n\"The American people deserve the truth, but the Biden admin only wants to control your behavior,\" he concluded.\n\nThe CDC's current childhood vaccine schedule lists one or more doses of the 2024-2025 coronavirus vaccine in the age bracket of 6 months to 15 months. It lists \"1 or more doses\" 18 months through 18 years as well.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) has also called for the end of the coronavirus vaccines.\n\n\"FDA should immediately revoke approval of these shots,\" he said.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

Especially when the NIH and these government agencies - most powerful agencies in our country - are recommending medical suggestions and advice and making up guidelines like six-feet distancing and masking of children,\" Greene said, asking Fauci, \"Do you think that's appropriate? Do the American people deserve to be abused like that, Mr. Fauci.\"\n\nGreene made waves in the room after refusing to refer to Fauci as doctor, stating, \"Because in my time that man does not deserve to have a license.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, it should be revoked, and he belongs in prison,\" she added.\n\nAfter a few minutes of back and forth among her colleagues due to her remark, Greene held up a picture of Fauci throwing out the first pitch at the Washington Nationals baseball game during the pandemic, as he ignored the mask and distancing rules, while everyone else had to stay home.\n\n\"Remember the cardboard cutout fans? That was one of the most insulting things to Americans, having to watch the games from home where you got to go and enjoy the game and sit right next to people, not following the six feet of distancing, not wearing your mask, and everyone else was forced to stay home and stop enjoying life,\" she said, noting that Fauci's science was \"displayed perfectly\" in the picture.\n\n\"Children in school were put in plastic bubbles because of your science - your repulsive, evil science. And let's go back to your very own email. ... This is your own email where you said the typical mask you buy in the drugstore is not really effective in keeping out virus. 'I do not recommend that you wear a mask.' This is your email. This is your own words. But yet children - children all over America were forced to wear masks. Healthy children, forced to wear masks, muzzled in their schools, and then they were forced to learn from home because of your so-called science and your medical suggestions,\" she said, noting that, all the while, Fauci and his \"cronies get paid from Big Pharma.\"\n\n\"You know that what this committee should be doing? We should be recommending you to be prosecuted. We should be writing a criminal referral because you should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity. You belong in prison, Dr. Fauci,\" she added.\n\nWATCH LIVE :\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Goes Off on Democrats for Accusing GOP of Worshipping 'Convicted Felon' Trump\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) went off on Democrats for accusing her and other Republicans of worshipping \"convicted felon\" former President Donald Trump, making it clear that Jesus is her only savior and pointing to the sheer hypocrisy of the radical left, explaining that they worshipped convicted felon George Floyd, which came with rioting and burning the country down.\n\nGreene made the remarks after Dr. Anthony Fauci's testimony before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic on Monday. During the hearing, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) lauded Fauci as a hero, accusing Republicans of treating the former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief as a \"convicted felon.\"\n\n\"Well, Dr. Fauci. I want to join my colleague from Florida and apologize that some of our colleagues in the United States House of Representatives seem to want to drag your name through the mud. They're treating you, Dr. Fauci, like a convicted felon,\" Raskin said before bringing Trump into the mix, albeit without uttering his name.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) questions Dr. Anthony Fauci during a House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on June 3, 2024. (JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty)\n\n\"Actually, you probably wish they were treating you like a convicted felon. They treat convicted felons with love and admiration. Some of them blindly worship convicted felons,\" Raskin said of Trump supporters.\n\nGreene defended the remarks she made during Fauci's testimony - which featured a fiery exchange - while also blasting Raskin's assertion that Trump supporters are worshipping a \"convicted felon.\"\n\n\"Everything I said is correct. It's how the American people feel. It's what we know to be a fact...all the evidence has been proven true. We have Jamie Raskin in there accusing us of worshipping Trump - worshipping a 'convicted felon,'\" she said, using air quotes.\n\nThe reporter pointed out that Trump \"is a convicted felon,\" which teed up Greene for a rebuttal.\n\n\"Well, yes, so was George Floyd, and everybody - and you all, too, the media - worshipped George Floyd. Democrats worshipped George Floyd. There were riots burning down the fucking country over George Floyd, and Raskin is in there saying we worship him [Trump],\" she said.\n\n\"Excuse me, let me correct you - and this is really important - I don't worship - I worship God. God. And Jesus is my Savior. I don't worship President Trump, and I'm really sick and tired of the bullshit antics I have to deal with constantly from the Democrats,\" the congresswoman said, explaining that it is unfair that Democrats can attack her character \"all day long.\"\n\n\"Whoever was talking last was calling me insane, but, yet, we can't say, 'Oh, they're attacking my character.' Oh, no. It's nonstop BS and antics,\" she said, telling the reporter that Democrats continue the antics because they \"don't have anything.\"\n\n\"They're responsible for the lockdowns, forced vaccinations, kids being forced to stay home, people committing suicides, and all the horrors that this country lived through during COVID,\" she said, doubling down on what she said during the hearing.\n\n\"Fauci belongs in prison. He should be tried for mass murder. And he should be tried for crimes against humanity. That's how I feel after that hearing. That's how the American people feel,\" she added.\n\nWATCH:\n\nDuring the hearing, Greene ripped Fauci for his so-called commitment to science, questioning some of the things that happened under his watch, including cruel, taxpayer-funded experiments on dogs, as well as forced masking.\n\n\"You know what this committee should be doing? We should be recommending you to be prosecuted. We should be writing a criminal referral because you should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity,\" she said at the end of her line of questioning. \"You belong in prison, Dr. Fauci.\"\n\nWATCH the entire hearing below:\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) will chair the subcommittee tasked with working with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to slash wasteful spending throughout the federal government.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) will create the new Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE) subcommittee and tap Greene to lead it in January, Fox News Digital reported Thursday.\n\nWATCH - MTG Dunks on Democrat Meltdown over \"Disinformation,\" Project 2025 in FEMA Oversight Hearing:\n\nMusk and Ramaswamy were tasked by Trump to lead DOGE to displace the power of the federal bureaucracy and return it to the \"people we elect [to] run the government,\" Musk and Ramaswamy outlined Wednesday in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. The DOGE subcommittee is likely to be the conduit for House investigations to aid the department's work.\n\nComer has met with Ramaswamy and his incoming DOGE team, Fox News Digital reported.\n\n\"A key step to driving greater efficiency in government is exposing the problem to the public - we are grateful that the House Oversight Committee has created a subcommittee to focus on this work,\" a spokesperson for Ramaswamy told the publication. \"We look forward to working together.\"\n\nGreene told Fox News Digital \"I'm excited to chair this new subcommittee designed to work hand in hand with President Trump, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and the entire DOGE team. We will identify and investigate the waste, corruption and absolutely useless parts of our federal government.\"\n\nShe added the subcommittee will provide \"transparency and truth to the American people through hearings\" and that \"no topic will be off the table.\"\n\nGreene singled out the bureaucrats behind the Pentagon's routinely failed audits as among those who \"will be getting a pink slip.\"\n\nThe Oversight Committee must shift its focus after years of investigations into Joe Biden and his family's corruption. The creation of the new DOGE subcommittee is a signal of where the committee will train its sights.\n\nComer told Fox News Digital that DOGE \"will align with the Trump administration's priorities to eliminate government waste, streamline the federal government's operations and cut red tape that's stifling jobs and increasing costs for the American people.\"\n\nWATCH - Update Your Resumes! Vivek Lays Out Plan for Mass Deep State Firings:\n\n\"I look forward to working with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to deliver on these goals to Make America Great Again,\" Comer added.\n\nTrump has set the bar high for the new department, saying he hopes DOGE will become the \"Manhattan Project of our time.\"\n\n\"Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of DOGE for a very long time,\" he said.\n\nWhile chairmanships and even committee membership await assignment by the Steering Committee, Comer is not expected to face a challenger to lead the Oversight Committee.\n\nBradley Jaye is a Capitol Hill Correspondent for Breitbart News.

      "text": "'He Belongs In Prison!': Hearing Goes Off Rails When MTG Refuses To Call Fauci 'Doctor'\n\nScreenshot/Rumble/House Oversight Committee\n\nA Monday hearing became contentious when Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene refused to call Dr. Anthony Fauci a doctor.\n\nFauci, who was formerly the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), testified to the House Oversight Committee on Monday. Greene refused to call Fauci \"doctor,\" instead referring to him as \"mister,\" saying he does not deserve the title and that he should be in prison, with members objecting to her choice of words. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: House, Senate Republicans Demand Agencies Terminate Grant Funding To EcoHealth)\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"Mr. Fauci, you were quoted on CBS 'Face the Nation' saying, 'it's easy to criticize, but they're really criticizing science, because I represent science. Do you represent science, Mr. Fauci?\" Greene asked.\n\nFauci declined to give a yes or no answer, leading to a clash, but he asserted he is a scientist.\n\nGreene then brought up how NIAID, under Fauci, directed $424,455 to researchers at the University of Georgia in September 2020 to infect dozens of beagles with disease-causing parasites in order to test an experimental drug on them, according to documents obtained by White Coat Waste Project (WCW) and reviewed by the Daily Caller.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JULY 31: Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testifies before a House Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis hearing on July 31, 2020, in Washington, DC. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch-Pool/Getty Images)\n\n\"I want to tell you this is disgusting and evil, what you signed off on and these experiments that happened to beagles paid for by the American taxpayer, and I want you to know Americans don't pay their taxes for animals to be tortured like this, so this type of science that you are representing, Mr. Fauci, is abhorrent and it needs to stop,\" Greene said.\n\n\"You're not doctor you're Mr. Fauci,\" she added.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland objected to Greene over not calling Fauci a doctor, with Greene protesting.\n\n\"In terms of the rules of decorum, are we allowed to deny that a doctor is a doctor just because we don't want him to be a doctor?\" Raskin asked.\n\n\"Yes, because in my time, that man does not deserve to have a license. As a matter of fact, it should be revoked and he belongs in prison,\" Greene said.\n\nThe hearing then delved into contentiousness with representatives saying Greene's questioning was inappropriate and violated rules, before she continued on.\n\nGreene was told to call Fauci by his title.\n\n\"You belong in prison, Dr. Fauci,\" she concluded.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Files Complaint Requesting Criminal Investigation Into Fani Willis\n\n(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nRepublican Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a complaint Wednesday requesting a criminal investigation into Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.\n\nWillis, who brought the racketeering case against Trump and co-defendants for alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia, allegedly hired a man she is romantically involved with as special prosecutor and approved \"lucrative\" compensation that he in turn used to take her on vacations, a motion filed by a Trump co-defendant Monday alleged. Greene sent a criminal referral to Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Attorney General Chris Carr on Wednesday expressing \"serious concerns\" about the allegations, NBC News reported .\n\n\"I request you order the immediate and formal criminal investigation into the alleged criminal misconduct by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, along with her special Trump prosecutor and alleged boyfriend Nathan Wade, pursuant to your authority under Georgia statute,\" Greene wrote . (RELATED: Could Allegations About Fani Willis' 'Improper' Romantic Relationship Sink Her Racketeering Case Against Trump?)\n\nWade has been paid nearly $1,000,000 in legal fees since he was appointed, the motion filed Monday alleged. Additionally, the motion alleged Wade used funds he received from Fulton County to pay for vacations he took with Willis.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis arrives to speak at a news conference at the Fulton County Government building on August 14, 2023 in Atlanta, Georgia. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe motion does not cite hard evidence of the pair's relationship or the alleged vacations but states that \"sources close to both the special prosecutor and the district attorney have confirmed they had an ongoing, personal relationship.\"\n\nWade's billing statements submitted with the motion include \"one billing for 24 hours on a single day,\" and two trips to Washington, D.C., to meet with Biden's White House staff, Greene wrote.\n\n\"This is part of Fani Willis' unlawful partisan pattern, through her words and deeds, to illegally politicize and weaponize her public office to wage lawfare against President Trump for the purpose of interfering in the 2024 presidential election,\" the letter states.\n\nThe allegations could violate a slew of Georgia statutes, Greene noted, including violations of public oath, bribery, improper influence of a government official, criminal conspiracy,  conspiracy to defraud government, racketeering, false statements and concealment, Fulton County's gift ban and more.\n\nThe Fulton County District Attorney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's attempt to remove House GOP Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership position.\n\nGreene first filed the motion to vacate on March 22 during the latest appropriations fight, and the effort has picked up the support from Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona. House Democratic leadership vowed to help save Johnson from Greene's motion if she moves forward with it after the speaker advanced the foreign aid supplemental last week, according to a press release. (RELATED: Dem Rep Says He Would 'Table' Any Motion To Remove Johnson Following Approval Of Ukraine Funding)\n\n\"From the very beginning of this Congress, House Democrats have put people over politics and found bipartisan common ground with traditional Republicans in order to deliver real results. At the same time, House Democrats have aggressively pushed back against MAGA extremism. We will continue to do just that,\" the statement read. \"At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican obstruction. We will vote to table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she invokes the motion, it will not succeed.\"\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) holds a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol following a private visit to the Holocaust Museum, to express contrition for previous remarks about Jewish people, in Washington, U.S. June 14, 2021. (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein)\n\nThe House voted to pass a foreign aid package on April 20 that green-lit $60.8 billion in aid to Ukraine, as well as $24 billion to Israel and $8 billion to Taiwan. The legislation, which subsequently passed the Senate and was signed by President Joe Biden, also included provisions to increase pressure on Iran and China, as well as language that could force ByteDance - the CCP-linked parent company of TikTok - to sell the social media app.\n\n\"For months, House Republicans irresponsibly delayed critical security assistance to our democratic allies in Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific, while simultaneously blocking humanitarian assistance to civilians in harm's way in places like Gaza, Haiti and the Sudan,\" the statement read. \"Thanks to a bipartisan coalition of Democrats and Republicans, led by President Biden, we were finally able to meet the national security needs of the American people.\"\n\nJohnson reacted to the news during a press conference on Tuesday, telling reporters that he did not make a deal with the Democrats.\n\n\"I have to do my job. We have to do what we believe to be the right thing. What the country needs right now is a functioning Congress. They need a Congress that works well, works together and does not hamper its own ability to solve these problems,\" said Johnson. \"We saw what happened with the motion to vacate the last time - Congress was closed for three weeks. No one can afford for that to happen.\"\n\n\"We need people who are [sic] serious about the job here, to continue to do that job and get it done. So, you know, I have to [sic] do what I believe is right every day and let the chips fall where they may. You've heard me say that many times, and will continue to,\" Johnson added.\n\nGreene took to social media following the Democrats' announcement, which she characterized as being the party's \"official endorsement of [Johnson's] Speakership.\"\n\n\"If the Democrats want to elect him Speaker (and some Republicans want to support the Democrats' chosen Speaker), I'll give them the chance to do it,\" Greene wrote on X. \"I'm a big believer in recorded votes because putting Congress on record allows every American to see the truth and provides transparency to our votes. Americans deserve to see the Uniparty on full display.

Nikki Haley, who is reportedly expected to drop out after getting trounced by former President Donald Trump in the Republican primary. Greene said Haley should drop out of the race and support Trump.\n\nMailtlis then asked why she and many other supporters of Trump support conspiracy theories.\n\n\"And can you tell me why so many people that support Donald Trump love conspiracy theories, including yourself? He seems to attract lots of conspiracy theorists,\" Maitlis said.\n\n\"Well, let me tell you. You're a conspiracy theorist and the left and the media spreads more conspiracy theories. We like the truth, we like supporting our constitution, our freedoms and America First,\" Greene said.\n\n\"What about Jewish space lasers?\" the reporter asked. \"Tell us about Jewish space lasers.\"\n\n\"Why don't you talk about Jewish space lasers and really, why don't you fuck off? How about that?\" Greene said.\n\nMailtis referred to Greene reportedly pushing a claim in 2018 that the Rothschild family, a Jewish family who owns an investment group, started a California wildfire by using space lasers in a Facebook post. The congresswoman has deleted the post, according to Newsweek. (RELATED: CNN Interview Goes Sideways When Woman Compares Marjorie Taylor Greene To Jesus Christ)\n\nGreene arrived at Mar-a-Lago to celebrate Super Tuesday, in which Trump secured major victories in every state except Vermont. The former president currently has 995 delegates, veering closer to the 1,215 needed to secure the nomination.\n\nFollow Nicole Silverio on Twitter @NicoleMSilverio\n\nTRENDING\n\n©2025 The Daily Caller, Inc.\n\nThe Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006\n\nSubscription Type\n\nUnlimited digital access to The Daily Caller\n\nPremium Article: Subscribe for $1 to read the rest.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nAlready have an account?

      "text": "LT. GOV. BURT JONES AND REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: It's Time To Increase Penalties For 'Swatting'\n\nLeft: (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Right: (Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)\n\nBetween the two of us and our families, we have been swatted 14 separate times. Thankfully, none of these instances has resulted in injury to us, our families, or law enforcement officers who are needlessly put in harm's way.\n\nEach time we've been swatted, our brave law enforcement officers wasted vital resources and manpower tending to a call that was meant to stoke fear, chaos, and violence. This type of deranged behavior cannot be allowed to continue.\n\nFor those who are unaware, swatting is the act of anonymously reporting a fake emergency at someone's home to the police. The intent is to force law enforcement officers to show up at the homes of elected officials, other prominent people, and even everyday citizens to cause chaos. Swatting can have deadly consequences, as in the tragic case of Mark Parkinson in Northwest Georgia in late 2017.\n\nAlong with the attacks on elected officials and innocent citizens, these swatting incidents are also an attack on our law enforcement. Our brave officers put their lives on the line every day to keep our families safe. These spineless swatters directly place them in harm's way by calling in fake emergencies. Additionally, swatting is a blatant abuse of police resources. These swatting incidents divert police resources that are oftentimes already stretched far too thin. Every second spent responding to a fake emergency is wasted time that our law enforcement could spend fighting the skyrocketing waves of crime that we have all witnessed across our nation. We will not stand for these anti-police acts.\n\nIt's no accident that recent swatting incidents have mostly targeted one side of the political spectrum. Swatting has become a tool of the radical Left to attack and potentially cause harm to pro-Trump, America First conservatives who pose a very real threat to those on the Left. They wish us harm because they hate the way we fight for an America First agenda.\n\nLet's be very clear: swatting is the act of a coward. The radical Left can't win the fight over ideas in the public square and chooses to hide behind anonymity and incite violence. There are serious consequences to these actions, and we will fight together in Washington and in Georgia to increase penalties for this crime. While swatting is not currently a federal crime, we are fighting together to change that and make sure these criminals are brought to justice.\n\nIn Georgia, we are advancing legislation that will strengthen sentences for these criminal offenses. No longer will someone simply receive a slap on the wrist for committing such a heinous and cowardly crime. Increased sentences will help to both deter future criminal activity while enabling law enforcement to properly punish criminals. In Washington, we are working to make it easier for our law enforcement officers to catch these criminals. It is essential that we take this issue seriously, so that we can end this practice.\n\nIf these swatting incidents are allowed to continue, it will result in someone being seriously injured or killed, just like the tragedy in Walker County. No one's family should ever again have to experience a swatting call. Those of us who have experienced a swatting incident are not afraid of those who wish us harm. We are simply emboldened.\n\nWe will not be silenced in our mission to deliver conservative, America First wins for our nation and state. No matter how hard they may try, those who wish us harm will not interfere with our capacity and willingness to lead.\n\nBurt Jones has served as Georgia's lieutenant governor since 2023.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene has represented Georgia's 14th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2021.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller.\n\nTRENDING\n\n©2025 The Daily Caller, Inc.\n\nThe Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006\n\nSubscription Type\n\nUnlimited digital access to The Daily Caller\n\nPremium Article: Subscribe for $1 to read the rest.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nAlready have an account?

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) rebuffed a reporter hounding her over President Donald Trump's sweeping January 6 pardons .\n\nHours after being sworn into office, Trump signed an executive order pardoning nearly all individuals charged with J6-related crimes.\n\n\"Is this all you're really talking about, is the J6ers have been pardoned?\" MTG asked the reporter, to which the reporter responded, \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Okay, are you gonna talk about the Biden family that got pardoned? No?\" Greene continued to push. \"I haven't -,\" the reporter replied.\n\nTo much controversy, former President Joe Biden pardoned five members of his family with only minutes left of his time in office.\n\n\"Okay, what about the rapers [sic], killers, and murders that Joe Biden pardoned - there are tons of them - is that a focus at all?\" Greene once again asked, only to receive a response that the reporter was focused on the J6 issue.\n\nIn late December, Biden commuted the death sentences of dozens of convicted killers, including a man who murdered a police officer and a man who kidnapped and murdered a 12-year-old girl.\n\n\"I know what you're asking about - I'm not doing this,\" Greene told the reporter. \"This insane place up here, and all of y'all's obsession with January 6 is absurd. Everybody outside of here is sick and f***ing tired of it. I'm serious.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden pardoned all these murderers and rapists and disgusting people, and then everybody up here has got their panties in a wad because J6ers got pardoned,\" the lawmaker continued. \"A lot of them walked through open doors. That's it.\"\n\nGreene then suggested the reporter \"go do a story on all the antifa and BLM (Black Lives Matter) people who never served time, over 95% of them. Seriously, think about that. Go do a story on all these cities BLM burned to the ground, and they never built back.\"\n\nCELEBRATE #47 WITH 47% OFF DAILYWIRE+ MEMBERSHIPS + A FREE $20 GIFT\n\nBefore the interaction ended, MTG talked about the distrust the legacy media had fomented in the American people. \"You are not trusted and people are sick of you,\" she told the reporter.\n\nGreene posted the interaction to her X account with the caption: \"After 4 yrs, I'm fed up with Washington DC press.

      "text": "Exclusive Interview: Marjorie Taylor Greene Says She Hasn't Changed, The Party Has\n\nThe firebrand conservative congresswoman discussed her views at her office.\n\nAs Marjorie Taylor Greene traded whispers on the House floor with the most powerful man in the chamber earlier this month, the headlines turned apoplectic.\n\nThe Georgia congresswoman's close alliance with Kevin McCarthy was on full display during his chaotic fight to become House speaker, a fight he ultimately won, in part thanks to Greene vouching for his conservative credentials. Pundits immediately began gesticulating about the \"normalization\" of the so-called \" QAnon congresswoman ,\" known by her fans and critics alike by just her initials, \"MTG,\" and her unapologetically America First brand.\n\nProximity to power is a new look for Greene, who was kicked off her committees by Democrats shortly after she took office and shunned as a pariah by leadership during her first term. She has since distanced herself from her most controversial comments, but that has not stopped her critics from insisting she is dangerous.\n\nNow, Greene appears poised to be a potent influence on the GOP agenda in the House, fueling speculation she is rebranding into a sanitized, more palatable version of herself.\n\nIn an interview at her Washington, D.C. office last week, Greene bristled at the suggestion she has changed.\n\n\"Nothing changed about me and didn't need to change,\" Greene said, sporting jeans as she sat opposite a wall covered nearly to the ceiling in framed photos of her family. \"I haven't changed my views. I haven't changed my political positions.\"\n\nIt's the party that has changed, she said.\n\n\"What has changed is the Republican Party has been pushed to the right. The Republican Party has been pushed to be more America First,\" Greene said.\n\nGreene said she has tried to \"constantly echo\" the concerns of \"Mr. and Mrs. American, regular Americans,\" who have been \"totally neglected\" in Washington. She has done this in public and private, from floor speeches to conference meetings to private meetings with McCarthy and others in leadership, she said.\n\n\"So if there's anything that has changed, I think the Republican Party cares more about Americans, and they need to continue to do that,\" she said.\n\nAs for her critics, \"people were lying about me. They lied about a lot,\" she said. \"The media has lied about me extensively and called me horrific names that don't reflect who I am.\"\n\nHer staunch support for McCarthy through the House speaker fight was both pragmatic and principled, she said.\n\n\"I don't pick a fake fight, and that was a fake fight,\" Greene said.\n\nGreene whipped votes for McCarthy as he frantically tried to quell an internal rebellion from a group of her fellow Freedom Caucus members, led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL).\n\nEventually, McCarthy was successfully installed as speaker after 15 votes over four days when the insurgents finally relented, but not before he agreed to several concessions. One was a rules change called \"motion to vacate the chair,\" meaning one member can effectively force a vote to remove McCarthy as speaker at any point. Other concessions included an end to COVID mandates and funding, a committee to investigate the FBI's alleged weaponization against its political enemies, more single-subject bills, and a promise not to increase the debt ceiling in the next federal budget.\n\nGreene insists the much-touted concessions changed little, and said Gaetz and company exaggerated their significance.\n\n\"Don't lie to make yourself look like you're conservative or make yourself look anti-establishment when you're not changing anything,\" she said.\n\nRepublicans simply do not have enough conservatives to elect someone like McCarthy's challenger Representative Andy Biggs (R-AZ), the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, Greene said.\n\n\"I dream of a conservative speaker too. It's just impossible to get one,\" she said, adding that McCarthy is \"willing to listen\" and \"willing to fight\" on conservative agenda items.\n\nMeanwhile, there was a danger during the speaker fight that Democrats would band together with moderate Republicans to choose their own speaker, Greene said. She overheard Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) sitting behind her discussing their lists of names and how to get to 218 votes, the threshold for a speaker to be elected, she said.\n\n\"It was literally happening. It was happening,\" Greene said.\n\nHowever, her support for McCarthy does not mean she will \"line up with leadership all the time\" or \"fight the Freedom Caucus\" from now on, she assured.\n\n\"No, that's not the case,\" Greene said. \"My voting record will still be the same. I still support the same views and values, and I'm gonna continue to fight on those things. I'm just not willing to do it for no reason, just to look tough or look a certain way in the public eye.\"\n\nIn the meantime, it feels good to finally have a Republican majority in the House, she said.\n\n\"I've been comparing it to the land of Narnia, when the ice queen, all the ice melted, and everything turned green again, and she was no longer in power,\" Greene quipped.\n\nHowever, she cautioned that she is not more optimistic than two years ago since Republicans are still hamstrung in the Senate and White House.\n\n\"I'm pretty grounded in my thinking,\" she said. \"We have to move the ball down the field. But I don't think we'll be scoring any major touchdowns these two years.\"\n\nNevertheless, Greene's critics are spinning over her new spots on the House Oversight and Homeland Security Committees.\n\nShe is particularly eager to get started on the Oversight committee, where she anticipates investigating Hunter Biden's laptop, specifically the president's son's bank records, which allegedly show suspicious transfers of funds that were flagged by U.S. banks . Greene thinks these alleged suspicious transfers could potentially implicate President Biden in Hunter's foreign business dealings.\n\nShe will also sit on Oversight's COVID select subcommittee , which she says will investigate the origins of COVID and the roles of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the National Institute of Health, the CDC, and the FDA in the pandemic response.\n\n\"We have a lot to investigate, and we need more than two years,\" Greene said.\n\nHouse Republicans have a packed agenda for legislation as well as investigations over the next two years. On the table is the budget, including potentially slashing funding for the Department of Defense to start whittling down the country's $32 trillion debt. Since the speaker fight, House Republicans have already passed a bill nixing $71 billion in funding for the IRS. They have also passed two abortion-related measures, one condemning the recent physical attacks on crisis pregnancy centers and another that would send doctors to prison for up to five years if they refuse to care for an infant born alive after an abortion attempt.\n\nAlthough House Republicans will struggle to get their bills approved by the Democrat-controlled Senate, Greene intends to get her gender identity bill passed in the House in the next two years. The bill would make it a felony to perform so-called \"gender-affirming care\" on minors.\n\nThe harms of gender ideology on children are \"on par with abortion,\" she said, and should be \"number one.\"\n\n\"Abortion is such a lie to women that you can kill this baby in your womb and make your dreams and goals come true,\" she said. \"But this gender lie, this attack on God's creation is so destructive to a child's development and how they see themself that it's literally the same type of thing.\"\n\nFor nearly two years, Greene has displayed a sign outside her office that reads, \"There are TWO genders: male and female. Trust the science!\"\n\n\"I told my staff it's never coming down,\" she said.\n\nBeyond this Congress, Republicans need total control of both chambers and the White House to effect significant change, Greene said. Greene has already endorsed former president Trump for a second term in 2024, and she would love to see him \"finish out what he started.\" To win again though, Trump will need to \"capture the spirit of 2016 but also move forward with the issues today,\" Greene said.\n\n\"He came into this town not knowing who the bad actors were, but he has a list of them now, and I'd love to see him clean house,\" she said. \"I think anybody counting President Trump out is totally reading it wrong just like they read it wrong in 2015.\"\n\nAs for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, seen as Trump's strongest potential challenger for the Republican nomination, Greene said he should stay governor for \"as long as possible\" since he is an excellent example to other Republican governors on how to keep their states \"safe\" and \"great places for conservative Americans to live.\"\n\nIf Greene's vision of a unified Republican government materializes in 2024, the party will have a long list of agenda items as it tries to make up for lost time under Biden.\n\nIf her bond with leadership has staying power until then, MTG could find herself a VIP.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who organized the hearing titled \"Anti-American Airwaves,\" slammed PBS and NPR as \"radical left-wing echo chambers\" that publish biased news reports with government subsidies and LGBTQ programming intent on \"grooming children,\" The New York Times reported .\n\nNPR chief executive Katherine Maher and PBS chief executive Paula Kerger were brought in for questioning by Greene as the chairwoman of the new Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency.\n\nKatherine Maher, who became CEO of NPR last year, backtracked on her organization's coverup of the Hunter Biden laptop story during the 2020 campaign prior to her tenure.\n\n\"Our current editorial leadership thinks that was a mistake, as do I,\" Maher testified, facing tough questioning from Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe old tweets are coming out to haunt the NPR CEO: \"Why did you call President Trump a 'fascist' and a 'deranged racist sociopath' in 2020?\" pic.twitter.com/ggcpPCSvzi\n\n- Christopher F.

Tim Burchett (R-TN) revealed 2020 tweets from Maher describing President Trump as a \"racist\" and \"sociopath,\" which Maher says she now regrets.\n\nWhen pressed on the tweets by Rep. Greene, Maher expressed regret, saying, \"They represented a time where I was reflecting on something that the president had said rather than who he is.\"\n\nThese admissions came as Rep. James Comer (R-KY) stated, \"I don't even recognize NPR anymore,\" adding that while he relied on public radio for news growing up in rural Kentucky, he now likens it to \"propaganda.\"\n\nFormer NPR senior business editor Uri Berliner, who resigned after publishing an essay critical of the network's leftward shift, was referenced by Republican lawmakers as further evidence of the outlet's bias.\n\nIn a text message to The New York Times, he wrote that he believes the organization should \"openly acknowledge and embrace its progressive orientation\" and decline federal support, contradicting Maher's claims of NPR's supposed objectivity.\n\nPBS CEO Paula Kerger defended her network, arguing that \"there's nothing more American than PBS\" and describing it as a crucial source of accurate information and educational programming for millions of Americans.\n\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a government-funded company, received $535 million from the government this year, with millions of dollars going directly to NPR and PBS.\n\nRepresentative William Timmons (R-SC) pressed PBS's Kerger about a digital segment titled \"Drag Queen Story Hour,\" which featured drag performers reading to children. Kerger responded that the segment never aired on PBS television and was removed after being \"mistakenly added\" to the network's website.\n\nRepresentative Greene pointed to a photograph of drag performer Lil Miss Hot Mess featured in PBS programming, calling the entertainer a \"monster\" and accusing the network of using \"taxpayer funds to push some of the most radical left positions.\"\n\nKerger rejected these characterizations and defended PBS programming as educational and appropriate for its audiences.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

The Senate introduced a resolution condemning the spate of attacks on Tesla as domestic terrorism. And prominent conservatives are being targeted in swatting hoaxes.\n\nIt's Thursday, March 27, and this is the news you need to know to start your day. If you'd rather listen to your news, today's edition of the Morning Wire podcast can be heard below:\n\n(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nTopline: Congress continued its investigation of \"Signal Gate\" on Monday while the House Oversight Committee grilled NPR and PBS leaders on bias at the taxpayer-funded outlets.\n\nThe purpose of the \"Anti-American Airwaves\" hearing was to determine if NPR and PBS should continue to receive federal funding. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a government-funded company that received $535 million in taxpayer dollars this year, with millions of dollars going directly to NPR and PBS.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who organized the hearing, slammed PBS and NPR as \"radical left-wing echo chambers\" that publish biased news reports with government subsidies and LGBTQ programming intent on \"grooming children.\" NPR CEO Katherine Maher admitted under questioning that it was \"concerning\" there were no Republicans on NPR's editorial board - all 87 are Democrats. Maher said that NPR was \" mistaken in failing to cover the Hunter Biden laptop story more aggressively and sooner.\" But perhaps the most revealing moment came when Texas Republican Congressman Brandon Gill grilled her about her past tweets:\n\nGILL: Do you believe that America believes in black plunder and white democracy?\n\nMAHER: I don't believe that sir.\n\nGILL: You tweeted that in reference to a book you were reading at the time apparently, The Case for Reparations.\n\nMAHER: I don't think I've ever read that book, sir.\n\nGILL: You tweeted about it. You said you took a day off to fully read The Case For Reparations. You put that on twitter in January 2020... Do you believe that white people inherently feel superior to other races?\n\nMAHER: I do not.\n\nGILL: You don't? You tweeted something to that effect. You said \"I grew up feeling superior. Ha! How white of me. Why did you tweet that?\n\nPBS CEO Paula Kerger defended her network from allegations of partisanship and bias, arguing that \"there's nothing more American than PBS\" and describing it as a crucial source of accurate information and educational programming for millions of Americans. Several Republican members of the committee disputed that characterization.\n\n\" There was an analysis done on PBS's NewsHour from June to November of 2023,\" Rep. Pat Fallon (R-TX) said. \"Where they found that far-right was used 162 times and far-left was only used six times. \"\n\n(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\n\nTopline: Should the attacks on Tesla cars and showrooms be condemned as \"domestic terrorism\"? A Senator introduces a resolution on the violence.\n\nAmid a wave of vandalism targeting Tesla and DOGE, Republicans in the Senate are bringing a resolution to condemn what they say is an orchestrated \"domestic terrorism\" campaign empowered by leftist groups.\n\nMorning Wire spoke with Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) about the attacks.\n\n\"It is stunning that we are seeing this take place, and that Democratic leadership is not standing up and calling out these acts of domestic terrorism.\" Sen. Blackburn told Morning Wire. \"We have lived through four years, where every time you turned around, they were talking about domestic terrorism, they were calling parents that went to school board meetings domestic terrorists. They were calling individuals that would stand across the street from a Planned Parenthood and pray for the women and the unborn children, and they would call that 'domestic terrorism.'\"\n\n\"And now we are going through this, where they're actually firebombing and shooting up Tesla dealerships. They are destroying the cars of Tesla owners. They are stopping people in the middle of the streets that are driving a Tesla, and are condemning them for owning those vehicles and nothing is being said. So we think it's appropriate that we have the resolution, and we give them the opportunity - members of the U.S. Senate from each party and the couple of independents that we have - give them the opportunity to stand up and say we condemn these attacks.\"\n\nThe resolution is expected to reach the floor of the Senate on Thursday.\n\n(Photo by Chris Clor via Getty Images)\n\nTopline: Prominent conservatives are being \"swatted\" - a dangerous hoax where someone falsely reports a serious crime to law enforcement and causes them to show up at a person's house fully armed.\n\nSwatting has been employed as a vindictive tactic for decades and has sometimes resulted in serious injury or even death, but recently, the number of swatting cases has jumped to alarming levels. CNN reported that at least a dozen Trump-supporting influencers have been swatted in the last two weeks.\n\nThe targets have been an eclectic group: private citizens like social media star Gunther Eagleman, radio show host Joe Pagliarulo, and Infowars' Chase Geiser, as well as elected politicians like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL). Matt Van Swol - a former liberal who gained a following in the past six months advocating for Hurricane Helene relief in North Carolina - was also victimized.\n\n\"Around 2:00 AM on Sunday night, we heard a loud bang on the door,\" Van Swol told The Daily Wire. \"We had a really big storm that night. We thought, you know, maybe someone was doing a wellness check. The power was going in and out all night. My wife ran to the door, I was getting my clothes on, and she saw a police officer with his gun drawn at the door. This could have ended horribly ... it turns out that the police had gotten a phone call from someone pretending to be me saying that there had been a shooting at the house. That Erin had been shot and killed, that um, I had been shot in the leg and that there were three masked men hiding in the basement.\"\n\nVan Swol's 3 children were at home during the incident - thankfully, no one was harmed. As of now, there have been no arrests associated with the recent swattings, but Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel have both said they were looking into the attacks. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) also suggested that those responsible should be charged with attempted murder.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "MTG Drops Latest Mayorkas Impeachment Resolution\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) abandoned on Thursday her latest bid to force another House vote on impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas , marking a turnaround for the congresswoman who only a day ago had threatened to \" keep reintroducing \" her resolution until it succeeded .\n\nIn withdrawing the resolution she introduced on Wednesday before it could be considered by the chamber, Greene - who often is referred to as \"MTG\" - claimed she had been \" guaranteed \" that the House would be \"moving forward\" with impeaching Mayorkas through the Homeland Security Committee.\n\nGreene told reporters she expects her articles of impeachment, which were previously referred to the Homeland Security Committee, to reach the House floor \"very soon.\" The congresswoman credited \"good talks\" with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green (R-TN), and other members of the panel in coming to that decision.\n\nEight Republicans joined with all voting Democrats earlier this month to approve a motion that kicked Greene's previous impeachment resolution, which accused Mayorkas of \" high crimes and misdemeanors \" over his failure to maintain border security, to the House Homeland Security Committee. The panel had already been investigating Mayorkas for alleged dereliction of duty in a probe that could lead to impeachment proceedings in the future.\n\nPreviously, Greene argued that sending her impeachment measure to the Homeland Security Committee would effectively \"kill\" her resolution, clashing with some of the GOP holdouts who indicated a desire to see Mayorkas impeached while stressing that they wanted to proceed in a way that was not rushed and ensured a conviction in the Senate - a high bar at the moment as the upper chamber is controlled by the Democrats who are generally aligned with the White House.\n\nOne of the eight Republicans, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), released a statement on Thursday announcing that he was ready to vote to \"recommend\" that Mayorkas be impeached, claiming the investigation \"has yielded ample and damning facts that the Secretary has not even attempted to correct or contradict - because he can't.\" Green, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, also released a statement that said the panel's investigation is \"nearing [its] conclusion, and will-as I've said all along-go where the facts lead us.\"\n\nIn defending Mayorkas, the Department of Homeland Security has derided what a spokesperson called \"reckless impeachment charades\" by congressional Republicans. Asked in a recent Bloomberg interview whether the impeachment effort has changed his strategy, Mayorkas shook his head and said , \"I am busy at work and incredibly proud to support and work alongside the 260,000 people at the Department of Homeland Security.\"\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS), the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, released a statement on Thursday claiming the about-face on Thursday \"exposed\" the impeachment effort as a \"political stunt.\" He also encouraged House Republicans to work with \"congressional Democrats and the Biden Administration to fix our broken immigration system and provide DHS the resources it needs along the border now.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "A 'National Divorce' Is An Understandable Desire But A Recipe For Disaster\n\nNational divorce is an understandable impulse, but our knowledge of better ways to live should give us hope we can win without separating.\n\nA national divorce is impractical, and the prospect of a civil war, which is what happened last time it was tried, is horrible. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia congresswoman, is a terrible messenger for the idea. Thus, it is no surprise that her tweet about the need for a national divorce brought a cavalcade of criticism upon her, including from fellow Republicans.\n\nYet for all the problems with the proposal - to say nothing of the often- stupid responses - there are good reasons why the idea is alluring to some on the right. Acknowledging these points is not an endorsement of a national breakup, and ignoring them will not make them go away.\n\nThe first of these truths is simple: The moral and cultural divisions in our nation are probably as deep as those preceding the Civil War. There is a multitude of polling and punditry on our polarization, but it can perhaps be best summed up by noting that we can't even agree on what a woman is - the Biden administration, along with many blue states, is literally putting male criminals in women's prisons on the theory that trans women are women, full stop. This level of disagreement, which is mirrored on many other issues, does not lend itself to easy coexistence or political comity.\n\nOf course, this division applies to both sides, which brings us to the second point, which is that the culture war has a persistent aggressor on the left. This is not to say conservatives never counterattack. Nonetheless, it is obvious that the cultural left has successfully remade social and legal norms around the basics of life, such as sex, marriage, and childbearing. And they keep pushing the envelope; we went from \"be nice as Bruce becomes Caitlyn\" to \"trans the preschoolers\" almost instantly.\n\nFurthermore, because the left styles these campaigns as the moral equivalents of, and successors to, the civil rights movement, they believe themselves justified in using the expansive government power used to break Jim Crow against, say, Christians who do not want to participate in promoting and celebrating same-sex wedding ceremonies.\n\nAdditionally, the left favors bigger government, which is inimical to pluralism, especially when it lacks generous accommodations for dissenters and minorities. The more control the government has over everything from education to health care, the less space there will be for nonconformists. This, in turn, reveals a practical problem with the federalist solution to our nation's divisions, which is that only one side is amenable to it. If the right shows more interest in national divorce, it is because they are constantly being attacked by the left.\n\nThis brings us to a third truth, which is that there is an asymmetry of power in the culture war. The dominance of cultural leftism within institutions and industries, from academia to the entertainment industry to Big Tech, allows leftists to achieve major cultural victories even when they lack political power.\n\nAs the left seizes control of cultural and economic hubs of power, the economic interests of much of red and blue America are diverging, leading to a merger of the class war and the culture war. Among the obvious examples of this dual polarization are the many attempts by Big Business (encouraged by the corporate media) to impose economic sanctions on conservative states that defy cultural leftism. The efforts by Big Tech to suppress conservative views and outlets (sometimes even coordinating these efforts with left-wing government officials) are another.\n\nThe attraction national divorce has for some on the right is explained as much by the left's aggression paired with its cultural and economic power as it is by the extent of our divisions. The cultural left impinges much more on even very conservative parts of red states than the right does on the most liberal areas in blue states. For the left, these are righteous victories, and they feel no need to apologize for them, but they are a persistent source of resentment on the right.\n\nNonetheless, the first point may provide the hardest challenge for those who insist that national divorce is not just undesirable but impossible. Put simply; there are limits beyond which pluralism becomes unstable and unsustainable. There are differences that cannot be bridged, even with a smaller government and more federalism. These are divisions over which there is no political compromise that will avoid one side feeling oppressed by the other.\n\nTransgender ideology has proven particularly potent at creating such conflicts. For instance, is it illegal and harmful discrimination to keep males who declare themselves \"trans women\" out of female locker rooms and showers, or is letting them in a violation of the rights of women and girls? Likewise, with regard to children who claim to be transgender: Is it abuse to transition them, or abuse not to?\n\nA multitude of such issues is being piled on top of older bitter disputes, such as whether abortion is a human right or an inhumane wrong. And it is impossible to formulate compromises, or live-and-let-live policies, for them all. One side wins, and the other loses. As these issues proliferate, living under the regime of the other side will seem increasingly intolerable.\n\nThis does not mean we are headed for national divorce. But it is all too easy to envision a lawless sort of federalism in which the uniform rule of law is replaced by competing jurisdictions engaged in de facto nullification along with a dose of anarcho-tyranny. Nullification is once again being preached from the floor of the Senate, and there are plenty of recent examples of officials refusing to enforce some laws and applying others only to their opponents. And that, combined with our deep divisions, could functionally break our nation, even if it is nominally united.\n\nBut conservatives should not quit the work of preserving and restoring our nation. The empire of wokeness is powerful but fragile. It does not have majority support, and it can be defeated and beaten back. There are reasons for hope, from so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion programs being the first to go when businesses need to cut costs to GOP governors and legislatures, led by the example of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, growing spines and beginning to govern their states in the interests of the voters, not just their campaign donors. These leaders have learned that the key to winning enduring victories is to dismantle the institutional power of cultural leftism and dry up its funding.\n\nCulturally, the time may also be right for a conservative renewal because cultural leftism is ineffective and immiserating. From public safety to racial harmony, cultural leftism is not keeping its promises. Indeed, it can't even deliver on its signature issue of sexual satisfaction - it turns out the conservative norm of the natural family is good at distributing sex and companionship across a population.\n\nIt is understandable that conservatives want to get away from those who are attacking our way of life, but our knowledge of better ways to live should give us hope that we can win.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., from her committee posts for controversial statements and conspiracy theories she had posted, largely to Facebook, in the years before she was elected to Congress.\n\nThe move sets a new low for the House of Representatives, whose work so far this year has been largely characterized by slap fights and manic political theater over anything particularly substantive.\n\nWhat Greene posted on Facebook were, indeed, conspiracy theories - something she owned up to in a floor speech, calling the QAnon posts she shared \"misinformation, lies, things that were not true,\" noting that \"these things do not represent me. They do not represent my district and they do not represent my values.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for saying all of those things that are wrong and offensive, and I sincerely mean that,\" Greene said in a genuine and candid press conference the next day. \"I'm happy to say that. I think it's good to say when we've done something wrong.\"\n\nGreene has conceded to her mistakes and misstatements. In a political climate where the only incentive is to never admit wrongdoing and instead blame everyone else, that deserves some acknowledgement.\n\nHer willingness to admit she was wrong is a strength, and a notable one in a city where Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., still defends sending thousands of Americans to die in Iraq, and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., continues to peddle outright falsehoods about Russia electing Donald Trump to the presidency.\n\nGreater Washington, of course, will intentionally overlook this and continue to paint Greene as a \"dangerous and powerful\" conspiracy theorist who represents the entire Republican Party - ignoring that, as a freshman member of the House, and in the minority, Greene is hardly in any positions of authority. But Greene is a useful anecdote to further their case that anyone who has engaged in wrongthink must be summarily deplatformed from public life. And so it will go.\n\nThere is more going on here, however, than a hyped up, hypocritical, and partisan moral panic. And it should give thoughtful Americans pause. In her floor speech, Taylor Greene discussed what led her to start trusting QAnon:\n\nAnd so, what I did is I started looking up things on the internet, asking questions, like most people do every day, use Google. And I stumbled across something and this was at the end of 2017 called QAnon. Well, these posts were mainly about this Russian collusion information. A lot of it was some of what I would see on the news at night and I got very interested in it, so I posted about it on Facebook. I read about it, I talked about it. I asked questions about it, and then more information came from it.\n\nBut you see, here's the problem, throughout 2018, because I was upset about things and didn't trust the government, really because the people here weren't doing the things that I thought they should be doing for us, the things that I just told you I cared about. And I want you to know a lot of Americans don't trust our government and that's sad.\n\nIn other words, Greene , who was then simply another American mom and business owner, was like all of us, trying to sort through information, and understand what was happening to the country, as well as within it. She was looking for someone, or some entity, to trust. But like so many Americans, her faith in the institutions and media outlets that once provided this had bottomed out.\n\nElected members of Congress ran on platforms they never intended to implement. Our government institutions became partisan weapons in the hands of powerful elites. Journalists at corporate outlets began to see their jobs as an avenue to humiliate, demean, and self-promote, rather than simply report objectively on the day's events.\n\nIn turning to QAnon, Greene is merely one of thousands of Americans who are facing a crisis of trust in institutions and in a government they believe no longer represents or speaks for them. This is an enormous social problem for America, one in which our ruling class is entirely culpable but has demonstrated no intention of acknowledging or addressing.\n\nThey would rather have us blame our fellow countrymen for being too dumb, racist, backwards, and illiterate to parse conspiracy from fact. They want us to believe this because it absolves them of any participation in degrading the bedrock of trust that holds us together.\n\nThis is obvious in the talking point being dutifully chattered out by every talking head in DC: Greene is a \"symptom\" of what ails the GOP and proof that the entire party is made up of racist conspiracy kooks.\n\nHer prior comments are indeed a symptom, but of the breakdown in the social consensus that must exist for self-government to thrive. Acknowledging that requires a level of honest self-reflection that party leaders, media executives, and institutional heads are both unable and unwilling to do.\n\nThey'd rather use the moment to double down on enforcing their own viewpoint, censoring, silencing, jailing, and expelling anyone who disagrees as a \"threat to democracy.\" Such actions will not end conspiracy theories. They will only encourage them.\n\nMoreover, by failing to look beyond anything but political opportunism, these same leaders will ensure that the institutional distrust - and the chasm between the rulers and the ruled - only continues to grow, fracturing our consensus, our trust in one another, and eventually, the very foundation of self-government.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "If Democrats Expel Marjorie Taylor Greene It Will Set A Dangerous Precedent\n\nEveryone knows Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., flirted with fringe conspiracy theories before her election to the House in 2020. Democrats are trying to kick her out of Congress for these ill-advised remarks made prior to her run for office - remarks voters had the opportunity to consider before electing Greene.\n\nAs many as 61 Democratic members of the House are willing to co-sponsor Rep. Jimmy Gomez's, D-Calif., resolution in favor of her removal. \"It should not be left to the whims of the Republican Party - Congress must act to ensure she is removed from her committee assignments,\" Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz wrote in a letter to other lawmakers.\n\nYes, Greene made stupid, questionable remarks prior to serving in government. Yet many people have made ill-advised comments prior to (and after) being elected - Rep. Ilhan Omar's, D-Minn., \"It's All About the Benjamins\" tweet is a prime, awfully antisemitic example .\n\nYet it's not wise for Congress to begin purging duly elected lawmakers based on their prior and fully legal rhetoric. If we accept the notion that our elected officials work on behalf of our interests, their campaign to undermine the electoral process cannot be tolerated.\n\nIn November, Greene won Georgia's 14th Congressional District by more than 152,000 votes (74.6 percent). She prevailed by such a substantial margin not only because the district leans heavily red, but also by running a grassroots campaign and aligning herself with the America First movement, which is prominent in rural areas that feel disenfranchised by corporatism. Greene's wild statements, shameful as they were, do not give Congress the right to disenfranchise thousands of American citizens.\n\nNow, whether these election voters have now lost interest or support for Greene is another story. We are only being given the national story from the mainstream media and Democrats-which is that Greene has supposedly betrayed her oath.\n\nNotwithstanding that it is odd and illogical to say that a lawmaker can betray an oath prior to even taking it, the broader issue points to a trend: Democrats will do anything and everything to belittle Republican voters. For four straight years, conservatives were vilified in the press as racist, white supremacist bigots. It was exhausting. The purge of Greene will set us down a course where the Democratic majority is incentivized through historical precedent to outlaw Republicans for much lesser offenses, based on an arbitrary process.\n\nMany on the left side of the aisle continue to openly support causes significantly viler than the dug-up rhetoric from Greene. In February of last year, all Democratic senators except Bob Casey, D-Pa; Doug Jones, D-Ala; and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., voted against The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Act and The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The former would have mandated medical care for babies who survive abortion, the latter prohibiting abortion after 20 weeks.\n\nFailing to pass this kind of law has effectively made the United States one of seven countries worldwide that allow abortions in this time span, joining the ranks of Communist China and North Korea. No one is saying the Democrats who effectively support such atrocities should be barred from office by Congress, yet it is apparently sensible to consider barring Greene for countenancing wild ideas.\n\nIn the U.S. Congress, words seem to matter more than actions. While Democrats in Congress and their media allies flirt with the removal of a lawmaker for comments she made prior to stepping foot on Capitol Hill, over which voters could have decided not to elect her, The New York Times still has yet to mention that Rep. Eric Swalwell slept with a Chinese spy.\n\nArticle I, Section 5 of the Constitution, also known as the Expulsion Clause, states that \"Each House may determine the Rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderedly behavior and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.\" The reason James Madison advocated for a two-thirds vote was to reliably deter against a sectarian interest or minority that seeks to unjustly overthrow the republic.\n\nFrom 1861 to 1862, 17 individuals were expelled for supporting the Confederacy. Aside from this, only three others have been expelled: Democratic-Republican Sen. William Blunt in 1797 for aiding the British in colonizing West Florida among other crimes; Democratic Rep. Michael Myers in 1980 for bribery in the FBI ABSCAM operation; and Democratic Rep. Jim Traficant in 2002 for bribery, racketeering, and tax evasion. All in all, this amounts to only 20 members in 213 years.\n\nJust as Democrats now seemingly want to set a precedent that normalizes one party attempting impeachment whenever it fits their political ends, setting this precedent for expulsion from Congress would be just as unscrupulous. Invalidating an election decided by voters over the information they could have taken into consideration before casting their ballots would politicize a process used to remove lawmakers who criminally violate the public trust.\n\nTwo things can be true at once: (1) Greene can be identified as an oddball un-representative of the sort of candidate Republicans should want to put forward, but (2) the idea of removal based on remarks that pale in comparison to historical precedent would be dangerous for future elections. Greene might be a bad apple among Republicans, but the left's disdain for Republican voters who fail to abide by their orthodoxy runs just as deep.\n\nCensuring Greene, thereby stripping her from her committee assignments, is a different story. While the majority of cases of congressmen being censured involved illegal involvement, several examples may in fact prove to be slightly compared to this. From 1867 to 1921, six congressmen have faced censure: all for \"using unparliamentary language.\" However, it is important to note that such language occurred while the lawmaker was actually serving in Congress-not an American citizen like Greene with no prior accountability to Congress.\n\nIf Democrats wholeheartedly believe Greene is bad, they ought to let the process work, permitting her to stay in Congress as elected and facing the voters for proper accountability. This present misguided effort, though, will only stir more distrust among Republican voters who already feel disenfranchised by Washington elites already verifiably out of touch with the overwhelming public.\n\nUnity may be the narrative preached by the newly elected President Biden, but Democrats don't seem to be truly interested in it. If this is what unity looks like, we best prepare for endless revisionism to historical precedent based on wild partisanship.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Greene Files Motion To Oust Speaker Johnson After House Passes Mega Spending Bill\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to oust Speaker Mike Johnson over a $1.2 trillion bill that advances zero Republican voter priorities.\n\nGeorgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to oust Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday after the House passed a $1.2 trillion spending bill that includes dozens of left-wing earmarks but no Republican voters' priorities. Greene urged Johnson not to allow the bill a floor vote, calling it a \"complete departure\" from the party's core values.\n\n\"No Republican in the House of Representatives in good conscience can vote for this bill. It is a complete departure from all of our principles, especially if you call yourself 'pro-life',\" Green said on the House floor.\n\n\"This is not a Republican bill. This is a Chuck Schumer Democrat-controlled bill coming from the House majority that is supposed to be controlled by Republicans, but yet our majority has been completely handed over to Democrats,\" Greene continued.\n\nThe 1,012-page bill passed the House 286-134, with 101 Republicans voting yes.\n\nGreene introduced a motion to vacate the speakership, but it will not be considered until after the recess since she did not file it as privileged, which would force the House to hold a vote within two legislative days, NBC News reported .\n\nGreene told reporters her move was a \"warning shot.\"\n\n\"I filed the motion to vacate today, but it's more of a warning and a pink slip,\" Greene said. \"I respect our conference, I've paid all my dues to my conference, I'm a member of good standing and I do not wish to inflict pain on our conference and to throw the House in chaos. But this is basically a warning, and it's time for us to go through the process, take our time, and find a new Speaker of the House who will stand with Republicans and our Republican majority instead of standing with the Democrats.\"\n\nJohnson's spokesperson Raj Shah said the speaker \"always listens to the concerns of members, but is focused on governing,\" according to Politico's Olivia Beavers.\n\n\"He will continue to push conservative legislation that secures our border, strengthens our national defense and demonstrates how we'll grow our majority.\"\n\nJOHNSON SPOX RAJ SHAH stmt re. MTV: \"Speaker Johnson always listens to the concerns of members, but is focused on governing. He will continue to push conservative legislation that secures our border, strengthens our national defense and demonstrates how we'll grow our majority.\"\n\n\"Governing\" apparently includes doling out $650 million to states, localities, and non-governmental organizations to make illegal immigrants comfortable breaking U.S. law as well as upping spending on the health care of illegal immigrants in custody. While the legislation includes an increase in funding for border agents , it includes zero policy solutions to the invasion at the southern border despite overwhelming demands from voters to control the chaos.\n\nJohnson has held the role for roughly five months after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted by Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. Johnson already has buckled on key issues .\n\nThe first spending package was signed by President Joe Biden earlier this month. It also increased government spending amid a federal financial crisis while ignoring conservative priorities. As The Federalist's Shawn Fleetwood wrote , Johnson and the more than 130 House Republicans \"threw their voters under the bus by helping Democrats pass a massive government spending bill.\"\n\nThe second half was crafted behind closed doors in conjunction with left-wing leaders including Sen. Chuck Schumer.\n\nJohnson, if for nothing else, has been consistent in abdicating leadership on the border crisis, waving the white flag and working with Democrats to pass a continuing resolution in January to keep the government funded without attaching a border security amendment.\n\nJohnson has made clear he cares about borders - so long as they run along Russia, saying he would work with Democrats to send billionsmore dollars to a country losing its war for the second year in a row.\n\nA Republican majority in the House should not compromise their values, their promises, or their country's national security in exchange for keeping Democrat campaign donors and flackies flush with cash.\n\n[READ NEXT: The GOP Is A Fake Opposition Party With No Vision For The Country]\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "MSNBC May Be Canceling Joy Reid, But Leftists Just Can't Quit Crazy\n\nReid's exit follows years of cringe-packed rants and reports of ever-declining ratings.\n\nIf November's election taught us anything it's that crazy sells for only so long. So goes the tale of MSNBC left-wing nut Joy Reid, who suddenly finds herself standing next to DEI-promoting federal bureaucrats in the unemployment line.\n\nReid, who has disgraced the low-IQ cable airwaves for what seems like a century, is set this week to say adieu to the news network that loathed America enough to give this walking lawsuit a nightly forum. In short, the high priestess of cancel culture is being canceled.\n\n\"The ad execs and the board finally figured out that racism, lies, and Trump derangement syndrome will put them out of business,\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., wrote Sunday on X.\n\n\"Sources familiar with the matter\" tell CNN (and many other corporate news outlets) that Reid's departure is all part of a \"major programming shakeup\" led by Rebecca Kutler, MSNBC's new president charged with righting the leftist network's faltering ship.\n\nSaid sources say the lunatic fringe weeknight show that was \" The ReidOut\" will be replaced by something else, hosted by the slightly less Marxist cohosts of MSNBC's \"The Weekend. \" That delightful program features former GOP chairman Michael \"To Hell With Republicans\" Steele and his band of merry Trump haters.\n\nReid's exit follows years of cringe-packed rants and reports of ever- declining ratings at a cable news network that has long had its meatless lunch handed to it by Fox News Chanel. MSNBC's new owner, the aptly named SpinCo, has apparently seen enough of Reid's kind of crazy.\n\nBut if we've learned anything about the left since Donald Trump began his second presidential term, it's that it just can't quit crazy.\n\nTake Wisconsin's far-left Gov. Tony Evers (there are plenty of Badger Staters wishing you would), who wants to change the word \"mother\" to \"inseminated person.\"\n\nMilwaukee conservative talk show host Dan O'Donnell first tweeted out the latest round of gender-expunging silliness that Wisconsin has come to expect from the DEI-worshipping two-term Democrat. Evers' executive budget bill includes a section that would remove terms in state documents such as wife, mother, father and husband and replace them with gender-neutral terms, including spouse, person, and inseminated person.\n\nNothing expresses the heartfelt sentiments for that special someone who gave us life like a \"Happy Inseminated Persons Day\" greeting card. And who could forget that old Waylon Jennings/Willie Nelson country classic imploring inseminated persons not to let their babies (or nonaborted clump of cells) grow up to be cowboys?\n\nThe governor's pandering to his LGBTQ base earned quick condemnation from lawmakers, political commentators, even a Hall of Fame quarterback for Wisconsin's beloved NFL franchise, the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Packers legendary QB Brett Favre wrote on a post noting the inseminated person proposal.\n\n\"As a proud mother of two, it is absolutely insulting that the Governor, in his 2025-27 budget bill, would reduce me and millions of other mothers across Wisconsin to 'inseminated persons,'\" wrote state Rep. Amanda Nedweski, R-Pleasant Prairie, in a statement last week breaking the news.  \"It is not only deeply offensive, but it is an outright attack on the very essence of motherhood. It is unconscionable that the Governor has the audacity to take the most beautiful, life-giving act a woman can perform - bringing children into this world - and turn it into nothing more than gender-neutral, virtue-signaling  jargon to appease his far-left base.\"\n\nEvers, a former science teacher who demanded Wisconsinites \"follow the science\" during Covid, could use a \"refresher on basic biology,\" Nedweski said.\n\n\"Last I checked, only one gender is capable of giving birth - women. Anyone who says otherwise is denying science,\" the lawmaker added.\n\nYou can bet Tony Evers never forgot his loving inseminated person on Inseminated Persons Day.\n\nIt's more of the same from an identity politics-practicing leftist who who apparently has failed to take no for an answer from voters in a swing state that helped return Trump to the White House. Those voters in no small part rejected the kind of leftist \"nonsense\" that they've seen from leftists like Evers - considered by Wisconsin conservatives to be the Joe Biden of the Badger State.\n\n\"Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers' latest left-wing push isn't just out of touch, it's offensive to mothers,\" said Republican Governors Association executive director Sara Craig in a statement from the RGA. \"If Tony Evers can reduce motherhood to an 'inseminated person' then our society is lost.\"\n\nEvers' whopping $119 billion biennial budget plan would cause a real cash deficit of $4 billion by the end of the 2029 fiscal year, according to Republican lawmakers who will once again rebuild Evers' budget plan from the ground up. The proposal raises taxes by some $2.4 billion , as well. But God forbid the term \"mother\" or \"husband\" survive in Tony Evers' delusional DEI utopia.\n\nIt's the kind of election-losing policy that even Joy Reid's inseminated person might think crazy.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "If Ilhan Omar Were A Republican, She'd Be Treated Like Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nIt doesn't take much courage for an American politician to publicly oppose antisemitism. But only under certain circumstances.\n\nIf the person or group that stands guilty of hatred of Jews is a conservative, a Republican, or someone who can be tied to the political right, it's open season on them. But if it's a Democrat or someone who can hide behind the label \"person of color\" or a potential victim of \"Islamophobia,\" then she can count on woke mobs on social media, pop culture influencers, and partisanship to not only protect her but to also put any potential accusers in the dock as racists.\n\nThat's why Rep. Ilhan Omar and other members of the left-wing \"Squad\" have evaded accountability in the past and what's still protecting them as the results of a recent dustup with party moderates indicated.\n\nAfter a surge in violent antisemitism inspired in no small part by vicious attacks on Israel by members of their party's left-wing, some Jewish Democrats seemed to have had enough. After Omar compared the United States and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban, the 25 Jewish members of the House of Representatives who are Democrats (two others are Republicans), met informally. Their discussion focused on whether it was time to rebuke Omar by name for her latest effort at demonizing the Jewish state, as well as besmirching the United States.\n\nTo their credit, 12 of them did so, signing on to a statement that rightly takes her to task:\n\nEquating the United States and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban is as offensive as it is misguided. Ignoring the differences between democracies governed by the rule of law and contemptible organizations that engage in terrorism at best discredits one's intended argument and at worst reflects deep-seated prejudice.\n\nThe United States and Israel are imperfect and, like all democracies, at times deserving of critique, but false equivalencies give cover to terrorist groups. We urge Congresswoman Omar to clarify her words placing the U.S. and Israel in the same category as Hamas and the Taliban.\n\nConsidering that Omar already trafficked in antisemitic tropes, is an open supporter of the antisemitic \" Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions \" movement, and had promoted a narrative about Israel's birth on the floor of the House last month that made it clear she thought one Jewish state on the planet was one too many, a call for her to \"clarify her words\" was a pathetically weak response. If she were a Republican, there's little doubt that Jewish Democrats would demand that, like former Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, or Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene, R-Ga., Omar should be officially censored and stripped of her committee assignments.\n\nBut it was arguably better than nothing. Moreover, by stating that her comment \"reflects deep-seated prejudice\" and that such \"false equivalencies give cover to terrorist groups,\" it correctly identified the stakes in the debate.\n\nStill, the fact that the other 13 Jewish Democrats - a majority of the caucus - refused to sign is an equally clear indication that even among Jews, support for Israel among Democrats is on the decline.\n\nOmar subsequently issued what she said was a clarification , claiming that her remarks were taken out of context. What she said was part of a series of questions to Secretary of State Antony Blinken about her support for the International Criminal Court.\n\nOmar had thanked the Biden administration for dropping sanctions former President Donald Trump had slapped on those responsible for what he had correctly labeled as antisemitism, while criticizing it for opposing the ICC's attempts to single out both Israel and the United States for committing \"war crimes\" during anti-terror operations.\n\nBut this is a distinction without a difference. Omar's support for the ICC's attempts to criminalize Israel's self-defense against Hamas terrorism is just as appalling in context as it is when seen on its own.\n\nWhat followed was a replay of the last House dustup over Omar's antisemitic bombast in 2019. House Democratic leadership led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi did rebuke Omar for her initial statement, but in the same breath also accepted her non-apology, with no thought to throwing her off the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the way they've done to Republicans who make extremist statements. Then Pelosi quickly backpedaled and insisted on CNN that Democrats \"did not rebuke\" Omar.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MarkBednar/status/1404079357145104388\n\nYet rather than those silent 13 Jewish Democrats being criticized for not speaking up against Omar, it was the ones who did sign the statement that found themselves under attack for supposedly persecuting her.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which is made up of nearly half of all House Democrats, issued a statement in support of Omar, who is part of the group's leadership. Jayapal, speaking in the name of all progressives, said those holding Omar to account were part of a \"bad faith\" effort to attack a \"black, Muslim woman,\" and endangering her and her staff.\n\nDespite her \"clarification,\" Omar was far from repentant and labeled the 12 Jews who dared to call her out as being guilty of \"Islamicphobic [sic] tropes\" and subjecting her to \"constant harassment and silencing.\"\n\nThat was seconded by others on the left, including fellow \"Squad\" members Reps. Rashida Tlaib , D-Mich., and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y., who had joined Omar on the House floor to falsely accuse Israel of committing war crimes. A tsunami of abuse on Twitter was also directed at the Jewish 12.\n\nTo read the responses to the statement on Omar is to understand why so many Jewish Democrats were reluctant to speak out. In doing so, even in the most restrained fashion, the 12 were widely denounced for demonstrating \"racism\" and \"white privilege,\" and for \"allegiance\" to Israel.\n\nThe exchange showed a lot had changed since early 2019, when it was Omar who was put on the defensive, at least for a short while, after claiming that Jews were buying congressional support for Israel (\"It's all about the Benjamins\"). Even then, Omar easily escaped being censured by the House and was soon lionized by the left, including pop-culture influencers among the late-night TV comedians like Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah , as an innocent victim of persecution from Trump.\n\nBut after the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and widespread acceptance of its toxic ideological baggage of critical race theory and intersectionality, which falsely labels Israel and the Jews as \"white\" and colonialist oppressors of \"people of color,\" Omar's rants are now viewed part of mainstream discourse. Just as the attacks on Israel for defending itself against Hamas terror from Gaza were far greater this year than they were during the last such fighting in 2014, so, too, Omar and her \"progressive\" allies are also on firmer ground in Democratic circles.\n\nSince she and the rest of \"The Squad\" landed in Washington three years ago (with more joining the club in January), many believe they have gotten far more attention than they deserve considering their non-existent legislative accomplishments. Still, this episode illustrates just how much influence she and her friends have acquired and the way the Black Lives Matter movement has given a permission slip to antisemitism.\n\nIn that short time, Omar and company have done more to establish antisemitic stereotypes and libels in mainstream discourse than extremist right-wingers could have accomplished in decades.\n\nWe already knew about the deep divide in the Democratic Party about support for Israel - one that is growing wider as a new and more leftist generation bought into intersectional myths. What we're seeing now is the price that those in the center of that party will have to pay if they continue to oppose the mainstreaming of antisemitism.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "MTG says far-left extremists, not conservatives, are the ones 'training in the hills' after Maxine Waters' remarks\n\n\"Maxine Waters is right. They are training in the hills and THEY are her people.\"\n\n\"Maxine Waters is right. They are training in the hills and THEY are her people.\"\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene fired back at Maxine Waters' assertions about right-wing extremists \"training\" in the event that Donald Trump is not re-elected in November, reposting a story about a left-wing domestic terrorist organization in Portland, Oregon that recently claimed responsibility for setting fire to 15 vehicles that belonged to the Portland Police Department.\n\n\"Maxine Waters is right,\" MTG said in her repost of the story regarding this Portland attack. \"They are training in the hills and THEY are her people.\"\n\n\"What is the FBI and DOJ doing about the Democrat funded terrorist group ramping up operations all over America again?\" she added. \"Still too focused on J6 election protesters?\"\n\nWaters had previously expressed fear in an interview on Sunday about right-wing organizations allegedly training for potential actions in the event that Trump is not re-elected in 2024. Waters claimed that she was worried  \"right-wing\" organizations are \"training up in the hills somewhere\" and would be ready to commit violence. The group \"Rachel Corrie's Ghost Brigade\" claimed responsibility for the Portland attack, explaining in a statement that it broke into a police training facility in Portland and set ten fires as an attack against the Portland Police Bureau (PPB). Their statement cited various motivations for their actions, including solidarity with the anti-Israel protesters engaging in political unrest on college campuses across the country. \"On May Day we torched some PPB cars at their training facility. We cut through a fence, set ten fires and are happy it grew to burn fifteen cars!\" The group's statement began. \"Our attack was preemptive. After seeing Humboldt, Columbia, UCLA and more we knew the occupation at PSU would be swept violently and wanted to attack PPB before,\" the statement continued. \"While we respect the student occupations, particularly the ones occupying buildings and causing damages to the colleges, we hate to see them passive and waiting to be attacked. Catch the police off guard!\" \"They do not believe you are free! Show them you are! Raid them before they raid you!\" Moreover, the group's statement included advice for students engaging in anti-Israel protests on college campuses, urging them to use violence when necessary to achieve their goals. Anti-Israel protests on college campuses were recently revealed to be funded by major Democratic donors for President Joe Biden's reelection campaign as well as other Democrat candidates and causes.\n\nWaters had previously expressed fear in an interview on Sunday about right-wing organizations allegedly training for potential actions in the event that Trump is not re-elected in 2024.

Thomas Massie said he will cosponsor a motion to vacate the House Speaker Mike Johnson with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) said on Tuesday that he will back a motion brought by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) motion to vacate House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA).\n\nThe announcement comes after Johnson said that a foreign aid bill for will not include provisions for border security.\n\n\"I just told Mike Johnson in conference that I'm cosponsoring the Motion to Vacate that was introduced by MTG,\" Massie wrote. \"He should pre-announce his resignation (as Boehner did), so we can pick a new Speaker without ever being without a GOP Speaker.\" On Friday, Johnson stood with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago and announced a plan to propose a bill requiring voters to prove they are US citizens prior to casting ballots in federal elections. This was largely seen as Trump backing Johnson's speakership.\n\nTrump said Johnson \"is doing a really good job under very tough circumstances.\"\n\nMTG filed the motion to vacate the House Speaker position in March in response over the $1.2 trillion package to continue funding the government.\n\nMassie is the first Republican aside from Greene to back the motion to vacate Johnson from the position. Earlier in the fall, a similar move was made by Rep. Matt Gaetz in order to oust Rep. Kevin McCarthy from the leadership position. That, too, was over foreign funding taking precedence over border security measures.\n\nMcCarthy, for his part, does not think the step \"will ever happen,\" according to a report from The Hill .\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

      "text": "BREAKING: Marjorie Taylor Greene brings resolution to censure Rashida Tlaib for sympathizing with terrorist organizations\n\nGreene accused Tlaib of \"antisemitic activity, sympathizing with terrorist organizations, and leading an insurrection at the United States Capitol Complex.\"\n\nGreene accused Tlaib of \"antisemitic activity, sympathizing with terrorist organizations, and leading an insurrection at the United States Capitol Complex.\"\n\nGeorgia's Marjorie Taylor Greene brought a resolution to the House floor on Thursday to censure Rashida Tlaib of Michigan for \"antisemitic activity, sympathizing with terrorist organizations, and leading an insurrection at the United States Capitol Complex.\" Greene listed several reasons for the censure, going back to 2019. These reasons include Tlaib publicly saying that she celebrated the Holocaust, during which 6 million Jews were murdered in Germany due solely to their race and religion. Tlaib said the Holocaust gave her a \"calming feeling.\" She has shared content reading \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" which is a call for the eradication of Israel as a nation. This slogan, Green said, \"has been adopted by Hamas and calls for the elimination of Israel and the death of all Jews.\" Tlaib said that progressives must oppose Israel or else they are not progressive, and instead of \"denouncing the horrors of Hamas slaughtering Israelis and demanding the release of all hostages held by Hamas,\" Tlaib supported the terror group. Only one day after the massacre of some 1,400 Israelis by Hamas on October 7, Tlaib said \"The path to the future must include lifting the blockade, ending the occupation, and dismantling the apartheid system that creates the suffocating dehumanizing conditions that can lead to resistance.\" Tlaib, Greene said, also hates America, as evidenced by her blaming America for Israel's counterattack on Gaza. She took aim at Tlaib's leading of \"an insurrection at the United States Capitol Complex on October 18, 2023, which put Members of Congress, their staffs, and Capitol visitors in danger by shutting down elevators, stairwells, and points of egress, while obstructing official business in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, including a Senate Foreign Affairs Committee hearing.\" Greene said that \"several insurrectionists at the Capitol belong to a group messaging chat called, 'Global Intifada', which is the Arabic word for 'rebellion' or 'uprising' and refers to a series of protests and violent riots carried out by Palestinians in Israel during the last century.\" Tlaib, Greene said, also \"followed Hezbollah's orders to carry out a 'day of unprecedented anger' following an explosion at a Gazan hospital, lying about Israel's responsibility for the attack, which United States intelligence agencies said was not perpetrated by Israel.\" In conclusion, Greene asked that Tlaib be censured. The matter is before the new House Speaker, Mike Johnson. Tlaib has consistently called for a ceasefire in the wake of the Hamas attack on Israel, though her mission is to get Israel to stop fighting back. She has equivocated those who attacked with those who were attacked. She asked for \"lasting peace\" without acknowledging who broke that peace. She brought her own resolution for a ceasefire, which is a Hamas talking point. Tlaib stood outside Congress in a keffiyeh saying that funding Israel is \"funding the oppression of indigenous communities.\" She claimed that Palestinians were being persecuted for their faith. She claimed in a tearful display that Israel bombed a hospital, even after it was made clear that this did not happen.

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) claimed that Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene's (R-GA) using her fake eyelashes to insult her during a House Oversight Committee hearing to hold Merrick Garland in contempt was \"racist.\"\n\nIn an interview on CNN's State of the Union, host Jake Tapper, who will be moderating the first presidential debate in June, asked Crockett if Greene going after her eyelashes was \"racist.\" \"I think that her specifically doing it to me, yes that was the intent,\" Crockett said.\n\n\"MAGA has historically been on social media doing the things, where they say 'oh she's black with lashes and nails and hair, so she's ghetto,'\" Crockett claimed. \"So to me, this was her playing into that rhetoric and trying to amplify for the MAGA crowd. So yeah I absolutely think she only did it to be racist towards me.\" After Tapper tried to clarify if using lashes as an insult was a racial trope, Crockett said, \"It is buying into a racist trope.\" She then admitted, \"But the reality is that women of all colors wear lashes.\" On Thursday, during a late night session in the House, Crockett, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, and Greene each hurled insults towards each other in a House Oversight Committee session. Greene told Crockett that her \"fake eyelashes\" were preventing her from reading. The purpose of the late nigh session was to determine if Biden's AG Merrick Garland should be held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena. Over the past few years, both Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, both Trump advisors, were convicted on contempt of Congress charges for refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas. Ocasio-Cortez jumped in and yelled, \"That's disgusting\" and asked for Greene's words to be struck because they were \"absolutely unacceptable.\" After a back and forth with Ocasio-Cortez and Greene, Crockett asked for congressional protocol if she hypothetically referred to someone's \"bleach blonde, bad-built butch body.\" Crockett will now be selling t-shirts with that quote printed on them. She announced the new merch on Sunday. Discussing the incident later , Ocasio-Cortez blamed Greene for causing Crockett's \"devolution of conduct.\" She said, \"AFTER the Republican Chair and GOP members broke official House protocol to allow MTG's horrific opening solo of rhetoric, they THEN made another change to dispense with the legislative process. THAT part is not getting enough attention.\" She went on to claim that the incident was an attempt by Greene to \"undermind deeper processes and rule of law.\" She added, \"They WANT you to think this was some random devolution of conduct instead of a structured GOP outcome. We must understand who and what actions created the situation. It matters.\"\n\n\"MAGA has historically been on social media doing the things, where they say 'oh she's black with lashes and nails and hair, so she's ghetto,'\" Crockett claimed. \"So to me, this was her playing into that rhetoric and trying to amplify for the MAGA crowd.
