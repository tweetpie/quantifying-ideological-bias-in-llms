(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nERIE, Pa. (AP) - Vice President Kamala Harris announced a plan on Monday to give Black men more economic opportunities and other chances to thrive as she works to energize a key voting bloc that has Democrats concerned about a lack of enthusiasm.\n\nHarris' plan includes providing forgivable business loans for Black entrepreneurs, creating more apprenticeships and studying sickle cell and other diseases that disproportionately affect African American men.\n\nHarris already has said she supports legalizing marijuana and her plan calls for working to ensure that Black men have opportunities to participate as a \"national cannabis industry takes shape.\" She also is calling for better regulating cryptocurrency to protect Black men and others who invest in digital assets.\n\nThe vice president's \"opportunity agenda for Black men\" is meant to invigorate African American males at a moment when there are fears some may sit out the election rather than vote for Harris or her opponent, Republican former President Donald Trump .\n\nThe vice president unveiled the plan as she visited Erie, Pennsylvania, where she stopped by LegendErie Records and Coffee House, a Black-owned small business, for a conversation with Black men from the area.\n\nThe business, opened just five weeks ago, is the project of Ishmael and Allana Trainor, a married couple of Erie natives who returned to their hometown after living for years in Arizona.\n\nLater, Harris held a campaign rally in the northwest Pennsylvania city, where she pilloried Trump for suggesting in a weekend Fox News interview that the U.S. military may need to be deployed to quell an \"enemy from within\" if Election Day is disturbed by agitators.\n\nHer push comes after former President Barack Obama suggested last week that some Black men \"aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign also has been working to increase support among other male voting blocs , including Hispanics, by founding the group \"Hombres con Harris,\" Spanish for \"Men with Harris.\" The latest policy rollout is notable because it comes with the stated purpose of motivating Black men to vote mere weeks before Election Day .\n\nAs her campaign has done with the \"Hombres\" group, Harris' team plans to organize gender-specific gatherings. Those include \"Black Men Huddle Up\" events in battleground states featuring African American male celebrities for things like watch parties for NFL and NCAA football games. The campaign says it also plans new testimonial ads in battleground states that feature local Black male voices.\n\nCedric Richmond , co-chair of the Harris campaign and a former Louisiana congressman who is Black, said Harris wants to build an economy \"where Black men are equipped with the tools to thrive: to buy a home, provide for our families, start a business and build wealth.\"\n\nBlack Americans strongly supported Joe Biden when he beat Trump in 2020. Harris advisers say they are less worried about losing large percentages of Black male support to the former president than that some will choose not to turn out at all.\n\nTrump, too, has stepped up efforts to win over Black and Hispanic voters of both genders. He has held roundtables with Black entrepreneurs in swing states and will sit for a townhall sponsored by Spanish-language Univision this week. He also has sought to openly stoke racial divisions, repeatedly suggesting that immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally are taking jobs from Black and Hispanic Americans .\n\nHarris' new round of proposals includes a promise that, if elected, she will help distribute 1 million loans of up to $20,000 that can be fully forgivable to Black entrepreneurs and others who have strong ideas to start businesses. The loans would come via new partnerships between the Small Business Administration and community leaders and banks \"with a proven commitment to their communities,\" her campaign says.\n\nThe vice president also wants to offer federal incentives to encourage more African American men to train to be teachers, citing statistics that Black males made up only a bit more than 1% of the nation's public school teaching ranks in 2020-21, according to data from the National Teacher and Principal Survey .\n\nHarris also is pledging to expand existing federal programs that forgive some educational loans for public service to further encourage more Black male teachers. She also wants to use organizations like the National Urban League, local governments and the private sector to expand apprenticeships and credentialing opportunities in Black communities.\n\nThe vice president's advisers have been urging her to talk more about cryptocurrency as a way to appeal to male voters. Her campaign said that as president, Harris will back a regulatory framework meant to better protect investors in cryptocurrency and other digital assets, which are popular with Black men.\n\nHarris also promised to create a national initiative to better fund efforts to detect, research and combat sickle cell disease, diabetes, prostate cancer, mental health challenges and other health issues that disproportionately affect Black men.\n\nA recent poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found about 7 in 10 Black voters had a favorable view of Harris and preferred her leadership to that of Trump on major policy issues including the economy, health care, abortion, immigration and the war between Israel and Hamas. There was little difference in support for Harris between Black men and Black women.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Height Elementary School in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) - Before 19-year-old Davontez Johnson found himself in a preschool classroom at Dorothy I. Heights Elementary, he was a senior at a nearby high school who, like many students his age, was unsure of what he wanted to do with his life. Not in his wildest dreams could he have imagined himself standing on a colorful carpet, leading a gaggle of 4-year-olds in a chant and dance about phonics.\n\n\"Words have parts - that's syl-a-bles,\" he said, enunciating for effect. The preschoolers craned their heads up at Johnson and echoed him. \"Clap your hands now, syl-a-bles! Stomp your feet now, syl-a-bles!\"\n\nPreschool teacher Bridget Jeffreys reads to students, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024, at Dorothy I. Height Elementary School in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nJohnson is part of the Leading Men Fellowship, which trains young Black and Latino men to become early literacy instructors in preschool classrooms across the country. It's a program that aims to tackle several problems at once: a shortage of early educators, a dearth of Black and Latino male teachers and the acute challenges boys of color face in schools because of their race and gender.\n\n\"We're not only affecting change in the classroom with these school students, but (we're) also developing these young future educators,\" said Ivan Douglas of the Literacy Lab, which runs the Leading Men Fellowship.\n\nMany fellows, like Johnson, are recruited right out of high school. After an interview process and intensive summer training, they go to work in schools where they may be among the only male educators. Fellows make between $16.50 and $18 an hour.\n\nA former high school offensive lineman, Johnson knows some parents would say he looks out of place in a preschool classroom. And the statistics back him up: Less than 1% of elementary and early education public school teachers are Black men, according to federal data . But that's part of the reason he wanted to do it.\n\nLeading Men fellow Davontez Johnson, right, ties preschooler Kodi's shoes, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024, at Dorothy I. Height Elementary School in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\n\"I really thought it was a great opportunity. Because I know if I saw someone like me, you know, in pre-K , I'd be pretty excited,\" Johnson said. \"You don't see a lot of young Black males.\"\n\nResearchers have shown that Black male students encounter discrimination before they even set foot in a kindergarten classroom, facing higher rates of expulsion and suspension from preschool even though evidence suggests they do not misbehave more than their white peers. Boys also are far more likely than girls to be expelled.\n\nBut there's a growing body of evidence that Black teachers can make a difference for Black students - and for Black boys in particular. In the years since the Leading Men Fellowship was founded, in 2016, researchers have repeatedly found that students of color seem to fare better when they have teachers who look like them .\n\nLeading Men fellow Davontez Johnson organizes a writing station during the classroom quiet time after preschoolers return from lunch, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024, at Dorothy I. Height Elementary School in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nJohns Hopkins University economist Nicholas Papageorge, who is based not far from Heights Elementary, studies the impact of Black teachers on Black students. His research found that Black teachers have higher expectations for Black students than do non-Black teachers.\n\n\"If a Black student had a white teacher and a Black teacher, that white teacher had systematically lower expectations,\" Papageorge said.\n\nHis later research found Black students who have a Black teacher are less likely to drop out of high school and more likely to attend college. The effect of having a Black teacher had the greatest impact on Black boys from low-income households.\n\nThrough his coursework, Johnson has learned the intricacies of early education - and that it involves a surprising amount of singing and dancing for someone not working on Broadway. Children learn best by repetition, and when they can pair information with movements and song.\n\nPreschool teacher Bridget Jeffreys and Leading Men fellow Davontez Johnson are surrounded by students while distributing playdough for an activity, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024, at Dorothy I. Height Elementary School in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nBridget Jeffrys, whose preschool classroom hosts Johnson, said she had never worked alongside a male educator until Johnson arrived at the start of the last school year. She said she's watched Johnson grow more confident with her students, going from reserved to enthusiastic. Jeffrys said his voice and dance moves could use some work, but he performs the songs with such heart that it doesn't matter.\n\n\"It was so beautiful because usually you don't see men really get down to the child level,\" Jeffrys said. \"That excited them even more. A lot of kids think he's a big kid.\"\n\nAlong with teaching at Heights Elementary, Johnson is studying political science at University of Maryland Global Campus and hopes to go into politics. His colleagues, though, are encouraging him to stick with teaching.\n\nLeading Men fellow Davontez Johnson, right, high-fives preschooler Kodi during a name writing exercise, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024, at Dorothy I. Height Elementary School in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nWhile Johnson is there to provide targeted literacy instruction, he has been fully integrated into the school day. His second week in the classroom, he sang the class's morning greeting song in a robot voice. When a child is squirming on the carpet or wandering away from story time, Johnson is there to rein them in.\n\nOn this October day, Johnson pulled students aside to help them work on writing their names. He had only been with this cohort for a couple weeks, but many students were drawn to him. During free-play time, he encouraged a student who was working on a crayon rubbing of a leaf.\n\n\"You've done a wonderful job,\" he said to the girl, who stared up at him, eager for reassurance. Another student interrupted him by handing him a fistful of play money.\n\nAfter lunchtime, as most of the preschoolers sat on the carpet held rapt by a story read by Jeffrys, 4-year-old Kodi Hendricks wandered toward the door and peered into the hallway until Johnson beckoned him back. Johnson bent his large frame to tie the boy's shoe and then they sat together for a penmanship lesson.\n\nLeading Men fellow Davontez Johnson, left, helps preschooler Kodi to practice writing his name, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024, at Dorothy I. Height Elementary School in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\n\"What's the first letter?\" he asked the boy.\n\n\"K,\" he replied. Johnson showed him, in slow motion, how to draw a K.\n\n\"No, I can't do it,\" said the boy.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Johnson said. He urged him on.\n\n\"You can do it. It just takes practice.\"\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nDETROIT (AP) - Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris warned Tuesday that Republican Donald Trump would \"institutionalize\" harsh policing tactics that disproportionately affect Black men, while Trump blamed Harris' immigration policies for \"devastating\" Black and Latino communities.\n\n\"Any African American or Hispanic that votes for Kamala ... you've got to have your head examined, because they are really screwing you,\" Trump said of Harris, who is African American, at an evening rally in Georgia.\n\nEarlier, during a radio town hall moderated by Charlamagne tha God, Harris promised to work to decriminalize marijuana, which accounts for arrests that also have a disproportionate impact on Black men. And she acknowledged that racial disparities and bias exist in everyday life for Black people - in home ownership, health care, economic prosperity and even voting.\n\nAP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on Kamala Harris' efforts to reach Black voters.\n\nJust 21 days before the final votes are cast in the 2024 presidential season, Harris and Trump are scrambling to win over Black voters, women and other key constituencies in what looks to be a razor-tight election. Harris, a daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, hopes to maintain her party's traditional advantage with voters of color, while Trump is showing modest signs of momentum among Black men in particular.\n\nA small shift among any group could swing the election.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris poses for a photo as she visits Norwest Gallery of Art in Detroit, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2024. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nHarris told Charlamagne that despite the persistence of racial bias, no one has a pass to sit out the election.\n\n\"We should never sit back and say, 'OK, I'm not going to vote because everything hasn't been solved,'\" she said. \"This is a margin-of-error race. It's tight. I'm going to win. I'm going to win, but it's tight.\"\n\nThe vice president took questions that listeners called in, but also from a series of people who joined in-studio, including Pastor Solomon Kinloch Jr., pastor of Detroit's Triumph Church.\n\nWhen asked about reparations, or potential government payments to the descendants of enslaved people, Harris said the notion \"has to be studied, there's no question about that.\" It's a position she's taken before, but which Trump's campaign immediately pounced on, saying the vice president was \"open\" to payments that could cost billions.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris visits Norwest Gallery of Art in Detroit, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2024. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nTrump has called for a return to \"proven crime fighting methods, including stop and frisk.\" The tactic, deployed by the New York City Police Department, involved stopping, questioning and sometimes frisking people deemed \"reasonably suspicious.\" It disproportionately affected Black and Hispanic men, and in 2013 the policy was found to have violated the U.S. Constitution.\n\nHarris said part of her challenge is that Trump's campaign is \"trying to scare people away because otherwise they know they have nothing to run on. Ask Donald Trump what is his plan for Black America. Ask him.\"\n\nTrump did not respond to Harris' criticism during multiple stops Tuesday, including a Fox News town hall with an all-female audience and a nighttime rally in Atlanta, where he railed against Democrats and the media and focused especially on immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nHe insisted that immigrants are \"devastating\" people of color by taking their jobs. He called President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris' border policies a \"complete and total betrayal of African American communities and Hispanic communities.\"\n\nDuring the town hall the former president sidestepped questions about the erosion of abortion rights, leaning instead into the nation's culture wars by vowing to ban male-born athletes from competing in women's sports.\n\nPressed on how he would enforce a ban, Trump responded: \"You just ban it. President bans. You just don't let it happen.\"\n\nTrump also stood by his recent description of his political opponents as \"the enemy within\" - rhetoric that evokes authoritarian regimes.\n\nEarlier, Harris stopped by a Black-owned art gallery, joined by actors Don Cheadle, Delroy Lindo and Detroit native Cornelius Smith Jr., for a conversation with Black men focused on entrepreneurship.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris arrives at Norwest Gallery of Art in Detroit, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2024. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nHarris this week announced a series of new proposals dubbed the \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men,\" meant to offer Black men more economic advantages - including providing forgivable business loans of up to $20,000 for entrepreneurs and creating more apprenticeships. The plans would also support the study of sickle cell and other diseases more common in Black men.\n\nThe focus on Black men sharpened last week when former President Barack Obama campaigned for Harris in Pittsburgh and said he wanted to speak \"some truths\" to Black male voters, suggesting some \" just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president .\"\n\nThe vice president's campaign says it doesn't believe Black men will flip in large numbers to supporting Trump, especially after strongly backing Democrat Joe Biden, with Harris as his running mate, in 2020. They are more concerned about a measurable percentage of Black males opting not to vote at all.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris' support among women has been generally been solid since she took over the top of the Democratic ticket, but Trump is aiming to narrow the margins on Election Day. That could be tough since the former president has seen his support among women, especially in the suburbs of many key swing states, soften since his term in the White House.\n\nA September AP-NORC poll found more than half of registered voters who are women have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, while only about one-third have a favorable view of Trump. To reverse the trend, Trump has sought to cast himself as being able to personally shield women from various threats .\n\n\"You will be protected, and I will be your protector,\" Trump said at a September rally. He's also suggested that, should he win, women will no longer have a reason to think about abortion, after three Supreme Court judges that he appointed helped in 2022 to overturn the landmark ruling.\n\nHarris said Tuesday that it was comical for Trump considered himself a president for women, particularly as maternal mortality is rising and roughly 1 in 3 women live in states with increasingly restrictive abortion bans.\n\n\"And they want to strut around and say this is in the best interest of women and children? And they have been silent on Black maternal mortality?\" she asked.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Breed)\n\nLandscaping was hardly his lifelong dream.\n\nAs a teenager, Alton Lucas believed basketball or music would pluck him out of North Carolina and take him around the world. In the late 1980s, he was the right-hand man to his musical best friend, Youtha Anthony Fowler, who many hip hop and R&B heads know as DJ Nabs.\n\nBut rather than jet-setting with Fowler, Lucas discovered drugs and the drug trade at the height of the so-called war on drugs. Addicted to crack cocaine and involved in trafficking the drug, he faced decades-long imprisonment at a time when the drug abuse and violence plaguing major cities and working class Black communities were not seen as the public health issue that opioids are today.\n\nBy chance, Lucas received a rare bit of mercy. He got the kind of help that many Black and Latino Americans struggling through the crack epidemic did not: treatment, early release and what many would consider a fresh start.\n\n\"I started the landscaping company, to be honest with you, because nobody would hire me because I have a felony,\" said Lucas. His Sunflower Landscaping got a boost in 2019 with the help of Inmates to Entrepreneurs, a national nonprofit assisting people with criminal backgrounds by providing practical entrepreneurship education.\n\nLucas was caught up in a system that imposes lifetime limits on most people who have served time for drug crimes, with little thought given to their ability to rehabilitate. In addition to being denied employment, those with criminal records can be limited in their access to business and educational loans, housing, child custody rights, voting rights and gun rights.\n\nIt's a system that was born when Lucas was barely out of diapers.\n\nFifty years ago this summer, President Richard Nixon declared a war on drugs. Today, with the U.S. mired in a deadly opioid epidemic that did not abate during the coronavirus pandemic's worst days, it is questionable whether anyone won the war.\n\nYet the loser is clear: Black and Latino Americans, their families and their communities. A key weapon was the imposition of mandatory minimums in prison sentencing. Decades later those harsh federal and state penalties led to an increase in the prison industrial complex that saw millions of people, primarily of color, locked up and shut out of the American dream.\n\nAn Associated Press review of federal and state incarceration data shows that, between 1975 and 2019, the U.S. prison population jumped from 240,593 to 1.43 million Americans. Among them, about 1 in 5 people were incarcerated with a drug offense listed as their most serious crime.\n\nThe racial disparities reveal the war's uneven toll. Following the passage of stiffer penalties for crack cocaine and other drugs, the Black incarceration rate in America exploded from about 600 per 100,000 people in 1970 to 1,808 in 2000. In the same timespan, the rate for the Latino population grew from 208 per 100,000 people to 615, while the white incarceration rate grew from 103 per 100,000 people to 242.\n\nGilberto Gonzalez, a retired special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration who worked for more than 20 years taking down drug dealers and traffickers in the U.S., Mexico and in South America, said he'll never forget being cheered on by residents in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood near Los Angeles as he led away drug traffickers in handcuffs.\n\n\"That gave me a sense of the reality of the people that live in these neighborhoods, that are powerless because they're afraid that the drug dealers that control the street, that control the neighborhood are going to do them and their children harm,\" said Gonzalez, 64, who detailed his field experiences in the recently released memoir \"Narco Legenda.\"\n\n\"We realized then that, along with dismantling (drug trafficking) organizations, there was also a real need to clean up communities, to go to where the crime was and help people that are helpless,\" he said.\n\nStill, the law enforcement approach has led to many long-lasting consequences for people who have since reformed. Lucas still wonders what would happen for him and his family if he no longer carried the weight of a drug-related conviction on his record.\n\nEven with his sunny disposition and close to 30 years of sober living, Lucas, at age 54, cannot pass most criminal background checks. His wife, whom he'd met two decades ago at a fatherhood counseling conference, said his past had barred him from doing things as innocuous as chaperoning their children on school field trips.\n\n\"It's almost like a life sentence,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAlthough Nixon declared the war on drugs on June 17, 1971, the U.S. already had lots of practice imposing drug prohibitions that had racially skewed impacts. The arrival of Chinese migrants in the 1800s saw the rise of criminalizing opium that migrants brought with them. Cannabis went from being called \"reefer\" to \"marijuana,\" as a way to associate the plant with Mexican migrants arriving in the U.S. in the 1930s.\n\nBy the time Nixon sought reelection amid the anti-Vietnam War and Black power movements, criminalizing heroin was a way to target activists and hippies. One of Nixon's domestic policy aides, John Ehrlichman, admitted as much about the war on drugs in a 22-year-old interview published by Harper's Magazine in 2016.\n\nExperts say Nixon's successors, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, leveraged drug war policies in the following decades to their own political advantage, cementing the drug war's legacy. The explosion of the U.S. incarceration rate, the expansion of public and private prison systems and the militarization of local police forces are all outgrowths of the drug war.\n\nFederal policies, such as mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses, were mirrored in state legislatures. Lawmakers also adopted felony disenfranchisement, while also imposing employment and other social barriers for people caught in drug sweeps.\n\nThe domestic anti-drug policies were widely accepted, mostly because the use of illicit drugs, including crack cocaine in the late 1980s, was accompanied by an alarming spike in homicides and other violent crimes nationwide. Those policies had the backing of Black clergy and the Congressional Black Caucus, the group of African-American lawmakers whose constituents demanded solutions and resources to stem the violent heroin and crack scourges.\n\n\"I think people often flatten this conversation,\" said Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit organization pushing decriminalization and safe drug use policies.\n\n\"If you're a Black leader 30 years ago, you're grabbing for the first (solution) in front of you,\" said Frederique, who is Black. \"A lot of folks in our community said, 'OK, get these drug dealers out of our communities, get this crack out of our neighborhood. But also, give us treatment so we can help folks.'\"\n\nThe heavy hand of law enforcement came without addiction prevention resources, she said.\n\nUse of crack rose sharply in 1985, and peaked in 1989, before quickly declining in the early 1990s, according to a Harvard study .\n\nDrug sales and use were concentrated in cities, particularly those with large Black and Latino populations, although there were spikes in use among white populations, too. Between 1984 and 1989, crack was associated with a doubling of homicides of Black males aged 14 to 17. By the year 2000, the correlation between crack cocaine and violence faded amid waning profits from street sales.\n\nRoland Fryer, an author of the Harvard study and a professor of economics, said the effects of the crack epidemic on a generation of Black families and Black children still haven't been thoroughly documented. A lack of accountability for the war on drugs bred mistrust of government and law enforcement in the community, he said.\n\n\"People ask why Black people don't trust (public) institutions,\" said Fryer, who is Black. \"It's because we have watched how we've treated opioids - it's a public health concern. But crack (cocaine) was, 'lock them up and throw away the key, what we need is tougher sentencing.'\"\n\nAnother major player in creating hysteria around drug use during the crack era: the media. On June 17, 1986, 15 years to the day after Nixon declared the drug war, NBA draftee Len Bias died of a cocaine-induced heart attack on the University of Maryland campus.\n\nCoverage was frenzied and coupled with racist depictions of crack addiction in mostly Black and Latino communities. Within weeks of Bias's death, the U.S. House of Representatives drafted the Anti-Abuse Act of 1986.\n\nThe law, passed and signed by Reagan that October, imposed mandatory federal sentences of 20 years to life in prison for violating drug laws. The law also made possession and sale of crack rocks harsher than that of powder cocaine.\n\nThe basketball player's death could have been one of the off-ramps in Lucas's spiral into crack addiction and dealing. By then, he could make $10,000 in four to five hours selling the drug.\n\n\"One of the things that I thought would help me, that I thought would be my rehab, was when Len Bias died,\" Lucas said. \"I thought, if they showed me evidence (he) died from an overdose of smoking crack cocaine, as much as I loved Len Bias, that I would give it up.\"\n\n\"I did not quit,\" he said.\n\nHe was first introduced to crack cocaine in 1986, but kept his drug use largely hidden from his friends and family.\n\n\"What I didn't know at the time was that this was a different type of chemical entering my brain and it was going to change me forever,\" Lucas said. \"Here I am on the verge of being the right-hand man to DJ Nabs, to literally travel the world. That's how bad the drug did me.\"\n\nBy 1988, Fowler's music career had outgrown Durham. He and Lucas moved to Atlanta and, a few years later, Fowler signed a deal to become the official touring DJ for the hip hop group Kris Kross under famed music producer Jermaine Dupri's So So Def record label. Fowler and the group went on to open for pop music icon Michael Jackson on the European leg of the \"Dangerous\" tour.\n\nLucas, who began trafficking crack cocaine between Georgia and North Carolina, never joined his best friend on the road. Instead, he slipped further into his addiction and returned to Durham, where he took a short-lived job as a preschool instructor.\n\nWhen he lacked the money to procure drugs to sell or to use, Lucas resorted to robbing businesses for quick cash. He claims that he was never armed when he robbed \"soft targets,\" like fast food restaurants and convenience stores.\n\nLucas spent four and a half years in state prison for larceny after robbing several businesses to feed his addiction. Because his crimes were considered nonviolent, Lucas learned in prison that he was eligible for an addiction treatment program that would let him out early. But if he violated the terms of his release or failed to complete the treatment, Lucas would serve more than a decade in prison on separate drug trafficking charges under a deal with the court.\n\nHe accepted the deal.\n\nAfter his release from prison and his graduation from the treatment program, Fowler paid out of his pocket to have his friend's fines and fees cleared. That's how Lucas regained his voting rights.\n\nOn a recent Saturday, the two best friends met up to talk in depth about the secret that Lucas intentionally kept from Fowler. The DJ learned of his friend's addiction after seeing a Durham newspaper clipping that detailed the string of robberies.\n\nSitting in Fowler's home, Lucas told his friend that he doesn't regret not being on the road or missing out on the fringe benefits from touring.\n\n\"All I needed was to be around you,\" Lucas said.\n\n\"Right,\" Fowler replied, choking up and wiping tears from his eyes.\n\nLucas continued: \"You know, when I was around you, when there was a party or whatnot, my job, just out of instinct, was to watch your back.\"\n\nIn a separate interview, Fowler, who is a few years younger than Lucas, said, \"I just wanted my brother on the road with me. To help protect me. To help me be strong. And I had to do it by my damn self. And I didn't like that. That's what it was.\"\n\n___\n\nNot everyone was as lucky as Lucas. Often, a drug offense conviction in combination with a violent gun offense carried much steeper penalties. At the heights of the war on drugs, federal law allowed violent drug offenders to be prosecuted in gang conspiracy cases, which often pinned homicides on groups of defendants, sometimes irrespective of who pulled the trigger.\n\nThese cases resulted in sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, a punishment disproportionately doled out to Black and Latino gang defendants.\n\nThat's the case for Bill Underwood, who was a successful R&B and hip hop music promoter in New York City in the late '70s through the '80s, before his 33-year incarceration. A judge granted him compassionate release from federal custody in January, noting his lauded reputation as a mentor to young men in prison and his high-risk exposure to COVID-19 at age 67.\n\nAs the AP reported in 1990, Underwood was found guilty and sentenced to life without parole for racketeering, racketeering conspiracy and narcotics conspiracy, as part of a prosecution that accused his gang of committing six murders and of controlling street-level drug distribution.\n\n\"I actually short-changed myself, and my family and my people, by doing what I did,\" said Underwood, who acknowledges playing a large part in the multimillion-dollar heroin trade, as a leader of a violent Harlem gang from the 1970s through the 1980s.\n\nUnderwood is now a senior fellow with The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit pushing for an end to life imprisonment. He testified to Congress in June that his punishment was excessive.\n\n\"As human beings, we are capable of painful yet transformative self reflection, maturity, and growth, and to deny a person this opportunity is to deny them their humanity,\" he said in the testimony.\n\nThough he feels the system is broken, Brett Roman Williams, a Philadelphia-based independent filmmaker and anti-gun violence advocate, said a lack of counseling and support for people re-entering society after incarceration has serious consequences.\n\nWilliams grew up watching his older brother, Derrick, serve time in prison for a serious drug offense. But in 2016, his brother - who discouraged young people from making choices similar to his own - was killed by gunfire in Philadelphia less than three weeks after he left prison, where he had been held on a parole violation.\n\n\"We do need reform, we do need opportunities and equity within our system of economics. But we all have choices,\" Williams said, adding that those were \"the principles that my brother stood on.\"\n\nRep. Cori Bush of St. Louis, following similar action by several members of Congress before her, last month introduced legislation to decriminalize all drugs and invest in substance abuse treatment.\n\n\"Growing up in St. Louis, the War on Drugs disappeared Black people, not drug use,\" Bush, who is Black, wrote in a statement sent to the AP. \"Over the course of two years, I lost 40 to 50 friends to incarceration or death because of the War on Drugs. We became so accustomed to loss and trauma that it was our normal.\"\n\n___\n\nThe deleterious impacts of the drug war have, for years, drawn calls for reform and abolition from mostly left-leaning elected officials and social justice advocates. Many of them say that in order to begin to unwind or undo the war on drugs, all narcotics must be decriminalized or legalized, with science-based regulation.\n\nDrug abuse prevention advocates, however, claim that broad drug legalization poses more risks to Americans than it would any benefits.\n\nProvisional data released in December from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show overdose deaths from illicit drug use continued to rise amid the global COVID-19 pandemic. And according to the latest Drug Enforcement Administration narcotics threat assessment released in March, the availability of drugs such as fentanyl, heroin and cocaine remained high or plateaued last year. Domestic and transnational drug trade organizations generate tens of billions of dollars in illicit proceeds from sales annually in the U.S., the DEA said.\n\n\"Many people think drug prevention is 'just say no,' like Nancy Reagan did in the '80s, and we know that did not work,\" said Becky Vance, CEO of the Texas-based agency Drug Prevention Resources, which has advocated for evidenced-based anti-drug and alcohol abuse education for more than 85 years.\n\n\"As a person in long-term recovery, I know firsthand the harms of addiction,\" said Vance, who opposes blanket recreational legalization of illicit drugs. \"I believe there has to be another way, without legalizing drugs, to reform the criminal justice system and get rid of the inequities.\"\n\nFrederique, of the Drug Policy Alliance, said reckoning with the war on drugs must start with reparations for the generations senselessly swept up and destabilized by racially biased policing.\n\n\"This was an intentional policy choice,\" Frederique said. \"We don't want to end the war on drugs, and then in 50 years be working on something else that does the same thing. That is the cycle that we're in.\"\n\n\"It has always been about control,\" Frederique added.\n\nAs much as the legacy of the war on drugs is a tragedy, it is also a story about the resilience of people disproportionately targeted by drug policies, said Donovan Ramsey, a journalist and author of the forthcoming book, \"When Crack Was King.\"\n\n\"Even with all of that, it's still important to recognize and to celebrate that we (Black people) survived the crack epidemic and we survived it with very little help from the federal government and local governments,\" Ramsey told the AP.\n\nFowler thinks the war on drugs didn't ruin Lucas' life. \"I think he went through it at the right time, truth be told, because he was young enough. Luke's got more good behind him than bad,\" the DJ said.\n\nLucas sees beauty in making things better, including in his business. But he still dreams of the day when his past isn't held against him.\n\n\"It was the beautification of doing the landscaping that kind of attracted me, because it was like the affirmation that my soul needed,\" he said.\n\n\"I liked to do something and look back at it and say, 'Wow, that looks good.' It's not just going to wash away in a couple of days. It takes nourishment and upkeep.\"\n\n___\n\nMorrison reported from New York. AP writers Allen G.

      "text": "Papers: Police seize $17M in 3 years; blacks targeted most\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nGREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) - Over three years, law enforcement agencies seized $17 million from people in South Carolina they thought got the money through illegal means, according to an investigation by two newspapers.\n\nAbout 65 percent of the people targeted for civil asset forfeiture in the state from 2014 to 2016 were black males in a state where African-American men make up just 13 percent of the population, according to \"Taken,\" a project by The Greenville News and Anderson Independent Mail.\n\nNearly 20 percent of the more than 4,000 people who had money or items seized over three years were never charged with a crime and another one in five were found not guilty or had charges dismissed. In more than half the cases, police seized less than $1,000, the newspapers reported.\n\nThe newspapers gathered court records on civil forfeiture from all 46 counties in South Carolina for their series and called every law enforcement agency in the state to see what they collected and how they spent seized assets.\n\nLaw enforcement says taking the money is vital to ending criminal enterprises. They are allowed to use the money in their operations. Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright uses a pickup truck seized from someone charged with a drug crime as his work vehicle.\n\nCritics say they can target legitimate businesses, making it expensive and sometimes impossible to get the money back.\n\nIsiah Kinloch called 911 after someone broke into his North Charleston apartment in 2015 and broke a bottle over his head. Police found an ounce (28 grams) of marijuana in his apartment and took $1,800 in cash from the tattoo artist.\n\nKinloch was charged with possession with intent to distribute, but the charge was dropped. Kinloch never got his money back and was evicted after he couldn't pay his rent.\n\n\"The robber didn't get anything, but the police got everything,\" Kinloch told the newspapers.\n\nIn Conway, city officials tried to take 72-year-old widow Ella Bromell's home starting in 2007 because people she did not know were selling drugs in her yard and the sidewalk by her home at night. The city said she didn't do enough to stop the crimes.\n\nBromell fought the city for a decade and eventually two judges ruled in her favor. But Bromell told the newspapers she worries the city may try again.\n\nThere is little oversight on how law enforcement agencies spend the money they seize. Wright sold a number of items the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office has taken at auction. Other agencies pay for guns, training, meals or food for police dogs.\n\nThere are a couple of likely reasons blacks are targeted at greater rates. First, they are more likely to run businesses like barber shops or yard care that operate on cash payments. And second, they are more likely to be pulled over in traffic stops, said Ngozi Ndulue, recently a national NAACP senior director, now working at the Death Penalty Information Center.\n\nGreenville Police Chief Ken Miller said his officers go to where they are called or find problems, and that is more often in African-American neighborhoods.\n\n\"We police where people are telling us there are problems. We're not an agency - and I don't know a police agency - that tries to balance racially its interdiction of drugs off the street,\" Miller said.\n\nTwenty-nine states have taken steps to reform their forfeiture process with 15 of them requiring a criminal conviction before seizing property, according to the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian law firm.\n\nBills to reform South Carolina's seizure rules have been recently filed, but have not made it out of committees.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Todd Rutherford said he hopes the findings, especially how often black men are targeted, will boost chances for reform.\n\n\"The fact that they are being stopped is no surprise, but now, the unmitigated fact that they are having their assets seized and taken by the government is appalling,\" the defense attorney from Columbia told the newspapers.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

America's teacher workforce has long been whiter than its student body. In South Carolina, Charleston County aims to increase the number of Black male teachers in the classroom - 60 more in the next three years. While teacher vacancies are affecting all educators, experts say if South Carolina wants its Black students to succeed, it can't afford to lose any more Black men in the classroom. (Grace Beahm Alford/The Post And Courier via AP)\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - After a student in his classroom had yet another outburst, Tyler Wright couldn't bear to see him get written up again. Wright, then a student teacher at a Charleston elementary school, led the child out to the hallway for a chat.\n\nWithin minutes, the student started crying.\n\n\"He was telling me that he really doesn't get to see his dad and stuff like that,\" Wright said. \"That his dad was supposed to come see him but never did. At the end of the day, that was the root cause for the outbursts, because the child was angry.\"\n\nWright told him that he grew up in a similar situation, but he still paid attention the best he could, despite what was going on at home. The conversation was all it took, Wright said, for the student to open up and improve his behavior.\n\nWright became a full-time teacher at Stono Park Elementary in January, thanks to a program in Charleston aimed at making the teaching profession more accessible to Black men, who are vastly underrepresented in classrooms in South Carolina and around the United States.\n\nJust 7% of America's public school teachers were Black during the 2017-18 school year although Black students make up 15% of the student population, according to the most recent available data from the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nTheir absence in classrooms is deeply felt, especially in states like South Carolina, where almost a fifth of students are Black and Black males account for less than 3% of teachers.\n\nHaving teachers who reflect the identity of their students can foster connections between teachers and students - and help avoid the kind of misinterpretation of behavior that can contribute to disparities in discipline for Black students , experts say. Research shows that Black teachers can lead to improved academic performance and higher graduation rates for Black students.\n\nAt a time of teacher shortages in South Carolina and around the country , the presence of Black teachers also can make it more likely for Black students to pursue careers in education themselves.\n\n\"The issue starts fairly young,\" said Eric Duncan, a member of the policy team at the Education Trust, a nonprofit advocacy organization. \"They get negative impressions of school because they are traditionally overdisciplined or misidentified in terms of behavior challenges, when they may have some other issues or challenges that should be addressed in a more culturally proficient way.\"\n\nThere are other barriers to the teaching for Black men. Many come from low-income families and face pressure to find higher-paying jobs, and there are license requirements that were deliberately created to prevent people of color from becoming teachers, Duncan said.\n\nThe program in Charleston, Men of CHS Teach , is a partnership between the University of South Carolina and the Charleston County School District. It places new teachers in elementary classrooms even if they haven't participated in a student teacher program and creates an alternative pathway for them to get teaching licenses.\n\nCCSD decided to focus on recruiting elementary teachers because it's typically difficult to fill those positions with men, and research shows that if Black students have a teacher of color in elementary school, they're less likely to drop out of high school and more likely to consider college. For Black boys of low-income backgrounds, those effects are even greater.\n\nProgram organizers hope to hire 20 male teachers of color within the next five years. Close to half of the district's student population is non-white.\n\nWright was one of the program's first inductees. He decided he wanted to teach after working as a student concerns specialist at one of the district's high schools. A few years later, Wright is leading a classroom of his own.\n\nThe South Carolina districts that have seen the greatest increase in Black male teachers in recent years are Charleston, York 3, Richland 1 and Aiken, with a net total of almost 80 new hires from 2017 to 2021. However, they still have a small share of Black male teachers overall.\n\nStatewide, the racial demographics of teachers barely changed between 2016 and 2021, according to an analysis of state teacher workforce data.\n\nThe program in Charleston was partially inspired by Call Me MiSTER, a Clemson University program that aims to recruit, train and certify men of color to become elementary school teachers in South Carolina.\n\nMark Joseph, the program's director, said they've seen a decrease in applicants in recent years and have had to put more effort into recruitment. It's a new era of teaching after the pandemic, Joseph said, and the program has had to adapt.\n\n\"We took a different approach in terms of talking about leadership, talking about college, talking about what it's like being a part of a program that provides support, encouragement, brotherhood and teamwork,\" he said.\n\nOne realization, he said, has been that teachers are ambassadors for the teaching profession.\n\nAfter all, the teachers they're looking to recruit aren't coming out of thin air - they're sitting in classrooms across South Carolina.\n\n___\n\nThis story is part of Tackling Teacher Shortages, a collaboration between AL.com, The Associated Press, The Christian Science Monitor, The Dallas Morning News, The Fresno Bee in California, The Hechinger Report, The Seattle Times and The Post and Courier in Charleston, South Carolina, with support from the Solutions Journalism Network.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

      "text": "AP Essay: Black male humanity shown in 'Fruitvale'\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nOscar Grant did not deserve to die.\n\nThis is the central message of \"Fruitvale Station,\" a film dramatizing the real-life case of the young unarmed black man shot in the back by a white police officer in 2009. It's a common message, often heard in film and life in general. But the way writer-director Ryan Coogler delivers this message is extraordinary.\n\nAs portrayed by Michael B. Jordan (beware of plot spoilers ahead) Grant is a great father - and a convicted felon. He loves his girlfriend - and he cheats on her. He wants to hold down a legal job - and he can't make it to work on time. He's a drug dealer who takes time to make his bed in the morning, a hardened convict and a mama's boy - a thuggish angel.\n\nBy the time the credits roll, Oscar Grant has become one of the rarest artifacts in American culture: a three-dimensional portrait of a young black male - a human being.\n\nWhich raises the question: If Grant was a real person, what about all these other young black males rendered as cardboard cutouts by our merciless culture? What other humanity are we missing?\n\n\"Everyone either made Oscar out to be a saint, depending on whatever their political agenda was, and on the other side they made him out to be this villain,\" Coogler said in an interview.\n\n\"Everything he had ever done wrong in his life was magnified,\" Coogler said. \"He was just a criminal, a thug, a drug dealer, and he deserved what he got. You live that type of lifestyle, you get what you deserve. His humanity was lost.\"\n\nGrant was 22 years old in the early hours of New Year's Day, returning home to Oakland, California, with his girl and other friends. In the film, a fight starts on the train when Grant encounters an enemy from prison. Police detained Grant and his friends on the platform of the Fruitvale station.\n\nThe police are abusive; Grant and friends respond with belligerence. Grant is being held face down on the platform, unarmed and struggling, when the officer shoots him once in the back. Numerous bystanders captured the scene on video.\n\nThat's the first scene of the film, using real video shot by bystanders. Then it jumps backwards one day to fill in the blanks of an average brother, to illustrate the mundane moments with family, friends and strangers that constitute real life.\n\nWhen Grant's death hit the news, what much of the public saw was a convicted drug dealer who had been released from prison three months before his death. They saw a troublemaker who police said was resisting arrest. They didn't see everything else that's in \"Fruitvale Station.\"\n\n\"If there's one thing missing in our country, it's an acknowledgment of the broad humanity of black folks,\" Ta-Nehisi Coates recently wrote on his blog at TheAtlantic.com. \"Racism - and anti-black racism in particular - is the belief that there's something wrong with black people.\"\n\nThe remedy: \"Close the gap between what they see and who we really are,\" Coates wrote.\n\nAsked what it felt like to close that gap, the actor Jordan said, \"It felt real. It felt like I was telling a story for young African-American males who are stereotyped and judged before people get a chance to know them.\"\n\n\"We wanted to let people know who this guy was through the people who knew him the best,\" Jordan said. \"Show the good, bad and the ugly. Flaws and all.\"\n\n\"Fruitvale Station\" is not unprecedented. It's part of a recent wave of independent black films that are putting authentic black characters on more screens than ever.\n\nThis can make a difference in how black men are perceived in the real world, said black filmmaker Ava DuVernay.\n\n\"A more complex, truer, authentic, comprehensive, non-caricature view of any person, of any kind of person, helps us all to understand each other a little bit more,\" DuVernay said. \"When you're only getting one dimension, unfortunately it does do its work, and that is mostly negative.\"\n\nWe have seen the complex depths of black manhood before, from actors such as Sidney Poitier and Denzel Washington, or television's \"The Wire,\" or Kanye West's music catalog. Even major studios are presenting substantial black male roles this year with \"12 Years a Slave\" and \"Lee Daniels' The Butler.\" (Although the roles are still, well, a slave and a butler.)\n\nPerhaps it's serendipity, then, that gives \"Fruitvale Station\" so much power: The film started trickling into theaters as the verdict was delivered in the Trayvon Martin case in Florida.\n\nThe parallels are inescapable: two young black men shot dead, both unarmed, both with checkered pasts, both accused of being responsible for their own deaths.\n\n\"Often times people can deal with certain things happening to people when they don't see them as full human beings,\" Coogler said. \"They're not real to you, you don't know them. What makes somebody a real person is those gray areas.\"\n\nWhat were Trayvon Martin's gray areas? All many see is black and white.\n\n\"With 'Fruitvale' opening the weekend this verdict came down, it's one of these zeitgeist moments that can't be planned and can never be predicted,\" said DuVernay.\n\n\"In those moments, the power of film is so abundantly clear,\" she said. \"These two lives, Oscar Grant and Trayvon Martin, really intersected in tragic and beautiful ways. One was made into a film that helps folks process and understand the tragedy of another.\"\n\nThe tragedy that Trayvon Martin did not deserve to die.\n\n___\n\nJesse Washington covers race and ethnicity for The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Henry Griffin, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - How U.S. history is told and taught is being challenged and potentially constricted on several fronts, but television's approach to Black History Month is firmly in overdrive.\n\nThere's a wealth of provocative and creative Black-focused programs in February, looking deep into the past to examine topics such as the roots of slavery and the achievements of towering figures including Frederick Douglass. Freshly painful chapters including the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida also get attention.\n\nThe post-George Floyd onset of racial reckoning and the subsequent backlash have coincided with the growth of streaming and its voracious need for content, a two-fold incentive for TV to pay heed to the sweep and nuance of Black experience.\n\nWith broadcast networks and cable channels trying to keep pace with flush streaming services, there's an impressive field of documentaries, profiles and more ahead. Among the highlights (all times are Eastern):\n\n-\"One Thousand Years of Slavery,\" Smithsonian Channel, Feb. 7-28. The four-part docuseries takes a global look at forced labor, examining its effect on people and societies. Prominent figures including Debbie Allen, Valerie Jarrett, Lorraine Toussaint and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker seek out their legacy from slavery as the program explores Africa, the Caribbean and elsewhere in an effort to look anew at history. The series from Angela Bassett and Courtney B. Vance's production company \"stretches the canvas beyond the 400 years we've traditionally learned about\" U.S. slavery, Bassett said in a statement. Vance narrates the series airing each Monday this month.\n\n-\"everything's gonna be all white,\" Showtime, 8 p.m., Friday, Feb. 11. An inventive, lively and trenchant assessment of race in American history from the perspective of people of color. The three-part docuseries delves into topics including racial identity, the ongoing effects of racism on housing, education and health care and efforts by Indigenous people to protect their land. Historians, artists, activists and others weigh in, including Ibram X. Kendi, Jemele Hill, Favianna Rodriguez and Margaret Cho. Director Sacha Jenkins has described the series as embodying \"the collected feelings of folks of color in America.... this is how America has treated us. This is how we feel.\"\n\n-\"American Masters: Marian Anderson: The Whole World in Her Hands,\" PBS, Feb. 8, (check local listings). A study of the artist and civil rights advocate's life, career and legacy, the film has the advantage of her speaking as well as singing voice. Anderson recorded more than 30 cassette tapes of interviews in the 1950s in preparation for writing a memoir and they, along with other archival material, were used to \"explore history from her point of view,\" director Rita Coburn said in a statement. The first Black performer in a leading role at the Metropolitan Opera, Anderson made an indelible stand for civil rights and human dignity in 1939 when she was barred from one venue and instead sang to the world from the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n-\"Profiled: The Black Man,\" Discovery+, Feb. 12-March 5. The four-part docuseries uses historical footage, interviews and commentary to spotlight the difficulties confronting Black men over the decades and those who overcame them. The hourlong episodes each address a stubborn stereotype that pigeonholes Black males: dangerous, absentee fathers, detractors of Black females, unemotional. Actor Tristan \"Mack\" Wilds is the host, with activists DeRay Mckesson and Tamika Mallory and actor Billy Porter among those sharing their perspectives.\n\n-\"Oscar Micheaux: The Superhero of Black Filmmaking,\" TCM, 9:30 p.m. Feb. 13. The documentary about early 20th-century movie pioneer Micheaux is part of the channel's monthlong tribute to Black achievement in filmmaking. TCM host Jacqueline Stewart and other experts will discuss films including 1963′s \"Lilies of the Field\" (8 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 6) starring Sidney Poitier, the first Black winner of the Oscar for best actor. David Oyelowo, who played Martin Luther King Jr. in \"Selma,\" will join Stewart on Feb. 20 for the airing of Ava DuVernay's 2014 film (8 p.m.) and on Feb. 27 for the double-bill of Spike Lee's 1992 \"Malcolm X\" (8 p.m.) starring Denzel Washington and the 1968 Agnès Varda documentary \"Black Panthers\" (11:30 p.m.).\n\n-\"Frederick Douglass in Five Speeches,\" HBO, 9 p.m. Feb. 23. Jeffrey Wright and others bring to life the quintet of key speeches by Douglass, who escaped slavery and became an abolitionist, renowned orator and writer. Denzel Whitaker performs the 1841 speech Douglass gave at an anti-slavery convention, an early public recounting of his life as a slave, with Nicole Beharie delivering \"What, to the Slave, is the Fourth of July?\", an 1852 address by Douglass aimed at reminding his fellow citizens that Black people remained enslaved a quarter-century after the Declaration of Independence was signed. Scholars David Blight and Henry Louis Gates Jr. and a Douglass descendent are among those offering context.\n\n-\"Trayvon Martin: 10 Years Later,\" CBS News Streaming Network and Smithsonian Channel on Feb. 26; BET at 8 p.m. on Feb. 28. Gayle King anchors the special that revisits the 17-year-old's fatal shooting in Sanford, Florida, by George Zimmerman and its part in what would become the Black Lives Matter movement. Trayvon's mother, Sybrina Fulton, and members of Mothers of the Movement, a support group she founded for those who have lost children to gun violence or police, are interviewed along with social activists, lawyers and others. The special also examines how Trayvon's death and Zimmerman's acquittal fanned a new wave of activism among pro athletes.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

      "text": "What Will Half of Young Black Men Have in Common by Age 23?\n\nEven if you know that African Americans are arrested at a greater rate than their white counterparts, it's still a shock to see the scale of the disparity. To wit, according to a new study published in the Journal of Crime & Delinquency, nearly 50 percent of all black males have been arrested by the age of 23. Overall, 30 percent of black men, 26 percent of Latino men, and 22 percent of white men have been arrested by age 18, and those numbers jump-respectively-to 49 percent, 44 percent, and 38 percent after five years.\n\nIn a press release, the lead author of the study-University of South Carolina sociologist Robert Brame-is forthright about what this means for their livelihoods and future success, even if an arrest doesn't come with a conviction. \"Criminal records that show up in searches can impede employment, reduce access to housing, thwart admission to and financing for higher education and affect civic and volunteer activities such as voting or adoption. They also can damage personal and family relationships,\" he says.\n\nIt's key that we're clear about what this information means. The high arrest rate for African American men isn't evidence of greater criminality; it's evidence of greater policing. We can see this in arrest rates for different offenses. The black arrest rate for marijuana possession, for instance, is nearly three times the arrest rate for whites, despite similar rates of marijuana use . But, because blacks are more likely to live in hyper-segregated neighborhoods with levels of poverty unseen among whites, they're more likely to have regular police contact. Likewise, between the war on drugs and policies like \"stop and frisk,\" blacks in many areas are more likely to encounter law enforcement, not because they're more likely to commit crimes, but because we've institutionalized the ridiculous view that blackness has something to do with criminality .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne other thing: As liberals and conservatives argue over the ultimate efficacy of our \"war on poverty,\" it's important to recognize the extent to which both parties undermined the fight for economic security with a hugely draconian approach to criminal justice. Low-income communities were met with over-policing and mass incarceration at the same time the federal government hit the brakes on anti-poverty programs. When you add that to the powerful legacy of housing discrimination , the collapse of the industrial base, and the cumulative disadvantage of generational poverty, you're left with stagnation, decline, and ruin.\n\nIf the War on Poverty was a failure-or alternatively, just a modest success-then it has a lot to do with the fact that we ignored segregation, pursued a ruinous War on Drugs, and refused to invest resources in the communities we engineered for failure.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Will America's Fear of Black Men Ever Go Away?\n\nThis weekend in Charlotte, North Carolina, Jonathan Ferrell was shot to death by law enforcement while looking for help after a car accident.\n\nFerrell, a 24-year-old former Florida A&M football player, crashed his car early Saturday morning. After climbing out, he ran to a nearby home for help. The resident, a woman waiting for her husband, opened the door and-realizing it wasn't him-closed it. She then called 911 to report a man trying to break into her home. Three officers arrived and found Ferrell about a block from the house. During the encounter, according to the police report, Ferrell ran toward them and at least one opened fire, killing him.\n\nFerrell joins a long, tragic list. This March, for instance, Kimani Gray was shot to death by officers in Brooklyn, New York, after he was confronted for \"suspicious behavior.\" A year before, in New Orleans, Wendell Allen, 20, was killed in his home by police executing a search warrant for marijuana. And Kendrec McDade, 19, was killed while running from police in Pasadena, California, after he was falsely accused of attempted theft.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow, it's tempting to say race has nothing to do with this-that it was a tragic accident, borne of fear and misunderstanding. After all, there's no evidence of intentional bias; just a young man in the wrong place, at the wrong time. But racism is a cultural force as much as it is a series of beliefs, and as such, it bears on our subconscious as much as it does our actions. For Americans, race has a strong pull on our sense of fear and our perceptions of aggression , a fact that has more to do with the legacy of slavery and our long history of racial demonization than it does any particular set of crime statistics. And in particular, according to a range of surveys and implicit association tests-which measure unconscious bias by flashing faces and soliciting responses-white Americans are more afraid of black men than any other group in the country.\n\nIn one such test ( PDF ), researchers found that black males elicited the most negative reactions from white subjects-simply seeing them was enough to make participants feel uncomfortable. And in a 2009 survey on the question of blacks and violence , drawn from a nationally representative sample of white Americans, more than 30 percent said that blacks were more violent than whites. Respondents were also asked specifically about violence among black men versus white men, black women, and white women. The results? More than 40 percent said that \"many\" or \"almost all\" black men were violent, compared to less than 20 percent who said the same of black women or white men, and less than 10 percent who said the same of white women.\n\nNo doubt these conscious biases are fed by stories such as that of Aaron Alexis, the man suspected of killing 11 people at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday.\n\nWith all of this in mind, let's return to the Ferrell shooting, with the reality of unconscious bias in mind. When Ferrell knocked on the door, asking for help, did the woman see an injured young man, dazed and confused from a car accident? Or did she see someone who would harm her if she didn't take action? Judging from her decision to call the police and report the incident as an attempted burglary, my guess is the latter. It's one thing to ask for police assistance-there's a good chance I would have done the same-it's something else to assume malign intent. Likewise, when the police confronted Ferrell, did they see someone who needed assistance, or did they assume-instinctively-that the young black man coming towards them was a threat to be neutralized?\n\nI think we know the answer.\n\nNone of this is to say that the men and women responsible for Ferrell's death are racists . There's no way to know what lives in their hearts, but my guess is that they aren't the reincarnations of Bull Connor. They don't have to be; this is just how racism works. The idea that African Americans are prone to violence has a long pedigree, from antebellum fears of slave revolts, to the 1890s , when white supremacist scholars took crime statistics and twisted them into \"proof\" of inherent black criminality.\n\nWhich is to say that, in writing about Jonathan Ferrell, I've tried to imagine a situation that doesn't end with his death. I can't. Fear of black men has a tremendous hold on the American subconscious, and it mixes with our perceptions in ways that guarantee tragedy. As a nation, it's one of our deadliest problems, and I'm not sure we can fix it.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "End the Stigma on Black Men Suffering From Depression\n\nBlack men suffer from depression, too . We just don't talk about it nearly as much as we should.\n\nBlack men take on the same battles that tens of millions of Americans wrestle with everyday. The only difference is that most of us suffer in silence .\n\nMost of us have been told things (often by other Black people) such as \"Black people don't go to therapy\" or \"depression is for white people.\" Neither of these things is remotely true-depression doesn't discriminate. In fact, according to Mental Health America, approximately 7 million Black Americans are suffering from depression at this very moment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI'm one of them, and have been battling depression most of my life.\n\nFrom an early age I knew there was something different about me. Whether it was the undiagnosed panic attacks that forced me to sit in my school's hallway with my head between my legs as a small child or the night terrors that made me terrified to fall asleep, I recognized that I was experiencing things that my friends weren't.\n\nLike many children struggling with an undiagnosed mental illness, I didn't know how to explain what I was feeling-or that I couldn't control it. My teachers didn't appreciate my need to sit in the hallway until the sensory overload was over, so I was labeled \"problematic\" and repeatedly reprimanded in front of my classmates.\n\nIn my mind, I was a terrible child for causing trouble while my mother-who was going to law school while simultaneously trying to put me through private school-did the best she could. It broke my heart to see her so desperate to help me, even though she couldn't help what she didn't yet understand.\n\nMy mother instilled in me at an early age that I was a Black boy in an unsympathetic white world (as many Black mothers do for their sons). Empathy would rarely be on the menu. So I needed to be tough, to be stoic, to never let my guard down. I couldn't let my classmates, my friends, or even the adults around me see a hint of vulnerability.\n\nIt was then that I first learned how lonely it can be to suffer in silence.\n\nBlack men leave the house every day not knowing whether they will make it home, for myriad reasons. Black men are often viewed as threatening, aggressive, and sometimes less than human-depending on where we live and who we interact with. Black men carry around trauma every day, and that trauma is often compartmentalized or suppressed until the proverbial balloon fills up and pops.\n\nSo I did what most Black males do when grappling with mental health challenges, I stopped talking about it. I stopped leaving the classroom. I kept it all inside. Some days it worked and some days it didn't, but over time the frequency of my attacks appeared to dissipate. I wondered whether I had actually managed to will my suffering away, by merely refusing to acknowledge it.\n\nOnce I got to college I realized that, no, I hadn't \"beaten\" depression.\n\nMidway through my freshman year I began suffering from mood swings. Some days my roommates had to force me to leave our apartment, which had begun to resemble a dark cave, while other days I was the life of the party, feeling on top of the world. Every day was a roll of the dice as to how I would feel emotionally.\n\nBut just as I had for most of my life, I tucked my emotions away and tried to distract myself. As my depression worsened, I didn't have anyone to lean on (or at least wouldn't allow myself the option). There was the occasional obligatory check-in from my parents, or momentary concern when I ignored most of their calls-but if I'm being objectively honest, we had been conditioned to not discuss our emotions, which was a behavioral pattern that I was all too comfortable perpetuating.\n\n\"Everybody gets sad occasionally,\" I told myself. And so, everyday I put a smile on my face and added some charm to my voice, just so that I could convince myself and everyone around me that I was ok. But this wasn't just garden variety sadness-this was severe and dangerous.\n\nI wasn't ok. Not even close.\n\nMy low moods led me to sleep for days, snap at my friends, and make experiencing joy all but impossible. Trying to maintain some semblance of normality, so that I didn't feel so broken, drove me to exhaustion.\n\nOn my 20th birthday, I wrestled with the notion of taking my own life. I've never spoken those words aloud until now. (This will shock even the people closest to me, for which I'm sorry-but it's true.) The next morning, I rationalized it all away by telling my roommates it was just a bad night of partying, but deep down I knew that I had gotten dangerously close to the line.\n\nOnce the worst had passed, I felt weak and embarrassed. I tried to numb the pain. No one could know about this. And I promised myself I wouldn't allow myself to sink so deeply into the emotional abyss again. I had to find a new way to cope.\n\nAs I grew into adulthood, I got better at \"managing\" my depression, but I still wasn't ready to ask for help. This is like trying to fix a car if you're not a mechanic. You'll have better results working with a pro.\n\nBut even through all this lonesome, inward despondence, I grew into what would appear by most measures to be a successful young adult. I had a national political column, I regularly appeared on television, and I passed the New York Bar. Not bad for a kid who could barely sit in class. But before I could enjoy the fruits of my labor, the lows of depression came back with a vengeance.\n\nThe pain become so all-encompassing that in my late twenties I finally decided it was time to see a therapist. I needed to talk. I needed to understand myself. I needed to ensure that what happened in college never happened again.\n\nWhen I told a close family member that I was in therapy, he was incredulous: \"What do you need to go to a therapist for?\" The more I tried to explain it, the less he appeared to understand. I didn't fare much better when I broached the topic with a second family member. He simply replied: \"Just pray on it. You don't need that stuff.\"\n\nI opened up, made myself vulnerable, and was dismissed like a door-to-door salesman by people in my own family and community. It was mortifying. I felt unheard. The loneliness was overwhelming. So I eventually stopped going.\n\nThe idea that we should struggle with depression without any of the proper tools or resources isn't just wrongheaded, it's inhumane. Black people absolutely \"need that stuff,\" and I was about to find out exactly why.\n\nIn late October 2020, while on a work trip in Florida, my life was upended-and with it, my emotional stability.\n\nMy phone rang. It was 5 a.m., a time when it's very rare you're about to hear good news. It was my grandmother, telling me I needed to come home. My grandfather didn't have much time left. To this day it feels like an out of body experience, so much did I worship my grandfather.\n\nAnd so began the worst two weeks of my life.\n\nMy grandfather's death brought with it a level of sadness that enveloped me whole. Publicly, I held it together for my family (and if I'm being honest, for myself). Privately, I was obliterated inside.\n\nAfter the funeral, I rarely left my apartment, almost never saw friends or family, and wasn't likely to answer the phone. This went on for months.\n\nThis was the psychological equivalent of drowning, without a life preserver, unable to find my way out of the current. I didn't want my family or my friends to know how bad my lows had gotten. I didn't even want to admit to myself that I no longer was able to just push the pain away.\n\nSo in the middle of the night, after accepting that not only was I not getting better, but in fact I was getting worse, I finally sat down at my computer and began searching for a Black therapist-a personal preference, as I felt more comfortable opening up to someone who could relate to my life experience and understand the nuances of being Black in America.\n\nThis time around, therapy was much more effective. It afforded me another chance at a happy life. It wasn't easy, though. Therapy can be frustrating as hell just as often as it can be illuminating. But I learned healthier ways to cope, and it forced me to address the root causes of my suffering.\n\nUnpacking my abandonment issues and feelings of inadequacy was no walk in the park, but it was a down payment for future happiness. If it didn't provide \"the answers,\" it at least helped me understand what were \"the questions\"-and to identify and isolate the lies I was being told by the villain of depression.\n\nAnd yet, even now, the prospect of going public with my depression and admitting that I'm one of those 7 million Black Americans is terrifying.\n\nDid I just set my career on fire? What will my friends think? What will my coworkers think? What will they say behind my back?\n\nI won't pretend that it doesn't make me want to shrink away and hide. But I can't. Too many people are going through exactly what I went through. And being blessed enough to have survived, I feel called to use the modest platform I have to speak up and share my story. There's no glory in suffering in silence.\n\nAs a culture, Black people need to do better communicating about mental health. That means empathizing with (and not shaming) other Black people who admit they're struggling and need support. It means promoting the value of mental health treatment and the virtue of engaging with therapists, so that we each may learn healthy coping mechanisms.\n\nThe idea that therapy makes you \"sensitive\" or \"weak\" is completely backwards. If anything, it's a sign of becoming a well-adjusted adult. Everyone could stand to have someone to talk to-we all suffer, we all have doubts. Friends and family are, too often, not enough. Mental health professionals, like all health care professionals, are equipped with tools and training that lay people simply don't possess.\n\nWe don't shame people when they get cancer, so why should we treat depression as a failure?\n\nPraying the pain away or \"being a man\" or being \"proud\" isn't a treatment plan, it's emotional malpractice. It's time to break the cycle. We can show the next generation of young Black men (and women) that addressing your mental health isn't weakness, it's strength and maturity.\n\nGoing to therapy didn't magically cure me overnight. There is no silver bullet. But what I've learned is that no one can take on life all by themselves. We're all still a work in progress. I have good days and tougher days, but I no longer worry about what's coming next. I'm still learning ways to better communicate and not compartmentalize my pain, but most importantly, I'm learning healthy ways to cope and deal with life's challenges head on. At the end of the day, the goal is progress, not perfection. No one is perfect.\n\nIf you're struggling with your mental health, I want you to know that you're not weak, you're not unlovable, and you're not alone. You're a warrior who fights a battle every day that few ever see. I see you. I've been where you are. I asked for help and so can you. Don't just do it for yourself, do it for the people you love and who love you back. You are worth saving.\n\nIt's time to end the stigma: Black men suffer from depression, too. But that's not the end of the story.\n\nBlack men go to therapy, too.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

This weekend, the American Family Association spokesman and right wing radio host paid tribute to National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness day by giving a new motive to his existing war on homosexuality: his love for black males. Fischer misread a CDC fact sheet from 2010 about black males in the U.S., saying that they make up \"six percent of the population\"- it's 12 percent - and \"44 percent of HIV\" infections in the country. \"This is black genocide,\" he declared, revealing that he is also under the impression that being gay might not exactly be legal in the U.S.: \"If you are for the legalization of homosexuality, you are for the acceptability of homosexuality, you are for the normalization of homosexuality, you do not care about black males. You have no compassion in your black heart for black males because they're being decimated by HIV/AIDS ... So why am I opposed to the normalization of homosexual behavior? Because I love black males.

      "text": "Why Young Men of Color Are Joining White-Supremacist Groups\n\nPORTLAND, Oregon-Outfitted in a flak jacket and fighting gloves, Enrique Tarrio was one of dozens of black, Latino, and Asian men who marched alongside white supremacists in Portland on Aug. 4.\n\nTarrio, who identifies as Afro-Cuban, is president of the Miami chapter of the Proud Boys, who call themselves \" Western chauvinists ,\" and \"regularly spout white-nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists,\" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Last month, prior to the Patriot Prayer rally he attended in Portland, Tarrio was pictured with other far-right activists making a hand sign that started as a hoax but has become an in-joke. Last year, Tarrio said traveled to Charlottesville , Virginia, for the Unite the Right rally that ended with a neo-Nazi allegedly killing an anti-fascist protester. (The Proud Boys said any members who went to the event were kicked out.)\n\nPatriot Prayer + Proud Boys in Vancouver night b4 Aug 4 Portland rally many fear will end in violence. Tusitala \"Tiny\" Toese and others make an apparent \"White Power\" hand gesture. T-shirts read, \"Pinochet Did Nothing Wrong.\" pic.twitter.com/7LI4BbA6za\n\nTarrio and other people of color at the far-right rallies claim institutional racism no longer exists in America. In their view, blacks are to blame for any lingering inequality because they are dependent on welfare, lack strong leadership, and believe Democrats who tell them \"You're always going to be broke. You're not going to make it in society because of institutional racism,\" as one mixed-race man put it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf racism doesn't exist, I ask Tarrio, how would he explain the disproportionate killing of young black men by police ? \"Hip-hop culture,\" he says. It \"glorifies that lifestyle... of selling drugs, shooting up.\" Because of that, \"Obviously you're going to have higher crime rates. Obviously you're going to have more police presence and more confrontations.\" (Police kill black males aged 15 to 34 at nine times the rate of the general population.)\n\nElysa Sanchez, who is black and Puerto Rican, attended the \"Liberty or Death Rally Against Left-Wing Violence\" in Seattle on Aug. 18, joining about 20 militiamen open-carrying handguns and semi-automatic rifles.\n\nSanchez says, \"If black people are committing more murders, more robberies, more thefts, more violent crime, that's why you would see more black men having encounters with the police.\"\n\nAlso in Seattle, Franky Price, who said he is  \"black and white,\"wore a T-shirt reading, \"It's okay to be white.\"\n\nThey are among nearly a dozen black, Latino, and Asian participants at far-right rallies on the West Coast interviewed by The Daily Beast recently. They represent the new face of the far right that some scholars term \"multiracial white supremacy.\"\n\nThe Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer, which overlap, embrace an America-first nationalism that is less pro-white than it is anti-Muslim, anti-illegal immigrant, and anti-Black Lives Matter. \"Proud Boys is multi-racial fraternity with thousands of members worldwide,\" a lawyer for the group's leader, Gavin McInnis, said in a statement. \"The only requirements for membership are that a person must be biologically male and believe that the West is the best.\"\n\nDaniel Martinez HoSang, associate professor at Yale University, co-author of the forthcoming Producers, Parasites, Patriots: Race and the New Right-Wing Politics of Precarity , says \"Multiculturalism has become a norm in society\" and has spread from corporations and consumer culture to conservatism and the far-right.\n\nIndeed, Patriot Prayer's leader is Joey Gibson, who is half-Japanese and claims Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as a hero. But his agenda is the opposite of King's. Gibson's rallies have attracted neo-Confederates and neo-Nazis.\n\nHis right-hand man is Tusitala \"Tiny\" Toese, a 345-pound Samoan American who calls himself \" a brown brother for Donald Trump \" and is notorious for brawling . By bringing diversity to what is at heart a white-supremacist movement, people of color give it legitimacy to challenge state power and commit violence against their enemies .\n\nDavid Neiwert, author of Alt-America: The Rise of the Radical Right in the Age of Trump , says, \"The ranks of people of color who show up to these right-wing events are totally dominated by males.\" He says the alt-right targets white males between the ages of 15 and 30 with a message of male resentment, which ends up attracting black, Latino, and Asian men as well.\n\nNeiwert says many young men of color in the far-right grew up on conservative traditions common in minority communities. Their journey to the far-right has been enabled by the ease of recruitment in the internet age and the endorsement of extremism by Trump.\n\nEntry points to the far-right include male-dominated video-game culture, the anti-feminist gamergate , troll havens on 4chan and 8chan , and the conspiracism that flourishes on websites like Infowars. Libertarianism is another gateway.\n\n\"A lot of these young guys,\" Neiwert says, \"especially from the software world, who are being sucked into white nationalism, start out being worked up about Ayn Rand in high school.\"\n\nAndrew Zhao, 25, a software engineer, says his parents, physicists who emigrated from mainland China, \"are Trump fans.\" He found out about the Seattle rally from Reddit and Facebook and said, \"We need more patriotism. A lot of liberals don't like America.\"\n\nDaniel HoSang says some people of color are drawn to the far-right because they \"identify with the military, with nationalism, with patriotism, with conservatism.\"\n\nWearing a Proud Boys hat, David Nopal, 23, came to the Seattle rally alone, like others. Nopal, whose parents crossed illegally from Mexico, said, \"I'm very patriotic. The U.S. isn't perfect, but we are a hell of a lot better than other countries.\"\n\nSanchez comes from a military family. \"They all love America. It's a big part of the reason I'm a patriot.\"\n\nSimilarly, Tarrio attributes his anti-socialist politics to his grandfather's experience in Cuba under Fidel Castro.\n\nThey proudly identify as \"American\" without modifiers. In their America they've never experienced racism. They eagerly talk politics, but evidence of their America is scant beyond the internet. Institutional racism has been ended by affirmative action, \"black privilege,\" and equal protection under the law. Any remaining black inequality is caused by social welfare and liberal policies. In any case, it was Democrats who started the Klan.\n\nPeople of color within the far-right play a role that \"excuses white racism and bears witness to the failure of people of color,\" HoSang says, adding that they make \"white supremacy a more durable force.\"\n\nHoSang said the far-right is trying to broaden its appeal from a whites-only movement in a multiracial America, so it is \"laying claim to the ideas of anti-racism, racial uplift, and civil-rights progress.\"\n\nHoSang says, \"It's hard for people to wrap their head around how Dr. King and civil-rights language are being used to legitimate positions approaching fascism and violence to restore hierarchy and order. But they are.\"\n\nEditor's Note: This story has been updated with a statement from the Proud Boys and to clarify that the group formally opposed the Charlottesville march.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "After Trayvon, Conservatives Discover Black-on-Black Violence\n\nThe killing of Trayvon Martin has focused the attention of conservatives on the high rate of homicides in urban communities, but only as a means of deflecting attention away from George Zimmerman. Right-wing commentators have suddenly become deeply concerned with black-on-black street killings, asking why we're being \"distracted\" by Martin . This ignores the obvious: everyone knows who Trayvon's killer is, and he has yet to be arrested.\n\nConservatives peddling this line are trying to suggest that young blacks are intrinsically equipped to fail and to damage one another and that blacks don't care when young blacks are done in by other blacks. All of this is simply untrue and mean-spirited.\n\nAs Randall Robinson wrote, \"There's nothing wrong with us, something was done to us.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat \"something\" was more than 300 years of the most inhumane and brutal form of slavery ever perpetrated by one group of human beings on another. And the remnants of those dark centuries still haunt blacks here in America in the form of abject poverty, low achievement, and endemic violence in poor communities. While neither the current generation of whites nor their parents or grandparents participated in the brutality perpetrated by their more-distant ancestors, many continue to benefit from its effects, and not nearly enough have engaged in any efforts to ameliorate the lingering effects of slavery. A debt is owed to blacks, even if it's uncollectible and never paid.\n\nNo group of people ever willingly allows its young people to devour themselves as senselessly as young black males are currently doing in America. These youths are drowning in a perfect storm of neglect, poverty, and mindless violence. If there were an easy solution to the high rate of violence among young men of color, the elders of the black community, criminologists, and social scientists would have \"solved\" the problem decades ago.\n\nBut if pointed barbs from small-minded conservative commentators are what it takes to spur the country into action, then so be it. The point is to solve the problem and not play petty politics with young black lives.\n\nSome potential short-term solutions: In more enlightened countries, poor people are paid to see doctors, because it's cheaper to keep people from getting sick than to have to pay for emergency care once they are seriously ill. Other countries are experimenting with the idea of paying addicts to stay clean. Death is costly. So why not take the fundamentally conservative idea that people respond to marginal economic incentives and apply it to the intractable problem of black youth violence?\n\nOne potential answer is paying students for earning good grades. All parents capable of doing so already engage in the practice in one form or another, but parents without the financial wherewithal or resources cannot use this simple carrot-and-stick approach, which has achieved remarkable success in Brazil, where it's a government policy, and some promising results in New York City, where a privately funded pilot program has tested the idea. I've had an educator tell me that he was \"philosophically opposed\" to paying kids to get good grades-so I suppose he expected children from disadvantaged backgrounds, where there's no family tradition of education, to become good students because it's the right thing to do.\n\nStaying with money, adults need to understand that it's tough being broke in an iPad world. Young blacks, like everyone else in our society, are bombarded with messages telling them what they absolutely need to have, and absent a legitimate method of acquiring such \"things\"-basic necessities of adolescence, if you stop and think about it-they will resort to illegitimate methods.\n\nPetty drug dealers, attempting to make a few bucks in one of the few ways readily available to them in the ghetto, get shot when something goes awry over amounts of money so small it's truly laughable, if not for the fact some kid died. Thus, paying students-even a small amount-can potentially make a huge difference in the inner-city crime rate. We cannot afford not to come up with the funds to do so on a broader scale.\n\nIn underclass urban communities, 29-year-old grandmothers are expected to help their teenaged children to successfully raise the next generation-and in most cases it quite simply can't be done. The answer lies in programs similar to the Harlem Children's Zone, where stable adults take young mothers by the hand and show them, step by step, day in and day out, how to raise their offspring. The mentoring is so intense that both the mother and child are being raised at the same instant. The success rate for such programs is well-documented, but the downside is such programs take time, political will, and an investment of capital (all of which we in America seem in short supply of). We can't find the money to save children of the underclass, but we damn sure will find the money to lock them up and further disenfranchise them when they act out as adults.\n\nGeoffrey Canada, the head of the Harlem Children's Zone, has been successful because of the large amounts of money he has been able to raise in wealthy New York City. If wealthy black entertainers, athletes, and businesspeople followed the example of \"bad boy\" football player Braylon Edwards, who established a charity to assist students in Cleveland (and has maintained his commitment to these kids even after he was traded), programs like Canada's could spring up across the country-and the back of the beast of urban violence could be broken in one generation. I know that other blacks of means are doing some good with their wealth, but it's simply not enough. How can they expect whites to shoulder the burden for the uplifting of the black race when so many blacks of means are stuck-like spoiled children-in the cult of celebrity? Perhaps Barack and Michelle Obama should have these folks to dinner at the White House after the election and do some serious arm twisting.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Trayvon Martin Slaying Shows the Young Black Male Is Society's Prime Target\n\nThe killing of Trayvon Martin (essentially for the \"crime\" of walking while black) and its aftermath provides one of those riveting moments in American history when the curtain of our still-all-too-rampant racism normally hides behind is pulled back ... exposing the ugly underbelly of prejudice and hatred that still exists in too many corners of our society.\n\nThrough decade after decade of scurrilous application of Jim Crow laws-combined with other forms of racially motivated biases that keep minorities marginalized-our country has created the near-perfect target for the majority culture's collective hatred, fear, and opprobrium: the Young Black Male. Hoodie optional.\n\nAnd thanks to new laws on the books in various parts of the country, the demographic many seemingly love to loathe and despise now have legalized targets pinned on their backs; the Young Black Male is now officially considered fair game in some parts of America. Game on-lock and load.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnder the \"Stand Your Ground\" laws that have been enacted in many states anyone can do what George Zimmerman did in Sanford , Fla.: shoot someone (preferably a Young Black Male) to death and then claim self-defense. Of course, it won't work too well if the shooter is black and the victim is white. Oh, and after the \"kill\" the shooter should bop him or herself upside the head with that trusty Glock ... just hard enough to raise the self-defense knot right above the left eye.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the shooter in this case will, in all likelihood, stand trial on state or federal charges, Southern \"justice\" being what it historically has been, there's no assurance of a fair and unbiased jury being selected-or of a conviction ... even if the evidence is overwhelming. This is why so many blacks were lynched in America a century ago: whites knew they could carry out their murderous acts with impunity. And, to quote an NAACP slogan: in America, \"much has changed, much has not.\"\n\nThe emerging facts surrounding Trayvon's death are so glaring as to be mind-boggling. Most important among them is the fact that when Zimmerman told a police dispatcher that he was following a Young Black Male (who, according to Zimmerman, \"appeared to be on drugs\"), the dispatcher responded, \"We don't need for you to do that.\" At that point Zimmerman should have gotten back into his vehicle and simply followed Trayvon until police arrived, but he continued his pursuit; a deranged white man on the hunt of the elusive Young Black Male. Zimmerman even said, \"These assholes always get away.\" But not this time.\n\nSupposedly, a number of break-ins had occurred in the gated community that served as Zimmerman's hunting and killing grounds, and while no suspects had been arrested or even spotted ... it was assumed by him and others that the dreaded Young Black Male-the fall guy for all our nation's collective neighborhood fears-was responsible for them.\n\nIt's abundantly clear by a preponderance of (albeit) circumstantial evidence that Zimmerman wasn't simply \"standing his ground\" ... he actually was out looking for what he considered \"fair game\" (read: the Young Black Male) and clearly was the aggressor in the confrontation with Trayvon, whom he ran to the ground and slaughtered.\n\nAnd if Zimmerman is not prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, expect other killings to occur in states with similar laws and even some where laws are not so unambiguous. There is an untold number of other Zimmermans out there, waiting to protect the white race by offing a Young Black Male.\n\nThe \"investigation\" (if you can call it that) carried out by the Sanford Police Department was so slipshod one has to wonder what relationship-if any- Zimmerman had with local police prior to the killing. Because Trayvon's body was tested for drugs and Zimmerman was not (all police officers involved in a shooting, deadly or not, are routinely tested), does this suggest a special relationship between the shooter and the police? Was Zimmerman on their payroll? Was he a cop wannabe they tolerated? Why did police never investigate someone who had called them dozens of times (always with unfounded, wacky suspicions about Young Black Males) just to see if he had a screw loose? The questions just keep coming and coming.\n\nThe silver lining of this darkest of clouds is that while the majority of protesters at the rallies protesting Trayvon's killing are people of color, there have been enough whites in attendance to prove that all people of good will find this killing abominable and not to be tolerated. Trayvon's death could bring about a new era of multiracial civil-rights activism in America.\n\nNow if we can just convert some of the extant outrage over the killing of a Young Black Male by a white vigilante ... to similar outrage when Young Black Males senselessly kill each other, we would be paying fitting tribute to the life-and tragic death-of Trayvon Martin.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "How Do I Raise a Black Son in Trump's America?\n\nI was in my mid-thirties when my perspective on life changed. For as long as I can remember, I had vacillated about cracking open this new chapter, but when my biological clock started ticking and my husband and I neared a decade together, it was time to take the leap. Despite what felt like an eternity, it wasn't long before my OB/GYN was pointing out a pulsating grainy black and white blob on a monitor. I wanted to hear that the indistinct mass would be my future son. Or so I thought.\n\nI knew that pregnancy could be hard on the body. Morning sickness, swollen feet, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia and hemorrhoids were just a few of the symptoms that plagued my friends. And the birth process itself was just a whole other toll on the body and mind. For most of my pregnancy I thankfully managed to escape these physical ailments. Instead, my pain morphed into anxiety about the gender of my child and what that meant for his or her future.\n\nDespite always wanting a boy, I kept circling back to the thought that this innocent being's blackness would be the first thing society would see. And that reality would alter how we raised him, how he walked through the world because the burden of male blackness manifests itself differently-disproportionately and more often fatally-to female blackness. While black women are also victims of dehumanizing treatment, black males fall victim to knee-jerk deadly reactions of police, who view them as more physically intimidating than women.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI made a pact with myself to stop poring over the news before going to bed. When I did, there was yet another headline about an unarmed black man being harmed by police, which kept me tossing and turning all night. Over the past few years, the relentless stream of stories justified my fear and feelings of helplessness to equip my child with the tools needed to live without constantly looking over his or her shoulder.\n\nThere were the especially heartbreaking stories of young black boys robbed of their childhood, like 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was killed when cops mistook his toy gun for a real one. Then there was Freddie Gray, Philando Castile, Alton Sterling, Walter Scott, Sam DuBose, Eric Garner, Terence Crutcher, Chinedu Valentine Okobi. These were just a fraction of the stories that made it into the mainstream news. My greatest fear was that my unborn child would be added to this list.\n\nStill, before my first trimester ended, I jumped on the opportunity to learn the gender of this tiny being growing inside me. My husband and I waited in the windowless cramped office of the genetic counselor, staring at the piles of papers on her desk. \"So, what's your guess?\" I asked him.\n\nHe knew what I was talking about and in his usual even toned manner, replied, \"You know it's been determined already. I just want it to be healthy whatever it is.\"\n\nAt this point, a cheery woman old enough to be my mother walked in. She asked us if we were ready to learn the gender. I didn't waste a moment to say \"yes.\"\n\nShe scribbled something on a piece of paper and handed it to me. I looked at my husband before slowly opening it. A joker-sized smile cracked my face as I saw \"boy\" staring back at me.\n\nI left the appointment sullen with contradictory emotions. I was excited to have a son but sad for his future challenges. For weeks, I no longer needed the news to trigger sleepless nights of worry because my imagination took me to dark places I hope never to visit in real life. As much as I got what I wanted, I knew the emotional weight of having a black son in America. Instead of wondering whether my son would inherit my curly hair or my husband's athleticism or both of his parents' stubbornness, I was bogged down with questions. How could I protect him in a society where black males are targeted and victimized more than any other race or gender? How could I teach him to thrive in a country where modern day Jim Crow laws and the school-to-prison pipeline were very serious realities? How would I teach him how to thrive in Trump's America, where \"Make America Great Again\" means he is treated as less than?\n\nPresident Trump's deplorable comments about communities of color and often marginalized groups are a constant fixture on Twitter and in news headlines. A NFL player who won't stand for the flag in protest at police brutality is \" a son of bitch ,\" while those immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and Africa are \" people from shithole countries .\"\n\nThe vitriol behind his words is not empty, but is impacting the decisions made by his administration. Joe Arpaio , the Arizona county sheriff who was found guilty of violating the rights of Latinos, received a pardon from Trump. And then there's the zero tolerance policy that led to the dehumanizing and unnecessary separation of migrant children from their parents.\n\nMore and more Obama era policies are being rolled back, including Betsy Devos's initiative to move away from policies intended to reduce unfair disciplining of minorities in schools or the reversal of affirmative action . Trump may only be president through 2020. But even if he isn't elected for a second term, the policies of his administration help propagate the systematic oppression of minorities, possibly impacting my family.\n\nAfter my son was born, I fell into a delusional denial that anything bad could happen to this sweet, innocent child. I mean look at those dimples. Plus, he had two working parents cognizant of what challenges he might face, ensuring he had every opportunity for a top education, safe neighborhood, and a stable home life. But that nagging voice kept whispering to me that it could be all for naught .\n\nIn a few months, we will be celebrating the second birthday of my son, not long before his younger brother arrives. I wish I could say that watching my son grow into an adored, smart and spirited toddler has alleviated me of recapitulating my anxiety during my second pregnancy, but it hasn't. I hear other parents talk about how much they love their toddler's cuddles, their innocence and unabashed affection for their parents, wishing their kids could remain at this stage longer.\n\nFor all these reasons, I yearn for the same, but it is layered with my recognition that my boys will lose their innocence in the eyes of society sooner than their non-black playmates. I don't know when their cuteness turns to suspicion so even at this young age, I am already contemplating how and when to talk to them about their perceived identity.\n\nWill I tell them that the only way to be on par with their peers is to be extraordinary? Do I let them know that, yes, it's not in your head, people are looking at you differently? Should I encourage them to make themselves small in whatever context as to not appear intimidating? Or do I plant the little white seed that if they work hard and treat others with kindness, that they can do and be whatever they like?\n\nThere is nothing worse for me as a parent than knowing despite my best efforts to protect my boys and prepare them for the harsh reality of this world, I feel helpless. Time and time again, we have seen the deadly repercussions of being black while walking, driving, simply existing. And why must a mother protect her child from living the way any other person in the country does?\n\nWhile I resent that society has robbed me of the excitement over milestone occasions like finding out the gender of my future child, I know the only way to reclaim it is through voting for people who believe in equality and accountability. Those people are the pillars that not only set the foundation for the fate of our country, but for all those who live in it. Perhaps that will allow a future where a mother, upon finding out she is pregnant, doesn't need to fear that her child's gender and race will predetermine his or her path in life, but instead can lose herself in piles of paint swatches for the nursery.\n\nmkmenon@outlook.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Trayvon Was Black. It Matters.\n\nDid the George Zimmerman trial involve racist attitudes? Of course it did. Did the predominantly white jury reach the right verdict? Of course it did. Is the criminal justice system a racist institution? Of course it is. Do young black males disproportionately suffer the brunt of this criminal justice system? Of course they do. Did the media and politicians inflame the situation for their own purposes? Of course they did. Is this a conundrum easily resolved or reconciled? Of course it's not.\n\nLet's start with whether this trial involved racist attitudes. That's easy. There has already been a judicial determination that the prosecution was racist. Judge Nelson made a finding that the prosecution was exercising peremptory challenges in a race-based fashion. The race and cognizable class they were targeting? White women. After finding that the Florida prosecutors were targeting white women, her Honor used her discretion, based on a U.S Supreme Court precedent called Batson , to reseat two of the white women that the prosecutors kicked off the panel. Those two women later became jurors who voted to find George Zimmerman not guilty.\n\nFaced with the prospect of trying this case to the only demographic that mattered-six women, five of whom were white-the prosecutors instead decided to play for the cameras. True homicide prosecutors will admit in private (and some brave souls will admit to the public) that the prosecutors in the Zimmerman case were appalling. Their histrionics were more appropriate for a bad episode of Law & Order .  Even though the Zimmerman prosecutors had the advantage of pretrial depositions of witnesses, something absent in criminal cases in most jurisdictions other than Florida, they acted unaware of what witnesses were going to testify to on the stand. They put on witnesses who destroyed any chance of a conviction and sat idly by without obvious objection as the defense co-opted witness after witness.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe defense flawlessly made the prosecution witnesses their very own character witnesses for Zimmerman. The media, instead of wondering what case the prosecution was trying, fixated on complete nonsense like the defense lawyer's lame knock-knock joke in his opening statement. Most breathlessly speculated that the defense would never recover. Supposed legal pundits, who themselves have never prosecuted or defended a homicide case in their career, daily gave high marks to the prosecution for their made-for-TV theatrics. As long as there is an Esquire after the name, they could opine in front of a camera about how great the prosecution was doing.\n\nIt's like going to a dermatologist for a second opinion when you are told you have a brain tumor. And what does the public know? Then, lo and behold, the jury comes back with a not-guilty verdict, which was the only correct verdict based on the evidence that was presented.\n\nThese prosecutors were scared from the beginning. They were scared to put the case in front of a grand jury. They were scared to turn over evidence to the defense. Zimmerman's lawyer filed not one but six separate motions seeking sanctions against the prosecution for playing hide the ball. The judge even set a hearing post-trial on sanctions against the prosecution, which the media treated as just a normal part of the process. Instead of questioning why the prosecutors were repeatedly hiding evidence, the media just continued their cheerleading for the prosecution. The prosecutors were even afraid to put Trayvon Martin's father on the witness stand. They left that chore for the defense.\n\nThe collective response from the hallelujah chorus of legal dermatologists? The defense had made a huge mistake calling Tracy Martin to the stand, instead of chastising the prosecution for playing hide the ball once again. In their penultimate act of fear, prosecutors sought a lesser charge than murder, basically running away from their case in its entirety and abandoning George Zimmerman as harboring ill will and malice. Instead, they jettisoned their malicious racist theory in favor of one that argued Zimmerman was grossly negligent. And in their final act of cowardice, the state attorney, Angela Corey, waited until the jury was out deliberating to fire her IT employee whistleblower who revealed her office's prosecutorial shenanigans.\n\nSo why this inversion of the normal criminal roles of the prosecution and defense? It lies in one simple word. Race. Prosecutors are not used to calling the Trayvon Martins of the world, or any other black youth, a \"child,\" or characterizing their comings and goings to the store as innocently buying Skittles and watermelon tea. They are used to demonizing young black males as violent predators of the night. Historically, prosecutors in Florida thought nothing of seeking the death penalty for 15- and 16-year-old black \"children\" when they were prosecuting them. It took the U.S. Supreme Court to slow that process down, so that the 17-year-old \"children\" had to become 18 year-old \"adults\" before they could be sent to \"Old Sparky,\" the Florida death chamber.\n\nIs it any surprise that years of this prosecutorial conditioning now leaves the prosecutors sounding almost schizophrenic and plastic when they describe a 17-year-old black male as a \"child\"? Go into any criminal courtroom in America in any metropolitan city and see the customers the prosecution is serving up. They are predominately \"children\" of color. Politicians and prosecutors use race as a strategy as part of their everyday currency. Is it any surprise that the public follows along? Think Willie Horton. Think President Obama talking about Trayvon looking like his son, if he had a son. Think George Zimmerman seeing a young black male with a hoodie who must be a punk who gets away with it. Think five or six white women who must have been wondering to themselves who was the prosecution and who was the defense.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Young black males in London '19 times more likely to be stopped and searched'\n\nStudy finds success rate for stops has fallen from 28% in 2018 to 22% between March and September this year\n\nYoung black males in London were 19 times more likely to be stopped and searched than the general population, a study of official data shows.\n\nThe tactic, dogged by claims of racial profiling , was concentrated in deprived areas, and the success rate for searches turning up something potentially unlawful had fallen from two years ago, the research by University College London's institute for global city policing found.\n\nResearchers examined official stop and search data in the capital from July to September, when 67,997 people and vehicles were stopped by officers.\n\nOf those stops, 97% were carried out by the Metropolitan police , the rest by City of London and British Transport Police officers.\n\nThe Met reacted by saying it was not targeting young black males and only deployed stop and search in high violence and high crime areas, taking thousands of weapons a year off the streets.\n\nVictor Olisa, a former lead for the Met on stop and search, said the study revealed profiling, which was shredding confidence in Britain's biggest force.\n\nTo carry out a stop an officer needs to have reasonable suspicion of an offence, with 95% of reasons given being drugs, weapons or stolen goods.\n\nThe study also found that young black males were 28 times more likely to be stopped on suspicion of carrying weapons than the general population.\n\nIncreases in stops by the Met have been justified as being necessary to tackle knife crime. The study found one in six reasons for a stop was for weapons, while 65% was for drugs.\n\nThe research looked not just at the ethnicity of who was being stopped, but their age and gender, and found huge disparities. More than nine in 10 stops were of males, with the young much more likely to be stopped.\n\nThe study said: \"Being male and being aged under 35 are more powerful predictors of a group having a higher search rate than that group being non-white. The reasons for these differences are likely to be complex: many types of offending are concentrated among some groups (particularly young men) as well as in some neighbourhoods, and there are longstanding issues of bias and stereotyping among police and in society.\"\n\nThe study also found that the success rate for stops had fallen, from 28% in 2018 to 22% between March and September this year.\n\nHalf of the searches occurred in 9% of neighbourhoods and 69% of searches were in neighbourhoods more deprived than average.\n\nCommander Jane Connors, who leads on combating violence for the Met, told the Guardian: \"We don't target young black males with stop and search.\n\n\"We put stop and search into areas with the most violence and the most crime. A lot of those areas have high deprivation.\"\n\nConnors said that 5,000 weapons, including guns and serrated knives designed to kill, were taken off the street every year: \"Stop and search is an investigative tool and it's about being able to look for these items people should not have.\"\n\nShe said the vast majority of around 250,000 stops a year are carried out professionally and the Met was conscious that in black communities, they enjoyed lower trust and confidence.\n\nOlisa, who led on stop and search for the force from 2006 to 2008 and was a lead on diversity in 2016-17, said: \"For me this is clear evidence the Met is targeting young black boys based on stereotypes and not backed by reasonable suspicion.\n\n\"This clearly does not represent evidence-based policing or intelligence-led policing. It indicates it has become more random than it was before.\"\n\nThe former Met chief superintendent said black people in London, including the young and professionals, increasingly did not feel they were being \"policed by consent\" , which is the guiding philosophy of British law enforcement.\n\n\"Given this data I would question whether the black community would feel they are being policed by consent,\" he said.\n\n\"My friends and family living in London who are black, do not feel they are being policed by consent.\"\n\nDr Matt Ashby, who led the UCL study, said: \"There is no question young black males are much more likely to be searched. The only question is are the Met justified in doing so.\n\n\"The proportion of searches that are for the most harmful items such as weapons is going down and the proportion of searches resulting in no further action going up, which suggests searches may have become less effectively targeted as the number of searches increased in the past two years.\""

      "text": "'They think I'm a gangster': the young black men caught in joblessness\n\nA Hackney youth project aims to help overqualified but underemployed young people find their place\n\nIn youth centres in cities across the UK young people are going into studios and remixing music. But at the Moving on Up project at Hackney Council for Voluntary Service ( HCVS ), young men searching for a job are remixing their names.\n\nOluwatosin Adegoke, 23, who graduated this year from Bristol University, was an early adopter of this strategy. He's been called Peter, the last of his four middle names, since he was a child.\n\n\"I think my African parents want it to be easier for me in school,\" he says. \"But in the past two to three years I've had to start thinking about it a bit more. One, it's instinct; and two, whenever I go by Oluwatosin I have to spell it, and sometimes I get referred to as Oliver - even after I spell it out.\"\n\nAdegoke is in precarious work. But many of the other young black men who visit the project are unemployed. They have that in common with more than a quarter of black people aged between 16 and 24 - the highest of any ethnic group, and more than double the 11% rate for white youths. Black males are understood to be the worst affected, but figures - while apparently collected - are not readily available.\n\nAt Moving on Up, which the Guardian visited as part of its Bias in Britain series , they aim to do something about that.\n\n\"The difference is getting a foot in the door,\" says Deji Adeoshun, a youth worker at HCVS, who advises Adegoke and others who take part. \"I've had some guys who have had to change their surname because that was an issue,\" he says, describing one in particular who was applying for an IT job. \"Same job - applied with his actual surname and didn't get a call back, applied with a Christian name and got an interview.\"\n\nThe strategy Adeoshun advocates might seem radical to some, but in the context of a workplace culture that often leaves black men excluded, radical action can be necessary.\n\nBinna Kandola, a business psychologist who specialises in racism and sexism, argues that offices are prone to a deep-seated racist culture. \"There's a racial hierarchy. It was developed during the course of the slave trade and it's a hierarchy of human beings. And wherever I looked, whether it was Brazil or north America or Europe - [or] even South Africa where black people are the majority - the hierarchy is always the same. It's white at the top, black at the bottom, and everybody else in between.\"\n\nSuch prejudices have clear economic consequences. The poverty rate for ethnic minorities is double that of white groups, according to research last year by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which also noted that workers who were not white were concentrated in low-paid sectors. And that was despite generally higher standards of academic attainment than most white groups.\n\nIt is young black men who suffer the brunt of the exclusion, in particular thanks to specific stereotypes around aggression and fecklessness. \"Aggression and violence is the strongest stereotype that research has shown is associated with black men,\" Kandola says.\n\nConnor Robinson, mixed race, from south Croydon, is taller and bigger than your average 18-year-old. Robinson has been working with Talent Match Croydon, a local project set up to help disadvantaged young people into work.\n\n\"Being brown or being black has been a big effect on my life,\" says Robinson. \"I think white people are very stereotyping towards me because I'm brown, because they think I'm a rudeboy or gangster. White people are very quick to judge black and brown people.\"\n\nWhile many black and brown people learn to ignore, or become inured to, such casual racism, for Connor, who is autistic, the experiences continue to trouble him. Racism, he says, means he is socially isolated from a community which he strongly identifies with through his white mother.\n\nMost confrontational racism went out with the Equalities Acts, hate crimes legislation and black and white TV. But as Adeoshun, the youth worker, points out, these days, and particularly in the workplace: \"Racism is not overt, it's subtle.\"\n\nWhile discrimination comes top of a list of barriers that face young black jobseekers, it is commonly expressed through other, related, hurdles. One is a lack of self-confidence in an alien environment entirely the preserve of white people.\n\n\"A lot of young black men, especially in [Hackney], one of the things that puts them off applying for certain jobs is ... this sense that you need to be posh or well spoken,\" Adeoshun says. \"If you have grown up in a household where English is not a first language, then how do you have confidence in your voice?\"\n\nAnother problem is a lack of role models and social networks to help people into industries.\n\nLamide Olusegun, 23, one of the young men visiting Hackney CVS, who this year received a higher education diploma in animation from the University of the Creative Arts, had hoped for work in a production company. It was not that the doors were shut to him, more that he could not find any doors at all.\n\n\"I felt like it's who you know, it's not really what's in your portfolios. Especially in this art field. A lot of jobs are gotten in the bars and it's just connections,\" he says. As a black animator, he feels he has no one to look up to. \"I've not seen personally any other black animators. Even at uni on my course, I don't think there was that many black people, maybe just a handful - or even Asians as well, just ethnic people.\"\n\nSuch barriers mean that by the time young black men find their way into work they have been forced to severely moderate their ambitions. So, they - and particularly the subgroup of black African workers - are more likely to be overqualified for their roles. Adeoshun, a law graduate, is a prime example. He passed his bar exams only to find he was unable to secure a pupillage at a chambers.\n\nAnd for those who appear stuck on the scrapheap, the lure of the shadow economy is strong. One young man in Croydon speaks of how, in an effort to raise a couple of hundred pounds, he pulled a scam and was convicted of fraud. Now he is blocked from any job in a bank, further limiting his prospects.\n\nWhat are the solutions? Many companies, including the Guardian, have begun rolling out \"unconscious bias\" training for senior managers, in an effort to make people aware of any unexamined prejudices that could lead to their not hiring people from ethnic minority groups.\n\nBut in a key report on race in the workplace, commissioned by the government and published in February last year, the Conservative peer Ruby McGregor-Smith said this unconscious bias was often anything but. \"We need to stop hiding behind the mantle of 'unconscious bias',\" she declared.\n\nLady McGregor-Smith said: \"I have to question how much of this bias is truly 'unconscious' and by terming it 'unconscious' how much it allows us to hide behind it. Conscious or unconscious, the end result of bias is racial discrimination, which we cannot and should not accept.\"\n\nKandola, the business psychologist, warns that such a stance risks undermining attempts to eliminate what is a most insidious form of racism. \"Not all biases are conscious,\" he says. \"There are some things that are very blatant that occur in the workplace and they are clearly not unconscious. But there are other things which are far more subtle that happen and people may not be aware they are doing it.\n\nHe recommends seeing racial bias as a performance issue at work, feeding back to managers about their biases and telling them how to change them, and disciplining those who fail to respond.\n\nBut young black men are not sitting back and waiting for procedures to be put in place and for attitudes to change. Olusegun is among those being active. Instead of trying to find work with an established production company he has taken his future into his own hands by starting his own business, merchandising his cartoon characters for sale online and in the market.\n\n\"I've seen the light in self-employment, it's helped me build some resilience as well,\" he says. \"I've learned so much of how to run a business, how to brand yourself, how to market yourself. These are things that I had a little idea about, but I'd never had a chance to practice it. And I'm seeing results as well, so it's not looking bleak for me.\"\n\nThis article was amended on 7 February 2025 to remove some personal information"

      "text": "Why I hate being a black man\n\nE very time I sit on a crowded street car, bus, or subway train in Toronto, I know I will have an empty seat next to me. It's like a broken record. Sometimes I don't mind having the extra space, but other times I feel awkward, uncomfortable, and annoyed.\n\nI know I have good hygiene, I dress appropriately, and I mind my own business. However, recently, I finally became cognizant of why people might fear being around me or in close proximity to me: I am a black male. Although Canadian society presents the façade of multiculturalism the truth is Canada has a serious problem with the issue of race.\n\nI didn't realize it until my sister said to me:\n\nOrville, people are afraid of you. You are a six-foot tall black man with broad shoulders.\n\nMy sister is right, people don't sit next to me on the street car, the subway or on the bus because they are afraid.\n\nThe issue of black self-hatred is something I am supposed to pretend does not exist. However, the great French psychiatrist Frantz Fanon wrote about this issue in his groundbreaking book Black Skin White Masks , in a chapter called \"the Lived Experience of the Black Man\". According to Fanon, the black man is viewed in the third person, and he isn't seen as a three-dimensional human being. The black man internalizes the perspectives of white society and its negative thoughts about blackness affect his psyche. In the chapter, Fanon discusses a white child calling him the \"N word\" and how he becomes cognizant of how he is different and viewed as someone people should fear.\n\nThere is also a fear by some black people that discussing the issue of self-hatred is a sign of weakness. There is a discourse that black people engender: that black is beautiful . But the truth is, the image of blackness is ugly - at least it's perceived that way. There is nothing special or wonderful about being a black male - it is a life of misery and shame.\n\nThe issue of black self-hatred is usually depicted from a female point of view. There are documentaries such as Dark Girls which aired on Oprah's OWN network earlier this year, in which black women discuss their feelings of self hatred for having dark skin. There are numerous books, articles, documentaries, and essays published by black female writers describing black self-hatred. Black women are not afraid to speak out about their self-loathing, yet for some reason, black men are silent about our own contempt for what we are.\n\nA lot of black men don't want to acknowledge the feelings of disgust we have for ourselves. It is considered emasculating to even admit the existence of such thoughts. I think my own self-hatred manifests from the exterior, from the outside world. It is born out of the despair and the unhappiness I see within a lot of young black men.\n\nI can honestly say I hate being a black male. Although black people like to wax poetic about loving their label I hate \"being black\". I just don't fit into a neat category of the stereotypical views people have of black men. In popular culture black men are recognized in three areas: sports, crime, and entertainment. I hate rap music, I hate most sports, and I like listening to rock music such as PJ Harvey, Morrissey, and Tracy Chapman. I have nothing in common with the archetypes about the black male.\n\nThere is so much negativity and criminal suspicion associated with being a black male in Toronto. Yet, I don't have a criminal record, and I certainly don't associate with criminals. In fact, I abhor violence, and I resent being compared to young black males (or young people of any race) who are lazy, not disciplined, or delinquent. Usually, when black male youth are discussed in Toronto, it is about something going wrong.\n\nHonestly, who would want to be black? Who would want people to be terrified of you and not want to sit next to you on public transportation?\n\nWho would want to have this dark skin, broad nose, large thick lips, and wake up in the morning being despised by the rest of the world?\n\nA lot of the time I feel like my skin color is like my personal prison, something that I have no control over, for I am judged just because of the way I look.\n\nNot discussing the issue doesn't mean it is going to go away. In fact, by ignoring the issue, it simply lurks underneath the surface. I believe a dialogue about self-hatred should be brought to the fore in the public sphere, so that some sort of healing and the development of true non-label-based pride can occur.\n\nOf course, I do not want to have these feelings, to have these dark thoughts about being a black man. However, I cannot deny that this is the way I feel. I don't want to be ashamed of being a black man; I just want to be treated as an individual based on the content of my character, and not just based on the colour of my skin."

      "text": "Met carried out 22,000 searches on young black men during lockdown\n\nMore than 80% stop-and-search procedures between March to May led to no further action\n\nYoung black men were stopped and searched by police more than 20,000 times in London during the coronavirus lockdown - the equivalent more than a quarter of all black 15- to 24-year-olds in the capital.\n\nMore than 80% of the 21,950 searches between March and May resulted in no further action, according to analysis by the office of the home affairs select committee chair, Yvette Cooper .\n\nThe figures equate to 30% of all young black males in London, though some individuals may have been searched more than once.\n\nThe Met increased its use of stop and search during the lockdown, compared with a year ago. The force carried out 43,000 stops in May, compared to 21,000 a year earlier, and 30,608 in April, up from 20,981.\n\nKatrina Ffrench, chief executive of Stopwatch, a charity that campaigns against the disproportionate use of stop and search, said: \"The number is shocking and saddening. How do those young people feel when this is their city, they're going about their daily business, could be caring for parents, all sorts of reasons as to why they're out?\"\n\nThe figures emerged after the commissioner for the Metropolitan police , Cressida Dick, apologised for the distress caused to the British athlete Bianca Williams when officers stopped, searched and handcuffed her at the weekend.\n\nBut Dick defended her force's use of stop-and-search powers, saying black people were eight times more likely to be perpetrators of violent crime.\n\nThe committee heard that in May alone, about one in eight young black males in London were stopped and searched. Cooper said data showed 10,000 black males in London aged 15 to 25 were stopped and searched in May. Total population estimates for that demographic in London are between 70,000 and 80,000.\n\nCooper said: \"That suggests in one month alone, more than one in 10 of young black men in London were stopped and searched and found to be carrying nothing and found not to be doing anything that required further action. That's just in one month also at a time when actually most people would have been at home during lockdown.\"\n\nAsked if the figures alarmed her, Dick replied: \"I'm not alarmed, I'm alert.\"\n\nOfficial figures show people who identify as black in England and Wales are nearly 10 times more likely to be stopped than people who identify as white. However, within some force areas, this is even higher: police in Dorset are 25 times more likely to stop black people than white people.\n\nDick told the committee that some of those searched and not found to have any illicit items were \"very violent repeat offenders who happen not to have it there and then\".\n\n\"Some of them have stashed it, given it to the other boy or whatever. That's a proportion of those people. Because what I can tell you is we're focused in the right areas and focusing hugely on people that we know to be involved in violent crime.\"\n\nShe said black people were not just disproportionately affected by stop-and-search powers but were more likely to be victims as well as perpetrators of violent crime in the capital. She said 72% of homicide victims under 25 were black, and that black people were four times more likely to be a victim of homicide and eight times more likely to be a perpetrator.\n\nFfrench added: \"I feel saddened for young black boys that we're in a time, in the 21st century, that your skin colour means you're more prone to police interference.\"\n\nShe said being subject to a stop-and-search was demeaning. \"You feel like you don't have a sense of belonging. If you did, you wouldn't be treated this way. Many of these will be third-, fourth-generation British. Yet the police don't treat you like you belong here.\"\n\nNick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said: \"These figures point to the significant levels of disproportionality we still see in our criminal justice system. That is why it is so important that there are sufficient levels of transparency and accountability with stop and search, including the publication of data, use of body-worn technology, and an effective complaints process for the incident when it is not carried out appropriately.\n\n\"During this crisis it is also vital that the police do not depart from the use of intelligence-led stop and search and continue to work to build trust in communities.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Met police said: \"There is disparity in the use of stop and search in relation to gender, age and race that also increases disproportionally the more the tactic is used.\n\n\"Crime, however, is not proportionate either, and different crimes affect different groups - the root causes of which are complex.\n\n\"Tragically, knife crime and street violence in London disproportionately affects boys and young men, particularly of African-Caribbean heritage, both in terms of victims and perpetrators.\"\n\nThe force said it believed a more accurate measure of disproportionality is the so-called \"positive outcome\" rate - that is the proportion of stop and searches that identify criminality.\n\nOver the rolling 12-month period to 31 May, the four main ethnic groupings all showed similar positive outcome rates - white 24%; black 21%; Asian 22%; other 22%."

      "text": "US justice is built to humiliate and oppress black men. And it starts with the chokehold\n\nThe author of the acclaimed Chokehold: Policing Black Men writes on how the system treats African Americans with contempt: 'If police patrolled white areas as they do poor black neighborhoods, there would be a revolution'\n\nChokehold: a maneuver in which a person's neck is tightly gripped in a way that restrains breathing. A person left in a chokehold for more than a few seconds can die.\n\nThe former police chief of Los Angeles Daryl Gates once suggested that there is something about the anatomy of African Americans that makes them especially susceptible to serious injury from chokeholds, because their arteries do not open as fast as arteries do on \"normal people.\"\n\nThe truth is any human being will suffer distress when pressure on the carotid arteries interrupts the supply of blood from the heart to the brain. Many police departments in the United States have banned chokeholds, but this does not stop some officers from using them when they perceive a threat.\n\nThe United States supreme court decided a case about chokeholds that tells you everything you need to know about how criminal \"justice\" works for African American men.\n\nIn 1976, Adolph Lyons, a 24-year-old black man, was pulled over by four Los Angeles police officers for driving with a broken taillight. The cops exited their squad cars with their guns drawn, ordering Lyons to spread his legs and put his hands on top of his head.\n\nAfter Lyons was frisked, he put his hands down, causing one cop to grab Lyons's hands and slam them against his head. Lyons had been holding his keys and he complained that he was in pain. The police officer tackled Lyons and placed him in a chokehold until he blacked out. When Lyons regained consciousness, he was lying facedown on the ground, had soiled his pants, and was spitting up blood and dirt. The cops gave him a traffic citation and sent him on his way.\n\nLyons sued to make the LAPD stop putting people in chokeholds. He presented evidence that in recent years 16 people - including 12 black men - had died in LAPD custody after being placed in chokeholds. In City of Los Angeles v Lyons , the US supreme court denied his claim, holding that because Lyons could not prove that he would be subject to a chokehold in the future, he had no \"personal stake in the outcome\". Dissenting from the court's opinion, Thurgood Marshall, the first African American on the supreme court, wrote:\n\n\"It is undisputed that chokeholds pose a high and unpredictable risk of serious injury or death. Chokeholds are intended to bring a subject under control by causing pain and rendering him unconscious. Depending on the position of the officer's arm and the force applied, the victim's voluntary or involuntary reaction, and his state of health, an officer may inadvertently crush the victim's larynx, trachea, or hyoid. The result may be death caused by either cardiac arrest or asphyxiation. An LAPD officer described the reaction of a person to being choked as \"do[ing] the chicken\", in reference apparently to the reactions of a chicken when its neck is wrung.\"\n\nThe work of police is to preserve law and order, including the racial order. Hillary Clinton once asked a room full of white people to imagine how they would feel if police and judges treated them the way African Americans are treated. If the police patrolled white communities with the same violence that they patrol poor black neighborhoods, there would be a revolution.\n\nThe purpose of my book, Chokehold , is to inspire the same outrage about what the police do to African Americans, and the same revolution in response.\n\nA chokehold is a process of coercing submission that is self-reinforcing. A chokehold justifies additional pressure on the body because the body does not come into compliance, but the body cannot come into compliance because of the vise grip that is on it.\n\nThis is the black experience in the United States. This is how the process of law and order pushes African American men into the criminal system. This is how the system is broke on purpose.\n\nT here has never, not for one minute in American history, been peace between black people and the police. And nothing since slavery - not Jim Crow segregation, not lynching, not restrictive covenants in housing, not being shut out of New Deal programs like social security and the GI bill, not massive white resistance to school desegregation, not the ceaseless efforts to prevent blacks from voting - nothing has sparked the level of outrage among African Americans as when they have felt under violent attack by the police.\n\nMost of the times that African Americans have set aside traditional civil rights strategies like bringing court cases and marching peacefully and instead have rioted in the streets and attacked symbols of the state have been because of something the police have done. Watts in 1965, Newark in 1967, Miami in 1980, Los Angeles in 1992, Ferguson in 2015, Baltimore in 2016, Charlotte in 2016 - each of these cities went up in flames sparked by the police killing a black man.\n\nThe problem is the criminal process itself.\n\nCops routinely hurt and humiliate black people because that is what they are paid to do. Virtually every objective investigation of a US law enforcement agency finds that the police, as policy , treat African Americans with contempt.\n\nIn New York, Baltimore, Ferguson, Chicago, Los Angeles, Cleveland, San Francisco, and many other cities, the US justice department and federal courts have stated that the official practices of police departments include violating the rights of African Americans. The police kill, wound, pepper spray, beat up, detain, frisk, handcuff, and use dogs against blacks in circumstances in which they do not do the same to white people.\n\nIt is the moral responsibility of every American, when armed agents of the state are harming people in our names, to ask why.\n\nE very black man in America faces a symbolic chokehold every time he leaves his home. The sight of an unknown black man scares people, and the law responds with a set of harsh practices of surveillance, control and punishment designed to put down the threat.\n\nThe people who carry out the chokehold include cops, judges, and politicians. But it's not just about the government. It's also about you. People of all races and ethnicities make the most consequential and the most mundane decisions based on the chokehold. It impacts everything from the neighborhood you choose to live in and who you marry to where you look when you get on an elevator.\n\nI like hoodies, but I won't wear one, and it's not mainly because of the police. It's because when I put on a hoodie everybody turns into a neighborhood watch person. When the sight of a black man makes you walk quicker or check to see if your car door is locked, you are enforcing the chokehold.\n\nYou are not alone. As an African American man, I'm not only the target of the chokehold. I've also been one of its perpetrators. I've done so officially - as a prosecutor who sent a lot of black men to prison. I represented the government in criminal court and defended cops who had racially pro-led or used excessive force. Many of those prosecutions I now regret. I can't turn back time, but I can expose a morally bankrupt system. That's one reason I wrote this book.\n\nBut before I get too high and mighty, you should know that I've also enforced the chokehold outside my work as a prosecutor. I am a black man who at times is afraid of other black men. And then I get mad when people act afraid of me.\n\nOther times I have been more disgusted or angry with some of my brothers than scared. I read the news articles about \"black-on-black\" homicide in places like Chicago and Los Angeles. I listen to some hip-hop music that seems to celebrate thug life. And as a kid I got bullied by other black males. Sometimes I think if brothers would just do right, we would not have to worry about people being afraid of us. I have wondered if we have brought the chokehold on ourselves.\n\nIn my years as a prosecutor, I learned some inside information that I am now willing to share. Some of it will blow your mind, but I don't feel bad for telling tales out of school. I was on the front lines in carrying out the chokehold. Now I want to be on the front lines in helping to crush it.\n\nMy creds to write this book don't come just from my experience as a law enforcement officer, my legal training at Harvard, or the more than 20 years I have spent researching criminal justice. I learned as much as an African American man who got arrested for a crime I did not commit - during the time that I served as a federal prosecutor. I didn't beat my case because I was innocent, even though I was. I beat my case because I knew how to work the system.\n\nThe chokehold does not stem from hate of African Americans. Its anti-blackness is instrumental rather than emotional. As slaves built the White House, the chokehold builds the wealth of white elites. Discriminatory law enforcement practices such as stop and frisk, mass incarceration, and the war on drugs are key components of the political economy of the United States. After the civil rights movement of the 1960s stigmatized overt racism, the national economy, which from the founding has been premised on a racialized form of capitalism, still required black bodies to exploit. The chokehold evolved as a \"color-blind\" method of keeping African Americans down, and then blaming them for their own degradation. The rap group Public Enemy said: \"It takes a nation of millions to hold us back.\"\n\nActually all it takes is the chokehold. It is the invisible fist of the law.\n\nThe chokehold means that what happens in places like Ferguson, Missouri , and Baltimore, Maryland - where the police routinely harass and discriminate against African American - is not a flaw in the criminal justice system. Ferguson and Baltimore are examples of how the system is supposed to work. The problem is not bad-apple cops. The problem is police work itself. American cops are the enforcers of a criminal justice regime that targets black men and sets them up to fail.\n\nThe chokehold is how the police get away with shooting unarmed black people. Cops are rarely prosecuted because they are, literally, doing their jobs. This is why efforts to fix \"problems\" such as excessive force and racial profiling are doomed to fail. If it's not broke, you can't fix it. Police violence and selective enforcement are not so much flaws in American criminal justice as they are integral features of it. The chokehold is why, legally speaking, black lives don't matter as much as white lives.\n\nThe whole world knows that the United States faces a crisis in racial justice, but the focus on police and mass incarceration is too narrow. We might be able to fix those problems the way that we \" fixed\" slavery and segregation, but the chokehold's genius is its mutability. Throughout the existence of America, there have always been legal ways to keep black people down. Slavery bled into the old Jim Crow; the old Jim Crew bled into the new Jim Crow. In order to halt this wretched cycle we must not think of reform - we must think of transformation. The United States of America must be disrupted, and made anew. This book uses the experience of African American men to explain why.\n\nOne of the consequences of the chokehold is mass incarceration, famously described by Michelle Alexander as \"the new Jim Crow\". The chokehold also brings us police tactics such as stop and frisk, which are designed to humiliate African American males - to bring them into submission. The chokehold demands a certain kind of performance from a black man every time he leaves his home. He must affirmatively demonstrate - to the police and the public at large -that he is not a threat. Most African American men follow the script. Black men who are noncompliant suffer the consequences.\n\nThe chokehold is perfectly legal. Like all law, it promotes the interests of the rich and powerful. In any system marked by inequality, there are winners and losers. Because the chokehold imposes racial order, who wins and who loses is based on race.\n\nWhite people are the winners. What they win is not only material, like the cash money that arresting African Americans brings to cities all over the country in fines and court costs. The criminalizing of blackness also brings psychic rewards. American criminal justice enhances the property value of whiteness.\n\nAs the chokehold subordinates black men, it improves the status of white people. It works as an enforcement mechanism for keeping the black man in his place literally as well as figuratively. Oh the places African American men don't go because of the chokehold. It frees up urban space for coffeehouses and beer gardens.\n\nBut it's not just the five-dollar latte crowd that wins. The chokehold is something like an employment stimulus plan for working-class white people, who don't have to compete for jobs with all the black men who are locked up, or who are underground because they have outstanding arrest warrants, or who have criminal records that make obtaining legal employment exceedingly difficult. Poor white people are simply not locked up at rates similar to African Americans. These benefits make crushing the chokehold more difficult because if it ends, white people lose - at least in the short term.\n\nProgressives often lambast poor white people for voting for conservative Republicans like Donald Trump, suggesting that those votes are not in their best interests. But low-income white folks might have better sense than pundits give them credit for. A vote for a conservative is an investment in the property value of one's whiteness. The criminal process makes white privilege more than just a status symbol, and more than just a partial shield from the criminal process (as compared to African Americans). Black men are locked up at five times the rate of white men. There are more African Americans in the US criminal justice system than there were slaves in 1850.\n\nBy reducing competition for jobs, and by generating employment in law enforcement and corrections, especially in the mainly white rural areas where prisons are often located, the chokehold delivers cash money to many working-class white people.\n\nThe chokehold relegates black men to an inferior status of citizenship. We might care about that as a moral issue, or as an issue of racial justice. But honestly, many people will not give a damn for those reasons. African Americans have been second-class citizens since we were allowed - after the bloodiest war in US history and an amendment to the constitution - to become citizens at all.\n\nThe political scientist Lisa Miller has described the United States as a \"failed state\" for African Americans. Indeed some activists involved in the movement for black lives speak of their work as creating a \"Black Spring\", similar to the Arab Spring movements that attempted to bring democracy to some Middle Eastern countries.\n\nWe face a crucial choice. Do we allow the chokehold to continue to strangle our democracy and risk the rebellion that always comes to police states? Or do we transform the United States of America into the true multiracial democracy that, at our best, we aspire to be? My book is about the urgency of transformation. All of the people will be free, or none of them will. \"All the way down, this time.\"\n\nCopyright © 2017 by Paul Butler.

      "text": "Black boys are too feminised\n\nM artin, a mixed-race 15-year-old south Londoner, had just downed half a bottle of vodka. The boy was already known for attention-seeking, bad behaviour and aggressively challenging authority figures. But in his drunken state, with his inhibitions gone, he wasn't more threatening. He was crying - violently sobbing - for his father. \"I want my dad. It's not fair. I've only spoken to him once on the phone. Why does he hate me? I fucking want to see him now.\"\n\nMartin was taking part in a residential summer camp run by my charity, which takes black boys and offers them educational coaching and mentoring. Martin had smuggled in the alcohol without us realising. Raised by a single white mother, he had never known his dad.\n\nHigher education minister David Lammy today appealed for black fathers to become more involved with their children. He is aware, as I am, of the devastating consequences of absent fatherhood within the black community: 59% of black Caribbean children live in lone-parent households, compared with 22% of white children.\n\nAnother boy at camp couldn't get along with the others; he told me that he loved fighting and displayed an excessive amount of attention-seeking. The headteachers of each boy's school - who were also both black - told me that the mothers blamed school for making their sons behave badly. The heads spoke of a personal dislike shown by the students, which they reported as a wider dislike of black male authority. When the boys did open up at camp, it was to our female staff whom they felt they could trust.\n\nPsychologists have known for some time that children's attachment to fathers and mothers derives from different sets of early social experiences. Specifically, mothers provide security when the child is distressed, whereas fathers provide reassuring play partners. As part of our orientation we played a simple game called Trust; I stood behind Martin who had to blindly fall into my arms. He refused to do it.\n\nTypically, this kind of tough play love would never come from his mother. Instead of allowing him to fall, she would probably grab him from behind and whisper in his ear: \"This game, it's too dangerous; I'll buy you a PlayStation instead.\" A typical father would say: \"Come on, son, fall. I'm behind and you'd better not look back.\"\n\nWe have been running summer camps for five years: boys are taken from their familiar environment and work on high-level science projects at universities. All the boys have bucked the trend for inner-city African-Caribbeans, scoring an average of nine high-grade GCSEs.\n\nWhen we set up the programme, we had high aspirations to nurture the next generation of black Britain's intellectual best. However, our academic ideals soon became secondary; many of the boys, once freed from the arms of their single mothers, suddenly had to cope with a world run by adult black males - figures in their lives who were mostly absent, unreliable, despised by their mothers, and usually unsuccessful.\n\nThese boys kicked up against us. It was like we were their dads who had walked out of their lives, and suddenly we demanded their respect.\n\nMore than racism, I now firmly believe that the main problem holding back black boys academically is their over-feminised upbringing. First, because with the onset of adolescence there is no male role model to provide guidance and lock down the destructive instincts that exist within all males. Second, in the absence of such a figure a boy will seek out an alternative. This will usually be among dominant male figures, all too often found in gangs. This is the space where there is a kind of hierarchy, a ritual and, of course, a sense of belonging.\n\nWe have wasted years, and lives, looking in the wrong direction as to the causes of crime and education failure. We've had endless studies attempting to prove institutional racism - while all along our boys' psychological needs weren't met.\n\nThe current government policy of rolling out role models to black youngsters is another attempt to externalise the problem that lies within. It has left us with little research and knowledge about a group that gets kicked out of school the most. Meanwhile, the black family continues to disintegrate and it seems no one dares say a word."

      "text": "My time on The Apprentice taught me a lot about black men in business\n\nH ow many black British businessmen can you name? Take a minute, I'll wait. I'm not dismissing the accomplishments of any black men who have reached the heights in the corporate world. But I guarantee many people will struggle to think of more than 10 names. Of FTSE 100 chief executives, there are currently more white men called Steve than there are ethnic minorities in total (just five). Of those five, only one is a black male.\n\nA lack of recognised black businessmen was one of the reasons I applied to BBC One's The Apprentice in 2016, for which I was selected as a candidate (I was then using an old family surname, Boateng). Since Tim Campbell won the first ever series in 2005, only one other black man apart from me has reached the seventh week. Seeing Lord Sugar's \"you're fired\" finger point at me was surreal, though with the disappointment came a sense of relief that I could finally get a good night's sleep. However, having sold the most in every task up until that point, I didn't feel it was my time to go. This got me thinking: why have black men struggled to succeed on the show - and, more importantly, in business in the UK? This year, for example, by the third week of the show, the only two black male candidates had already been fired .\n\nAfter appearing on The Apprentice , I went in search of investment for my business idea. I put together a team of industry experts and we created a comprehensive pitch and financial plan to show that my business idea was viable. I then met with investors, applied for accelerator programmes, incubator programmes, seed funding - you name it, I applied. I was rejected every time.\n\nHaving learned so much from this journey, I then started a not-for-profit with leading professionals within finance, law and marketing to help entrepreneurs understand how to set up their businesses and the different ways to secure funding. Having run this for more than a year, I found that most white entrepreneurs who attended our courses, workshops and seminars tended to secure funding yet the black entrepreneurs struggled to do so. I questioned why and looked into this deeper.\n\nI found out that UK startups raised more money in equity investment in 2017 than ever before. However with this influx of cash and new ideas being funded, there is a lack of diversity among venture capitalists. Though overwhelmingly based in London, they are not as diverse as the city's population as a whole.\n\nPeople naturally tend to give opportunities to those who look like them and fit into their organisation's culture. For this reason, many black males are not promoted into leadership positions, or given investment for their startups. But without these opportunities, how can black men then gain the required experience to fully succeed?\n\nI was taught by my parents that I needed to work 10 times harder than my white friends in order to be seen as equal. As a child this made no sense. I thought education was very black and white. If my answers were right, they were right; if they were wrong, they were wrong. Why then would I need to work harder just to receive the same grades?\n\nBlack people in the UK are 21 times more likely to have university applications investigated for suspected false or missing information, figures show. The data reveals that 419 black British applicants to undergraduate courses last year were highlighted as a cause for concern, compared to 181 white British applicants, despite there being far fewer black applicants. Further studies show that even when black students come from the same socioeconomic background as their white counterparts, there is still on average a 15% negative disparity in the grades they receive in higher education. Research due to be released this year finds this figure is now significantly worse.\n\nThere is a lack of black men in senior positions in top businesses, educational institutions and politics. Even when black men have their foot in the door within organisations, they are not valued as highly as their white counterparts. For all black and ethnic minority employees this amounts to a total loss of £3.2bn a year in wages compared to white colleagues doing the same work. Only about 3% of large companies have reported their ethnic pay gap results.\n\nThere are black British males doing exceptionally well in business in the UK. However there is a clear need to tackle the institutional discrimination across the country that is holding many others back. For black men to reach the top of more organisations, they must first be seen and treated as equals.\n\nSamuel Brooksworth is an account director at the Guardian and a former candidate on BBC One's The Apprentice"

      "text": "Half of UK's young black males are unemployed\n\nMore than half of young black men available for work in Britain are now unemployed, according to unpublished government statistics obtained by the Guardian which show the recession is hitting young black people disproportionately hard.\n\nThe new figures, which do not include students, also reveal that the youth unemployment rate for black people has increased at almost twice the rate for white 16- to 24-year-olds since the start of the recession in 2008. Young black men are the worst affected of all, according to a gender breakdown contained within the data supplied by the Office for National Statistics .\n\nUnemployment among young black men has doubled in three years, rising from 28.8% in 2008 to 55.9% in the last three months of 2011.\n\nAlthough the ONS said the gender breakdown should be treated with caution due to a relatively small sample size, the figures brought calls for further government action from business and community figures in the UK.\n\nIqbal Wahhab, owner of the Roast restaurant in London and chair of the ethnic minority advisory group at the Department for Work and Pensions, said the figures had exposed an issue that has been \"like the elephant in the room\". Wahhab, who runs his own mentoring scheme for young black youths, urged the government to join businesses in tackling the problem. \"Now that the figures are out in the public domain, what are we going to do about it?\"\n\nHe added: \"I would love to see ministers doing more. If it is businesses doing it, that's great, because we are more in tune with how to make programmes run efficiently, but we need to see how the government is going to reverse that tide.\"\n\nAccording to the ONS, in the last three months of 2008 the unemployment rate for black people aged 16 to 24 was 28.8%. In the most recent quarter in 2011, this had risen to 47.4% - an increase of 70% in three years. This is more than double the unemployment rate for young white people, which increased from 15% in 2008 to 20.8% in 2011. Unemployment among young black women, while still higher than any other ethnic group, is lower than the black male percentage, at 39.1%.\n\nData breaking down unemployment by ethnicity used to be routinely published alongside official unemployment figures, but has not been released since February 2011, apparently due to changes in how different ethnic groups are coded by official statisticians. However, the data is still collected as part of the official labour market survey, which is used to generate official unemployment figures, allowing this breakdown to be obtained.\n\nOn Monday Labour MP Diane Abbott highlighted some of these hidden statistics in a Guardian comment article revealing that the overall unemployment rate for black people had risen to 44%. This was criticised by Channel 4's factcheck blog which questioned the origin of the data and stressed that the rate did not include students. However, the Guardian has persuaded the ONS to release a detailed breakdown of the figures and found the rate for young black men is even higher than the overall figure used by Abbott.\n\nAsked to respond, the Department for Work and Pensions stressed the overall proportion of young black people who are unemployed was only 22%. This differs because it includes students and others not available for work, whereas the ONS calculates the official unemployment rate as a percentage of the economically active population.\n\n\"We have introduced a number of measures designed to give all young people the right skills and experience to match them to vacancies,\" said a DWP spokesperson. \"This includes the Work Programme, which assesses people as individuals to discover what barriers are preventing them from getting a job and will then work with them overcome these problems. We are also spending £1bn over the next three years to help young jobseekers by creating around half a million opportunities through work experience and apprenticeships.\"\n\nYouth unemployment figures are always considerably higher than the general population. This is partly due to the difficulty of tracking students through this data. Most students are excluded from official figures, as they are classed as \"economically inactive\" - people who are not currently in work, or looking for work - though any student actively looking for full-time or part-time work but unable to find it would be classed as unemployed. It should be noted, however, that black people are less likely to enter higher education than most other ethnic groups.\n\nThe reaction among black youths on the streets of Toxteth, the Liverpool district that saw some of the worst inner-city riots of the Thatcher era, was one of frustration. \"I've handed out over 50 CVs since January,\" said Joel O'Loughlan, 18. \"Each day I go to the job centre and look online as well. I've had a two interviews but I didn't get either job. You don't even get a call back most of the time. It makes you feel ... I don't know, like what's the point?\" He added: \"Being black definitely makes it harder. Sometimes if you're going to a job [the employers] look at you like you're not going to work here, they think you're not the right kind of person. That's across the board. I've been handing CVs out to coffee shops, shops, you name it. I need the money and will go to uni to do what I really want next year but right now it feels like more than bad luck.\"\n\nNathan Atiko, 24, said: \"Sometimes I have in the back of my mind that employers see my surname, see it's African and write my CV off straight away. I think about changing it because I wonder if they immediately think I might be trouble or I might be lying.\" He added: \"I can count on one hand the amount of interviews I've had. I've been to university, I know how to write a CV, do application forms, but my [white] friends from university are getting jobs and I'm not. I've looked at their CVs and it's exactly the same as mine yet they're getting the job.\"\n\nGoogle's UK operation is among the companies that have taken a more pragmatic approach to the ethnic employment issue. It makes strong business sense for Google to run a mentoring scheme for black youths, according to the company's head of search advertising in northern and central Europe, Adrian Joseph. \"We believe it makes good business sense. Our ambition is to make information universally accessible to all our users. If we don't reflect all of our users in the composition of our workforce, it will be much harder to achieve that,\" said Joseph. Google's mentoring programme is now in its second year and focuses on undergraduates and postgraduates with an interest in software engineering.\n\nAccording to an organisation that advises the public and private sector on employing ethnic minorities, a mass of factors from inner-city schools to unwitting bias against graduates are behind the discrepancies in employment figures, with the confusion exacerbated by a lack of consensus and research on the underlying causes. Race For Opportunity, the diversity arm of the Business in the Community organisation, says the government and businesses should \"get their heads together\" to tackle the problem, while greater use of mentor figures from families and businesses could make a difference.\n\nSandra Kerr, Race for Opportunity's national director, said: \"Why can't everybody have a mentor? There is a whole social mobility dimension that affects you whatever your ethnicity. There are work places that have skilled people who can help with monitoring, reading, being role models. Employers are looking for people who are ready for work and social mobility determines factors such as what school you go to, whether you will get the educational attainment to go to university.\"\n\nKerr added that some employers, including the Home Office and consultancy group Ernst & Young, are attempting to eliminate racial bias in graduate recruitment. \"If you leave university and you are 'Bame' [black, asian and minority ethnic group], you are still more likely to be unemployed one year on,\" said Kerr, ascribing the problem to \"that subtext of what you don't know\". She added: \"I think it's unconscious bias. Some employers are being really truthful about it already.\""

They were also killed at four times the rate of young white men.\n\nRacial disparities persisted in 2016 even as the total number of deaths caused by police fell slightly. In all, 1,091 deaths were recorded for 2016, compared with 1,146 logged in 2015. Several 2015 deaths only came to light last year, suggesting the 2016 number may yet rise.\n\nThe total is again more than twice the FBI's annual number of \"justifiable homicides\" by police, counted in recent years under a voluntary system allowing police to opt out of submitting details of fatal incidents. Plans to improve the government records have been thrown into doubt by the election of Trump, who campaigned as a \"law and order\" conservative.\n\n\"This data is so important,\" said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. \"We have to capture the whole range of use of force by police, and we have to have a way to identify how we are doing.\"\n\nCiting the Guardian findings, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) expressed renewed concern over Trump's nomination of Jeff Sessions for US attorney general. Sessions, a rightwing Republican senator for Alabama, has been hostile to critics of police, such as the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThe ACLU urged members of the Senate judiciary committee to press Sessions at his confirmation hearings in Washington next week on whether he thinks too many Americans are being killed by police, and whether police departments across the country are prioritizing the use of force over de-escalation.\n\n\"Committee members should also question Sessions on what role, if any, the Justice Department would play in trying to help police departments nationwide reduce the number of people they kill,\" the campaign group said in a report published this week .\n\nThe 2016 data showed a decline in the number of unarmed people killed by police, a central concern of protests across the country after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri , in August 2014. A total of 169 unarmed people were killed in 2016, compared with 234 in 2015.\n\nThere was a marked increase in the number of Native Americans killed by police, although the available sample size was relatively small. A total of 24 Native Americans were killed by police in states across the US, compared with 13 killed in 2015. Eleven of the Native Americans killed in 2016 were young males, meaning that this group was almost six times more likely than Americans at large to be killed by law enforcement.\n\nThere was little movement, however, in other demographic data. In 2016, 53% of people killed by police were white, compared with 51% in 2015. Hispanic or Latino people comprised 17% of the total in both years. There was a small decline in the proportion of African Americans among the total, from 27% to 24%.\n\nGeography also continued to correlate with deaths. Alaska, Washington DC, New Mexico and Oklahoma were all among the five states (plus the District of Columbia) with the highest rates of deaths relative to their populations in both 2015 and 2016.\n\nEight people were killed in Alaska, which had the year's highest rate, compared with just one fatality caused by officers in Delaware, which had the lowest rate. Delaware's population is 28% larger than Alaska's.\n\nLaw enforcement officers in New Mexico have killed a total of 43 people over the past two years. Last month, the state attorney general launched a review of how police shootings and use of force incidents are handled in the state. Police in Oklahoma have killed a total of 69 people in two years, compared with 52 in the state of New York, whose population is five times greater.\n\nFranklin Zimring, a professor of law at University of California, Berkeley, and an author of a book about police killings , said the 2016 data indicated that \"the patterns you found are patterns that repeat\". Zimring said: \"What 2016 tells you is that the three-deaths-per-day finding for 2015 is typical of the period.\"\n\nBarack Obama's administration has taken limited steps to reduce the use of deadly force by law enforcement since Ferguson, including a series of recommendations for police departments made by a policing taskforce. But Democratic efforts to make such reforms more robust via controls on federal funding were repeatedly rejected by the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nPartly in response to the Guardian's investigation, the justice department and FBI have promised to publish more comprehensive data on killings by police. In an essay for the Harvard Law Review on Thursday, Obama said improved data collection \"has the potential to make the use of force even more rare and the devastating consequences of force even less likely\".\n\nOthers remain skeptical that government efforts will be successful. While a separate justice department program to record all \"arrest-related deaths\" will see officials actively seeking news of killings by police, the FBI intends to merely expand its voluntary system.\n\n\"The FBI has been embarrassed by work of investigative journalists that have clearly done a better job gathering this important data,\" said Tim Lynch, the director of the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute's project on criminal justice. \"I expect the bureau to show some improvement, but considering its past work on this subject, that's not saying much.\"\n\nThe justice department's new data collection program involved a threat to reduce federal funding for any local police departments that failed to provide data to Washington on deaths caused by their officers. Trump has, however, stated that the funding should come with \"no strings\" , meaning the program may be rendered toothless.\n\nThe Counted found that a plurality of killings by police in 2016 began with attempted traffic or street stops by officers. Almost 29% of deadly incidents last year developed from police trying to pull over a vehicle or approaching someone in public, including some potential suspects for crimes.\n\nAnother one in five killings by police last year started with calls reporting domestic violence or some other domestic disturbance. Data analyzed by the justice department shows that domestic calls are the deadliest for police officers.\n\nPolice killed 161 people while moving to arrest known suspects or to execute warrants of some kind. They used force fatally in nearly 259 cases shortly after someone had committed a crime - 188 of them violent crimes and 71 nonviolent.\n\nMore than 200 people killed by law enforcement in 2016 had fired a gun at or near officers before they were killed in return fire, according to police and witness reports on the incidents. Another 50 were accused of attacking officers without a gun. And 142 allegedly pointed, raised or levelled a gun or a nonlethal gun at police before being killed.\n\nAuthorities also alleged that 135 people were killed as they appeared to reach for a potential weapon, waistband or pocket suspiciously, although 18 of these people turned out to be unarmed. One hundred and fifty-four people were accused of refusing to drop a weapon of some kind in the moments before they were killed by officers. And 201 others were said to have been killed after they struggled, fought with or advanced on officers.\n\nAt least one in every five people killed by police in 2016 was mentally ill or in the midst of a mental health crisis when they were killed, according to reports following the incident by law enforcement, local media and relatives.\n\nIn October, for instance, Deborah Danner, a 66-year-old woman with schizophrenia, was killed by a New York police officer in a shooting the city's mayor called \"tragic and unacceptable\". Police went to Danner's Bronx apartment after receiving a phone call from a neighbor who said Danner was acting strangely. An officer opened fire when Danner swung a baseball bat near his head.\n\n\"What is clear in this one instance: we failed,\" NYPD chief James O'Neill later said. In more than 80 killings by police in 2016, the initial contact with law enforcement began following a call reporting that the person was suicidal or harming themselves, or attempting to harm themselves.\n\nOf the at least 35 military veterans killed by police last year, at least 20 had been diagnosed with a mental illness or were having a mental health crisis. In August, Ronald Smith, a Gulf war veteran, sought help via an online crisis chat service for veterans. The chat service alerted deputies in Pickaway County, Ohio, who arrived at Smith's home and fatally shot the 45-year-old sometime after arriving and finding him armed with a gun.\n\nPolice officers were charged with crimes in relation to 18 deaths from 2016, along with several others from the previous year . These charges included the arrests of officers involved in the high-profile killings of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Philando Castile near St Paul, Minnesota.\n\nSeveral lesser-known fatal cases have also led to criminal prosecutions, such as that of Deravis \"Caine\" Rogers, an unarmed black man who was killed in June by an officer in Atlanta, Georgia. Local authorities charged officer James Burns with murder and other crimes. Investigators said Rogers was driving away from a parking lot when Burns opened fire without pausing to see whether Rogers was the suspect he was seeking.\n\nSessions' nomination has dismayed activists who only a year ago felt the US was heading toward bipartisan policing reform. Sessions has accused Black Lives Matter of being \"really radical\" and driving up crime by deterring officers from policing effectively. He has also consistently attacked investigations of local forces by the justice department.\n\nA report published on Friday by New York University's Brennan Center for Justice warned that Sessions' aversion to what he has called federal \"interference\" may lead to a resurgence in abuse.\n\nPolice departments \"could be emboldened to escalate their use of force, exacerbating the racial tension plaguing cities across the country,\" said the report, by Ames Grawert, a counsel and former prosecutor in New York."

      "text": "Black men in England three times more likely to die of Covid-19 than white men\n\nONS figures, which also cover Wales, show black males have highest Covid-19 mortality rate\n\nBlack men in England and Wales are three times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white men, the Office for National Statistics has found.\n\nThe study, which covered deaths in hospitals and in the community between 2 March and 15 May, found black men had the highest mortality rate from the disease. Among black men of all ages the death rate was 256 per 100,000 people, compared with 87 deaths per 100,000 for white men.\n\nWhen comparing death rates for younger males between nine and 64 years of age, the discrepancy was even starker, with black males more than four times more likely to die than their white counterparts.\n\nWhen researchers adjusted for population density, socio-demographic factors and region, they found black men were still twice as likely to die as white men, while for black women the risk was 1.4 times higher.\n\nA delayed report into increased Covid-19 mortality among BAME people was published by Public Health England this week. The report found racism could have been a factor in high death rates among BAME people, who may be less likely to seek out hospital care or speak up when they have concerns about personal protective equipment (PPE) or increased risk.\n\nThe ONS analysis also found that Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men had a higher chance of dying than white males.\n\nSimilar trends were seen among black and Asian women, although the difference in mortality rates between women of different ethnic groups was not as pronounced as among men. Black women were twice as likely to die from Covid-19 as white women, who had the lowest risk of dying.\n\nThe ONS also published research looking at death rates for religious groups. Combining data on Covid-19 death rates with demographic information from the census, it found that Muslims had the highest death rate of any religious group, with 199 deaths per 100,000 for men of all ages and 98 deaths per 100,000 for women.\n\nJewish men had the next highest death rate, with 188 deaths per 100,000 people. The lowest-risk group were those who reported \"no religion\" at the last census, with 81 deaths per 100,000 men and 48 deaths per 100,000 women.\n\nNick Stripe, the head of life events at the ONS, said: \"For the most part the elevated risk of certain religious groups is explained by geographical, socioeconomic and demographic factors and increased risks associated with ethnicity.\n\n\"However, after adjusting for the above, Jewish males are at twice the risk of Christian males, and Jewish women are also at higher risk. Additional data and analyses are required to understand this excess risk.\"\n\nCensus data was also used to explore mortality rates among disabled people. The ONS found those who reported their daily activities were \"limited a lot\" by a disability at the 2011 census were about twice as likely to die as those who reported no disability, after adjusting for region and socio-demographic factors."

      "text": "Before He Was UVA Police Chief, Timothy Longo Helmed DNA Dragnet That Targeted Black Men\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA closer examination of a two-decade-old operation in Charlottesville, Virginia, shows that it was larger in scope than previously reported.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2004, long before Charlottesville made national news for a far-right rally in 2017, and years before the peak of stop-and-frisk in New York and other cities, the Virginia city implemented a \"DNA dragnet\" that swept up nearly 200 Black men.\n\nAfter a serial rapist, who first struck in 1997, brutally assaulted a victim in November 2002, Charlottesville police became increasingly desperate to catch the suspect. They had his DNA but were short on leads, and physical descriptions given by victims varied; they knew only that he was a Black man. So, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo authorized a policy whereby officers could approach Black men that they felt matched the extremely broad description and request DNA samples. Over the next two years, the names of targets were kept in a running master suspect list maintained by the department.\n\nIn April 2004, the dragnet was halted after press coverage joined with community outcry over allegations of racial profiling and police harassment. The dragnet never identified the serial rapist - who was instead apprehended after being recognized in public by a victim in 2007 - and the city pledged to narrow its focus. Longo remained as Charlottesville police chief and served until 2016.\n\nAn independent review of the dragnet by The Intercept reveals that it was larger in scope than previously reported. According to interviews of current and former local officials and internal records previously filed in court by the Charlottesville Police Department and obtained by The Intercept, the Albemarle County Police Department and the University Police Department at the University of Virginia collected buccal, or cheek, swabs alongside CPD, with UPD even sharing students' personal information in the process.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn an email to The Intercept, ACPD spokesperson Abbey Stumpf denied that the department was involved in the dragnet, though she acknowledged that buccal swabs \"could have been consensually obtained\" by ACPD and that \"ACPD collected DNA samples during the course of investigations and compared them to the database if there was a similar MO to other cases.\" UVA did not respond to questions about UPD's role in the dragnet.\n\nNotably, CPD records contradict Longo's previous suggestions that the swabbing of Black men was tightly controlled. As Longo told the Washington Post, \"There's this picture out there that hundreds of people have had a Q-tip stuck in their mouths, and that ain't it.\" In one case, CPD records show that a man had been approached on two separate occasions for a swab, only for police to later note that he \"does not fit the general description of the suspect. He appears to weigh at least 250 pounds with [sic] very round face and abdomen.\" The Intercept's reporting also sheds light on the limited recourse the legal system can offer for victims of alleged racial discrimination, as local resident Larry Monroe discovered after suing the city for being targeted in the dragnet. (Documents from his lawsuit provided the foundation for The Intercept's reporting.)\n\nThe dragnet remains infamous among longtime residents of Charlottesville, a city with a history of racially biased policing as well as current issues of segregation and racially disproportionate stop-and-frisks . In 2018, Charlottesville Mayor Nikuyah Walker sharply criticized Longo when asked for her reaction to Virginia adding new categories of mandatory DNA registration for criminal convictions. Walker replied that the basis of the law is racist, pointing to Charlottesville's dark history of DNA collection. \"Charlottesville is the locality that helped fuel that,\" she said. \"The chief of police at the time, Chief Longo, thought that it was OK to round Black men up and take their DNA samples to see if they had been the individuals who had committed a crime.\"\n\nMany community members were concerned when the University of Virginia announced on February 13, 2020 that Longo had been formally appointed to lead its public safety services. \"I was very surprised that Longo surfaced as the chief of the University Police Department,\" M. Rick Turner, UVA's former dean of African-American affairs, told The Intercept.\n\nIn response to a detailed list of questions about Longo's hiring process and whether the university evaluated concerns related to these events and others, UVA spokesperson Brian Coy confirmed that the university examined Longo's record, writing, \"[Longo's] service in the Charlottesville/Albemarle area and his commitment to building positive relationships with the community made him the right candidate for the post.\"\n\nCoy also referenced the recent upheaval over policing in America, stating that Longo was the right person to guide the university through it. \"There are many valid viewpoints and concerns about the proper role of policing [in] our society and we have a responsibility to ensure that our approach is responsive to the needs of our community,\" Coy wrote. \"That is a key part of the reason the University hired Tim Longo as the Associate Vice President of Safety and Security and Chief of Police. Throughout his career, Chief Longo has demonstrated the leadership and personal character necessary to keep our community safe in a way that reflects the University's core values of justice and equality.\"\n\nIn a statement to The Intercept, Longo wrote, \"As our efforts to collect DNA samples were underway, I heard from many members of the Black community in this area that the policy was overinclusive and ineffective. Through these conversations, I recognized that the policy impacted our relationship with that community in a negative way and took steps to correct our initial mistake.\" Longo added, \"I regret allowing it to take place as it did - it was wrong, and I am sorry. Since then, I have tried my best to listen and I have tried hard to rebuild relationships and to restore trust where it may have been lost.\"\n\nThe old guard of law enforcement still has sway in Charlottesville and particularly at UVA, a behemoth institution that looms large over local issues. \"Longo is popular with white people in the community as a police officer,\" Turner told The Intercept, adding that \"Black students and Black alumni should be alarmed that a police chief from the ranks of Charlottesville is now elevated\" at UVA.\n\nA man walks the campus of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Va. on March 20, 2015.\n\nWhen news broke of the DNA dragnet, which was first reported by the local outlet The Hook in July 2003 and nearly a year later by national outlets like the Washington Post, the program was swiftly condemned by the community. Over the course of the dragnet, according to internal records later filed in court by CPD that have not previously been reported, police swabbed 197 men. CPD meticulously tracked every swab collected, with each assigned an individual custody record, and kept note of those who refused to be swabbed. At the time, Longo rebuked allegations of racial profiling, stressing that \"We weren't approaching and accosting Black men on the street.\"\n\nThe Intercept reviewed 30 cases in which individuals refused a swab, and CPD internal records from these stops tell a different story. The documents demonstrate that police often exerted minimal effort to narrowly target suspects and frequently accosted Black men on the street, contrary to Longo's claims. In some cases, police attempted to swab men who they later found out were already in the state's DNA database or would soon be added for separate criminal offenses; in others, men who were approached for a swab were later ruled out for not fitting the description. Some attempted swabs even came from traffic stops. Others were approached for a swab only for Charlottesville police to subsequently discover that they were in jail the day of an assault by the serial rapist.\n\nPolice stressed that all swabs were obtained on a voluntary basis. But many residents expressed that they did not feel they had much of a choice, considering several were approached at home or their places of work. CPD records also reveal several instances in which officers would repeatedly press those who refused requests for swabs on separate occasions. \"Approached again,\" one form notes, subsequently reading, \"again declined.\" According to CPD court filings, of the 30 men who initially refused to be swabbed, nine would later relent.\n\nThese internal records also raise questions about the nature of the stops CPD conducted to obtain swabs. After one resident refused a swab, a form reads that he was stopped by police once again and \"arrested for [Drunk in Public],\" noting, \"DNA sample obtained.\"\n\nOne resident arrived at the police department furious after having been asked for a swab, asserting, \"I'm not the fucking rapist.\" But Charlottesville police did not seem too concerned, since \"He really looked like too much of a 'crackhead' to be the rapist.\" After another man refused a request for a swab, an officer noted that \"He is well spoken.\" A composite sketch released by Charlottesville police claimed that the serial rapist had \"unnaturally white\" or \"slightly bulging eyes.\" This description was apparently enough to motivate one officer out on patrol to stop a man on the street and later write in a field contact card, \"Suspect kept looking back as I went by,\" adding, \"Person [sic] eyes look big!\" The man refused a swab, though he relented after being approached again.\n\nOne former Charlottesville police officer, Curtis Brandon, told The Intercept that the dragnet became a source of anxiety for many Black men in Charlottesville. \"I feel like if I wasn't an officer and I was outside jogging,\" Brandon said, \"they probably would have stopped me.\"\n\nCharlottesville police were also given greater leeway to swab suspects than previously known. Though previous press reports discuss that a multi-jurisdictional team was established to identify the serial rapist, the widespread involvement of CPD officers outside this task force, as well as those of other departments, in swabbing residents has not been reported. Over 40 CPD officers, including patrol officers, collected swabs at different points during the dragnet, an analysis of buccal swab custody records shows.\n\nDave Chapman, the commonwealth's attorney for Charlottesville at the time of the dragnet, told The Intercept, \"When you see the apparent involvement of patrol-level officers in actually making contacts and collecting samples, that's a danger signal,\" reasoning that \"the methodology, the strategy that's being followed isn't adequately well-supervised.\" Concerning the nature of the stops, he said, \"It is well-known and it's true to this very day that when an officer is approaching a citizen, there is a different power dynamic. It's not equal. That's a reality.\"\n\nWhereas previous reporting of the dragnet centered on Charlottesville police, records reveal that University and Albemarle County police officers swabbed residents as well. According to a list of all swabs compiled by CPD and reviewed by The Intercept, CPD swabbed 167 men, UPD swabbed 21, and ACPD swabbed nine, bringing the total number of men stopped in the dragnet to at least 218, since 21 of the 30 men who initially refused never ended up providing a swab. (Longo previously told the Washington Post in April 2004 that 197 men had been stopped in the dragnet and 10 refused a swab.)\n\nSteven Turner, a student at University of Virginia, talks to a group on April 12, 2004 at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Va. Turner was stopped twice by the Charlottesville Police Department and asked to submit a DNA sample.\n\nUniversity and Charlottesville police closely coordinated to surveil and swab Black men, particularly after attacks near UVA's campus prompted officers to patrol the area. \"Uva obtained Gatorade bottle and submitted to lab,\" a CPD officer noted. \"We will continue to attempt swabs.\" Sometimes CPD referred an individual to UPD after trying and failing to obtain a swab. Other times CPD notified UPD to swab residents who would travel through UPD's jurisdiction. In many cases, UPD would share information with CPD to target men for swabs.\n\nUPD also divulged UVA students' personal information to other departments in the process. After one man refused a swab, CPD noted that UPD \"advised subject is a student and should be returning in AUG [sic] to begin his 4th year.\" UPD also \"reported that he did not live at [address redacted], according to their records.\" The student, who had previously refused, evidently later complied with another request for a swab, since CPD remarked \"DNA sample obtained.\" (If this student was a fourth-year undergraduate as the document suggests, this particular stop also speaks to a lack of narrow criteria, since the serial rapist had first struck in 1997, likely before the student would have arrived in Charlottesville.)\n\nTurner, the former UVA dean, told The Intercept that close to a dozen students approached him about being targeted by the police for a swab. Turner and other community leaders spoke out, eventually prompting a meeting in April 2004 on UVA's campus where the tactics of the dragnet were denounced. Within days, Longo agreed to scale the dragnet back, bringing it to a halt.\n\nDuring the dragnet's operation, a university commission formed by former university President John T. Casteen was studying how to improve diversity and equity, but a UVA official with direct knowledge of the commission's deliberations told The Intercept that its members had no formal discussion regarding the dragnet at all. Although Turner told The Intercept that he was aware UPD participated in the dragnet, other senior university officials offered little insight into their knowledge of the dragnet or UPD's role. Casteen wrote to The Intercept, \"Sad to tell, I do not remember the dragnet in which you are interested.\"\n\nIt is unclear how widely known UPD's involvement was with the department's own officers. Michael Coleman, who served as a captain with UPD during the time of the dragnet, told The Intercept, \"The University Police Department, to the best of my knowledge, did not participate in that\" since \"it alienated or aggravated a fair amount of the Charlottesville population.\"\n\nBlake Caravati, who served on the Charlottesville City Council between 1998 to 2006, acknowledged in an interview with The Intercept that the dragnet \"was certainly racial profiling\" and \"not a good decision at the time,\" though he offered high praise for Longo. \"You can't cancel the guy because he's one of the best police chiefs in the country at the time,\" he said, echoing many of Longo's peers who lauded his leadership. \"We're all fallible, right?\"\n\nDetective Sgt. James Mooney, left, stands next to Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo, right, during a news conference on Sept. 19, 2014, in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nA single lawsuit was filed in response to the dragnet. After Charlottesville resident Larry Monroe was swabbed in March 2004, he sued CPD, Longo, and CPD detective James Mooney the following July.\n\nMonroe's litigation spanned several years as it made its way through state and federal courts, eventually culminating in an attempted federal class-action lawsuit that fell apart following unfavorable court rulings. Despite Monroe's apparent lack of any shared physical characteristics with the serial rapist besides being Black, and CPD's aggressive tactics of stopping a wide range of Black men under circumstances criticized by residents, state and federal courts dismissed Monroe's claims.\n\nMonroe died in 2018. Mooney, now assistant chief of CPD, told The Intercept that he knew Monroe personally before swabbing him. He said, \"I never would have thought in my wildest dreams\" that Monroe could be the serial rapist. Concerning the lawsuit, he added, \"I think Monroe was a decent guy, I think he was a decent father, and I don't think he deserved to go through that.\"\n\nLike many men approached for DNA samples, Monroe was asked for a swab at his home, though mere days before, he had been in police custody following an arrest for misdemeanor disorderly conduct. (Monroe's attorney later told a court that he was exonerated of the charge.) According to Monroe's March 2004 misdemeanor arrest record, Charlottesville police recorded his height as 5-foot-8 and weight as 290 pounds, well outside the range of descriptions of the serial rapist.\n\nMonroe later testified that he was nervous and scared and did not want to provide a swab, but complied because \"[Mooney]'s the police,\" adding that he did not feel he had a choice. \"I just feel it's messed up,\" Monroe said. \"I don't fit the description, but just because I'm a Black man, I feel like I'm being pinpointed.\"\n\nMonroe's trial commenced on January 31, 2005 in Virginia state court, where proceedings revealed that Monroe was targeted for a swab because CPD Officer William Sclafani had stopped him on the night of May 31, 2003. According to a field contact card Sclafani wrote after the encounter, Monroe \"was out at Chancellor St with four black males\" and told Sclafani that he was \"looking for a party.\" Since the area was dominated by student housing left mostly vacant for the summer, Sclafani reasoned that Monroe \"may have been scoping out houses.\" This fact, combined with the apparent note that Monroe was on ACPD's \"list\" as well, was sufficient to designate Monroe for a swab nearly a year after Sclafani's stop occurred.\n\n\"He came to their attention because he was Black in public,\" Monroe's attorney, Deborah Wyatt, told The Intercept. \"The college kids had left, said Sclafani, so he might have been casing the place. It was racist from the inception.\"\n\nMooney told the court that Monroe had signed a consent form, which the department claimed was standard for all swabs, but Monroe testified that he did not recall signing one. In any event, the swabs and consent forms had been destroyed after the department pledged in April 2004 to eliminate all samples that were ruled out.\n\nMonroe lost the case and filed an appeal in state court. He then decided to nonsuit the lawsuit - drop with a chance to refile - and filed a new case in federal court in the Western District of Virginia, claiming he was racially profiled.\n\nMonroe was also seeking class-action certification, meaning that more Black men who felt wrongly targeted by the dragnet could potentially join the lawsuit if the certification was approved. Wyatt told The Intercept that probably close to a dozen dragnet victims had expressed interest in suing, and one, Granville Boggs, told The Hook that he had separately contacted Wyatt about suing in the fall of 2003 and explicitly indicated that he was interested in joining a class-action suit. (Boggs could not be reached for comment. The Intercept unsuccessfully attempted to contact other victims of the dragnet, but many could not be reached because they had died, their identities were never publicly disclosed besides those who spoke with reporters, they have moved away from Charlottesville, or they were still wary of speaking to the press.)\n\nIn 2007, attorneys for the city moved to dismiss Monroe's claims as well as his class-action certification. At a subsequent hearing on the certification issue, Monroe's attorneys told The Intercept that they were troubled by an affidavit submitted by Sclafani, whose 2003 field contact card led to Monroe being swabbed.\n\nSclafani alleged that while on patrol, he encountered Monroe on the Charlottesville Downtown Mall. According to Sclafani, Monroe told him that the federal lawsuit had been filed in his name without his knowledge, that he was not interested in pursuing claims against Mooney, and that the lawsuit was making him \"look bad\" and he \"does not know what is going on.\"\n\n\"My recollection is we were surprised\" by the affidavit, remarked Neal Walters, who represented Monroe with Wyatt for the federal lawsuit, in an interview with The Intercept. \"I remember being in that courtroom and having the feeling afterwards of 'holy four-letter word, how do we deal with that?'\" Wyatt did not hesitate to characterize the affidavit, which contradicts Monroe's deposition, as false. \"It's not true,\" she told The Intercept. Both lawyers acknowledged that since the affidavit was filed with the court system, it could have escaped their notice before the hearing, catching them off guard. \"Sometimes we can both drop the ball,\" Wyatt said.\n\nReached for comment by phone, Sclafani confirmed submitting the affidavit but did not answer any other questions.\n\nJohn Raphling, a senior researcher on criminal justice at Human Rights Watch, told The Intercept that, generally speaking, the testimony of police officers is infrequently challenged by courts. \"Police officers are given an incredible amount of deference, to the point where judges often accept their word at face value and don't interrogate whether what they are saying is truthful,\" Raphling said. \"Police are not judged by the same standard as everybody else is.\"\n\nJudge Norman K. Moon dismissed most of Monroe's lawsuit and denied his class-action certification, relying heavily on Sclafani's affidavit in the process. \"I am convinced that ... a reasonable person would have felt free to decline Mooney's requests or to otherwise terminate the encounter,\" Moon wrote, acknowledging Monroe's claims of fraught relations between police officers and the Black community but ultimately disregarding them. An attempt to appeal also failed, citing precedents that grant wide latitude to law enforcement activities influenced by racial criteria.\n\nThe appeal decision in Monroe v. City of Charlottesville has since served as legal precedent in other cases involving allegations of racially discriminatory policing. In 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson in North Carolina for conducting what federal attorneys alleged was an \"egregious pattern of racial profiling.\" In 2015, a federal judge cited precedents like the Monroe decision and ruled in favor of Johnson.\n\nIn his remaining years as chief, Longo worked to repair the damage the dragnet created and helped implement new initiatives such as crisis intervention training for officers, which he also participated in. Longo also cooperated with efforts to improve local criminal justice outcomes. \"As a participant in community collaborations that have been undertaken to make our criminal justice system and our community better, I think he's been a very important player,\" James Hingeley, Albemarle's progressive commonwealth's attorney, told The Intercept.\n\nA leading example began in 2010, when law enforcement and other community representatives in the Charlottesville area embarked on a pilot program of the National Institute of Corrections called Evidence-Based Decision Making, in which officials like Longo played an important role. Throughout his career as chief, Longo's hands-on approach and close relations with community members were praised by many local leaders, who pointed to efforts like greater collaboration with churches, schools, youth programs, and human services.\n\nHowever, other events during Longo's tenure strained CPD's relationship with the community. After Sage Smith, a Black transgender woman, vanished in 2012, Charlottesville police mounted a lackluster response . Smith has never been found, though CPD is still investigating . Don Gathers, a community leader who was forced to suspend his run for City Council in large part due to white supremacist threats against his life, told The Intercept, \"When young Black children would come up missing, the same efforts didn't seem to be put forth, and that's still very much a point of contention in the Black community,\" emphasizing that \"Sage Smith is still missing.\"\n\nLongo had risen through the ranks of the Baltimore Police Department before becoming chief in Charlottesville, and after the death of Freddie Gray fueled intensifying Black Lives Matter protests, he sat down with the local news outlet C-VILLE Weekly in May 2015 to discuss a range of recent controversies. He said that events like those in Ferguson and Baltimore underscore \"that race relations are a significant part of our history and they continue to influence relationships we have today\" and noted specifically concerning the Gray case, \"I don't know about the investigation except for what I've read in the newspaper. I haven't talked to anyone from Baltimore about it.\"\n\nBaltimore police Officer William G. Porter arrives for trial at the Baltimore City Circuit Courthouse East, on Dec. 16, 2015 in Baltimore, Md.\n\nSeven months later, in December 2015, Longo gave expert testimony on behalf of Officer William Porter, who was indicted for his role in Gray's death in police custody. Longo reportedly told the jury that \"I believe [Porter's] actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances he was confronted with.\" The jury deadlocked and prosecutors later dropped all charges in the Gray case.\n\nLongo announced his retirement as CPD chief in November 2015 and was then recruited by UVA to lead a master's program in public safety that was slated to launch in 2019. In 2017, he started teaching a short course at UVA's law school called \"Understanding Police Use of Force: Investigation & Litigation Concepts,\" which he has taught for several semesters since.\n\nLongo's February 2020 appointment as UVA's security chief effectively consolidated all public safety administration at the university under his purview - reversing the creation of separate positions for chief of police and associate vice president for safety and security that stemmed from new security recommendations that followed the 2017 white supremacist \"Unite the Right\" rally - and occurred shortly before a national reckoning over police violence and racial discrimination.\n\nIn July 2020, UVA's Student Council passed a resolution demanding that the University Police Department's budget be decreased and its funds reallocated to the university's Counseling and Psychological Services. In an interview discussing the Student Council's vote, Longo pointed to a pin he wore signaling UPD's commitment to \"peace and justice,\" emphasizing that \"our job is to prove that they're more than just symbols, through our actions.\"\n\nMany students have since spoken out against the university, with some claiming that they have felt targeted by UVA for their protests. When fourth-year student Hira Azher, a resident of UVA's historic Lawn, posted a sign on the door of her residence denouncing UVA in September 2020, a UPD officer visited her room hours later in response to someone being \"offended.\"\n\nOther Lawn room residents posted similar signs in solidarity and were then subjected to constant threats and harassment by community members. Azher and another Lawn resident, Hannah Hiscott, told The Intercept that their property and that of other students was repeatedly vandalized, people would bang on and throw things at their doors throughout the night, strangers spied on them, and nothing was done to stop it. \"I don't feel safe at all here,\" Hiscott said.\n\nAfter being inundated with alumni complaints about Azher's sign, UVA President James Ryan responded with a post deriding it as \"offensive\" and \"deeply disappointing,\" which was followed by the university unveiling new regulations limiting Lawn residents' ability to post signs on their doors.\n\nThis past February, UPD announced the appointment of its first manager of diversity, equity, and inclusion, but some student activists say recent changes do not go far enough. Longo's appointment as chief was a \"slap in the face\" to the community, said Sarandon Elliott, a member of the student activist organization UVA Beyond Policing, in an interview with The Intercept.  Hiring a diversity, equity, and inclusion officer \"doesn't improve policing,\" Elliott added, remarking that it instead funnels \"more money into this violent institution.\" Citing Longo's record, including the DNA dragnet, UVA Beyond Policing is calling for his removal.\n\nAs UVA's police chief, Longo will have to continue to confront the lasting impact of the dragnet. Charlottesville Police Chief RaShall Brackney wrote to The Intercept that she would \"absolutely not\" consider a similar policy of DNA collection and that \"the legacy of the program continues to impact CPD's relationship with the Black community, particularly Black men.\" She noted that repercussions of programs like the dragnet are \"not confined to Charlottesville,\" since \"the cumulative effects associated with these types of practice[s] undermine the legitimacy of policing agencies across the nation.\"\n\nAnd though considerable time has passed, the dragnet remains a painful memory for longtime local residents like Raymond Mason, who described it as an \"all-time low\" for Charlottesville. \"Those were trying times because everybody was afraid, Black men were afraid that they were gonna get pulled over, roughed up, or whatever,\" Mason told The Intercept. \"Anybody was subject to be stopped and harassed. Anyone.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Little Rock's Black Police Chief and the Campaign Against Reform\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nKeith Humphrey was appointed to reform the Little Rock Police Department. Then the old guard went to war with him.\n\nJust how strong are the forces arrayed against police reform - and how far are they willing to go? In April 2019, Keith Humphrey was appointed police chief in Little Rock, Arkansas, a Southern city with a fraught history of racial division. Among the growing number of Black police chiefs, Humphrey came in with a mandate from the new mayor to implement reforms and curtail abuses. Almost as quickly as he set about to do that work, the city's \"old guard,\" the police union, and even cops under Humphrey's own command struck back. The aim, to many observers, was simple: to oust Humphrey.\n\nThis week on Intercepted: Radley Balko joins The Intercept's Ali Gharib to talk about Humphrey's ordeal. Then Balko speaks to Little Rock civil rights attorney Mike Laux and former LRPD Lieut. Johnny Gilbert Jr. Balko, an award-winning journalist and columnist at the Washington Post, is the author of \"Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America's Police Forces\" and co-author, with Tucker Carrington, of \"The Cadaver King and the Country Dentist: A True Story of Injustice in the American South.\"\n\n[Introductory theme music.]\n\nJeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted.\n\nAli Gharib: I'm Ali Gharib, a senior editor with The Intercept.\n\nThe Little Rock Police Department has been riven by internal strife. Things have long since been tense. Like many Southern cities, race plays a salient role in historical and present-day Little Rock. So when a new Black police chief arrived in town and began implementing reforms, things boiled over.\n\nToday on Intercepted we're going to tell you a story from Arkansas, about Little Rock Police Chief Keith Humphrey, and about the tremendous pressure and backlash he's getting from the city's old guard, including inside his own department.\n\nA dozen of own officers have sued him. Internal complaints are too numerous to count. And then there are the media leaks and whisper campaigns. The allegations ranged from a supposed affair, to harassment, to retaliation.\n\nLate last year, The Intercept did a deep dive into this: the story of Humphrey, the campaign against him, the city's police union, and the decades of fraught history that informs all of it. Our investigation found that most of the allegations against the chief collapsed under scrutiny. So far, Humphrey is hanging on to his job, but his antagonists aren't giving up.\n\nThe story was the culmination of a year and a half of reporting by Radley Balko, an ace journalist and author who has been on the police beat for a long time.\n\nRadley Balko: Another anecdote from the Intercept story that I think that really hammers this home is that a lot of Black officers told me that when white officers are forced to patrol in Black parts of the city, they refer to it as \"the hunt.\" It's such a dehumanizing term. For Black officers, it was like: These are people. Right? These are Black people, and you're basically referring to them as prey and you as their hunter.\n\nAG: We're going to tell this story in two parts. First, Radley and I spoke about his investigation as well as some stunning recent news: Less than two weeks after his story came out, Radley learned that Chief Humphrey, during patrol on New Year's Eve, was involved in an incident where he fired his service weapon at a civilian. He's now under investigation, which is why you won't be hearing from him today.\n\nThen you'll hear a conversation between Radley and two Little Rock sources that contributed significant information to his investigation. One is a civil rights attorney and the other is a recently retired Black police officer. They talk about what happened to Humphrey and what's happening to him now.\n\nRadley and I begin with the New Year's eve incident:\n\nRB: Humphrey was out on patrol on New Year's Eve, and he had called a, I guess what he calls an \"all hands on deck\" for New Year's Eve. So basically, every officer had to be out on patrol. And one of his guiding philosophies in policing is that even, high-ranking, top-brass police officers need to spend time in patrol because patrol is kind of where you get to know a city, you get to know the people, you become part of the neighborhoods that you're policing. And he doesn't exempt himself from that.\n\nBut while he was out on patrol, apparently there was a fight between two women in a parking lot. There's actually a video of it:\n\nTHV11 (Jade Jackson): A bottle used to break the window of a car [sound of the bottle breaking the window], leading to a fight outside a gas station - that's when police say the suspect Taz Hayes pulled out a gun and fired multiple rounds.\n\nRB: It escalates to the point where one woman then pulls out a gun and starts shooting at the other from just a few feet away. And Humphrey apparently pulls up, gets out his gun and fires one shot at the woman who was wielding the gun. And then she, I believe, was later arrested.\n\nBut it's really incredible to have a police chief shoot at someone - an actual chief while on patrol - and he's now suspended, or, I guess, \"on administrative leave\" was what they say, pending an investigation into his shooting. He is being investigated by the Arkansas State Police, which is the result of a policy that he himself implemented for shootings involving police officers to be investigated by an outside organization. So he is actually the first person who will be subjected to his new policy.\n\nHe initiated this policy of outside investigations to instill public trust in the police department when officers do shoot at someone. And he will be the first person subjected to that policy. So I think it's, in a kind of perverse way, actually a testament to the reform policies that he's trying to put in place.\n\nAG: One of the reasons it's such a good little capsule of the story is that as your story, this massive epic about the Little Rock Police Department, and Humphrey's arrival there, and the backlash to him shows, there's kind of a system of - speaking of preferential treatment - these kind of officers and their family members sometimes, and certainly their social circles and, in some cases, legacies of people that became ensconced in these powerful and kind of plum assignments, and just wanted to hang on to them. And, as Humphrey postulated, and a few policing experts backed up to you, that's not conducive to good policing.\n\nSo why don't you tell us a little bit about the background of how the police department functioned up until this point, the role of the police union, in sort of enforcing the old order that ended up clashing with Humphrey when he came in?\n\nRB: The Fraternal Order of Police ran the department. I mean, it's the only recognized collective bargaining unit for the city of Little Rock, and has been for a long time, for police officers.\n\nAnd so, Black officers have long complained that the FOP primarily represents the interests of white officers; that there's a clique of a few families that have had multiple members become police officers, who have controlled the union and have used the union to control the department and so their people get promotions over other people, their people get plum assignments to elite groups like major crime, special investigations, narcotics, those kind of really sought-after positions.\n\nAnd Black officers told me that the union would often fight when a Black officer would occasionally get assigned to one of those unions, or would get a promotion over white officers. The union worked hard to protect this kind of clique of people and families and their social circles, to keep them in these powerful positions.\n\nAnytime a white officer clashed with a Black officer - anytime, for example, a Black officer would claim racial discrimination, the union would not support them in their complaint. In fact, I asked every Black officer I interviewed, which was, I think I interviewed over 20 of them, if they could remember a single time when the union represented them in a racial discrimination claim and the most common response I got was laughter, and none of them could think of a single case. Whereas white officers, the FOP frequently represented them in reverse discrimination claims; so when a Black officer would get a promotion over a white officer, the FOP would would sue on behalf of the white officer.\n\nAnd so there's a sense among Black officers that the union hasn't represented their interests and that it works instead to protect this, as you said, ensconced clique of a few families, their supporters, and their social networks.\n\nAnd then, at the same time because you have this kind of power structure that wants to keep things as they are, any Black officers who have tried to raise red flags over the years about, say, racial profiling, police misconduct, police corruption, excessive use of force, the union has come down on them like a ton of bricks. They don't get representation in the union. There's one officer in particular, a white officer, who has had multiple complaints against her by Black officers for harassment, hostile work environments. There's the internal kind of racial issues where Black officers have a hard time getting promotions, good training opportunities, assignments to these kinds of elite units. And then there are the external effects of that, which is that Black officers who try to raise concerns about the department's relationship with the Black community in Little Rock with discrimination, with profiling, with abuse of force, those officers, too, are punished within the department.\n\nAG: So Humphrey told you that he came into the department with the intention to win everybody over. But when he gets there, he immediately is faced with this controversy that ignites a debate about what he plans to do there and what kind of chief he's going to be, and it speaks to the power of the old guard and the way policing is done in Little Rock and the things that he wanted to change. So maybe you can tell us about that incident.\n\nRB: So when he comes in, he's got this incident waiting for him to take action on immediately and that is this white officer named Charles Starks [who] had shot and killed a Black motorist named Bradley Blackshire during a traffic stop.\n\nLittle Rock has a policy that forbids police officers from shooting into moving vehicles unless the vehicle is heading straight for them or is about to strike other people. And even that policy is sort of absurd because if a car is moving in a certain direction shooting and killing the driver is not going to stop it from moving in that direction, right? But the department has a previous problem with this. There was an officer who had been fired and actually prosecuted - although he was not convicted - for killing a Black teenager by shooting into a moving car. Another officer had just been recently fired for shooting into a moving car. And there have been a lot of other incidents where officers were not disciplined for doing so. And so this is kind of a big deal that's awaiting Humphrey as soon as he starts.\n\nAnd he ends up firing this officer, Charles Starks. If you look at the dashcam video of the incident itself, first of all, he starts shooting into the car while he's standing beside it before there's really any threat. There was a gun in the car, but it was in the backseat and it wasn't visible to Starks at the time. He then positioned himself in front of the car and sort of slowly climbs up onto the hood as the car continues to slowly roll forward, and then claimed that he had no choice but to shoot and kill the driver because the driver was driving toward him, trying to strike him with the car.\n\nAG: Yeah, the officer claimed that the driver was cutting the wheel toward him. But the video looks to me like there was no need for the officer to step in front of the car.\n\nRB: And, in fact, the video shows that if Starks was legitimately in fear of his life because the car was moving toward him, it was because he placed himself in front of the car. And there's a specific policy prohibiting that as well - officers are obligated to position themselves in a safe place.\n\nSo Humphrey fires Starks. So you've got this reformist Black police chief who within weeks of taking office after being appointed by this reformist Black mayor, fires a white police officer for shooting and killing a Black motorist; the FOP goes crazy, they immediately vow to help Starks get his job back, help him sue the department, the city, over this. It immediately turns a good percentage of the police department, mostly white officers, against Humphrey right from the start. And what it does then from there is it becomes this excuse that officers who have a beef with Humphrey can cite by claiming retaliation when they're affected by the other reforms that he puts in place.\n\nSo, some of the kind of more banal reforms - but still important - not even really controversial reforms that Humphrey puts in place, are things like an anti-nepotism policy, right. So you can't have an officer in the same chain-of-command as, say, his dad, right? Or you can't have a husband and wife working side by side. Or you can't have twin brothers working in the same unit - all of which have happened at LRPD.\n\nHe also instituted a policy of rotating his command staff. So he immediately signs all of his assistant chiefs to oversee different bureaus than the ones that they were overseeing. He takes not the assistant chiefs, but the next level down, he rotates them as well to new departments. The idea is from Humphrey's perspective, you want new blood in these departments, you don't want these supervisory officers overseeing the same department for 5, 10, 15 years at a time because it allows them to kind of build these little fiefdoms, it breeds corruption, or at least it breeds a sense of cronyism, and you get stagnation. And so the idea is to rotate your command staff to new departments.\n\nThe other thing about Humphrey, too, is that he's very much about career development. And he's constantly trying to hook people up with other people in ways that will help their careers, but he's always about creating your best self and a lot of self-improvement. And I think he legitimately wanted to rotate his command staff because he thought it'd be good for them, he thought it'd be good for their careers to get different experiences, to get exposed to other bureaus, departments within the the LRPD, so that they could go out and get chief's jobs with other departments. But instead, the way this gets portrayed is that he's just transferring these officers to these high ranking officers because they disagreed with him about his firing of Charles Starks and that this is retaliation.\n\nAG: None of these officers responded to your request for comment, Radley. But if you put yourself in their heads, why would you guess that they resisted Humphrey so strongly?\n\nRB: They immediately, from the start, hate Humphrey - or maybe not hate him personally, but hate what he represents. And they hate that he and the mayor represent change and represent upending the power structures in Little Rock. So they characterize these transfers and these new anti-nepotism policies as retaliation from this tyrannical chief who doesn't like that people disagreed with him about his firing of this white officer.\n\nAnd I'll tell you, I interviewed a number of experts in police management, groups like PERF, other police foundations that promote best policies in policing, particularly in large cities. And they all say that these reforms that Humphrey implemented, they're not radical, right? They shouldn't really even be controversial; I mean, the idea that you don't want to father in the same chain-of-command as his son, or that you don't want a married couple working side-by-side, you don't want that in really any organization, but particularly in policing.\n\nAG: Humphrey fires Starks because of this issue of loss of life that involved violations of LRPD policy, and then Starks fights for his job back. There's this extremely tense episode around these two days of hearings, Civil Service Commission hearings, where Starks is appealing his firing. And then some of Humphrey's antagonists testify there. And, I mean, despite many complications, they cite their testifying against Humphreys decision to fire this officer as the seed against which he later retaliated by instituting these reforms and taking away their positions from him. And I think it's fair to say that the forces of the old guard, the kind of forces of reaction in Little Rock and the police department really went to war with Humphrey to an incredible degree at this point. The means through which they did that was a raft of human resources complaints and other internal things, and then also taking their fight into the courts, and Chris Burks, who you mentioned before was deeply involved in this.\n\nSo if you could just give us a little bit about the history of the way litigation has shaped the Little Rock Police Department and what people from the days of yore in Little Rock told you about that, and then also the incredible degree to which these lawsuits started to fly at Humphrey?\n\nRB: There's kind of a three-front war on Humphrey, right?\n\nThe first is through the human resources department and EOC complaints, allegations of retaliation,. Then there are these lawsuits, all but one of which are filed by Chris Burks, on behalf of various officers from the department, including a good percentage of Humphreys command staff when he starts.\n\nThere's also a war in the press. And one of the things that I found probably not surprising, but disturbing, is the degree to which the local media in Little Rock just sort of ate up whatever tips the FOP fed them and ran with really any accusation at all with very little skepticism.\n\nThere's a good explanation, there's a good reason for that, which is that if you're in the FOP, if you are an assistant chief who's been in the LRPD all your life, you probably have connections and local media, right? You have sources that you can reach out to. And for local media, they've developed these sources. If you're on the police beat for the local TV station or local paper in a city, the size of Little Rock, being skeptical of what those sources tell you makes it a little more difficult for you to do your job, right?\n\nWell, Humphrey comes in and he kind of tips over the applecart and he's trying to implement all these reforms. He doesn't have those same sources in local media that his opponents have built up over the years. And so it's very easy for them to plant stories about Humphrey with local journalists and for those journalists to then run with it without a whole lot of skepticism.\n\nAnd so you see a lot of accusations against Humphrey, including really petty things like there was one accusation that he had turned on his lights to run a stoplight in Little Rock. And that this, of course, was illegal, and an abuse of his position, and a local TV station ran with the story. And Humphrey had to basically use GPS data from his car to prove that he was on the other side of the city at the time with this alleged infraction - and they never ran a correction.\n\nBut what we see then is just this kind of full-court press against Humphrey and part of the problem, too, is that in Little Rock, the police union, they collectively bargain on behalf of everybody in the department whose rank is sergeant or lower, but anybody in the department - excluding the chief - including the assistant chiefs, can pay union dues and in exchange for that they will get representation if they ever face any sort of discipline from the department or from the chief. And so a guy like Humphrey comes in from the outside, the union is representing everybody in the department but him.\n\nSo usually what happens in a situation like this is a city appoints a reformed chief, any higher ranking officer who had wanted his job sees the writing on the wall, and they resign and try to find a job somewhere else. But in Little Rock, because the union represents everybody up to and including the assistant chiefs, two of the three assistant chiefs at the LRPD had applied for this job: They wanted it, they didn't get it, Humphrey got it. So immediately he's got two of his three direct subordinates are already pissed off because he got the job that they want. A lot of the rest of his command staff are part of the old guard, they don't want these reforms, they aren't happy that this new mayor was elected and appointed this reformist Chief.\n\nAG: Yeah. And we should add again, that none of these officers responded to your request for comment. But anyway, Radley, Humphrey's hands were tied.\n\nRB: And because of the way the union is set up in Little Rock, there's nothing an outsider chief can really do about that. He's got a command staff that's going to be pretty militantly opposed to his new policies, and there's nothing he can do to change it.\n\nA lot of the policing experts that I talked to said that it's untenable. You have to be able to put in a command staff that supports your policies. And if you can't, it's going to be nearly impossible for you to get anything done. And, in fact, they're sort of surprised that Humphrey had been able to implement the reforms he had given that the deck was kind of stacked against him when he started.\n\nSo there's all that resistance from the start. And then we started seeing the lawsuits, the lawsuits start flying, and Burk files one after another, after another, after another. And they all hew to this line that all these officers who are filing lawsuits against Humphrey are alleging basically the same thing, which is that one of the parties to the lawsuit, either testified against the firing of Charles Starks, or publicly advocated against the firing, or opposed the firing from behind the scenes, and that Humphrey had then taken actions to retaliate against them and their friends and family, or whoever, because of that.\n\nAG: Radley, can you tell me a little bit about how this story fits into the bigger picture of police reform post-George Floyd, whether reforms are possible, the sort of forces that are going to push back against these sorts of efforts from inside police departments?\n\nRB: Here you have a clear mandate from this new mayor, he runs on police reform, he wins, he appoints a reformist police chief. And what you have a couple years later is you've got a chief who's been in constant turmoil, who's been fighting left and right for his job, and who's basically had difficulty implementing even these kinds of basic, non-radical, fairly mundane reforms.\n\nAnd what it tells us is that the resistance to reform is going to be formidable, that it's going to be especially vulnerable in cities that have strong police unions, because they've negotiated their way into a position that they're not gonna back down voluntarily.\n\nBut also, I mean, what you found in Little Rock was it wasn't just the FOP. There were state legislators who got involved in the campaign against Humphrey and who tried to publicly shame him. In one case, you had an HR investigator donating to the GoFundMe campaign for the officer who's firing she was investigating, right? [Chuckles.]\n\nSo policing has been the institution that it is for generations in this country. As somebody who has been covering this issue for 15 years now is very encouraged by what happened in the wake of the George Floyd protests, and that we've seen the most substantive reforms, I think, we've seen since I've been covering this issue. But, again, policing has been the way it is for generations and generations; the people who have a vested interest in keeping it the way it is have a lot of powerful allies and so it's going to be hard to shake all of that up.\n\nAG: We should add, again, that none of the officers that are apparently hostile to Humphrey responded to Radley's detailed and repeated requests for comment, including then-assistant chiefs, Finks and Fulk, who have both since left the department.\n\nAG: Radley also recently spoke with two people who are very familiar with the Little Rock Police Department: civil rights attorney Mike Laux and Johnny Gilbert, Jr., a Black lieutenant who retired in 2019 after 35 years on the force. Gilbert's father was also an officer in Little Rock.\n\nRadley asked Gilbert about his career, and about his dad's legacy at the LRPD.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nJohnny Gilbert, Jr.: My father became a Little Rock Police Officer in 1967. Prior to being a police officer, he was a construction worker with his older brother.\n\nAccording to my dad, that was his call for police officers, firemen; it was a call for Black leadership to be spread throughout the public sector. And I remember him quoting Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he said: If you're going to be a ditch digger, be the best ditch digger that there is. So he decided he was going to become a Little Rock Police Officer based on what was going on in the world, in America, in Arkansas, and in Little Rock because the number of Black police officers was almost insignificant. And so he heard the call and he became a policeman based on that.\n\nHe told me later on in his life that it was very, very difficult. And he said he always had to prove himself time, and time, and time again - that he was worthy, that he was competent enough to be a police officer. But he was judged by his race, by his color, and not by the badge and the gun that he had, or even his intelligence. So he was always struggling, fighting, resisting and asking himself: Is it really worth it?\n\nMike Laux: They call that the double consciousness, that added burden of African-Americans who strive to succeed in various professions.\n\nThink about all the added stress, and the added consternation, and self-doubt, and all of the other burdens that folks of that generation and certainly today still take on. I take my hat off to Lt. Gilbert's father, he's a trailblazer and a heck of a icon really\n\nJGJ: Thank you, Mr. Laux. And you bring up Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois and \"The Souls of Black Folk\" when you said double consciousness.\n\nRB: Johnny, so your dad eventually started the Black police officers union in Little Rock and filed a lawsuit a discrimination lawsuit against the department in the city. Can you tell me a little bit about how both of those things came about, and then how that affected your hiring, eventually, at the department?\n\nJGJ: As far as the Black Police Officers Association is concerned, he didn't believe - and these other Black police officers and some of them are still alive - didn't feel that the Fraternal Order of Police would represent their interests, because they were Black. And they felt as though: Why can't we start our own organization and represent ourselves as a bargaining agent with the city of Little Rock?\n\nAnd so consequently, there were five Black police officers who helped to form the Black Police Officers Association that was formed in 1978. He said that they conspired - his words - to keep him from being promoted to sergeant because they don't want to deal with a Black man or Black supervisor. And in that situation came the evidence for a lawsuit against the city of Little Rock, because he and several other Black police officers didn't feel they were being treated fairly in terms of the promotion process.\n\nAG: You had told me that you got out of the military, where you had some policing experience. And then you apply for a job at the Little Rock Police Department. And what happens?\n\nJGJ: I apply for a job with the Little Rock Police Department. They told me I didn't pass the examination. And so I asked them: If I didn't pass the examination, could you tell me where I faltered? Or what errors, and what I was weak in? And they told me that they couldn't show me that information.\n\nSo I re-enlisted in the Air Force and decided to serve my country again. And while I'm on my second enlistment with the Air Force, I'm coming back from Germany, I found out that the United States Justice Department had come and interviewed people in the Little Rock Police Department and city government had entered into a consent decree to hire African Americans and females at a rate commensurate to the population of the City of Little Rock. I was on my second enlistment from the Air Force and I had the opportunity to go to Germany for four years unaccompanied without my wife, or I can leave the military early and join the Little Rock Police Department and start being employed there. I chose the latter. I chose to become a member of a Little Rock Police Department in 1984.\n\nRB: So Johnny, when you talk about systemic racism, structural racism in policing, one of the responses you often get from groups like police unions or people politically on the right, is that: Well, there are all these Black officers in policing, this department is majority Black, or 30 percent Black, why would Black officers participate in a system that is systemically racist, right? You're saying that those officers are racist, too?\n\nAnd I think one of the things I tried to show in this article is that Black officers themselves will agree that the system is racist. How would you respond to people who make that argument, that policing can't have systemic racism issues because it has so many Black police officers in it?\n\nJGJ: I will tell you just because you have Black people there is not enough. Those people of color, Black people, female, aspire to be in positions of leadership. They want to be able to steer the ship. They want to be able to influence it. They want to impart fair policies, they want to use their life experiences, they want to use their formal education, they want to use critical thinking and reasoning, and that has been circumvented time, and time, and time again, in my experience. And it's hurtful. It's hurtful.\n\nWhen you spend time, and time, and energy, and you carry this stuff home inside the house with you, and it impacts your family, it impacts your quality of life, it impacts your thinking. It's a kind of an ongoing trauma that you have to endure all the time. And you say: When's enough? I didn't sign up for this.\n\nI don't have the answer. But I realized as I have it in my rearview mirror that I was traumatized.\n\nRB: And when you say you're traumatized, you're not talking about seeing violence, getting resistance from suspects, you're talking about trauma inflicted by your fellow police officers?\n\nJGJ: I'm talking about trauma inflicted by supervisors and managers who don't see my point of view because they don't want to see it. They don't want to see the truth.\n\nRB: I think Mike was one of the people who mentioned this phrase to me, but this idea of: As long as you're blue before you're Black, you can be alright. But as soon as you put your Blackness ahead of your badge, that's when you start, you get in trouble as an officer. And so you get the racism within the department, but then the systemic racism in the department prevents Black officers from raising concerns about how the Black community is treated by the department.\n\nBut Mike, if you want to talk about your experience, and some of the lawsuits you filed, and what you found?\n\nML: I've been handling police-involved shooting and racial discrimination lawsuits in Little Rock for over 10 years now. It's really remarkable for me to say that, but it's true. And I have personally reviewed and scrutinized thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands of pages of files - internal affairs review files, divisional operation investigation files, citizen complaints - and there are certainly trends that break through all of these different kinds of files. And one of them is that there's definitely a tier system in the Little Rock Police Department. And by that I mean, there are tiers of particular types of officers who are on a hierarchy, are placed in the hierarchy. And the ones at the top have bad conduct overlooked. If it can't be overlooked, their discipline is minimal, they get the plum positions - this is previous to Chief Humphrey's reforms - but they get the plum positions, they get the plum off-duty positions, they get promotions, they get perks, nicer department cars, things like that. And the tiers are basically white males who are connected, who are legacies, at the very top.\n\nRB: Lt. Gilbert, I'd like to hear specifically what you think about that, in your own experience? Because I know that you have raised concerns about some personnel decisions about how officers were disciplined after shootings, and I think you suffered repercussions for that?\n\nJGJ: Yes, sir. I can. But this hurts - hurts deeply.\n\nWhen I was assigned to the training division, that's where police applicants and candidates come through the city, through the police department go through these backgrounds, physical fitness examinations, moral turpitude interviews, but the one that stands out in my mind most distinctly was this legacy - and Mike referred to legacies - of a guy by the name of Josh Hastings.\n\nHe came to the police department as an applicant. Part of the criteria of a police applicant was to submit to a polygraph examination. And when he was undergoing a polygraph examination, the question was: Has he ever been a member of or participated in a subversive group that undermined and tried to overthrow the American government? And he said he had accidentally gone to a Klan meeting. The polygraph examiner stopped the tape, and says: Go talk to your father and come back and talk to me in a couple of days.\n\nAnd so I read it, and I said, in writing and verbally: Why are we entertaining the idea of hiring someone who says they've actually gone to a Klan meeting? My document was submitted, it went up the chain-of-command, and was ignored. That individual was hired as a police officer, and I was removed from the training division. That individual was hired.\n\nThere was a call to a shooting that took place in Little Rock, where supposedly, there were some Black males breaking into cars. The responding officer was officer Josh Hastings. One of the suspects was an individual named Bobby Moore. Hastings shot him and alleged that Bobby Moore was trying to run over him.\n\nAnd so, for me, I go back to what I said before, how sometimes police work can cause trauma. Hastings should've never been hired in the first place. If he hadn't been hired, maybe - I don't know - maybe Bobby Moore would still be alive.\n\nI will tell you, I was not viewed in a respectful manner by my superiors. I was not. I was regarded as a problem child.\n\nRB: Because you didn't want to hire an officer who had gone to a Klan meeting? [Laughs.]\n\nJGJ: [Laughs.] All I can do is tell you the truth. That's all I can do.\n\nRB: Mike, one thing I've found interesting is sort of the arc of who you've represented in Little Rock over the years. So, you often represent residents of Little Rock who've been shot or abused by Little Rock Police officers. But then you start representing some Black officers when it comes to policies, and promotions, and training, and alleged discrimination.\n\nBut now you're representing the damn chief, right? And he's still encountering the same problems that everybody else has been encountering that you've represented. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that - or if that's occurred to you - what does that say about just how difficult this is going to be to change or to reform, particularly from the outside?\n\nML: Yeah, it's been quite a journey. And it's been quite an odyssey. I'm very proud of the work that I've done in Little Rock. And I'm very proud of my clients and the cases I've handled. And I think, hopefully, I've made some kind of a difference there.\n\nYeah, I represented Lt. Gilbert and three other officers in a, I think, fairly landmark race discrimination case; it settled. And I learned a lot about the inequities within the department and how they are on equal footing with the inequities out in the field toward Little Rock citizens of color. I have never seen such naked hostility to reasonable reform in my life than I have witnessed with Chief Humphrey and the very reasonable measures that he's trying to implement - ones that have been endorsed by the residents of Little Rock via the polls, and via their choice as Frank Scott, Jr. for mayor.\n\nRB: The reforms that Humphrey has proposed are pretty mild. I mean, these aren't radical reforms by any stretch of the imagination. They tend to be reforms supported by groups like PERF and the National Association of Chiefs of Police. And yet, he still gets this kind of resistance. He gets these sort of baseless sexual harassment allegations. He gets this very classic, racist trope: when you want to bring a Black man down, you accuse him of having inappropriate relations with white women. And he's not alone. I mean, this has happened to Black police chiefs across the country, they face similar campaigns against them with similar allegations.\n\nML: I'll tell you, it's been disheartening to see the resistance that Chief Humphrey is facing, and some of the underhanded tactics that have been used against not just him but myself. But, as I think your article really demonstrates and really showcases, because it's such a comprehensive piece you did, I really feel like it takes a long time to turn around an ocean liner. And this ocean liner has been going for a very, very long time in open seas. And it takes a long time to get that baby turned around.\n\nAnd when I read your article, kind of taking myself away from the frontlines, and reading it from afar, reading it as I hope and I believe your many, many readers will do, it's actually a positive story, in a sense. And I say, cautiously, it portends, I think, well for the future.\n\nRB: The kind of villain in the story is the FOP. And this is what we've seen nationally, the FOP has been the biggest barrier to reform. There's certainly been a disconnect between Black officers and the FOP - not just in Little Rock, but across the country. I remember seeing stories about how the national FOP and FOPs across the country endorsed Trump, and a lot of Black officers unions actively resisted that, to the point of in some cases, withholding dues. So there does really seem to be this racial divide within law enforcement.\n\nAnd yet, the FOP in Little Rock and elsewhere remains the only recognized collective bargaining agent in these cities. How do we get around this? How do we get around that this monstrous barrier to reform that is, I guess you could say, largely white police unions? What do we do?\n\nML: These contracts are annually renewed. And so there's no long-term issue here. These are just simple contracts. So when the contract period expires, at least in theory, you're free to draft whatever type of an agreement you'd like.\n\nNow, I know that mayor Scott has been entertaining, if not more, the idea of getting more comprehensive representation into some of these negotiations for police contracts. And by that, I mean, the LRBPOA, which is the Black officers' union. Now, whether that's kind of window dressing, or whether that puts them on equal footing with the FOP, I think is going to be the nuts and bolts. That's going to be the thrust of anything in terms of change or not.\n\nBut I think the the way is that you've got to start to loosen and then remove the stranglehold, quite simply, that the FOP has on Little Rock and other cities across the country: Hoke County, North Carolina; Kansas City; in Columbus, recently, there is an article on CNN about the really malicious lengths to which these unions will go to thwart reform.\n\nAnd basically we're talking about greediness, basically. We're talking about greed. We're talking about a resistance to just sharing resources equally. No one's overreaching. No Black officer is overreaching, or Black officer's group is overreaching. They're just trying to get the baseline. And so what that means is that for generations and generations, some of these white officers are going to have to relinquish some of these cherry-on-top-perks that they've been enjoying for so long.\n\nBut that comes with having a healthy, fairly run, egalitarian, and thus more effective police department. It's the lesson we all learn in kindergarten: you share your toys, and you share your sandwich, you share the resources, you don't hoard at the expense of others. And so I think that if some of those key things can be implemented, maybe you'll see some change.\n\nRB: One of the questions that came out of the George Floyd movement is this question of defunding the police or abolition of police, and without getting into that aspect of it, I just want to ask, as somebody who's experienced a lot of these problems with policing firsthand, or somebody who has tried to reform the system from within and has faced retaliation for that, I guess my question is: Is policing reformable? Can it be changed in a way that will actually make a difference in people's day-to-day lives?\n\nJGJ: That's a deep question, man. That's not even fair to ask me something like that.\n\nIn terms of police reform, some people are going to have to get hurt. Some people are going to have to leave this profession. It's not cut out for everybody. It's not not cut out for people like Josh Hastings. It's not. He doesn't have the maturity, the emotional maturity or psychological maturity. He doesn't. If we're going to elevate this thing to a profession, you can't hire a bunch of derelicts - you can't - with a bunch of baggage, emotional psychological baggage. Say no.\n\nSo the stamps have to be increased. Is it gonna hurt? Yes. Are we hurting? Yes. Is the Little Rock Police Department hurting for police officers? Yes. But that trend goes across the board and law enforcement across the country. But somebody has to sacrifice themselves and be the blood on the altar. You have to be! Because I wouldn't be without that. Not just my father, but people before him, suffering and sacrifice, enduring hardship again and again and again. And they kept coming back. I'm not gonna go away. You're gonna have to deal with this Black face. I'm gonna contribute in my own way. I want to be a leader. I want to be a supervisor. I want to contribute. I want to tell you about my community. I want to tell you about my church. I want to be heard. I want to be respected; I want to be valued. We can't turn the ship around. But guess what? We can start turning. We can start turning. We can start turning and we can start rowing.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nAG: That was Radey Balko, in conversation with former Little Rock police officer Johnny Gilbert, Jr., and civil rights attorney Mike Laux.\n\nRadley Balko is a journalist and author.

      "text": "Don't Stop the Protests Against Police Brutality - Black Lives Still Matter\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nNo group should be asked to forgo Constitutional rights.\n\nLast summer, Jerad and Amanda Miller walked into a CiCi's Pizza restaurant in Las Vegas and murdered two police officers who were sitting down and having lunch. Jerad Miller pulled out a handgun and shot one officer in the back of his head, and before the other officer could react, Miller shot him in the throat. Amanda then joined in, as the couple lit up the incapacitated officers. Afterwards, the Millers placed the deceased bodies on the floor and covered them with a Gadsden flag and a swastika. The former, a Revolutionary War-era flag adopted by libertarian groups, is important because the Millers were rabid anti-government activists, whose history of extremism was well documented . Video also surfaced showing the pair protesting at Cliven Bundy's ranch.\n\nBundy is the Nevada rancher who since 1993 has refused to pay grazing fees. He is also the man who alluded to possibly happier times when Negroes were slaves and had, he said , more freedom. The standoff between him and the government became a cri de coeur of anti-government, right-wing activists. Yet there was no mass outcry, after the Millers murdered those two officers, against Bundy, his supporters, cable news, or tea party groups (the occasional pundit notwithstanding). There were certainly no calls for a cessation of first amendment rights.\n\nFast forward to Saturday, when Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley killed two New York police officers as they sat in a marked patrol car outside a housing project in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Brinsley, who had long struggled with mental illness, tied the shootings on social media to the death of Eric Garner, who died in a chokehold during a confrontation with New York police officers.\n\nThe outrage machine was ready and salivating. The George Patakis, Rudy Giulianis and Pat Lynches of the world had been waiting for something like this to happen, so they could lash out at those they view as their enemies. Pataki, the Republican former New York Governor, took to Twitter and blamed the police shootings on the supposed anti-cop rhetoric of outgoing U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and liberal New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. I could not recall any anti-cop musings from Holder and de Blasio, so I went back and searched. They said, in essence, that America's police departments have a history of targeting and violating black people. That is it. But since we live in a country where police officers are so highly respected and immune to criticism - even when they are recorded doing something wrong - de Blasio's timid remarks qualify as anti-cop.\n\nLynch, the fanatical president of the NYPD union, even went so far to accuse de Blasio of having the dead officers' blood on his hands. Meanwhile, Giuliani - who has reemerged from his reprobate business dealings to reclaim his role as America's reigning racial arsonist - blamed Barack Obama. \"They [Obama and de Blasio] have created an atmosphere of severe, strong, anti-police hatred in certain communities. For that, they should be ashamed of themselves,\" he said on Fox News.\n\nThe family of Michael Brown, the widely mourned Ferguson, Missouri police shooting victim, put out a statement that condemned the killings. It's hard to think of why a Midwestern family a time zone away should have to comment on a shooting in New York, other than that black Americans are always thought to be responsible - some how, some way - for crimes to which they have no connection. As one Twitter user posted Saturday, \"Only in America does the still-grieving family of a murdered black child have to come out with a statement about an unrelated crime.\" And Garner's daughter visited a memorial set up for the slain officers. Did NYPD commissioner Bill Bratton visit Garner's makeshift memorial? Did de Blasio?\n\nThe lives of the officers killed in Brooklyn were no more valuable or precious than those of Garner or Brown, to say nothing of Tamir Rice (fatally shot by police at age 12 while playing with a toy gun) or John Crawford (fatally shot while walking through Wal Mart with a BB gun). But today an apparently cowed de Blasio called for the protests, which were spawned by the killings of the aforementioned black males, to stop . \"Put aside protest,\" he said, \"put aside demonstrations, until these funerals are passed. Let's just focus on these families and what they have lost.\"\n\nStop protesting police brutality. Stop demanding racial justice. Stop fighting for black life.\n\nThe murders of the two NYPD officers were ghastly, but no group of Americans should be asked to stop exercising their Constitutional rights because of what occurred in Brooklyn. This is particularly true for black Americans who have long been admonished to wait their turn. Black citizens are always expected to give up so much for a country that has given them so little. But two weeks ago New York activists organized a giant demonstration to protest police brutality.\n\nI marched for seven hours in the city I now call home. In front of me, for a chunk of that time, was a father and his son. The son appeared to be 3 or 4 years old. At one point we passed a phalanx of NYPD officers whom the father promptly flipped off. He then looked down at his son, while motioning to the massive crowd, and said, simply, \"This is for you.\" And so, despite Saturday's horrible events, black lives still matter.\n\nThis post has been amended to reflect the author's views on the Millions March NYC.\n\nEditor's Note: February 2, 2016 After uncovering misattributed quotes in stories written by Juan Thompson, a former staff reporter, The Intercept conducted a review of his work.

      "text": "The Case for Expanding Social Security\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nDemocratic Rep. John Larson believes Social Security has fallen behind the times.\n\nThe proposed Social Security 2100 Act would bolster the nearly century-old social insurance program through additions like caregiver credits and increased minimum benefits. Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., the architect of the plan, joins The Intercept's Ryan Grim and Jon Schwarz to discuss why he thinks an expansion of Social Security is overdue.\n\n[Intro theme music.]\n\nJon Schwarz: We are big Social Security partisans, and love to talk about it in depth. So get ready.\n\nRep. John Larson: I'm ready. I'm a big partisan Social Security advocate myself. [Laughs.]\n\nNewscaster: We could be one step closer to better Social Security after lawmakers unveiled what they're calling Social Security 2100.\n\nRyan Grim: We are hostile opponents of elderly poverty.\n\nJL: Exactly.\n\nRG: That's a very controversial position, apparently.\n\nNewscaster: Chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee, Connecticut Congressman John Larson says that's why he's introduced the Social Security 2100 Act to increase payments to older Americans.\n\nRG: So I'm joined here by two Johns - Congressman John Larson, who represents Hartford, Connecticut and areas around that. Does that about accurately describe your district?\n\nJL: It is. It's Hartford and the 27 towns around it.\n\nRG: And also joined by Jon Schwarz, my colleague at The Intercept, and we're talking about Social Security.\n\nAnd I wanted to start with a story that I actually wrote about with Arthur Delaney about 10 years ago in an article back at the Huffington Post . And he had dug out of the Historical Society of Washington's archives, this fascinating but very revealing story about the way that elderly poverty existed pre-Social Security.\n\nAnd so it starts in the winter of 1896-1897, an employee of a charity called Associated Charities was walking through Washington and he came across an elderly Black woman - she's only known as aunt Winnie in in the archives - and he writes in his report, she \"could not give street and number, but could 'fotch' the agent to her place. Old age, with a heavy load on top and a strong wind blowing, made the walk a trying one. At last the 8×10 cabin was reached. In it was a stove in many pieces held together with wire, a bedstead with rags for mattress and rags for covering. From the leaky roof the floor was wet through and through.\"\n\nBut the story doesn't stop there. So it talks about how her only income was as a washerwoman, she would make 50 cents every two weeks taking in laundry, and then she raised the garden in the summertime, but in the winter, it says she \"suffered for food and fuel.\" Her children had all been sold away to slavery, even though this is the 1890s. she was born into slavery.\n\nJL: Wow.\n\nRG: And so she didn't have family to help her out. There was a nearby niece, but she was too poor to offer much support. Neighbors helped her get through and a \"colored, friendly visitor was found to carry broth and other comforts to her.\" So this is how she survived, as the agent then writes. In the fall of 1898, an agent asked her to go into the almshouse, which is another name for a poorhouse, but she would not consent.\n\n\"During the storm in February '99, she was kept from perishing with a great effort. Every visit, and they were many, had to be made through snow up to the waist. It was during these visits that the promise was made that before another winter she would take refuge in an almshouse.\"\n\nBut then when the spring came, and when he backed off, she refused to go to the poorhouse - so the social worker at that point started playing hardball. He said: \"It would be hard to say which, the agent or the applicant, suffered the more, because through all this distress had sprung up a loving confidence and perfect trust that seemed cruel to deceive. Attention and assistance were withdrawn gradually.\"\n\nAnd so, you know, effectively, he's further immiserating her to try to talk her into going to this poorhouse. And finally, in July of 1899, she agrees, and she says that she'll sell her cabin and go into a poorhouse. Nobody would buy the [cabin]. So the social worker suggested that she tear it down and just sell it for kindling. And then it says at 2 p.m. on August 23, 1899, the social worker showed up in a wagon: \"[S]he was sitting on her trunk, without a stick of the cabin to be seen. Without a murmur she dropped a courtsey to the bare spot where once stood the cabin and turned away.\"\n\nAnd what's stuck with me all these years about that story is not just the horrific poverty that she was living through, and the struggle of her life, but how much she wanted to cling to her place, her freedom - it may have been a rag-covered mattress and it may have been a stove that was stitched together -\n\nJL: It was home.\n\nRG: - by wire, but it was home. It was hers. She didn't want to go to the poorhouse.\n\nAnd poorhouses more or less do not exist anymore. And so this is the second thing I want to read to you, Congressman. Your colleague, Rep. John Dingell, I interviewed him for this story.\n\nJL: Oh wow.\n\nRG: And his father stood behind FDR when he signed the Social Security Act into law. And he said: This is one of the things of which my dad was very proud. It closed 1,100 old folks homes in New York - 1,100. And that was just one example, but it tells you what it did all over the country, Dingell told me.\n\nAnd he said, before Social Security, what he remembered was that, \"everybody and his second cousin piled in with their families. I had relatives that came to stay with my dad and mom I didn't even know were relatives. To tell you the truth, I'm not sure they are. And my grandad on Dad's side, who threw Dad out of the house, came to live with Dad. Dad was the only one of his kids who'd take care of him. He was, quite frankly, the only one who could afford to do so, because Pop was making a fairly decent living during the war, but he was supporting a whole tribe of Dingells and Selmerses and a whole bunch of others who had other Polish names but were related.\"\n\nAnd so those were the two ways that the elderly survived: they either were pushed into a poorhouse, or they piled in with family who was, on the one hand, happy to help as much as they could, but on the other hand, makes for an awfully difficult living situation.\n\nSo, we all have stories in our lives about Social Security. And, Congressman, I'm curious what your connection to the program has been?\n\nJL: Well, first and foremost, what a compelling story about Winnie. And I think also there, and what struck me as you were speaking, is the enormous pride that people had and you know, as you pointed out, be it ever so humble, there was no place like her home - making it on our own. And I think this is important to the concept of Social Security, often referred to by our erstwhile colleagues on the other side as an entitlement.\n\nThe brilliance of Roosevelt was that this is not an entitlement. This is not being forced to go into an almshouse. This is your contribution. And I tell seniors and everyone everywhere I go: Look, and you know, this is true? Just look at your pay stub. It says, FICA - Federal Insurance Contribution. Whose? Yours.\n\nThis is not an entitlement. It is the most efficient insurance plan - and I live in an insurance capital of the world - the most efficient insurance program in the world is Social Security. It has a 99 percent loss ratio. Any insurance company would die to have a loss ratio of 99 percent, meaning the cost to run Social Security, and government officials don't get enough credit for this, is 1 percent. It is the most economical, the most efficient government program, and as you pointed out at the outset of the show, Ryan, it has kept seniors out of poverty. It has also kept children out of poverty. And veterans rely more on it - especially disabled veterans - than they do on the VA.\n\nAnd it all comes down to responsibility and accountability. You mentioned Social Security stories. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which has cognizance over this, is Rep. Rich Neal. Rep. Rich Neal lost his mother, his father, his grandmother, who was then bringing his family up on Social Security, and then his grandmother passed. Both Rep. Tom Reed and Rep. Tom Rice - on the committee - also lost a parent, and were raised on Social Security.\n\nWe have 5 million fellow Americans who live and receive checks below the poverty level, so a people who have paid into a system all their lives, but for the negligence of Congress, receive a below poverty-level check from the wealthiest nation in the world, at a time in our history, where the wealth differential is the greatest it's ever been.\n\nAnd this is something that Joe Biden cannot do with an executive order, nor that the Supreme Court is going to take up anytime soon. This is the responsibility of the United States Congress. Congress has kicked the can down the road too many times. The last president to do something with Congress with this was Ronald Reagan. But what they did is they made Social Security more solvent. But what they did was put in place a series of cuts.\n\nNow, I say a series of cuts. What do I mean by that? They raised the age. And they use this very simplistically saying: Well, people are living longer, so therefore we should raise the age. For every year you raise the age, it's a 7 percent cut in benefits, the last of which just went into effect this January, from a bill that was passed in 1983.\n\nSo 39 years ago, we're still seeing the effects, even though it improved the solvency of Social Security, not a single benefit was enhanced. And by raising the age, your benefit was cut by 7 percent.\n\nJS: Congressman, you are the chair of the Social Security Subcommittee on Ways and Means.\n\nJL: Yep.\n\nJS: I assume that that did not happen by accident.\n\nJL: [Laughs.]\n\nJS: And this is something that you're personally wanting to do, something you personally care about. And I think for most people, they understand politics through stories. And I'm wondering if there are any stories from your life about how Social Security has touched your family, or simply what you've encountered in your political career, like things that you really remember.\n\nJL: Growing up in a blue collar, industrial town, you get to see firsthand what poverty is about, and also how people struggle, and why programs like Social Security are so vitally important. It's, in so many cases, and for so many Americans, the only retirement that they have.\n\nAnd in the case of millennials, as we project out into the future, a generation of people who are earning less money than their parents did, are not in a position to buy a house or accumulate assets the way their parents were, and are saddled with enormous college debt, and are wondering: Will Social Security be there for us? And I always say: Yes, it will.\n\nA few things have changed over the last 50 years in terms of the cost of living, and adjustments that people have had to make. But, clearly, Social Security has not kept pace with that.\n\nRG: And you have more than 200 co-sponsors on your bill, is that right?\n\nJL: Mhmm.\n\nRG: How close are you to 218?\n\nJL: We're at 206 right now. So but if I do the math right on that, that's 12 people away.\n\nRG: And so your bill has also changed recently. A previous bill of yours had basically permanently expanded Social Security payments, so that everybody was getting, I guess you can describe how it worked progressively for the richest recipients.\n\nJL: Right.\n\nRG: But everybody in, particularly at the lower end to the middle end we're getting an expansion, and it was going to be permanent.\n\nBut now President Biden campaigned on what has been become popular among Democrats, which is to say, there will be no tax increases on anybody making more than x, and the x for Biden was $400,000, which sounds nice, but it also does crimp the ability to fund a universal project like this in perpetuity.\n\nSo now, as I understand it, your new proposal extends it for five years. And then you would come back to the drawing board after that?\n\nJL: Well, you wouldn't have to go back to the drawing board, what it would do, and I think, rightfully so, it would put pressure on Congress to act, and it would also make all the recipients and all the benefactors, the 65 million people who will benefit from this, aware that something has been done with regard to social security. And why it's so strongly opposed by Republicans has been because once that benefit is implemented, it would be extraordinarily hard to take off. And again, the emphasis here would be on Congress's responsibility to vote.\n\nPresident Biden, when he campaigned, and I thought he used the very telling term when he said Social Security is \"a sacred trust.\" That's what the American people believe. And he articulated that. And he also then further added that he had other ideas that he wanted to see included in his proposal, including the repeal of WEP and GPO, which are governmental programs that prevented states and municipalities that had special pension plans from getting Social Security benefits.\n\nBottom line is this: In so many areas, it's unfair. But it's great that this has all now come together with the president, saying, as you point out, however, limited the constraint of lifting the cap on people over $400,000. And even though you're right, progressively, they will still receive a benefit, but far less of a benefit than someone under $50,000.\n\nYou know, there's some 120-plus groups from the Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Social Security Works, the NAACP, the National Organization of Women, the American Federation of Teachers - you get the picture and the drift here - they all emphasize one thing: Well, if we're limited in terms of what the president will sign into law, we would like to see the benefit enhancement, which has not been done in 50 years, and everybody has been falling behind, including fixing the COLA, so that actually reflects the real costs that seniors experience - a 2 percent across the board increase for everybody, but again, progressively designed, so people at the top end receive far less than people at the lower end of the spectrum, a tax cut for people that have to continue to work even when they're on Social Security. These are the kinds of benefits.\n\nAnd we've reached out to the other side, and people say: Well, how come you don't have bipartisan support? The bill is bipartisan. The American people, Democrats, Republicans, and independents broadly accept this. The polling data on it is off the charts. And I believe that once the bill is put on the floor, just like back in 1935, very rough going getting the bill out of committee, but once it got to the floor, all of a sudden, there was Republican support for a bill. And why? I can remember Mark Meadows saying to me: That bill makes it to the floor, you're going to find a lot of Republicans are going to be voting for that bill. Because we know as he did in rural North Carolina that this is their lifeline. This is what they depend on.\n\nRG: Mark Meadows told you that?\n\nJL: Yep. Mark Meadows.\n\nRG: Former Freedom Caucus turned Trump Chief of Staff?\n\nJL: Exactly. Exactly.\n\nRG: And speaking of getting it out of committee, the rumor around the House was that that Pelosi didn't want to see this come out of committee, but as I've reported this out more, it seems more like it's one of her top lieutenants, Wendell Primus, who's concerned about it. Do you know what his concerns are with the bill? Do you have any plans for working around that problem? Because he's not just any staffer, as you know, he's the guy that people kind of jokingly refer to him as Speaker Wendell.\n\nJL: He's a very bright and capable person, and he passionately cares about children. And he's always made the point that we have to make sure that we're taking care of the children.\n\nMy argument is that this does take care of the children. This is the number one anti-poverty program for children as well. And I think you're correct, in terms of Wendell's concern, would be that there's only so much money to go around, and we have only so many expenditures, etc.\n\nI would add that this is an off-budget item that this will not raise, this will not add a single penny to the national debt, number one. And number two, yep, it's limited in terms of what we would have liked to do in the bill previous, which was to make sure that it was solvent beyond 75 years, and the benefits were all permanent. But this expands the benefits, gives us a solid cornerstone, and it cuts the shortfall of Social Security in half.\n\nYes, it's a compromise based on A. making sure we're getting the benefits where it's needed. Rep. Pramila Jayapal told me that at the Progressive Caucus, they raised this with Speaker Pelosi. And she said yes, that it's time that we looked at Social Security. She said: There are bills out there, I'm familiar with Mr. Larson's bills. And there are bills in the Senate, too. And Bernie Sanders has a good bill. Elizabeth Warren has a bill. The Republicans have, I don't know if they actually have a bill in the Senate, but they've discussed an idea of a study, which, that doesn't help anyone who's currently dealing with Covid, and currently concerned about inflation, and is currently living on a fixed income.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nRG: And Schwarz, what jumps out the most to you about this program's history?\n\nJS: Well, the most interesting thing about Social Security to me is that it is part of what is really like a titanic, centuries-long fight just to make America a place that works for regular people.\n\nJL: That's a great description.\n\nJS: Yeah, I mean, it's the truth.\n\nJL: I'm gonna steal that.\n\nJS: Please do. Please make use of it.\n\nAnd I think that if you look at the Social Security Administration website, one of the interesting things about it is that there's a pamphlet on there, written by Thomas Paine in 1797, called \"Agrarian Justice.\" And it is, in essence, about social insurance, which Social Security is an example of. So this is something that people have literally been trying to make happen for 225 years in this country.\n\nAnd the establishment of Social Security was a huge victory in that fight. And maintaining it and expanding it is another potential gigantic victory. And I think that it's important for people to understand: This is an exciting story with heroes and with villains, it's not just something boring about getting a check every month, although that's extremely important. [Laughs.]\n\nJL: It is. Well, I try to tell people as well, especially my Republican colleagues, a number of Republicans who have campaigned against Social Security ended up being their biggest champions, most notably Dwight David Eisenhower.\n\nAnd you know the history behind social security. But he knew the history behind the sacrifice that the men and women who served under him in World War II had gone through and what they would need when they came back. And in one of his biographies, it talks about a letter from his brother saying: You've changed your view on Social Security. He says: Anyone who's seen what Americans endure upfront understands that this is an essential program for the American people and essential for our entrepreneurial system of governance, and anyone who doesn't recognize this is a fool.\n\nAnd Eisenhower expanded the program; Richard Nixon was the last person to expand the program - a Republican president - and, as we mentioned before, Ronald Reagan, who was virile in his attacks against social security, ultimately, and God rest his soul, primarily because of Bob Dole, said: No, this is a cornerstone that so many Americans depend on and believe in, as a party, we have to make sure that we're out front in favor of this. And they did pass it. Of course, Tip was the Speaker of the House. But what the compromise was then is they extended the solvency for a long period of time, but they did it through cuts. The program was not enhanced in 1983. And the cuts came by raising the age in steps - the last of which took place this January.\n\nRG: Let's say you could get it through the House this term. Have you talked to the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer about whether he thinks that this is worth a fight? I mean, obviously, Social Security is carved out of reconciliation. It's specifically written in there, interestingly, that you cannot do Social Security changes through reconciliation. I think that it's because, correct me if I'm wrong, I think Bob Byrd who helped write those reconciliation rules, didn't want to see it get cut through reconciliation.\n\nJL: Well, you know, you're absolutely correct and nobody would ever argue about Byrd's great parliamentary capability. The question remains, though, and as you point out, supposedly it was put in there Social Security and Medicare were put in and excluded from reconciliation to protect them - or, one could also argue, to prevent them from happening when you have a simple majority.\n\nAnd this raises a whole issue. That's why I think Social Security is one of the best things that should be front and center because it impacts America. It's broadly understood, and simple, and they all understand it. And I think when you have a vote like that before you, it places a great deal of responsibility and pressure - it's why I think Mark Meadows would recognize that in North Carolina, our seniors understand the value and importance of Social Security. And I think certainly Chuck Schumer knows politics as well as anyone. And I think this would be a valuable tool on several fronts.\n\nNumber one, first and foremost, because the benefit is needed, it's broadly understood, and it would impact 65 million Americans. And then when you look at, also, if Black lives really matter, the group that's impacted the most, who of those 5 million fellow Americans who live in poverty, of the more than 3 million who have paid into a system all their lives and still get a below poverty-level check, who are they? They are the Winnies you were talking about before: it's primarily women, and specifically women of color, and Black males.\n\nJohn Lewis said: This is the next civil rights issue. Because of the discrimination, unintended or otherwise, that has existed because of either jobs that people were doing at the time, and the menial nature of those jobs and the lack of a COLA or a wage adjustment by the government as we're going forward so that people were anchored at the bottom.\n\nSo no matter how well the economy was doing, Kennedy's phrase that a rising tide will lift all boats, couldn't happen if you're permanently anchored to the bottom, in poverty.\n\nRG: Speaking of politics, while we've got you on, I want to ask you a midterm question.\n\nJL: Sure.\n\nRG: You're facing a primary challenge for the first time in - when was the last time you had a serious primary challenge?\n\nJL: When I ran for the seat the first time: It was a five-way, highly contested primary.\n\nRG: And it seems like this is a phenomenon that's hitting districts all over the country, these very credible primary challengers, this was from a young progressive named Muad Hrezi, and he seems to be running a pretty serious campaign, he's been hitting you over corporate PAC contributions and generally making the argument for generational change. What does the race look like, from your perspective? And what is it like to not have had a challenge for so long? And do you think that people like yourself or others are going to be caught off guard by some of this? Or did AOC coming in a couple years ago, get people who'd been facing comfortable re-elections to say: Oh, I guess I might actually get challenged pretty soon?\n\nJL: Well, there's a number of good points there.\n\nFirst and foremost, anyone ought to be able to run for public office at any time, no matter who, what, where, or why. But they also have to demonstrate that they have the credentials and the wherewithal to do that.\n\nAnd I think if you're doing your job in your district, and you're out there meeting your constituency, and working on their behalf - as I said, at the beginning, this job, at the end of the day, is about helping people, and if you've got a reputation for helping people. There's not an awful lot of news about constituent service, and what you do on a daily basis, so I'm very comfortable - we certainly are taking nothing for granted in terms of the race.\n\nAnd I think that's the one of the lessons whether you're talking about Rep. Joe Crowley or Rep. Mike Capuano, two members of Congress that I served with. So you take nothing for granted. But if you're doing your job, and continuing to represent the people and their concerns, the best remedy for that is to roll up those sleeves, lean in, and I think what it's done for me is gotten me even a little bit more enthusiastic about making sure that we accomplish those goals and we're getting that message out.\n\nJS: Like on the one hand, I do truly believe that Social Security is a centuries-long and inspiring saga. But, of course, it is also a matter of very straightforward dollars and cents and people care about that part as well. And I would just like to give you the opportunity to maybe go through the top three, top four aspects of this bill, like what this means in terms of money.\n\nAnd my understanding from reading the bill is that: Number one, every single Social Security beneficiary would get an extra $30 a month, so an extra $360 a year, which is not nothing. And so what are the things that you see as most important in terms of just those basic dollars and cents issues?\n\nJL: Well, I do think that it's a basic dollar and cents issue, number one. And I would add that I think what we do is make sure that we address it. When you haven't had a program adjusted in more than 50 years, then there's a wide range of improvement. And that improvement starts with a 2 percent across-the-board increase. So, for example, you can have people that were currently making around, at the lower end of the scale, $11,900 in today's terms. But passage of this bill would mean that they received $15,000. Nobody's going to get wealthy off of Social Security. People aren't going out and re-upping their stock options with Social Security. They're getting basic subsistence.\n\nKS: And one thing I think people would be particularly interested in right now is that one of the most important, most significant aspects of Social Security for people, like in a year like the last one, is that it does have an automatic adjustment for inflation. So prices have gone up last month, January, Social Security benefits went up to match it.\n\nAnd so it might be interesting for people to know about the bill's change to the way that adjustment is calculated, because I'm sure you know the nitty gritty, wonky details, I'll just say that the costs for people who are over 65 are somewhat different than the cost for people who are under 65. And so there may need to be another way to calibrate the inflation adjustment so that people would actually get a higher cost of living adjustment every year.\n\nJL: Yes, you're absolutely correct. Let me start with the COLA. And for a number of years, the AARP has been suggesting that we ought to have something called CPI-E. CPI, as you know, standing for Consumer Price Index, and E referring to the elderly. By that, what they've done is they've devised something so that the actual costs that the elderly incur is factored in and not the broader CPI.\n\nNow, here's the great irony: This year, because of Covid, there was one of the largest increases in COLA in recent memory. So what we did with the legislation is make sure we adopted it to be flexible, and say that it will reflect either of the two, whichever is the greater.\n\nSo, in this instance, for example, CPI-E may not have gotten as much money in the wallets of people during this Covid pandemic, but in our legislation, it would be either/or - whichever is the greater amount. But consistently, year-in, year-out, CPI-E and what the AARP has been supporting would be a far better way to go as well.\n\nAnd as we were saying previously, also, about taking the new floor for Social Security, and saying that the new floor will be developed by the government to reflect 125 percent of the poverty rate. And what that means, quite frankly, is this: For so many Americans who have worked all their lives, more than 3 million, and paid into a system, they receive a below poverty-level check. And under our bill, what would happen is that an individual who gets a yearly benefit now of, let's say, $11,200 under the current formula, under our bill there would be a 42 percent increase, and they would be making $15,900.\n\nNow nobody's going to get wealthy on $15,900. But they're not living in poverty anymore. And that's an enormous help to all of them, and that's why we've done some of those specific increases, raising the floor to 125 percent of poverty is just common sense and so is a COLA that needs to reflect what everybody is going through.\n\nJS: And I think another particularly important aspect of your bill that caught my eye is that people know, I believe, that their Social Security benefits are based on their income during years where they were participating in the formal workforce. But there are a lot of people who work very, very hard, who are not in the formal workforce, because they are taking care of children.\n\nJL: Exactly.\n\nJS: They're taking care of their older relatives. And I think anybody who's ever done that knows that that actually is very real, very hard work.\n\nAnd so can you tell us a little bit just about what the bill does to address that?\n\nJL: Sure. Well, we provide caregiver credits to ensure that people - again, mostly women - are not penalized in retirement for taking time out of the workforce to care for children and their other dependents.\n\nI mean, again, we feel that this is common sense. This is something that President Biden was arguing for as well, as Rep. Brad Schneider and a number of people on the subcommittee. But what it does is provide earning an earnings credit for up to five years for those who take time out of the workforce to care for a dependent child aged 12, or a dependent relative. The maximum wage credits are up to half the average national wage, which would be $28,300 for 2020, and also making those for those who first become eligible for benefits in 2023, 27.\n\nThese are common-sense, practical, straightforward things that need to be addressed. And repealing WEP and GPO - that's the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Provision Offset - these are items that penalize people unfairly. And by eliminating them, school teachers, policemen, firefighters, municipal employees are now, and especially their spouses, going to be able to get benefits that they've been denied under the current system. It only happens when people start talking it up and focusing on it in this way.\n\nThe fierce urgency, as Martin Luther King would say, the fierce urgency of now is staring us right in the face, this Covid pandemic that is only underscored what's going on in seniors lives, in those very kitchen table discussions that they're having, wondering if they can make ends meet, wondering what the future holds for them. And wondering whether or not their government is going to step up and do the right thing here and make an adjustment they haven't done in more than 50 years.\n\nThis is blatant congressional neglect, and long overdue. And I'm glad that progressives all across this nation are supporting this. And this is what we're going to continue to fight for till we get a vote. And we get it passed. And it's signed into law.\n\nRG: Well, Congressman, thank you for joining us. And before I leave, I was just thinking about our exchange about the insurgent candidate. Are you still taking corporate PAC money? Have you considered joining the group, your colleagues, who have said: You know what, we're in a new era, I'm not doing this anymore?\n\nJL: You know, for years I've lived in a community. And the question has always been raised, even back when I was Senate president in the state of Connecticut: Do you take corporate money? These are the people that I work with and grew up with. Do you take defense contractor money? My father worked at Pratt & Whitney all of his life. My mother worked there during the Second World War.\n\nYes, I have taken that money. But the thing is, when you take that money, am I signing on to their agenda? No. They're signing on to my agenda. And I think that that point isn't made often enough. And you know, I live in an insurance capital of the world, but I've always been a supporter of the public option. And these are people, family and friends, etc, that I've known all of my life. And I represent them. And we're limited in terms of what we can take, and I think that's appropriate.\n\nBut if you search my record, I'm sure you'll find that I have one of the most progressive voting records in the United States Congress. And that's how I will continue to comport myself. It's my agenda that people are buying into, and that agenda includes Social Security and its passage.\n\nRG: Congressman, thank you for joining us. Really appreciate it.\n\nJS: Yeah. We'll be looking forward to seeing what happens with this bill.\n\nJL: Thank you.

      "text": "Intercepted Podcast: Injustice League\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA student gives an eye-witness report from Gaza, Glenn Greenwald discusses lies around the Pulse shooting, and DA candidates talk criminal justice reform.\n\nTwo million Palestinians live in the open-air prison that is Gaza. Last Friday, Israeli snipers gunned down 17 protesters and wounded more than a thousand others. This week on Intercepted: Yousef Mema, a 24-year-old nursing student in Gaza who witnessed the massacre, describes the killings and the aftermath, and he has a message for U.S. lawmakers. Then, key narratives about the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooter, Omar Mateen, and his motives and alleged accomplices are falling apart. The Intercept's Glenn Greenwald talks about the new information, the dubious prosecution of Mateen's wife Noor Salman and how the shooter's father has been an FBI informant since 2005. While Jeff Sessions may be turning back the clock to '80s-era \"tough on crime,\" a national insurgency is steadily aiming its sights at winning elections for district attorney. If successful, these new, progressive DAs could shake the criminal justice industry to its core and find themselves at war with the Trump White House. We speak to two DA candidates in California: Geneviéve Jones-Wright of San Diego and Pamela Price of Alameda County. These two women say they will take on out-of-control police, end cash bail, stop prosecuting nonviolent drug crimes, protect undocumented immigrants, and challenge mass incarceration. And, Frank from \"Donnie Darko\" pays a visit to the White House.\n\nAnnouncer: Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States, and Mrs. Trump, accompanied by the Easter Bunny.\n\nFrank from \"Donnie Darko\": Wake up, Donnie.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump: I wish I had that voice. Well, welcome to the 2018 White House Easter Egg Roll.\n\nF: I can do anything I want. And so can you. They are in great danger.\n\nDJT: And look what we have. I love you people, I hear them a lot.\n\nF: Wake up, Donnie.\n\nDJT: Whatever you want to call it because there really is no name for it. It is - we call it, sometimes, tippy top special.\n\nF: 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds.\n\nDJT: Great, look at what's happening. Nothing's ever easy. It's - you see what's happening? Unbelievable.\n\nF: That is when the world will end. Closer -\n\nDJT: Thank you all for being here folks. Thank you. And now I'm going to come down, and we're going to watch this Roll. Thank you all, and have a great time. Thank you, Happy Easter. Thank you very much.\n\nF: Do you believe in time travel?\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nJeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nJS: I'm Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City, and this is episode 51 of Intercepted.\n\n[Ambulance sirens in Gaza.]\n\nJS: As I speak right now, hundreds of families in Gaza are continuing to mourn the death and injuries of their loved ones after Israeli forces opened fire on a crowd of demonstrators along the militarized border controlled by Israel.\n\nLast Friday, Israeli snipers and other soldiers began firing live ammunition and other lethal projectiles into the crowd. At least 17 people were killed; some were shot in the back or hit as they prayed. Many hundreds of other Palestinians were wounded.\n\nNewscaster: Palestinian medical officials say one of the dead was aged 16. Most of the casualties were struck by gunfire.\n\nIsrael's military responded by saying its troops had used \"riot dispersal means\" in firing towards main instigators.\n\nJS: The Gaza Strip is home to nearly 2 million Palestinians who are trapped in a 140-square-mile piece of land. They live under constant threat of Israeli bombings, incursions, drone strikes, and they suffer under a sweeping blockade that prevents even basic humanitarian and medical goods from getting into Gaza. Life inside Gaza has been consistently compared to living in an open-air prison. It's one of the most shameful ongoing episodes in the world. It's the very definition of collective punishment. And it's aided and abetted, and sometimes even cheered on, by the U.S. government, by lawmakers from both political parties, and backed up by powerful lobbying groups and special-interest coalitions.\n\nLast Friday, March 30, thousands of Palestinians began amassing at the Israeli border. They erected tents and other structures and planned to be there for more than a month of protest events. All of this was to mark Land Day.\n\nOn March 30th, 1976, six unarmed Palestinians, who were citizens of Israel, were killed as they protested Israel's seizing of Palestinian lands by force. Some 70 percent of Gazans are refugees from other parts of Palestine that had their land taken by Israel. And this year, the protesters marched under the banner of \"the great return.\" Their focus was on the right of return to their original homes and land.\n\nAnd the demonstrators knew that Israel was going to attack their demonstration by force. Israel had said as much in the days leading up to the protest. This is how Human Rights Watch, which is not exactly a radical organization, described the Israeli position on the demonstrations: \"In interviews given on March 28th, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of staff, Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot, announced that he would deploy 100 snipers to the Gaza border area to block 'mass infiltration' or damage to the border fence, saying that, 'The orders are to use a lot of force.' On March 29, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Arabic spokesman posted a video of a man shot in the leg, stating, 'This is the least that anyone who tries to cross the security fence between Gaza and Israel will face.'\n\n[Ambient of gun shot in Gaza.]\n\nOn the morning of March 30, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman tweeted in Arabic that, 'Anyone who approaches the border puts his life in jeopardy.'\" That from the Human Rights Watch report on this incident.\n\nWell true to its word, the Israeli military opened fire on the demonstrators, including with sharpshooters and snipers. As of this moment, the death toll is at 17 and the number of injured could be as high as 1,700 hundred people across Palestinian lands.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu praised the conduct of his soldiers and snipers, and the IDF spokesperson accused the demonstrators of, \"hurling burning tires, throwing Molotov cocktails and attempting to harm or destroy Israel security infrastructure.\"\n\nIsrael has said there will be no internal investigation and that Israel is not going to cooperate with any outside or international investigations, as both the United Nations and the European Union have called for. In the U.S., the reaction on Capitol Hill to this massacre of unarmed protesters who live trapped in a small slice of land surrounded by a nuclear power has largely been marked by silence or de facto support for Israel. Only one U.S. senator, Bernie Sanders, has said anything about the killings, and his statement was tepid given the numbers of dead and wounded.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders: My assessment is that Israel overreacted on that. But, again, the bottom line here is that the United States of America has got to be involved in dealing with the terrible tragedy in Gaza.\n\nJS: My colleague Mehdi Hasan wrote an excellent column this week for The Intercept; it's about the hypocrisy of so-called liberal interventionists.\n\nMehdi Hasan: So where is the outcry from liberal interventionists across the West? Where is the call from former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair for a no-fly zone over Gaza? Where is the moral outrage from former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, the famously pro-intervention, Pulitzer-prize-winning author of \"A Problem from Hell,\" which lamented U.S. inaction in Rwanda, over the sheer number of unarmed Palestinians shot killed and injured in recent days? Where are the righteously angry op-eds from Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times, or Richard Cohen of The Washington Post, or David Aaronovitch of the Times of London demanding concrete action against the human rights abuses of the IDF? And where is the appeal from former U.S. Secretary of State and arch-interventionist Madeleine Albright for economic and financial sanctions against the state of Israel, for an arms embargo, for travel bans on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman and IDF Chief of Staff General Gadi Eisenkot?\n\nTheir silence is deafening and telling. Palestinians, it seems have been so dehumanized that they don't deserve a humanitarian intervention. Their blood is cheap, their plight is unimportant and perhaps, above all else, their killers are our friends.\n\nJS: Those are the words of Mehdi Hasan writing in The Intercept.\n\nWe go now to Gaza where we're joined by a young nursing student named Yousef Mema. He is 24 years old, and he was at the massacre last Friday in Gaza. Yousef only has electricity for about four hours a day and our connection with him is unstable. His modem is running on batteries, so bear with us.\n\nYousef, thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\n\nYousef Mema: You are welcome. It's my duty.\n\nJS: So, let's begin. What happened on March 30th in Gaza?\n\nYM: So, we going to the borders of the Gaza Strip, rising and holding a Palestinian flag. We go to protest peacefully at the borders, there was a thousand of the Gazan people who were going to the borders to send a message to the world, as I said to you, to protest peacefully. And when I [went] I just witnessed the Israeli soldiers shooting fires toward the peaceful protestors at Gaza borders, and the Israeli snipers, they were behind Sandy Hill and they were full of weapons and guns. And they were shooting toward the peaceful protestors, and there were tens of injuries there, and the ambulances were transferring tens of injuries.\n\nJS: And did you see people who were killed in front of you?\n\nYM: Yes. He was away from me, about just 15 meters. Yeah. And [was] shot directly in the head. And he was just standing and he was away from the Israel soldiers. I don't know why the snipers shot him directly in the head.\n\nJS: What is the feeling right now in hospitals in Gaza?\n\nYM: My friends working in the hospitals, they explained the situation for me in the hospital: it was unimaginable because, you know, the hospital conditions, are very poor. And there was a lot of injuries inside the hospital and the medical section in Gaza Strip, in general, is poor because of the shortage of the medical supplements here. After giving them the medical care, they were directly were discharging them to their houses because they won't accept new injuries to the hospital.\n\nJS: And did you see any Palestinians with guns or rifles or weapons?\n\nYM: No. Never.\n\nJS: Were any Palestinians throwing Molotov cocktails, you know, on fire, at the Israelis, or rocks, or anything like that?\n\nYM: Molotovs, no. But I think some Palestinian young men, they were throwing just stones, small stones.\n\nJS: Why do you believe that Israel did this? That they killed so many people who were protesting inside of Gaza that had not crossed over? What do you think was Israel's purpose in shooting and killing these Palestinians?\n\nYM: Yeah, I think that Israel soldiers and snipers did this to the protestors to send [a] message to us as the Palestinians. They want to send [a] message to us to stop the protest at Gaza borders. They want to send us [a] message that \"your protest would not benefit you,\" and they want also to send [a] message to us that Palestine is not for us. It's a type of terrorizing us, and, as you know, this marching and the protest will make the outer world aware about our issues as Palestinians, who are living under occupation.\n\nThey, as I said to you, are terrorizing us, to make us stop about this protest. But we will continue, and we will make the outer world aware about what is going on here because we are living in Gaza and suffering daily. And on the other side, inside our occupied land, Palestine, or some people are calling it, Israel, they are having our land and enjoying the life. And we will continue in the protest until we get and achieve our rights.\n\nJS: My understanding is that Gaza is like being in a prison or a jail, that is open air. Describe what is it like to live in Gaza, on the Gaza strip right now, Yousef?\n\nYM: Yes, exactly, we are living in an open-air prison. Why? Because you know, all Gaza borders are controlled by Israel, from the land, and from the air, and from the sea, except one side is controlled by Egypt.\n\nThe fishermen are facing many problems in Gaza strip because they, all the Gaza Sea is controlled by Israeli warships, and our air is full of Israeli drones, and sometimes F-16s are flying over us, but Israel drones are holding professional camera and rockets, and [are] always flying over us, and they can target anyone they want.\n\nAnd, we just have four hours of electricity every 12 hours. This is simply part of the life.\n\nJS: Benjamin Netanyahu is praising the soldiers. He says they did a good job at the protest. What do you say about Netanyahu's words?\n\nYM: I say that this is a type of racism against us, as he is supporting his soldiers to kill more people, and this is a type of racism. Because all of the protesters were [peacefully] protesting at the borders, and asking for their rights to return.\n\nJS: In the United States, at this moment when I'm talking to you, only one U.S. senator, Bernie Sanders, has even mentioned this killing in Gaza. What is your message to the United States Congress right now?\n\nYM: Yeah, my message to the United States Congress is to stop supporting Israel and just to be - to stand up with us as a Palestinians and to support our issues and to stop supporting Israel with the money and with the weapons. They're killing us, they're killing innocent people there in Palestine, in Gaza.\n\nJS: Yousef, you're a student studying nursing. Why do you want to be a nurse?\n\nYM: I want to be a nurse, because it's about humanity, it's a humanitarian job. Because you know we are living in a place where there is always wounded and killing by Israelis. So, it is my duty to stand up with my people and offer all I can.\n\nJS: Well, both of my parents are nurses. My mother and my father are nurses.\n\nYM: Yeah, that's great!\n\nJS: And I thank you for choosing that path.\n\nYM: Thank you so much. I will do all my best to just to help my people.\n\nJS: Thank you so much, Yousef. Stay safe.\n\nYM: Thank you. You are welcome.\n\nJS: Ma'a salama.\n\nYM: Ma'a salama\n\nJS: Yousef Mema is a 24-year-old nursing student in Gaza. You can find him on Twitter @joo_gaza. That's @joo_gaza.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nJS: I'm sure all of us remember the horrors of June 12, 2016. It was Latin night at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. Many of the guests there that night were Latino, and as people danced and hung out with friends and partied, it was around 2 AM when the bartenders shouted out the last call.\n\nAs people began to down their final drinks and exit the club, a van pulled up. It was driven by a 29-year-old, off-duty private security guard. His name was Omar Mateen. He got out of the van and approached the club. He was heavily armed with a Sig Sauer semiautomatic rifle, a nine-millimeter Glock, both of which he had purchased legally.\n\nMateen almost immediately began spraying bullets at exiting club-goers. Dozens were killed or wounded, but the shooter didn't stop. He proceeded to enter the Pulse Nightclub and continue on with his massacre.\n\nIn the end, Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded nearly 60 others. During his rampage, Mateen called 9-1-1, and he reportedly swore allegiance to the Islamic State, and its leader Ab? Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\n911 Operator: 911. This line is being recorded.\n\nOmar Mateen: (speaking Arabic)\n\n911 Operator: What?\n\nOM: (speaking Arabic) I want to let you know I'm Orlando, and I did the shooting.\n\n911 Operator: What's your name?\n\nOM: My name is: I pledge allegiance to Ab? Bakr al Baghdadi of the Islamic State.\n\nJS: Mateen said that he was attacking the club to oppose U.S. wars in Syria and Iraq, and he told the negotiator that his demand was that the U.S. stop its bombing. Mateen had also posted these same sentiments on Facebook just hours before the shooting.\n\nOM: Well, you need to know that they need to stop bombing Syria and Iraq. The U.S. is collaborating with Russia, and they're killing innocent women and children, OK?\n\n911 Negotiator: I know what you're saying.\n\nOM: My homeboy Tameran Tsarnaev did his thing on the Boston Marathon; my homeboy [indistinct name] did his thing, so now it's my return. OK?\n\nJS: Almost immediately after news of the massacre began to spread, the dominant story that emerged was that Pulse had been targeted because it was a gay club. Pundits and so-called terrorism experts began tying it to ISIS's execution of gay people, and claimed that this was the reason Pulse was chosen.\n\nBrian Ross: Yet it is now clear he was attracted to gay men and gay nightclubs, including the very place he would target for his suicide attack, The Pulse, where employees and patrons said he was a regular, often seen cheering on the performers in drag. Mateen's interest in gay men goes back at least ten years. Yet somehow, Mateen, a Muslim, was drawn to ISIS, which preaches that homosexuality is punishable by death.\n\nJS: And then came reports that Mateen had been using apps like Grindr and Jack'd to find men to sleep with. A man who claimed to be a former lover of Omar Mateen's told media that Mateen chose Pulse to get revenge for being potentially exposed to HIV/AIDS by a Puerto Rican man with whom he had a sexual relationship.\n\nLaw enforcement officials not only categorized it as a terror attack but also as a hate crime. Even Donald Trump and Mike Pence and other anti-gay political figures, condemned the shooting as an attack on gay Americans, just like ISIS throwing gay people off of buildings.\n\nVice President Mike Pence: We have been praying for the victims and those that are recovering from injuries, family members, friends and loved ones, especially those in the LGBT community who have been victimized by this horrendous attack.\n\nReporter: Does this change your opinion on adding protections for LGBT Hoosiers?\n\nMP: I'm just deeply saddened at the loss of life. An attack on any American is an attack on every American. This was a terrorist attack.\n\nJS: This narrative about Mateen choosing Pulse because it was a gay club and the reports of his sexual orientation and previous visits to the club has all become part of the universally accepted narrative of this heinous act.\n\nBut there's a problem with this: It appears to be totally false. And the reason we know that is because of the U.S. government's attempt to prosecute Omar Mateen's wife as an accomplice.\n\nDuring the course of her defense at the trial last month, many of those claims fell completely apart and something extraordinary happened in the prosecution of Noor Salman, on charges that she had supported her husband's killing spree.\n\nThe FBI arrested her in January of 2017, and they claim that she had admitted to helping case the Pulse nightclub with her husband. FBI agents spent 17 hours interrogating her with no video recording, and they used her supposed confession to ask the court to hold Noor Salman without bond. And as a result, she was denied bail, and they charged her with providing material support to terrorism and obstruction of justice. And last month she went on trial.\n\nAnd here is what was extraordinary: Noor Salman was acquitted by a jury of 12 - acquitted of all charges. That almost never happens, where people charged with terrorism-related crimes in the U.S. are found not guilty. Just doesn't happen. In fact, it has only happened to other times since 9/11: two times out of more than 850 cases. The last time this happened was 12 years ago in 2006.\n\nIt became clear during Noor Salman's trial and her defense that so much of what the public was told about this case was not true.\n\nMy colleague Glenn Greenwald has done some really important work on this case and he joins me now. Glenn, welcome back to Intercepted.\n\nGlenn Greenwald: Thank you for having me, Jeremy.\n\nJS: Now, a lot of information came to public light that calls into question almost every aspect of the Pulse nightclub shooting, except the fact that these people are dead and Omar Mateen was the shooter. Number one: That Omar Mateen had previously been to the Pulse nightclub. Number two: that he intended to shoot up the Pulse nightclub because of his hatred of gay people.\n\nYour reporting and then the evidence that was presented, or has come out as a result of this prosecution, calls those key assertions, which continue to this moment to be viewed as the kind of dominant narrative on what happened at the Pulse nightclub, your reporting, and the trial showed what, Glenn?\n\nGG: On the two questions that you just raised - namely, one: whether he had ever been to Pulse, or, for that matter, any other gay bar ever in his life; and number two, whether or not he went to Pulse with the intention of murdering LGBTs - everybody is in agreement - the prosecutors, the FBI, his lawyers, all the journalists who sat through the trial, who looked at the evidence, that neither of those things is true.\n\nI thought for a year and a half, as just kind of a casual observer, until I started doing reporting on this, that that was why he chose Pulse. It seemed obvious. It was a very easy narrative to believe. We're constantly told that Muslims hate gay people, especially ones who are radicalized by ISIS.\n\nBut the thing that made me start wondering was if you looked at all the reports about what he said, I mean the shooting went on for like hours, and he was talking to hostage negotiators, multiple calls with police and 9/11, no one ever said he ever uttered a word about gay people during the shooting. He wasn't saying, \"I'm killing you because you're morally warped,\" or \"deviant,\" or \"because you're homos\" or \"faggots\" or anything like that, not a syllable of homophobia from him. Everything was \"I'm doing this because your government is murdering innocent Muslim children and women.\" So already, that to me seemed like a pretty big red flag.\n\nAnd then the evidence uncovered during the trial showed that his real target were Disney properties. He had cased multiple Disney properties on the night of the shooting, he had gone to Disney Springs, which is this elaborate shopping complex and tourist attraction, but found it too fortified to attack. And the only reason he ended up at Pulse was because he then said: You know what? Since I can't shoot a mall or a complex or a tourist attraction, I'm going to just pick a nightclub. And he went to Google, and he entered \"nightclub downtown Orlando.\" Not \"gay nightclub,\" not \"LGBT nightclub,\" just \"nightclub Orlando.\" And the very first result, if you do that, was Pulse, and that's where he went.\n\nSo, the evidence is really overwhelming that his targets were non-LGBT related, that he ended up at Pulse for the first time that night by virtue of a Google search that had nothing to do with LGBTs, or any of the other things that we were all led to believe by media accounts, most of which ended up being debunked by investigators.\n\nJS: There are two aspects to this that really also piqued my interest. One is that Omar Mateen worked for a very large, global private security, some would say mercenary, company, G4S, as a security guard, and was known to wear NYPD and other law enforcement gear. And his father, Omar Mateen's father, Siddique Mateen, he was an FBI informant going back to 2005.\n\nWhat can you tell us about those two facts?\n\nGG: So, when the Pulse attack happened it was revealed shortly thereafter that the FBI had twice investigated Omar Mateen for possible terrorism ties because he was boasting of being part of terrorist groups to co-workers at the security firm that you referenced. And, at the time, people were criticizing the FBI for not having arrested him preemptively. And I found myself in the very strange position of defending the FBI, it's something I don't think I've ever done in my entire life. I actually wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post saying: We can't expect and shouldn't want the FBI to go around arresting anybody who has ever uttered a radical thought in their life, because that has a really dangerous potential and a bad history.\n\nBut as it turns out, there was a lot more to it than that. His father, as you said, was working as an FBI informant, directly with the FBI, 2005 to 2016. They never told anybody that. They decided they were going to call Siddique Mateen to the stand because they wanted him to testify in ways they thought would help convict Noor Salman. But had they done that, the defense would've found out that he was an FBI informant, so they decided they weren't going to call him, and they took them off the list because they wanted to prevent anybody from knowing that he was an FBI informant.\n\nNear the end of the trial, sort of in the middle, the defense discovered for the first time that he was an FBI informant, and they were furious because there's a lot of theories they should have pursued and would have pursued, had they known that - including: Is Siddique Mateen the person who helped his son carry out the attack on Pulse and they were scapegoating Noor Salman? Is the reason the FBI chose not to arrest Omar Mateen was because his father intervened on the behalf of his son to have the FBI not arrest him? There's evidence that the FBI was talking to Siddique about the investigation into his son at the time that they decided not to arrest him or go forward with the investigation. So there was a lot of really interesting aspects that never got explored, because just as was true of the FBI's conclusion that she never went to Pulse, the FBI also, or the DOJ also, concealed from the court and from her lawyers that the father was working directly with the FBI.\n\nOne last point about the father: The FBI actually opened a criminal investigation into the father because they had received tips that he was sending money to Afghanistan and Turkey with the intention of having an attack launched on the government of Pakistan. He's ethnically Afghan. And so, they opened a criminal investigation once they found money transfers in his name both to Afghanistan and Turkey, as these tips had revealed, leading the defense to wonder: Was the real radical the father? Was he the one who helped Omar Mateen carry out the attack, and that's the reason why they decided to prosecute Noor Salman, to protect their own informant?\n\nJS: We have so many cases where the FBI's own informants are essentially the go-betweens for the FBI and then unsuspecting, in many cases, Muslims and it's the FBI informant who, you know, at the spurring of the FBI, is actually, sort of, the one creating the plot.\n\nAnd so, it seems like it would be very significant to understand, and I understand we don't have that information right now, but it's significant to understand how Siddique Mateen's relationship began with the FBI?\n\nGG: Yeah. It's a really great question. I've written about before how the way that I became so devoted to writing about civil liberties, and particularly the attack on the civil liberties of American Muslims in the wake of 9/11 was that I went around in that era to a lot of Muslim communities and constantly heard from Muslims that when someone new at the mosque showed up, instead of being able to welcome them and be hospitable and embrace them the way that most religions call for, and certainly Islam, they instead assumed that the new person was sent by the FBI to infiltrate their communities and to try and manipulate and trick them into saying and doing things that the FBI could use to prosecute them.\n\nJS: You know, you cite, Glenn, in some of your reporting on the Noor Salman case, this major investigation that is ongoing at The Intercept, this \"Trial and Terror,\" where our publication collected and analyzed the profiles of 850 terrorism defendants that have been prosecuted by the Department of Justice since 9/11. And, I mean, the big picture of this is that the U.S. has prosecuted 850 people on terrorism since 9/11, and the overwhelming majority of them never even got close to committing an act of violence, and just two of the people that have been prosecuted, just two of them have been acquitted, three have had their charges dropped or dismissed, but the vast majority of them have been quickly convicted, usually through plea agreements.\n\nGG: So, it's interesting, because I didn't realize this until the jury acquitted her, I found myself in a state of utter shock that justice had been served. Because even though the more I reported on this story, the more I came to believe, vehemently, that not only was she not guilty but that it was one of the most - it was one of the weakest and most dubious prosecutions I had seen in a long time. But I nonetheless just assumed that she would be found guilty because she's a Muslim in the United States judicial system charged with terrorism-related offenses and Muslims charged with terrorism have no chance in the American justice system, as our database demonstrates. Virtually no chance.\n\nJS: Well, you know, I find it also really important to discuss how the broader public, all of us, I think - I would assume you and I are in that camp, too - when this shooting happened, and it was at a gay nightclub, it seemed like it combined both the kind of threat of terrorism, but also the fact that the LGBTQ community is under constant attack already in this country, including from the highest levels of power in this country, namely Vice President Mike Pence and his ilk. And now to have that fall apart, I've seen people, even though you're showing the proof, Glenn, I see people saying, \"No, it had to have been motivated by his hatred of gay people.\"\n\nGG: Obviously, just as a journalist, I think it's important if there is a pervasive myth believed by the public that's false to correct it in an important case. But in this particular case, I thought it was extra important because there is this really insidious effort on the part of people in the West to campaign against Muslims and try to spread anti-Muslim animus to argue that being Muslim is incompatible with being a Westerner.\n\nBill Maher: Vast numbers of Muslims across the world believe, and they do, that humans deserve to die for merely holding a different idea or drawing a cartoon or writing a book or eloping with the wrong person. Not only does the Muslim world have something in common with ISIS, it has too much in common with ISIS.\n\nGG: Interestingly the people who do that have the same view as ISIS, and our colleague Murtaza Hussain has written about this before, that the strategy of ISIS is to eliminate what they call \"the gray zone\" which is where Muslims integrate into the West. They kind of feel like they have one foot in the Muslim world, one foot in the Western world - to make that impossible, to drive a wedge so that you either have to choose: You're Muslim or you're Western, and there's an incompatibility.\n\nThere's a big group in the West who hate Muslims who also try and create that framework. And this Pulse attack and the false narrative that arose from it was the perfect weapon to promote that narrative.\n\nDJT: Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country and who suppress women, gays, and anyone else who doesn't share their views or values.\n\nGG: It was saying: \"Look, all of you liberals who have been resistant to the idea that Muslims and Islam in the West are a threat to your values, here's the perfect proof.\"\n\nDJT: They enslave women and they murder gays. I don't want them in our country.\n\nGG: They didn't go and they didn't attack a conservative synagogue or the Pentagon. They went in attacked, you know, kind of one of the most sacred places for American liberalism, which is the meeting place, a safe space for LGBTs, and, I mean, I know as a gay man I had a kind of visceral reaction to it that way also. And very much that was exploited on purpose.\n\nDJT: Ask yourself: Who is really the friend of women, and the LB - and LGBT community? Donald Trump with actions or Hillary Clinton with her words? I will tell you who the better friend is. And someday, I believe that will be proven out - bigly.\n\nGG: And that's why I thought it was so important to debunk what had been this very damaging falsehood because it just isn't true that that's why he chose to do the attack. What really motivated him was the same thing that motivates most people who engage in violence against the West in the name of jihad or radical Islam or allegiance to ISIS, which is anger over 17 years of American killing of innocent Muslim women and children and men in the Muslim world.\n\nJS: Well, you know, it reminds me, Glenn, of a case that I've written about and you also have written about, and that is the 2009 Fort Hood shooting where you had this U.S. Army Major named Nidal Hasan who opened fire on his fellow soldiers and others on the base, back in November of 2009. Thirteen people were killed there, more than 30 others were injured, and he was convicted in the military court of premeditated murder and he was sentenced to death in August of 2013.\n\nWhat's interesting about that case is that, again, it's been portrayed as \"Oh this is an al Qaeda sympathizer or a guy that said he was a soldier of Allah that just opened fire on these infidel forces.\"\n\nNewscaster: The FBI says Major Hasan first came to the attention of intelligence officials in December 2008, when he reached out to Anwar al Awlaki, an American-born cleric who now lives in Yemen.\n\nInvestigators say the two traded 10 to 20 Internet messages over a number of months. But the communications appeared to benign, with Hasan asking for help on a research paper, studying the effects of war on Muslim-American soldiers and Awlaki responding with spiritual guidance.\n\nJS: When in reality if you know anything about Nidal Hasan's background, he was a psychiatrist. Nidal Hasan was seeing soldiers who were coming back from the U.S. wars abroad, particularly in Afghanistan, and he listened to the stories of these soldiers that he was treating as a psychiatrist and heard what he believed were confessions to war crimes.\n\nNewscaster: This morning near the Palestinian town of Ramallah, Hasan's uncle told CBS News his nephew was deeply affected by his work treating soldiers returning from war zones.\n\nRafik Hamad: In fact, one time he told me about one of his patients. Describing his situation to me, I saw the tears come from his eyes.\n\nJS: He then tried to notify his superiors. He said that under certain military laws, you are allowed to refer specific certain criminal matters, and he wanted to do that. He was told to stand down. And in fact in his writings, his own writings, he describes his utter frustration and hopelessness facing all of these stories of war crimes and nothing being done about them.\n\nNow, that doesn't justify, by any means, what he did that day in Fort Hood by killing 13 people. At the same time, that's an important fact to understand if our real goal in understanding this is to try to reduce terrorism or trying to understand why people may want to commit those kinds of acts.\n\nAnd yet when you try to say that, it's \"Oh, you're defending the Fort Hood shooter.\" Or, \"Oh, you're defending the Pulse nightclub shooter.\" No, but facts actually matter, especially to those of us who have been trying to crack the code on how we might be able to hit a reset button with huge parts of the Muslim world based on American foreign policy and support for Israel.\n\nGG: For me, that is the whole critical point of this Pulse case, and virtually every case of so-called terrorism against the United States for the last 17 years, and the entire War on Terror. If you remember, starting immediately after 9/11, the number one propagandistic goal of the U.S. government and then the U.S. media was to conceal the actual grievances expressed in the Muslim world that led to 9/11.\n\nSo, after 9/11, people in America wanted to know one thing, quite reasonably: Why do they hate us? That was the question that sort of became a cliché because it was so widely asked: Why do they hate us so much that they would just want to destroy two of our biggest civilian skyscrapers, and fly planes into buildings, and all of these things?\n\nPresident George W. Bush: Americans are asking, \"Why do they hate us?\" They hate what they see right here in this chamber: a democratically elected government. Their leaders are self-appointed. They hate our freedoms: Our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.\n\nGG: And the real reasons for it were things that people like David Frum, and Dick Cheney, and Bill Kristol, and Donald Rumsfeld were petrified for people to know, which is: We're interfering in the Muslim world, we have bases all over the land that they consider sacred, we starved hundreds of thousands of people with sanctions in Iraq, we have supported Israeli aggression against numerous Arab countries, including the Palestinians. These were all the grievances articulated by al Qaeda, and those weren't allowed to be aired. So they had to invent a fictitious narrative which became: They hate us for our freedoms. They don't want women to be able to walk around unveiled. They hate gays. They hate freedom of speech, freedom of religion. That became the fiction that was designed to suppress the actual truth of what the case expressed in the media or in the Muslim countries were about what their grievance was against the United States.\n\nTo this day that remains the number one propagandistic goal. And so, when Omar Mateen spends hours saying: The reason I'm doing this is in retaliation to your killing Muslim, innocent civilians in Syria, and Iraq, and Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen - none of that makes the media narrative. Instead, we hear he did it because Muslims hate gays, even though he never uttered a syllable about that and it turned out to be totally false.\n\nSo that is really the goal of why these myths persist, is because if we did stop and think about it, we would realize that the policies we're supporting in the name of stopping terrorism, constantly bombing the Muslim world, locking up people up without due process, all of that, are actually the things that are fueling terrorism more than anything else and the people who say that are the people who keep engaging in these attacks.\n\nJS: Alright, we're going to leave it there. Glenn Greenwald, thanks so much for being with us on Intercepted.\n\nGG: Thank you for having me. Appreciate it.\n\nJS: Glenn Greenwald is my fellow co-founder of The Intercept. Make sure to check out all of the reporting that Glenn and Murtaza Hussain have done on this case. You can find it at theintercept.com.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nComing soon from The Intercept: \"Evening at the Talk House,\" new audio drama from playwright and actor Wallace Shawn.\n\nWallace Shawn: Why are things different? I want the old days back. Where are they?\n\n[\"Evening at the Talk House\" promo.]\n\nJS: We're really looking forward to sharing this radio drama with our listeners in two weeks. If you become an Intercepted sustaining member today, you will get early access to the play and also the chance to participate in an online Q&A with the play's writer and one of its stars.\n\nI'm talking about Wally Shawn. You may know Wally from \"The Princess Bride.\"\n\nThe Man in Black: You guessed wrong.\n\nWallace Shawn (as Vizzini in \"The Princess Bride\"): You only think I guessed wrong. That's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned! Ha, ha, you fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is: Never get involved in a land war in Asia. But only slightly less-well-known is this: Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line (laughs).\n\nJS: Maybe you know Wally as the dinosaur in \"Toy Story.\"\n\nWallace Shawn (as Rex in \"Toy Story\"): Were dinosaurs hot-blooded, or were they cold-blooded? I'm overwrought with anxiety over this issue. I mean, what temperature was their blood? There's even a third camp that theorizes that larger designers may have been born hot-blooded, and after growing to a sufficient size, they suddenly switched to cold-blooded. Who am I supposed to believe?\n\nJS: Well, this is the real deal, Wally Shawn. Don't miss it. If you're already a sustaining member, don't worry: You already have your place reserved and you are going to get this play ahead of time. If not, go to theintercept.com/join, sign up and you'll get early access to the play and a chance to ask Wally your questions during a live, online chat on April 12th at 7 PM EST. Once you become a sustaining member, we will send you info on all of this.\n\nIf you can't afford to become a sustaining member, don't worry: We're going to be making the play and the Q&A available after the sneak preview for sustaining members.\n\nDJT: We are going to be doing some things, I've been speaking with General Mattis. We're going to be doing things militarily. Until we can have a wall with proper security, we're going to be guarding our border with the military. It's a big step. We really haven't done that before, certainly not very much before.\n\nJS: Donald Trump has consistently shown the world, and the United States, that he has very little understanding of the Constitution and U.S. laws. There are technical ways in which Trump can legally deploy the U.S. military on the border with Mexico. Trump is definitely wrong about some of his assertions: Barack Obama used the military in some capacity on that border, as did George W. Bush. There are other exceptions, as well, throughout American history.\n\nBut what Trump is proposing sounds to be of a much larger scale and duration. And he says he's sending the military to the border until his atrocious border wall gets built. Now, that may never happen, by the way, and if the purpose of deploying the U.S. military is to snatch people who cross the border, that sounds a lot like a law enforcement activity, and that is a generally banned activity for the military to conduct inside of the United States.\n\nDepending on what Trump actually authorizes, this deployment of the U.S. military to the border could result in legal challenges based on the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. It was updated in the 1950s and again in 1981. This move is the latest in a series of potentially far-reaching edicts that have been issued by Trump and his administration that seek to change some fundamental realities on immigration, on mass incarceration, on police shootings of unarmed people, and on and on. Trump has gone so far as to imply that drug dealers should be executed as they are in his Rodrigo Duterte's Philippines.\n\nDJT: We have pushers and we have drug dealers that don't - I mean, they kill hundreds and hundreds of people and most of them don't even go to jail. You know, if you shoot one person, they give you life; they give you the death penalty.\n\nThese people can kill 2000, 3000 people, and nothing happens to them. And we need strength with respect to the pushers and to the drug dealers. Some countries have a very, very tough penalty - the ultimate penalty. And, by the way, they have much less of a drug problem than we do.\n\nJS: Since Attorney General Jeff Sessions entered office, he has been methodically reversing policies aimed at reducing mass incarceration. Last May, Sessions ordered federal prosecutors to go after defendants in cases with a passion and to hit them with the most serious charges possible.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions: Going forward, I have empowered our prosecutors to charge and pursue the most serious offense, as I believe the law requires. It means that we're going to meet our responsibility to enforce the law with judgment and fairness. It is simply the right and moral thing to do.\n\nJS: Jeff Sessions intent was clear: He wants to wipe out an Obama-era policy instructing prosecutors to avoid criminal charges for nonviolent or low-level drug offenses that could trigger mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nWhat does this mean in practical terms? It means that a judge must almost always give the mandatory minimum sentence to anyone convicted on charges brought by the prosecutor. And the sentences can be very lengthy. Enacted in 1986, federal mandatory minimum sentencing laws in drug cases can range from five to forty years, and from ten years to life in prison.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions: Charging and sentencing recommendations are bedrock responsibilities of any prosecutor, and I trust our prosecutors in the field to make good judgments. They deserve to be un-handcuffed, and not micromanaged from Washington.\n\nJS: Mandatory minimum sentences are one of the main reasons that the U.S. incarcerates many more people than any other country in the world. There are about 2.3 million people held in the American criminal justice system, and one in five are locked up for drug offenses.\n\nWhile Jeff Sessions may be turning back the clock toward 1980s-era, tough on crime policies, there are district attorneys across this country pushing back and using the powers of their offices as the chief prosecutors in their communities to implement criminal justice reform. Now that may seem odd, considering the traditional role and relationship that district attorney's offices have had in implementing the very policies that have led to this horrible state that the criminal justice system is in today. Prosecutors are generally a key part of criminal justice reform since they ultimately decide who to prosecute and what to charge them with. But they can also instruct their deputies not to prosecute certain crimes.\n\nAs of 2016, more than 70 percent of district attorneys in the United States ran for reelection unopposed - meaning they've just sailed from term to term without being challenged. But that's changing now. From Philadelphia to Texas, a new wave of prosecutors are being elected, and they're already shaking up the status quo.\n\nPhiladelphia's new district attorney, Larry Krasner, won his election in 2017 in a landslide.\n\nDistrict Attorney Larry Krasner: This is a story about a movement, and this is a movement that is tired of seeing a system that has systemically picked on poor people, primarily black and brown people. [Audience cheers.] This is mandate for a movement that is loudly telling government what it wants, and what it wants is criminal justice reform in ways that require transformational change within the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office.\n\nJS: Jeff Sessions may be the attorney general, but in communities across this country, district attorneys are subverting his attempts to keep draconian prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Voters in California are going to head to the polls in June and, in some communities, there is going to be a serious fight over who is going to set the tone for prosecutions, and sentences and criminal justice reform in communities across the state.\n\nI am joined now by two candidates for district attorney in California. Geneviéve Jones-Wright is running for San Diego County district attorney. She's currently a deputy public defender.\n\nAnd I'm also joined by civil rights attorney Pamela Price. She's running for Alameda County district attorney - that includes Oakland and much of the East Bay.\n\nWelcome, both of you, to Intercepted.\n\nGeneviéve Jones-Wright: Hello! Thank you so much for having me.\n\nPamela Price: Thank you for having me as well.\n\nJS: Geneviéve, for people that don't normally vote in their district attorney elections or have no clue what the district attorney does, explain why it is important for people in communities across this country to care about who their district attorney is?\n\nGJW: The DA makes the decisions on who is charged with what crimes, when, how and even why. And so the flip side of that is: The district attorney has the decision-making abilities to not charge, and they are in charge of making those decisions with very, very little oversight.\n\nIt is important for everyone to vote for their district attorney because the DA touches the lives of every single community member. Even if you've never been justice involved, you may have had a family member, or a neighbor, a friend, someone - we all know someone who's been justice involved. They are justice involved because of the discretion that was exercised by the district attorney. And how the case would be resolved, in whether there was a plea bargain that was offered, whether there was diversion as an option, all of these things come into play through the power of the district attorney.\n\nJS: Pamela Price, why are you running for district attorney in Alameda County?\n\nPP: Because I've dedicated my life for the last 27 years as a civil rights lawyer, fighting against racial inequities, fighting for gender equality and civil rights. And our county is desperate for police accountability, and we have tremendous racial disparities in our criminal justice system. And we voted overwhelmingly for criminal justice reform. And our current district attorney is out of sync with the electorate.\n\nIn Alameda County, black people are 20 times more likely to be incarcerated than a white person. Black folks are less than 12 percent of the population in Alameda County, but we are 50 percent of the people on parole or probation and 49 percent of the people in the Santa Rita County Jail.\n\nBlack children are less than 11 percent of this county's population, but they are 53 percent of all felony arrests. The record that we have from the district attorney is that when you are arrested in Alameda County, you have a 93 percent chance of being charged with something. Most of the people who are charged with something are black or brown people. Most of them cannot afford to post bail. Most of them are ultimately compelled to plead guilty to something. And so we have a criminal justice system that not only over-criminalizes and decimates black and brown communities, and poor communities, but it has been happening for the entire time that the incumbent has been a part of that office.\n\nJS: Geneviéve, you are running in San Diego County and your opponent, Summer Stephan, has been endorsed by local law enforcement associations, some, even, establishment Democrats. What would the district attorney's office under your leadership look like?\n\nGJW: It will look more balanced. I would bring a cultural shift and a change in the mentality to the district attorney's office, here, that is very much needed. We have a district attorney's office that has been completely out of touch with the voters and the will of San Diegans, and as a person who's been involved in the justice system as a defense attorney for many years - all of my career - I will bring a much-needed perspective that the current administration doesn't have and can't offer because they are entrenched as prosecutors, and they have a certain mentality that doesn't take into account the people that they're actually supposed to represent.\n\nAnd so when you talk about her having law enforcement endorsements, that goes to the heart of it. On her website, I'm not sure she's taken this down yet, but she has a banner that says she's law enforcement choice. Well, we need a district attorney in San Diego County that's going to represent the people whose names we file complaints in. And so that's the biggest difference, is that I'm going to end the win at all costs. Justice is not about winning or losing. And that's what this DA's office currently represents. I will change that.\n\nJS: Pamela, you have a ten-point platform. Number one: End mass incarceration; number two: stop criminalizing our youth; number three: eliminate use of the death penalty; four: protect immigrant communities; five: hold police accountable.\n\nI want to stop on that one and ask you: All of these shootings that we see of a lot of young black males, most recently we have the Stephon Clark shooting, how do you take that on and still win election, in any meaningful way, how do you take on these police killings of, many times, unarmed young black men?\n\nPP: In Alameda County, it is, in fact, the will of the people to hold police officers accountable. I have said over and over again, I will hold bad cops accountable for bad acts. And we have found that this is a community that is desperate for police accountability. We have had our own legacy of killing of unarmed black men, as well as unarmed people in our community.\n\nRight now, we have a situation where a young, 16-year-old girl was in a car riding with a 19-year-old person who apparently was wanted by the police, and in their overzealous efforts to apprehend him, she was shot five times with rifles by our local police department. And while that case was under investigation by our district attorney, the district attorney accepted a $10,000 contribution from the Fremont Police Officers Association. It just happened that one of the officers who engaged in this murder of this young girl is the president of the Fremont Police Officers Association.\n\nAnd so, we have a tremendous disconnect between what justice should look like and what ethical conduct should look like in our relationship with local law enforcement. Oakland has been under a negotiated settlement agreement for over 13 years, and we have never had adequate accountability over the Oakland Police Department.\n\nAs the new district attorney, I will enforce the requirement in the negotiated settlement agreement that Oakland report any allegations of officer misconduct to the district attorney's office within 24 hours. That mandate, that requirement has not been enforced. It will be enforced under my administration, and it will be expanded to include all law enforcement agencies throughout Alameda County.\n\nJS: Geneviéve, on that same issue, when we've seen district attorneys or the justice system spit out indictments of police officers or when there are attempts to get justice in some of these cases, it seems like the outcome has become predictable: Either nothing is going to happen to the officers, or they'll have some kind of desk duty or suspension. Maybe they'll get fired. Is there anything you can do to change that reality and to criminally hold officers accountable when they conduct these unjustified shootings, particularly of on unarmed people?\n\nGJW: Yes. I believe that the first step is actually being willing to hold officers accountable, and that has not been the case in San Diego. Between 2005 and 2015, there were 155 officer-involved shootings, and for each of those officer-involved shootings, the district attorney's office here has said that they were all justified.\n\nSo let's just think about those odds: We have not had a district attorney here who was willing to take the first step in asking the necessary questions in investigations, and to stand and say, \"I will hold everyone accountable under the law, even when you wear a badge.\" So, unfortunately, even after 2015, we've seen more officer-involved shootings here in San Diego. They haven't stopped.\n\nAnd about a month ago the current, interim DA had a press conference where she lumped in four officer-involved shootings all together, justified all four, and they all involved sheriff deputies.\n\nJonathon Coronel was shot by a sheriff's deputy. This deputy was found to have fired at least 16 rounds into Mr. Coronel. The medical examiner stated that Coronel's body had 22 bullet wounds in his body. This was deemed justified, even though Mr. Coronel was lying prone on his stomach when he was shot. He was unarmed.\n\nAnd 11 months before shooting Mr. Coronel, this same sheriff's deputy shot and killed another young man. And it was round after round after round fired into both of these young men. These deaths have all been determined to be justified.\n\nSo, the very first step is we need someone in the DA's office who's willing to hold officers accountable. We have to have that desire. We need an independent unit established in the DA's office that will review all allegations of excessive force, whether or not it is a fatal shooting or not. We need a unit that is independent from the DA's office where it is not deputy DAs who are in court every single day with these officers they have personal connections. Someone that would be independent so that we can have a transparent process so that when we have allegations of misconduct, whatever it is, and it relates to law enforcement, we're willing to look at those things.\n\nAnd so I think we also have to be amenable to asking the AG to review whatever decisions come out of that unit because we want to make sure that the public understands and trusts the process, and that has not been happening in San Diego. And so, I think that that is something that is absolutely important.\n\nJS: Pamela Price, Larry Krasner who won, shocking to a lot of people, won in a landslide election to become the district attorney of Philadelphia. And he is implementing as the DA in Philadelphia many of the policy changes that you and Genevieve have been laying out here. He also is meeting a lot of resistance from Philadelphia police and other law enforcement entities in his city.\n\nIf you're setting the policies as DA on what you're going to prosecute and what you're not going to prosecute, for instance, minor possession charges of drugs, but the police keep ticketing it, what do you do in that situation if the police basically say, \"All right, Pam. We get it. You campaigned. You made all these promises, but here's how it works really in our streets, and these are crimes that we are going to continue to ticket these crimes, and we will battle you if you try to drop these prosecutions.\"\n\nPP: Bring it on. I'm ready. We are not going to tolerate that in Alameda County. The people of Alameda County are going to expect officers to follow the constitution, to comply with the policies that they have voted overwhelmingly for. This county has voted overwhelmingly for criminal justice reform.\n\nCalifornia is a sanctuary state and we're going to require our law enforcement agencies in Alameda County to respect and follow that policy. California has legalized marijuana. We are not going to tolerate the flaunting of the law. I am not going to tolerate that as the new district attorney. So I am prepared to, if necessary, do battle with officers who do not respect the law. I am prepared to partner with officers who do respect the law, who do respect the will of the people and who are, in fact, committed to protect and serve this community.\n\nJS: Geneviéve Jones-Wright, on the issue of undocumented immigrants, sanctuary cities and this mass crackdown that we're seeing now from ICE agents across the country, what would be your posture on undocumented immigrants who would come into courts that you are running the show in as the district attorney?\n\nGJW: San Diego is home to about 200,000 undocumented immigrants, and I believe it is our responsibility to protect our community members, whether they are documented or undocumented.\n\nTo that point, I do not believe that ICE has a place in our courthouses. I would work to keep immigration agents out of our courthouses because it has an adverse effect. We can never gain the trust of community members if community members feel that they're being targeted. I believe wholeheartedly that our courthouses should be safe havens and they should be sanctuaries. They should be places where community members feel comfortable and welcomed to come and support family members who are just as involved. As well, they should be able to come in as witnesses, and the victims of crimes, and stand up to the perpetrators of those crimes.\n\nThat will not happen when we allow for immigration agents to come into our courthouses. Here in San Diego, all over the county, in North County and down in South County, we are seeing that immigration agents are taking people off the streets in front of their children while they are crying, simply because they left out of their apartment doors and went to the store or went to pay rent. This cannot happen. ICE agents are in our jails. And so, clients of mine who thought they were walking out as they were released were met by ICE agents who then took them into custody and detained them. And then bench warrants went forth because no one knew they were going to be deported.\n\nAnd so this is what happens when we have ICE in our courthouses and in our jails - it alienates a whole community where folks will not feel comfortable, no matter what the law says, to cooperate and speak with law enforcement about crimes that are happening in their communities, things that they have witnessed, and it creates this underworld where perpetrators of crimes know who they can target. And so it has an adverse effect on public safety and having safe communities.\n\nJS: Pamela, you are also running in a race against an incumbent, Nancy O'Malley, and her campaign would say, you know, she has a long public record and that she is pushing for many of the same criminal justice reforms as you, including diversion programs instead of convictions, and taking on the cash bail system. Why was it necessary for you to run against Nancy O'Malley, and what would be different about your time as DA versus what we already know of hers?\n\nPP: So, my opponent is now painting herself as a progressive reformer, change agent. But that has not been her legacy. Nancy O'Malley was raised by the Contra Costa County district attorney. Her father was the DA of Contra Costa County for 16 years. She came to Alameda County. She served as the chief deputy district attorney under Tom Orloff, who was someone that fought our community, who prosecuted the Black Panther Party, who was against criminal justice reform.\n\nNancy O'Malley is an executive board member and a leader in the California District Attorneys Association, which has actively advocated and campaigned against criminal justice reform, both in litigation as well as in our state assembly, in our state legislature.\n\nNancy O'Malley's leadership has been focused on one piece, one small piece, of sex trafficking. But the kinds of racial disparities that have been tolerated, encouraged and taken root in our criminal justice system have never been addressed by Nancy O'Malley, and our community deserves a better, more compassionate form of justice.\n\nWe have to look at the whole community. We have thousands of people whose lives have been thrown away by mass incarceration.\n\nJS: Geneviéve, what has driven you to make the decisions you've made to become a public defender - you're now deputy public defender - and this race for district attorney? How did you get to this place?\n\nGJW: So, when I was in fourth grade, I learned about Justice Thurgood Marshall, and there I decided that I would be just like him and I would use the law to make our nation better and to make our world better.\n\nI actually wanted to be a prosecutor when I was in high school, because of the OJ Simpson trial. And it was because I have a sincere desire to bring justice to victims and I felt that the prosecutors, in that case, failed to do that through their own inabilities. And, at the same time, I had a war inside of myself because of the community where I lived in and where I grew up. It created this conflict where I believe in justice, I believe that victims should have justice done in their name and on their behalf, but every time I saw a police officer in my community, or when we talked about going to court or a prosecutor in my neighborhood, it was nothing that was positive.\n\nAnd so, early on I decided that I couldn't be a tool in the mass incarceration machine. That was something that was solidified even in law school when I interviewed for prosecutorial agencies around the country. And so the first time that I ever took a case was as a student attorney in law school, at Howard Law, and I really fell in love with this idea of bringing justice and fairness to indigent people who were charged with crimes.\n\nBut I'm running for district attorney because I still want to bring justice to victims. I want to give voice to the people who are very vulnerable and marginalized. And unfortunately, because the way the justice system is set up and structured at this point, that includes the people who are defendants as well. And so we have to think about: How do we bring dignity to the process and ensure fairness and justice for every single person? Because everyone has rights in this system, and yet some of these rights are not being respected, they're being trampled on. And so the only way that I can see that change locally in San Diego, where I am and where I serve my community, is to be the district attorney. So I can ensure fairness and justice all throughout the process for everyone involved.\n\nJS: Pamela Price, in reading about your background, it seems like your entire life you've been in struggles that in some way or another are connected to the justice system, from foster care to juvenile justice systems and then your own legal battles as a young, single mother in an abusive relationship. How did you get to this point today where you are running to be the district attorney of Alameda County?\n\nPP: As you pointed out, my whole life I've been involved, really, as a civil rights activists from the moment that Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated. My life changed. I was both traumatized and radicalized. I got arrested when I was 13 years old in a civil rights demonstration. And I made it, literally from the streets of Cincinnati to Yale College, by the grace of God. And I've just been, my life has been going forward every step of the way I've had these experiences, not all of them good that have shaped my understanding of the law.\n\nI, like Geneviéve, have a compassion for people, for the disenfranchised, for the disinherited. My mom always knew that I was going to fight for the underdog, and so that's what I've been doing my whole life. As a civil rights lawyer, that was my passion and I was literally living my making, to represent kids and people who were victims, of state violence, sometimes, or people who were experiencing discrimination and injustices in their employment.\n\nMy decision to run for district attorney was a process whereby I became an advocate on behalf of victims of sex trafficking; particularly the young woman who was sex trafficked in the Bay Area by law enforcement. That triggered me to get involved in district attorney accountability because I thought who can hold officers accountable but the district attorney in this moment? And so, it didn't take law for me to realize that this is the moment, where I am called to do something that seemed completely unlikely to me in 1968.\n\nJS: Well, Pamela Price we're going to continue to follow your campaign and I want to thank you very much for joining us here on Intercepted.\n\nPP: Thank you for having me. Thank you very much.\n\nJS: Geneviéve Jones-Wright, we will also be following your campaign closely. Thank you so much for being with us.\n\nGJW: Thank you.\n\nJS: Geneviéve Jones-Wright is a deputy public defender. She's running for California's San Diego County district attorney seat.\n\nAnd Pam Price is a civil rights attorney, running for California's Alameda County district attorney seat.

      "text": "Baltimore Radio Host Airs Outlandish Theories About Freddie Gray\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nProminent conservative talk-show host Tom Marr airs rumor that Freddie Gray injured his spine jumping from a window to elude police.\n\n(This post is from our new blog: Unofficial Sources .)\n\nBaltimore talk-radio fixture Tom Marr aired outlandish theories about the death of Freddie Gray during his Tuesday morning show, suggesting that Gray's severed spine could be the result of a botched burglary or a \"pre-existing condition.\"\n\n\"I'm hearing that Freddie Gray may have sustained an injury himself while fleeing from police on March 20th, 2015. What I'm hearing is that in order to try to elude police, he jumped from a window, possibly as high as three stories,\" said Marr.\n\nMarr serves a \" slice of the conservative pie \" on his morning show on Talk Radio 680 WCBM. Gray, an African-American 25-year-old, died from spinal cord injuries while in police custody earlier this month.\n\nMarr drifted between alternative theories to suggest that police might not be responsible for Gray's death. \"Did [Gray] have a preexisting condition?\" asked Marr, after running through Gray's criminal drug record and floating the possibility that he died from running into a wall. \"We just don't know answers yet.\"\n\nThroughout the segment, Marr took calls and entertained a range of ideas to explain the unrest in Baltimore City, including the role of welfare, illegal immigration, and the \"entitlement mentality\" in the African American community. \"Oh you want to use food stamps to buy illegal drugs, go ahead,\" said Marr, claiming the welfare programs started in the 1960s have been \"an utter and complete disaster,\" particularly for \"poor blacks.\"\n\nMarr also pinned the blame for Baltimore's woes on Reverend Jamal Bryant , the pastor who delivered the eulogy for Freddie Gray's funeral on Monday. Though Rev. Bryant repeatedly called for calm after the funeral and urged protesters to \" go back home ,\" Marr singled him out for criticism.\n\n\"The young black males, the Al Sharptons of the world and the Reverend Jamal Bryants of the world, they're not out on the streets demonstrating against the blacks shooting and killing other blacks,\" said Marr. \"They're out to blame everything on whitey.\"\n\nListen to the interview here:\n\nMarr has been on the airwaves in the Baltimore area for decades, first as a play-by-play announcer for the Orioles and in recent years as a popular voice in conservative talk radio. During his term in office, Gov. Bob Ehrlich, R-Md., often served as Marr's guest host. Recently elected Gov. Larry Hogan, R-Md., is also a friend of the show and frequent guest on the program.\n\nTowards the end of the segment about Gray, Marr effortlessly transitioned into a pitch for one of his advertisers, a reverse mortgage company.\n\nPhoto of Tom Marr with Maryland Gov.

      "text": "In the Nation's Capital, Fewer Than Half of Black Males Graduate From High School\n\nThe term \"black lives matter\" has become the battle cry for Americans outraged by the recent deaths of Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and other unarmed black men at the hands of police. Indeed, the folks at the Schott Foundation for Public Education aim to help make those lives matter before they come to a premature end. Black Lives Matter, its fifth annual report on the state of black youth in the public schools, looks at suspension and graduation rates and points to some alarming trends.\n\nFor example, according to the report, 15 percent of black males nationwide have been suspended from school, versus only 5 percent of white boys. Missouri, Michigan, and Florida have some of the highest suspension rates for black boys: greater than 20 percent. These findings parallel a March 2013 study by the Discipline Disparities Research-to-Practice Collaborative, which found that black students and students with disabilities are suspended at \"hugely disproportionate rates.\"\n\nAll of this information is presented in the context of the school-to-prison pipeline; data has shown suspensions increase the likelihood of students dropping out, and many end up in the criminal justice system. In 2013, researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that about 75 percent of Florida ninth graders who were never suspended as freshman graduated from high school. Those suspended once had a 52 percent graduation rate. For those suspended multiple times, the rate was just 38 percent.\n\nNationally, the Schott report notes, only 59 percent of black males graduate from high school, versus 80 percent of white males. The worst rates were found in Washington, DC, and in Nevada-both had graduation rates of less than 50 percent for black males.\n\nThat's a bleak picture. But the report also aims to highlight the achievements of young black men who graduate from high school, such as the more than two million with four-year college degrees and those who have left significant marks in the world of business, finance, science, and the arts.\n\nThe high suspension and low graduation rates received national attention last January: President Barack Obama rolled out his first \"school discipline guidelines,\" which hold schools legally responsible for the disparate impact of their disciplinary actions on different races. In February 2014 the president announced his \"My Brother's Keeper\" initiative. With more than $200 million in foundation support, it aims to help black youths finish school and stay out of the criminal justice system.\n\nThe Schott report comes one week after the publication of Black Girls Matter: Pushed Out, Overpoliced and Underprotected , a new report from Columbia Law School that highlights an even greater disparity in the rates of punishment for black girls: Crunching data from the Department of Education, the authors found that black girls are suspended six time s more often than white girls, whereas black boys were suspended three times as often as white boys.\n\n\"We must challenge the assumption,\" says Columbia Law School professor Kimberlé Crenshaw , the report's lead author, \"that the lives of girls and women-who are often left out of the national conversation-are not also at risk.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Black Men Are Pushed to Pursue Sports. Why Not Medicine?\n\nFormer NFL player Nate Hughes, shown here in 2009, recently became a physician. Gray Quetti/Cal Sport/ZUMA\n\nThis story was originally published by Undark and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nAaron Bolds didn't consider becoming a physician until he tore a ligament in his knee while playing in a basketball tournament when he was 15. His orthopedic surgeon was Black, and they hit it off. \"He was asking me how my grades were, and I told him, 'I'm a straight-A student,' and he was, like, 'Man, this is a great fallback plan if basketball doesn't work out,'\" recalls Bolds, who is African American.\n\n\"He looked like me,\" Bolds says, \"and that was even more encouraging.\"\n\nIf not for that chance encounter, Bolds, 34, a doctor at Mount Sinai Health System in New York, might never have gone into medicine, he says. When he was growing up, there were no physicians in his family or extended social network to model that career path. And at the schools he attended, he says, his aptitude for science didn't trigger the kind of guidance young people often receive in more privileged contexts.\n\nWhat Bolds did get attention for was his athletic ability. He got a full basketball scholarship to Lenoir-Rhyne University in North Carolina, where his team won a conference championship. But when he transferred to Bowie State University in Maryland, where he also played basketball, an academic adviser discouraged his pre-med ambitions, Bolds recalls, saying his grades were low and he lacked research experience.\n\nBolds is not alone in finding in athletics a fraught lever of educational opportunity. Whereas Black players comprise more than half the football and basketball teams at the 65 universities in the top five athletic conferences, and bring in millions of dollars for their schools year after year, the graduation rates for Black male college athletes are significantly lower-55 percent as compared to 69 percent for college athletes overall-according to a 2018 report from the USC Race and Equity Center. Many Black college athletes end up without either a professional sports contract or a clear career path.\n\nNow some educators and advocates are looking to reverse this trend by connecting sports, an area in which African American men are overrepresented, and medicine, where the opposite is true. As of 2018, 13 percent of the U.S. population, but just 5 percent of doctors- according to the Association of American Medical Colleges-identified as Black or African American. (The AAMC data notes that an additional 1 percent of doctors identified as multiracial.) Decades of efforts to increase diversity at medical schools have made progress with other demographics, including Black women-but barely any with Black men. \"No other demographic group is broken down with such a large split between men and women,\" says Jo Wiederhorn, president and CEO of the Associated Medical Schools of New York. \"And none of them have stayed stagnant, like that group has.\"\n\nAccording to data the AAMC provided to Undark , the proportion of Black men enrolling in medical school hasn't changed much since 1978-with only some headway being made in the past few years.\n\nThe absence of Black male medical professionals ripples across the health system, experts say, contributing to widespread health disparities. African Americans tend to be diagnosed later than White people with everything from cancer to kidney disease , leading to more advanced disease and earlier deaths . Meanwhile, a recent study suggests that Black men who see Black male doctors may be more likely to follow medical advice. Other research also suggests that racially concordant care, in which patients and doctors have a shared identity, is associated with better communication and a greater likelihood to use health services.\n\n\"We are in a crisis point, nationally,\" says Reginald Miller, the dean for research operations and infrastructure at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \"I don't think it's a stretch to suggest that the health of communities of color are directly proportional to the number of practitioners available to see,\" he says. \"It's just that straightforward.\"\n\nLast year, the National Medical Association, a professional organization representing African American physicians, embarked with the AAMC on a joint effort to address the structural barriers to advancement for Black men. \"We need to look at this with a unique lens,\" says Norma Poll-Hunter, senior director of workforce diversity at the AAMC.\n\nThere is no single solution to such an entrenched and multifaceted problem, Poll-Hunter says. According to her, some medical schools have adopted a holistic admissions process that evaluates many personal factors rather than relying on standardized test scores, which can exclude promising Black candidates. In addition, she says, students of color need better access to high-quality K-12 science education, particularly in under-resourced public schools. \"There are a lot of barriers that exist early on,\" she notes, \"and that then creates this narrowing of the pathway to medicine.\"\n\nBut the novel strategy of wooing athletes is slowly gaining traction. Advocates point out that high-performing athletes possess many of the skills and attributes that doctors, psychologists, physical therapists, and other medical professionals need-things like focus, a commitment to excellence, time management, and problem-solving skills, as well as the ability to take constructive criticism and perform under pressure.\n\n\"When you say, 'What's your ideal medical student?' it's not just a kid who's academically gifted. It's a kid who's got resilience, attention to detail, knows how to work on the team,\" Miller says. \"Because science and medicine are team sports.\" And by virtue of being athletes, these young men are already attuned to nutrition, fitness, and other aspects of human biology.\n\nTwo former NFL players, Nate Hughes and Myron Rolle, recently became physicians. And there is evidence that competitive sports experience contributes to medical success. A 2012 study of doctors training to become ear, nose, and throat specialists at Washington University, for example, found that having excelled in a team sport was more predictive of how faculty rated their quality as a clinician than strong letters of recommendation or having attended a highly-ranked medical school. Likewise, a 2011 study found that having an elite skill, such as high-achieving athletics, was more predictive of completing a general surgery residency than medical school grades.\n\nAdvocates of the athletics-to-medicine pipeline point out its practicality. Thousands of Black men are already in college, or headed there, on athletic scholarships. It would only take a small percentage of them choosing medical careers to boost the percentage of Black male doctors to better reflect the proportion of African American men in the general population, they say.\n\nNo one thinks it will be easy. One obstacle, advocates say, is a lack of role models. Black sports celebrities are household names, but some young athletes may never encounter a Black medical professional. \"People don't believe they can become what they don't see,\" says Mark R. Brown, the athletic director at Pace University.\n\nAnd for the best chance of success, many say, these young men need to form and pursue medical aspirations as young as possible, along with their athletic training. \"Those kids who are able to do both, the rewards at the end are enormous,\" Miller says. But the adults in their lives may not believe the dual path is possible. \"The second that a kid says to a science teacher or someone else that he's an athlete,\" Miller says, \"they go into a different category. 'They're not really serious about science and medicine, they're just here, and so I don't expect this kid to really achieve.'\"\n\nRigid course and practice schedules also make it challenging for busy athletes to undertake demanding and time-intensive science majors, observers say. What's needed is \"a cultural change, and not just a cultural change with the athletes. It's a cultural change with the whole structure,\" Miller says. \"Everybody's excited about the idea\" of the physician athlete, he adds, \"because it makes sense. But when the rubber hits the road, it is challenging.\"\n\nDonovan Roy, the assistant dean for diversity and inclusiveness at Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine at Western Michigan University, was one of the first people to envision the potential of directing Black athletes toward medical careers.\n\nRoy, 48, who is Black and a former college football player, grew up in the working class, primarily Black and Latino community of Inglewood, California. Attending an elite private high school on a football scholarship was eye-opening. He vividly remembers the first time he ever saw a walk-in pantry, at a friend's home. \"It was stocked like a convenience store,\" he recalls. \"Five different types of Hostess, Ding-Dongs, sodas, every type of snack that you ever wanted.\" Equally startling was speaking with another friend's mother, who was a lawyer. \"I'd never seen a road map to success in my community,\" he says.\n\nRoy's athletic talent continued to open doors-at 18 he got a scholarship to the University of Southern California-but poorly prepared by the under-resourced public schools he had attended through ninth grade, he struggled academically, and left both USC and later another university that he also attended on an athletic scholarship.\n\nEventually Roy found his footing, and when he did, he became a learning specialist. After working through his own academic struggles, he wanted to help others with theirs. Roy took a job as a learning skills counselor at UCLA's medical school. There he helped the students who were struggling with classes like anatomy and genetics. In early 2015, he returned to USC as the director of academic support services at Keck School of Medicine.\n\nSomething Roy noticed at both these medical schools stuck with him, though it would take a few years for the observation to crystallize. A certain kind of student sought help despite, by ordinary standards, not needing it. These were the athletes, and many of them were Black or Latino. \"They always talked about, 'How can I excel? How can I get better?'\" he recalls. They \"were getting 90s and they wanted to be 100.\"\n\nRoy began a doctoral program in education in 2015, the same year the AAMC published a damning report about the lack of Black men entering medical school. This was a crisis Roy understood both personally and professionally. For his dissertation, he decided to interview 16 Black male students at Keck School of Medicine. What was it about them, he wanted to understand, that had gotten them there against all odds?\n\nThe answer, he discovered, was what academics call social capital. For medical students from privileged backgrounds, social capital might take the form of a family friend who arranges a summer internship at a biotechnology lab, or a well-funded high school that offers advanced placement science classes. The young men Roy interviewed did not, for the most part, have access to those sorts of resources.\n\n\"Growing up, I didn't see a Black male with a college degree until I got to college,\" medical student Jai Kemp said in a separate interview Roy conducted for a documentary he's making on the topic. The social capital these young men leveraged to get to medical school took the form of parental support, science enrichment programs and clubs, peer social networks, faculty mentors-and the perks that come with athletics. \"For me it was just sports that got me through,\" Kemp said.\n\nThe pieces started to fit together. Roy knew from his own experience all the benefits athletes get, not just entrée to educational institutions, but travel, enrichment, and academic advantages like tutoring and early class registration. Athletes also tend to possess social cachet on campus and, with more exposure to different types of people, may feel comfortable in environments that seem foreign and forbidding to other young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Roy also recalled the drive for academic excellence he had observed in the athletes who came to his tutoring programs. \"I got this epiphany,\" he says. \"Why don't we look at student athletes in order to increase Black males' representation in medicine, because they have the most social capital and the most network on predominantly White campuses.\"\n\nBut when Roy began talking to his medical school colleagues about recruiting athletes, who according to a report from the Center for American Progress-a liberal think tank-make up 16 percent of Black male college students receiving athletic aid in the Big 12 athletic conference, he says most weren't receptive to the idea. The same thing happened when he got up the nerve to make the suggestion publicly at a 2018 conference in Orlando, Florida. The idea ran against type. \"I think people tend to lump athletes into this box,\" he says. \"They just think that athletes are big meatheads.\"\n\nRoy knew this truth viscerally, because with his offensive lineman's build of 6-feet-6-inches and 300-plus pounds, he sticks out in academic settings. \"People stare,\" he says. \"They do not expect me to be in the role that I am in.\"\n\nWhat Roy didn't know was that the idea was percolating elsewhere, including at the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Brian Hainline, the NCAA's chief medical officer, says he and Poll-Hunter of the AAMC are in talks with several universities about launching a pilot program to support African American athletes interested in medical careers.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2018 Miller founded the organization Scholar-Athletes with Academic Goals (a.k.a. SWAG , a name he hopes will resonate with young people). The initiative connects promising athletes with a range of available programs to help them pursue and succeed in science and medicine. Recently, Miller worked closely with leadership at Pace University to create a program, expected to launch next year, to support Black college athletes interested in attending medical school. Pace officials want the initiative to become a magnet for out-of-state athletes and a model for other schools. \"My hope is that two years from now, colleges and universities will call\" and ask, \"Wow, how did you do this?\" says athletic director Brown. \"Once we have some success, and proof of concept, then I think it can really grow.\"\n\nBolds graduated medical school in 2018 and is now doing his residency at Mount Sinai. His focus is rehabilitation medicine, and he plans to tend to injured athletes and serve as a team physician. He got a business degree while in medical school, and his long-term goal is to open his own interventional spine and sports medicine practice specializing in preventing and rehabilitating injuries in both athletes and non-athletes, as well as helping serious players enhance their performance.\n\nBut there were tough moments along the way, such as the encounter with that academic adviser, which Bolds says only served to motivate him. At the time, he thought, \"Wow, this person doesn't believe in me. So let me make them a believer,\" he recalls. \"That was, moving forward, really a turning point for me, honestly. Because I knew that people aren't going to believe in you unless you give them a reason to.\"\n\nBolds began to apply an athletic mindset to his pre-med classes. \"That same grind of having to get up, 5 a.m., get to the gym, get shots up before anybody gets there, to put in that extra time-I was doing that with my studies,\" he says. \"I would get to the library before anybody.\" Once Bolds turned his grades around, professors began to notice and help him, he says. Still, he says, his score on the MCAT, an entrance exam required by nearly all U.S. medical schools, was borderline. Instead of giving up, he attended multiple events at Howard University's medical school, where he met people who advocated for him. It was the only medical school he got into.\n\nWhereas Bolds had to bushwhack, he saw other Black students fall off the medical path-and his fellow Black teammates avoided it entirely. Many athletes find themselves enmeshed in a profit-making system that may not prioritize their education. The NCAA has been criticized in recent years for its long-standing policy which prohibits profit-sharing with college athletes-a policy that was only recently reversed under interim guidelines. Others have said that Black labor has been especially exploited.\n\nAs of 2014 reports, fewer than 2 percent of athletes in the NCAA will go on to play professionally. But for self-serving reasons, critics say, (Clemson University's football team, for example, made $77 million in average annual revenue from 2015 through 2017) universities often direct athletes to \"academic paths of least resistance.\" Many schools practice \" major clustering ,\" in which players are steered to the same relatively undemanding major, such as communications, so they can devote themselves almost entirely to their sport. Major clustering is more pronounced among athletes of color, according to a 2009 study of football teams at 11 universities. At six of those schools, the study found, over three-quarters of the non-White football players were enrolled in just two academic majors, although dozens of majors were offered.\n\nSheron Mark, an associate professor of science education at the University of Louisville, co-authored a 2019 case study of two young Black men who arrived at college on basketball scholarships, with the intent to pursue respective careers in computer science and engineering. But both found it difficult to balance academics with athletics because of pressure and blandishments from coaches and faculty advisers.\n\n\"For so long, they've been sold this message that you don't have many choices, that banking on a professional sports career is one of very few options for you if you want to advance your station in life,\" says Mark of many Black athletes. It's important to have a plan B, she says, since \"the odds just aren't in their favor.\" But coaches can discourage academically demanding majors because they may cut into practice time, and college athletes are not always capable of pushing back, she says, because their financial packages are tied to fulfillment of their team responsibilities.\n\nMany Black college athletes are already strong candidates for medical school, advocates say, but others may need extra academic support to compensate for deficits acquired at under-resourced K-12 schools. They may also need post-graduation training to take science classes they did not have time for while working long hours as athletes-with some working 20-plus hours a week. \"How are they being mentored and guided and protected in planning for their futures?\" Mark asks. \"They are high achieving in sports, they want to be high achieving in academics. Why don't we support them?\" When people wonder whether student-athletes can cut it in science and medicine, Mark's response is: \"It's on us. It's on us to help them do so. That's how we can grow their representation.\"\n\nThat's what Pace University intends to do. The school already nurtures academic success in its athletes, who collectively had a B+ average last school year, but premedical studies have never been a great fit, in part because afternoon practices can conflict with long lab classes, says athletic director Brown. As part of the school's new initiative, Pace science departments have pledged to offer flexibility in course section offerings in order to accommodate football commitments. Athletes of color from any sport will be welcome, but football was prioritized because it is the largest and one of the most diverse teams and has the most complicated schedule, Brown says.\n\nThe school also plans to adjust its advising, tutoring, and library services to ensure that pre-med athletes won't falter when they struggle with personal issues or tough classes like organic chemistry. \"Rather than saying, 'Oh, chemistry, nobody likes chemistry, you're right, you should just drop that,' instead now it's going to be, 'Yeah, you've got to buckle down. And here's how we're going to do it,'\" says Hillary Knepper, the university's associate provost for student success.\n\nMeanwhile, Brown will be directing his coaches to actively recruit Black and Latino high school athletes who are interested in medicine. In the past, Brown says, his coaches were less likely to select such students because of anticipated scheduling challenges. But now Pace is trying to establish a partnership through which a nearby medical school would give preferred consideration to pre-med athletes who have completed the Pace curriculum. \"With our new approach, you're not only going to have the ability to do it,\" he says, \"but you're going to have a support system, to make sure that you follow the path.\"\n\nSome advocates for the athlete-to-doctor paradigm see this work as part of the larger movement for social justice. \"Look what Jackie Robinson did, right? Look at Muhammad Ali, look at Colin Kaepernick,\" Roy says. \"Athletics has always been the vehicle for social change.\"\n\nMedical professionals can influence public policy, accumulate wealth, and help empower others in their orbit. \"The impacts ramp up really quickly, from just that individual benefiting,\" Mark says, to \"your family, your neighborhood, your social network, and society-people you won't even meet, and across generations.\"\n\nStudies suggest that African American doctors are more likely to choose to work in underserved communities. They also may be more attuned to, and motivated to combat, the disparities in health care . A study published last year, for example, suggests that Black newborns are half as likely to die when they are cared for by a Black physician.\n\nBolds is keenly aware of the health disparities for Black communities, and he jumps at opportunities to mentor other young Black men, to show them that they, too, can become doctors. \"It seems like there's so many steps that just are never-ending,\" he says. But, he adds, to see someone \"that you can connect with that's at that finish line or has already passed that finish line-I think that's very key to their success.\"\n\nOne of the people Bolds has connected with is Darius Ervin, a talented Black basketball player from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, who is now a sophomore at Cornell University. The two met when Ervin attended a virtual event late last year, sponsored by SWAG, at which Bolds spoke. Afterwards, the two chatted, and Bolds now checks in periodically with Ervin, who says he appreciates the encouragement. \"Those are people that have once laced up shoes and got on the court and played just like how I did, and now they're in the hospital helping people,\" he says. \"Being able to speak to those people gives me the visual, allows me to see that it's an opportunity and it's definitely possible for me to do.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "I Spent a Week With Black MAGA. Here's What I Learned.\n\nMother Jones illustration\n\nJust a few (long) weeks ago, President Joe Biden was still running for reelection, grappling with persistently negative polling. One major concern for Democrats-and a source of surprise and delight for Republicans-was the apparent shift of young Black male voters towards former President Donald Trump. This will-they-won't-they question dominated the summer, culminating at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in mid-July: Could Trump make significant inroads into a voting bloc that traditionally supported Democrats?\n\nThat narrative shifted dramatically with the entry of Vice President Kamala Harris into the race. Suddenly, a much higher percentage of Black voters told pollsters of their intent to vote, a big increase from July when Biden was still on the ticket. \"I seem to be doing very well with Black males,\" Trump mused during a televised press conference at Mar-a-Lago last week, without citing evidence. \"And I still am.\" But he also seemed spooked: \"It could be that I'll be affected somewhat with Black females.\"\n\nWhen the Mother Jones team reported from the RNC last month, I went on a mission to unravel these complex cross-currents of identity, policy, and political strategy. \"I learned a lot about Black Republicans during these conversations-their motivations, their stories, their goals,\" I recall, in a new, in-depth video showcasing several substantive interviews with Black convention attendees. \"I wanted to know what draws a Black person to identify with this Republican Party.\"\n\nI uncovered old-school appeals to rugged individualism (with elements of historical revisionism), traditional anti-abortion viewpoints, and a rejection of government interventions. Ultimately, I discovered that-for a party that so openly courts racists and racism enablers-having more Black people in the ranks could be, surprisingly, beneficial: \"The only way the Republican Party becomes this ideologically conservative but racially inclusive big tent party,\" I conclude, \"is if there is a fundamental rejection of the people, policies, and practices they currently hold as sacred in their political vision.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "New Data Shows That America's Schools Are Still Disproportionately Punishing Students of Color\n\nPablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nA report released by the Education Department on Tuesday reveals that black students and students with disabilities are still suspended and arrested at much higher rates than their classmates, further complicating Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' reconsideration of an Obama-era rule meant to curtail the disproportionate punishment of students of color.\n\nAccording to the Education Department, 2.7 million K-12 students were suspended at least once during the 2015-16 school year, the most recent year for which data is available. Black students make up 15 percent of students enrolled in schools across the country but accounted for 39 percent of those suspended out of school at least once. Black boys, who make up 8 percent of the student population, accounted for 25 percent of suspended students, while black girls (another 8 percent of students) accounted for 14 percent of those suspended.\n\nOf the 120,700 students expelled from school in 2015-16, 33 percent were black. Black students were also overrepresented among those who were physically restrained (27 percent) and secluded in rooms in which they were prevented from leaving (23 percent).\n\nWhat's more, black students were more likely to get referred to law enforcement and arrested at school, a notable finding considering the Trump administration called for more cops in schools following the Parkland shooting. Black students account for 31 percent of all referrals to law enforcement, up 4 percentage points from the 2013-14 school year.\n\nStudents with disabilities, meanwhile, were subject to 26 percent of out-of-school suspensions, even though they made up 12 percent of students.\n\nSuspensions can ultimately lead to a loss of instruction time that could overwhelmingly fall on students of color and those with disabilities. A report released last week by the UCLA Center for Civil Rights Remedies and Harvard Law School's Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice found that black students  with disabilities were more likely to be suspended and lost 77 more days of instruction, on average, than their white peers. In at least 28 states, the gap between disciplining black students with disabilities and white students worsened between 2013-14 and 2015-16.\n\nDan Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at UCLA, tweeted out several examples of what the newly released discipline data meant in several urban school districts:\n\nNew OCR data on Memphis show Black males lost 83,727 days of instruction due 2 out of school suspensions, yet only 43,216 Black males r enrolled. That =s 194 days lost for every 100 Black males! Every district reports days lost showing profound impact on ed opportunity . @losendan\n\n- Dan Losen (@losendan) April 24, 2018\n\nFerguson MO schools Black males lost 9,905 days of instruction 2 suspension with only 4,695 enrolled =s 211 days per 100 enrolled + White mls lost 54 days per 100. 157 more days lost per 100 for Black mls @SarahDSparks @EricaLG OCR released data but this not mentioned. . @losendan\n\n- Dan Losen (@losendan) April 24, 2018\n\nOCR data out today, in Jefferson Cty Kentucky, Black males lost 115 days lost 2 out of school suspension per 100 enrolled which is  81 days per 100 more than the 34 days lost for white mls enrolled. A devastating racially disparate impact on educational opportunity. . @losendan\n\n- Dan Losen (@losendan) April 24, 2018\n\nOn April 4, DeVos held closed-door listening sessions with educators and advocates on both sides of the Obama-era discipline rule. The guidance , issued in 2014, seeks to ensure that schools don't disproportionately punish black and Latino students for wrongdoing and encourages schools to look at their own disciplinary policies. Members of a White House school safety commission, overseen by DeVos, is looking into repealing the guidance.\n\nThat same day, a report released by the Government Accountability Office found that black students, students with disabilities, and boys were far more likely to be disciplined than their classmates. The GAO report notes that \"implicit bias\" from teachers and staffers \"may cause them to judge students' behaviors differently based on the students' race and sex.\"\n\nIn December, the Education Department also proposed delaying another Obama-era guidance, known as the significant disproportionality rule, that's meant to require states to look at whether schools are overidentifying students of color for special education or disciplining students of color at higher rates.\n\nThis article has been revised.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Closing the Achievement Gap: Race Still Matters\n\nistockphoto.com More bad news for folks, who think that Obama's election landed us in a post-racial America. A new report ( PDF ) looking at math and reading proficiency among young black males in urban public schools concludes they're doing even worse than is generally known, and poverty alone doesn't explain it.\n\nRace still matters. Case in point: African American boys who are not poor get the same test scores as white boys who live in poverty.\n\nMost K-12 data is usually broken up by race or ethnicity, but not gender. What this sharpened interpretation reveals is that young black males face more obstacles to graduating from high school than any other subgroup, from living in a household without a male guardian, to more frequent encounters with overzealous cops, to higher dropout rates and more suspensions.\n\nThe intention of this report is a call for more targeted solutions that take race into consideration, such as recruiting more black male counselors or creating more culturally relevant lesson plans. The report's authors call for increased national efforts, like a White House conference on black males, creating a special task force, and providing more resources to public schools for after-school programs specifically for black males.\n\nWhat we are likely to actually see are roughly the same (or less, with Dems losing the House) education reform efforts using \"market-friendly\" mechanisms to eradicate poverty, like opening more charters, turning around or closing schools, and increased pay for teachers whose students get the highest test scores. What we definitely won't see are new federal programs that anyone could brand as affirmative action. Not at a time when a mainstream publication like Forbes runs a cover feature on Obama describing him already \"so outside our comprehension\" that he can only be fathomed \"if you understand Kenyan, anti-colonial behavior.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trayvon Shooter's 911 Calls: Potholes, Piles of Trash-and Black Men\n\nPart of a Powerpoint lesson on neighborhood watch programs by the Sanford, Fla., police department: City of Sanford At 9:02 p.m. on September 21, 2005, he called 911 about a stray dog on Skyline Drive. At 7:22 p.m. on St. Patrick's Day, 2005, he called 911 about a \"pothole that is blocking [the] road.\" Then there was the pile of trash in the road near the local Kohl's, which he reported on Nov. 8, 2010. \"[Complainant] states it appears recently dumped and appears to contain  glass,\" the dispatcher dutifully reported.\n\nA new 47-page document , quietly dumped online by the city of Sanford, details some of the phone calls George Zimmerman made to emergency dispatchers in Seminole County, Florida. Zimmerman, a self-styled neighborhood watch captain in his Orlando suburb, shot 17-year-old African American Trayvon Martin dead last month after reporting him to police as a suspicious person prowling the area. Zimmerman now claims Martin attacked him on the street, and he defended himself with deadly force.\n\nBut the newly released police calls paint Zimmerman as a man obsessed with law and order, with the minutiae of suburban life, and with black males.\n\nMost of the calls seem to cover mundanities: Zimmerman reported a male driving with no headlights; a yellow speedbike popping wheelies on  I-4; an aggressive white-and-brown pitbull; an Orange County municipal  pickup cutting people off on the road; loud parties; open garage doors; and the antics of an ex-roommate, Josh, that he'd thrown out of their apartment. On September 9, 2009, he called to report another pothole, this one on Greenwood road, advising the dispatcher that \"it is deep and can cause damage to vehicles.\"\n\nHe especially had concerns about kids in the neighborhood. On June 16, 2009, shortly after school had let out for the summer, he called to complain about six to eight youths playing basketball near his development's clubhouse,  \"jumping over the fence going into pool area and trashing the bathroom,\"  according to the dispatcher's notes. This past January, he called to report five or six  children, ages 4 to 11, playing in the neighborhood. The kids, he told a  dispatcher, \"play in the street and like to run out [in front of] cars.\"\n\nBut when there weren't kids or garbage to report, he'd spend his evenings looking for would-be burglars. At 2:38 a.m. on Nov. 4, 2006, he called about a late-model Red Toyota pickup \"driving real slow looking at all the [vehicles] in the complex and blasting music from his [vehicle].\" It's not clear if Zimmerman feared the driver was a car thief, though car thieves tend not to blast music through the neighborhood while practicing their craft.\n\nBut even more than cars, he was concerned about black men on foot in the neighborhood. In August 2011, he called to report a black male in a tank top and shorts acting suspicious near the development's back entrance. \"[Complainant] believes [subject] is involved in recent S-21s\"-break-ins-\"in the neighborhood,\" the call log states. The suspect, Zimmerman told the dispatcher, fit a recent description given out by law enforcement officers.\n\nThree days later, he called to report two black teens in the same  area, for the same reason. \"[Juveniles] are the subjs who have been  [burglarizing] in this area,\" he told the dispatcher.\n\nAnd last month, on Feb. 2, Zimmerman called to report a suspicious  black man in a leather jacket near one of the development's units. The  resident of that townhouse, Zimmerman told dispatch, was a white male. Police stopped by to investigate, but no one was there, and the residence  was secure.\n\nAfter that, there's one final call logged in the report. At 7:11 on  February 26, Zimmerman called police to report a black male in a dark  gray hoodie. A few minutes later, that male-Trayvon Martin-lay dead on  the sidewalk.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Even Heather Mac Donald Is Right Twice a Year\n\nI have to give this one to my girl Heather Mac Donald over at City Journal. Well, partly give it to her. She's right on the problem, but wrong-ish on the solution.\n\nThere's been lots of talk lately, however muted since black dysfunction is the issue, of rising intrablack homicide and violence rates. Overall, crime is down, except for blacks. What gives?\n\nShe's got her beady and all too analytic eye on this NYT editorial explaining exactly what she, mostly persuasively, thinks gives.\n\nA new study of homicide among young black males prompted this latest [NYT] editorial. James Alan Fox and Marc Swatt of Northeastern University found that the number of homicides committed by black males under the age of 18 rose 43 percent between 2002 and 2007, while the number of gun homicides by this same group rose 47 percent. Homicides by white youth during that period decreased slightly. But more significant were the different homicide rates that the report calculated, which no news story dared to divulge. Whereas the report's graph for white homicides over the last 30 years plots the rate in increments of 10, the black rate is demarcated at intervals of 100. The highest homicide rate for whites over the last three decades was 32 homicides committed per 100,000 males between the ages of 18 and 24 (reached in 1991), whereas the highest homicide rate for blacks was approximately 320 homicides per 100,000 males between the ages of 18 and 24 (reached in 1993).\n\nEven this apparent ten-to-one disparity between black and white homicide rates doesn't tell the full story. Fox and Swatt include Hispanic homicides in the white rate, though they do not disclose that they are doing so (both the inclusion and the silence about it follow FBI practice). Hispanic crime rates are between three and four times that of whites-meaning that if one excluded the Hispanic homicides from the white rate, the black-white differential would be even larger than ten to one.\n\nI have to agree with her that numbers should not be sugar coated when they make minorities look bad; facts are facts and you're gonna run out of gas if your fuel gauge has been tinkered with to give you a false sense of (oh so brief) security). Funny, isn't it though, that when minorities want a count that proves our under-representation in the good stuff (see: the census, police stop-and-frisk numbers, employment rates) conservatives cry foul. When a count proves the opposite...... But I digress.\n\nWhat's got her most incensed though is, having fudged incriminating numbers, 'liberals' go on to demand more investment in social programs, programs she deems utter failures. I'm not sure she's wrong, except in the locus in which she situates her solution: marriage.\n\nLiberal policymakers and pundits have spilled buckets of ink over the years promoting social-service programs as the solution to crime, yet-like the Times's recent editorial-those opinion-setters cannot squeeze out one word about the most effective anticrime (and antipoverty) strategy: marriage. The marriage imperative civilizes boys. By contrast, in a world where it is unusual for a man to marry the mother of his children, boys fail to learn the most basic lesson of personal responsibility: you are responsible for your children. Freed of the social expectation that they will have to provide a stable home for their offspring, boys have little incentive to restrain their impulses and develop bourgeois habits. In 2005, the national black illegitimacy rate was 70 percent, and it approached 90 percent in many inner cities (compared with a white illegitimacy rate of 25 percent, and as low as 6 percent in some urban areas, like the District of Columbia). The disappearance of marriage from the black community is a social cataclysm.\n\nSome highly structured, values-based youth programs, like the Boy Scouts, can provide boys a surrogate for the paternal authority that they lack at home; society is right to support these lifelines. But they cannot possibly bring crime down significantly among blacks in the absence of a cultural shift toward marriage. True, no one knows yet how to revive marriage in the black community. But given the imperative of doing so, you would think that somewhere in the flood of recommendations for more useless government social programs, a little space could be reserved for promoting the idea of a marriage movement.\n\nMac Donald's underlying assumption is that marriage makes men out of boys and that there's some way to entice sperm-donors to become husbands and fathers. But I beg to differ. You can't be a husband and father until you first become a man. The problem isn't the lack of marriage. Few of the kind of marriages we're talking about last, or are functional during their duration. From personal experience as a ghetto-escapee, I can't tell you the number of women I know who are 'married' to some fellow 'hood rat they've barely seen in the last decade. Top of my head, I can think of a close relative whose husband left her in 1984; they're still not divorced. He doesn't pay his taxes and her refund is garnished every year. While they were married, she behaved like a 'wife' but he behaved like a frat boy. Why? Because the black community tolerates intolerable black male behavior. She went on, five years later, to raise her common law husband's infant, conceived during the first six months of their courtship and raised by her alone after she finally had enough of the CLH's...inadequacies as a 'husband' and father. She never had any legal rights to the child. But the educational and social services community of our inner city knew exactly what time it was. Need I point out that that 'community' is largely female?\n\nThe problem is two-fold: a lack of manhood, mostly due to absent fathers in the previous generation, and a profound lack of self-esteem or hope for the future among black women. Maybe it's a chick-or-egg problem, but here we still are.\n\nSay it loud, I'm black and I'm proud: There's a war between black men and black women. Why? Who can say, except that black women are, culturally and globally, the lowest of the low: the only group black men can look down on. So they do, and black women, the mules of the world, take it.\n\nYou can't get to marriage without first looking at courtship and gendered-courtship behaviors. What do I think? I firmly believe that black women fervently want black men and have accordingly lowered their standards to a humiliating, self-abnegating level. Black men, quite predictably, take advantage of that fact.\n\nMarriage will bloom in black America again, or illegitimacy will wane, when black women get the self-esteem to go Lysistrata on black men's asses. Black men won't love and respect black women until black women love and respect themselves. See why we're the mules of the world?\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Closing the Achievement Gap\n\nDavid Kirp notes today that the academic achievement gap is widest among African American males. Better preschool can help, but it doesn't do any good unless it's followed up with plenty of other things:\n\nWhat does work? Reducing class size to 14 or 15 students, a large-scale Tennessee experiment demonstrated, can generate big academic gains in the long run. Focusing on reading is also smart practice....Keeping schools open from dawn to dusk, six days a week - offering youngsters a raft of medical, social and psychological supports, academic help, sports and activities - also has a demonstrable effect on academics.... Carefully scrutinized mentoring programs like Big Brothers or Friends of the Children, which keeps mentors involved in the lives of the hardest-to-reach youngsters from kindergarten through high school, have been proven to rewrite life-scripts for such children, including African American males.\n\n....Changing students' attitudes about the value of hard work also makes a difference. A study of black eighth-graders found that students' self-discipline was twice as good a predictor of grades as IQ. Charter schools, like those run by Green Dot and KIPP (Knowledge Is Power Program), that emphasize character-building have narrowed the achievement gap for adolescent black males. At one Green Dot school in L.A., 68% of African American male students graduated in four years, while at a nearby public high school, just 3% graduated on time.\n\nOf course, all of these things cost money. And who's willing to spend money these days on nonsense like this? Overseas wars and tax cuts for the rich are surely much better uses of our resources.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Prison Population is Dropping. Can You Guess Why?\n\nKeith Humphreys has a nomination for the most underreported public policy story of the past year: The continuing decline in the number of Americans who are behind bars or on probation/parole. Alex Tabarrok illustrates the trend with the chart on the right.\n\nWhat's going on? At the risk of sounding like a broken record today, part of the answer is probably lead. Lead emissions rose throughout the 50s and 60s, leading to a rise in crime through the 70s and 80s. Incarceration rates went up dramatically during the high-crime years, and many of the people put behind bars served long sentences. So even though crime rates started to fall in the early 90s, incarceration rates kept going up for a while as new criminals were added to a system that already had a lot of long-term residents.\n\nEventually that turned around, and the incarceration rate turned around too. But it turns out there's actually something even more interesting going on if you dig into the data. Rick Nevin, one of the lead researchers who played a key role in figuring out the lead-crime connection, has a short paper about incarceration rates at his website, and his key point is this: over the past decade, incarceration rates for young offenders have gone down, while incarceration rates for older offenders have remained high. (In fact, they're actually up a bit, probably the result of recidivism.) The chart below shows the raw data:\n\nNote how this fits the lead hypothesis. Young people, who were raised in the post-lead era, have sharply lower arrest rates than in the past and sharply lower prison rates. At the same time, older people, who were raised during the era when lead emissions were high, still have high arrest rates and therefore high incarceration rates. However, as the oldsters serve out their sentences and finally get too old for criminal activity, the lower arrest rates of young people are finally lowering overall incarceration rates. Nevin explains more in his paper, and also added a comment to my article with some additional details about black-white incarceration trends between 2001-11:\n\nOver the same 10 years , the incarceration rate for black men ages 18 and 19 fell by 46%, and fell 40% for black men ages 20-24, and 31% for black ages 25-29. Over that same 10 years, the incarceration rate for black men ages 35-39 fell 12% and the rate for black men age 40-44 increased 11%.\n\n....The incarceration rate is now declining for black males ages 35-39, but rising for white males in that age bracket, because that age group today reflects years when slum demolition in black neighborhoods reduced severe lead paint hazards over the 1960s, as urban sprawl caused more gasoline lead fallout in predominantly white suburbs.\n\nYou will often hear inaccurate and misleading statistics about the lifetime risk of incarceration for black males. That data reflects what the risk of incarceration was for black males born across years of pandemic lead poisoning, in urban slums with severe lead paint hazards and additive exposure to urban gasoline lead fallout. That \"lifetime risk\" does not apply to young black males today.\n\nI'm going to caution everyone again that no one is suggesting that lead is solely responsible for the rise and fall of either crime rates or incarceration rates. There are plenty of other factors. But the evidence is very strong that lead plays a key role. And the good news is that since the drop in lead emissions is permanent, crime rates are likely to stay fairly low and incarceration rates are likely to continue to fall. Someday, instead of hearing about overcrowded prisons, we'll be tearing down old prisons because there aren't enough inmates left to keep them in business.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

The signers-among them actor and activist Danny Glover, scholar Robin D.G. Kelley and author Kiese Laymon-take issue with the $200 million effort's exclusive focus on boys and men. The entire letter is worth a read, but its argument is summed up in its final paragraph: If the denunciation of male privilege, sexism and rape culture is not at the center of our quest for racial justice, then we have endorsed a position of benign neglect towards the challenges that girls and women face that undermine their well-being and the well-being of the community as a whole. As Black men we believe if the nation chooses to \"save\" only Black males from a house on fire, we will have walked away from a set of problems that we will be compelled to return to when we finally realize the raging fire has consumed the Black women and girls we left behind. I raised similar concerns after the president's February announcement, so I'll be closely watching this effort to encourage the initiative to adopt a stance that's more inclusive to women and girls. This more holistic approach is crucial, according to the letter's signers, in part because \"our historic struggle for racial justice has always included men as well as women who have risked everything not just for themselves or for their own gender but for the prospects of the entire community.\" Vassar College professor Luke Harris is a co-founder of the African American Policy Forum, a think tank that's helping coordinate the effort and hosting the letter on its website. Harris is one of ten men who are recruiting and organizing signers. He told me this week that the overwhelming response to the letter has been gratitude. \"There are a lot of people who feel that this is a threshold moment for us to have a conversation,\" he said, and emphasized the similarities between the My Brother's Keeper initiative and the Million Man March in 1995. Then, event organizers invited men to reclaim their families and communities. Women were asked to stay home. \"From our perspective, it's a glaring example of the same phenomenon,\" Harris said. \"It's a long-term rebranding of the racial justice discourse into a struggle by and for black male leadership, empowerment and responsibility.\" What this amounts to, according to Harris, is \"the subsequent marginalization of the role of African-American women as actors in the racial justice movement and a decentering of their needs, which are every bit as important as the needs of their brothers.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal The same message is amplified in an op-ed by Harris published this week. In it, he takes on the widespread perception that girls and women of color are somehow in an advantaged position vis-à-vis boys and men, writing: We know, but do we care that Black girls are much more likely to be suspended than all other girls and most boys as well? We know, but do we care, that Black women have lower average incomes and possess significantly less wealth than both Black men and White women? We know, but do we care, that Black women are disproportionately burdened with childcare in situations of acute poverty? Harris also takes on the narrow definitions of family, the heteronormativity and the leap in logic at the heart of the initiative, writing, \"The underlying message here is rooted in the idea that if we help the boys and men, then the situation of girls and women will inevitably get better. With better husbands and sons everything will just 'click.'\" It's that apparent trickle-down approach to racial uplift that's given me pause as I've watched the philanthropic community and now the White House adopt this emphasis on boys and men. After I asked how and whether girls and women fit into the My Brother's Keeper initiative, some commenters countered that girls and women don't need a place at this particular table because their needs were being addressed by the White House Council on Women and Girls , which was launched in 2009. But a statement the National Organization of Women released last week in support of the men's letter shows why comparing the two efforts is apples and oranges: Women and girls of color are in a deep crisis that is too often overlooked. We do not fault the White House Council on Women and Girls for not producing an initiative of the breadth and scope of \"My Brother's Keeper,\" as they were neither tasked nor-as importantly-funded to do so. [ Emphasis mine. ] The Council's charge applies to \"all\" women and girls. But if the specific concerns of girls and young women of color are not investigated and addressed, it becomes all too easy to reinforce the unfortunate myth that girls of color have succeeded and are not in need of attention. There's a reason it's easy to forget that there even is a White House initiative for girls: Money makes the world go 'round, and that older iniative lacks the at least $200 million over five years that the philanthropic community has put in place for boys and men. That NOW even weighed in to offer this perspective and its support for the letter highlights the unexpected bedfellows aspect of the current debate, legal scholar and African American Political Forum co-founder Kimberlé Crenshaw told me. \"This is really an unprecedented moment in feminist and anti-racist politics. I can't remember a time in history when a group of black men, particularly as diverse as this-academics, laborers, entertainers-have actually made a statement calling on the community and society at large to directly focus on the plight facing African-American women. Another first is a feminist group basically applauding a black male group,\" she said. \"Each is acknowledging the extent to which race politics and gender politics hadn't done a good job elevating some of the issues facing women of color.\" Crenshaw called the closing of ranks by the letter's signers and NOW a \"mirror opposite\" of the group represented at the president's My Brother's Keeper press conference in February. There, conservative Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg-whose commitment to a stop-and-frisk policy that targets young men of color is well-documented-offered their support. It's the initiative's focus on personal responsibility over institutional racism and the structures that disadvantage youth of color that allows people like O'Reilly and Bloomberg to feel comfortable getting on board. \"That's a political realignment,\" Crenshaw said of the camps on either side of the debate. Harris, of the African American Policy Forum, said a webinar to further discuss the sign-on letter and next steps will be held Thursday, June 12.

Harris also takes on the narrow definitions of family, the heteronormativity and the leap in logic at the heart of the initiative, writing, \"The underlying message here is rooted in the idea that if we help the boys and men, then the situation of girls and women will inevitably get better. With better husbands and sons everything will just 'click.'\" It's that apparent trickle-down approach to racial uplift that's given me pause as I've watched the philanthropic community and now the White House adopt this emphasis on boys and men. After I asked how and whether girls and women fit into the My Brother's Keeper initiative, some commenters countered that girls and women don't need a place at this particular table because their needs were being addressed by the White House Council on Women and Girls , which was launched in 2009. But a statement the National Organization of Women released last week in support of the men's letter shows why comparing the two efforts is apples and oranges: Women and girls of color are in a deep crisis that is too often overlooked. We do not fault the White House Council on Women and Girls for not producing an initiative of the breadth and scope of \"My Brother's Keeper,\" as they were neither tasked nor-as importantly-funded to do so. [ Emphasis mine. ] The Council's charge applies to \"all\" women and girls. But if the specific concerns of girls and young women of color are not investigated and addressed, it becomes all too easy to reinforce the unfortunate myth that girls of color have succeeded and are not in need of attention. There's a reason it's easy to forget that there even is a White House initiative for girls: Money makes the world go 'round, and that older iniative lacks the at least $200 million over five years that the philanthropic community has put in place for boys and men. That NOW even weighed in to offer this perspective and its support for the letter highlights the unexpected bedfellows aspect of the current debate, legal scholar and African American Political Forum co-founder Kimberlé Crenshaw told me. \"This is really an unprecedented moment in feminist and anti-racist politics. I can't remember a time in history when a group of black men, particularly as diverse as this-academics, laborers, entertainers-have actually made a statement calling on the community and society at large to directly focus on the plight facing African-American women. Another first is a feminist group basically applauding a black male group,\" she said. \"Each is acknowledging the extent to which race politics and gender politics hadn't done a good job elevating some of the issues facing women of color.\" Crenshaw called the closing of ranks by the letter's signers and NOW a \"mirror opposite\" of the group represented at the president's My Brother's Keeper press conference in February. There, conservative Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg-whose commitment to a stop-and-frisk policy that targets young men of color is well-documented-offered their support. It's the initiative's focus on personal responsibility over institutional racism and the structures that disadvantage youth of color that allows people like O'Reilly and Bloomberg to feel comfortable getting on board. \"That's a political realignment,\" Crenshaw said of the camps on either side of the debate.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Among his concerns: The researchers rely on a tiny sample size of American youth to determine arrest rate, when larger data sets are available. Their data is taken from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, which primarily looks at youth employment, not arrests. The researchers use statistical extrapolations to account for participants targeted for the survey in 1997, but could not be reached in later years, meaning \"black males could be guilty by association even in a data set.\" The researchers do not list the survey questions anywhere in the study, meaning it cannot be replicated. I encourage you to read his full critique, here . *** About 49 percent of black men are arrested for non-traffic offenses by the time they turn twenty-three, according to a new study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency . That's compared with 45 percent of Hispanic men and 38 percent of white men who reported arrests by the same age. The study notes that an early arrest, \"even if it results in an acquittal,\" often haunts the arrestee for the rest of their lives. The authors explain: There is substantial research showing that arrested youth are not only more likely to experience immediate negative consequences such as contact with the justice system, school failure and dropout, and family difficulties, but these problems are likely to reverberate long down the life course in terms of additional arrests, job instability, lower wages, longer bouts with unemployment, more relationship troubles, and long-term health problems including premature death. The authors analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997-a Department of Labor survey consisting of interviews with about 7,000 American youths from 1997 to 2008.\n\nI encourage you to read his full critique, here . *** About 49 percent of black men are arrested for non-traffic offenses by the time they turn twenty-three, according to a new study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency .

It involved trying to understand the neurobiological and behavioral effects of psychoactive drugs like cocaine and nicotine. So I read everything that seemed relevant. The provocatively headlined article had appeared in The New York Times on February 8, 1914. I was surprised by the title, although I knew it was once acceptable to print such blatantly racist words in respectable papers. But what really shocked me was how similar it was to modern media coverage of illegal drugs and how, from early on, the racialized discourse on drugs served a larger political purpose. The author, a distinguished physician, wrote: \"[The Negro fiend] imagines that he hears people taunting and abusing him, and this often incites homicidal attacks upon innocent and unsuspecting victims.\" And he continued, \"the deadly accuracy of the cocaine user has become axiomatic in Southern police circles.... the record of the 'cocaine nigger' near Asheville who dropped five men dead in their tracks using only one cartridge for each, offers evidence that is sufficiently convincing.\" Cocaine, in other words, made black men uniquely murderous and better marksmen. But that wasn't all. It also produced \"a resistance to the 'knock down' effects of fatal wounds. Bullets fired into vital parts that would drop a sane man in his tracks, fail to check the 'fiend.'\" Preposterous? Yes, but such reporting was not the exception. Between 1898 and 1914, numerous articles appeared exaggerating the association of heinous crimes and cocaine use by blacks. In some cases, suspicion of cocaine intoxication by blacks was reason enough to justify lynchings. Eventually, it helped influence legislation. Around this time, Congress was debating whether to pass the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act, one of the country's first forays into national drug legislation. This unprecedented law sought to tax and regulate the production, importation and distribution of opium and coca products. Proponents of the law saw it as a strategy to improve strained trade relations with China by demonstrating a commitment to controlling the opium trade. Opponents, mostly from Southern states, viewed it as an intrusion into states' rights and had prevented passage of previous versions. By 1914, however, the law's proponents had found an important ally in their quest to get it passed: the mythical \"negro cocaine fiend,\" which prominent newspapers, physicians and politicians readily exploited. Indeed, at congressional hearings, \"experts\" testified that \"most of the attacks upon white women of the South are the direct result of a cocaine-crazed Negro brain.\" When the Harrison Act became law, proponents could thank the South's fear of blacks for easing its passage.

Although the Harrison Act did not explicitly prohibit the use of opiates or cocaine, enforcement of the new law quickly became increasingly punitive, helping set the stage for passage of the Eighteenth Amendment (alcohol prohibition) in 1919 and, ultimately, all our narcotics policy until 1970. As important, the rhetoric that laced those early conversations about drug use didn't just evaporate; it continued and evolved, reinventing itself most powerfully in the mythology of crack. From its earliest appearance in the 1980s, crack cocaine was steeped in a narrative of race and pathology. While powder cocaine came to be regarded as a symbol of luxury and associated with whites, crack was portrayed as producing uniquely addictive, unpredictable and deadly effects and associated with blacks. By this time, of course, references to race in such a context were no longer acceptable. So problems related to crack were described as being prevalent in \"poor,\" \"urban\" or \"troubled\" neighborhoods, \"inner cities\" and \"ghettos,\" terms that were codes for \"blacks\" and other undesired people. A March 7, 1987, New York Times article, \"New violence seen in users of cocaine\" offers a potent example. It describes an incident in which \"a man apparently using cocaine held four people hostage for 30 hours in an East Harlem apartment.\" That cocaine use was never confirmed was minimized; and since East Harlem was almost exclusively black and Latino, there was no need to mention the suspect's race. The message was clear: crack makes poor people of color crazy and violent. Over the next few years, a barrage of similar articles connected crack and its associated problems with black people. Entire specialty police units were deployed to \"troubled neighborhoods,\" making excessive arrests and subjecting the targeted communities to dehumanizing treatment. Along the way, complex economic and social forces were reduced to criminal justice problems; resources were directed toward law enforcement rather than neighborhoods' real needs, such as job creation. In 1986, Congress passed the infamous Anti-Drug Abuse Act, setting penalties that were 100 times harsher for crack than for powder cocaine convictions. We now know that an astonishing 85 percent of those sentenced for crack cocaine offenses were black, even though the majority of users of the drug were, and are, white. We also know that the effects of crack were greatly exaggerated; crack is no more harmful than powder cocaine. On August 3, 2010, President Obama signed legislation that reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine from 100:1 to 18:1. This is an important step, but any sentencing disparity in this case makes no sense. Black males are no longer lynched for violating drug laws, but they are killed. (Ramarley Graham, the unarmed Bronx teen who was chased into his bathroom and shot because police officers believed he had drugs, is just one recent example.) More common is the insidious damage inflicted on black men by the selective enforcement of drug laws. Arrested, incarcerated and placed under criminal justice supervision, they wind up marginalized and deprived of an education. Incredibly, one in three black boys born today will spend time in prison if this country doesn't alter its current approach. One hundred years after the myth of the \"Negro cocaine fiend\" helped sell the Harrison Act to Congress, its legacy lives on. Yet we no longer have the excuse of ignorance for indulging these kinds of wild fictions. It is long past time to ensure that our drug policies reflect reality and morality, not racism.\n\nThe provocatively headlined article had appeared in The New York Times on February 8, 1914.

Entire specialty police units were deployed to \"troubled neighborhoods,\" making excessive arrests and subjecting the targeted communities to dehumanizing treatment. Along the way, complex economic and social forces were reduced to criminal justice problems; resources were directed toward law enforcement rather than neighborhoods' real needs, such as job creation. In 1986, Congress passed the infamous Anti-Drug Abuse Act, setting penalties that were 100 times harsher for crack than for powder cocaine convictions. We now know that an astonishing 85 percent of those sentenced for crack cocaine offenses were black, even though the majority of users of the drug were, and are, white. We also know that the effects of crack were greatly exaggerated; crack is no more harmful than powder cocaine. On August 3, 2010, President Obama signed legislation that reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine from 100:1 to 18:1. This is an important step, but any sentencing disparity in this case makes no sense. Black males are no longer lynched for violating drug laws, but they are killed. (Ramarley Graham, the unarmed Bronx teen who was chased into his bathroom and shot because police officers believed he had drugs, is just one recent example.) More common is the insidious damage inflicted on black men by the selective enforcement of drug laws. Arrested, incarcerated and placed under criminal justice supervision, they wind up marginalized and deprived of an education. Incredibly, one in three black boys born today will spend time in prison if this country doesn't alter its current approach. One hundred years after the myth of the \"Negro cocaine fiend\" helped sell the Harrison Act to Congress, its legacy lives on. Yet we no longer have the excuse of ignorance for indulging these kinds of wild fictions. It is long past time to ensure that our drug policies reflect reality and morality, not racism.\n\nAround this time, Congress was debating whether to pass the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act, one of the country's first forays into national drug legislation. This unprecedented law sought to tax and regulate the production, importation and distribution of opium and coca products. Proponents of the law saw it as a strategy to improve strained trade relations with China by demonstrating a commitment to controlling the opium trade. Opponents, mostly from Southern states, viewed it as an intrusion into states' rights and had prevented passage of previous versions. By 1914, however, the law's proponents had found an important ally in their quest to get it passed: the mythical \"negro cocaine fiend,\" which prominent newspapers, physicians and politicians readily exploited. Indeed, at congressional hearings, \"experts\" testified that \"most of the attacks upon white women of the South are the direct result of a cocaine-crazed Negro brain.\" When the Harrison Act became law, proponents could thank the South's fear of blacks for easing its passage.

As important, the rhetoric that laced those early conversations about drug use didn't just evaporate; it continued and evolved, reinventing itself most powerfully in the mythology of crack. From its earliest appearance in the 1980s, crack cocaine was steeped in a narrative of race and pathology. While powder cocaine came to be regarded as a symbol of luxury and associated with whites, crack was portrayed as producing uniquely addictive, unpredictable and deadly effects and associated with blacks. By this time, of course, references to race in such a context were no longer acceptable.

While youth voting is on the rise, barriers to civic engagement among working-class black youth persist. How are activists going beyond voter registration to break down these barriers?   Beyond the Ballot: Young Black Men and Voting Donny Lumpkins September 4, 2008 Most grassroots organizers are as dedicated to their work as their offices are messy. For Rose Braz, the case is no different. As campaign director for Critical Resistance , she's part of a national network of grassroots organizers, community members, academics and former prisoners whose mission is as straightforward as it is challenging: to abolish prisons. Her Oakland office is filled with boxes, pamphlets and fliers. During this busy presidential campaign season, hers is one of the few national organizations not organizing directly to get out the vote. \"One in 100 adults are in jail in the United States,\" she says. \"For young black men between the ages of 20 and 34, that number is one in nine, and we're surprised that people don't want to vote?\" Critical Resistance views prisons as merely one part of the equation. The group's focus is on dismantling what advocates often refer to as the prison-industrial complex - namely, private businesses such as security firms and construction companies that profit from warehousing millions of people with little hope for rehabilitation. \"People are a little defeated,\" she says. \"The way the prison system is set up, you don't have to be behind bars to feel disenfranchised.\" Despite record numbers of young and new voters in this historical presidential election, voter disenfranchisement remains an issue for many young black men. New Voters, Old Barriers After the Civil War, Congress passed three important pieces of legislation known as the Reconstruction Amendments . The 13th Amendment to the Constitution abolished slavery, the 14th secured the constitutional rights of former slaves and the 15th gave black men the right to vote. Together, these acts helped form the crux of black political participation in America.

The 22-year-old Richmond, California native was born to a mother with lupus, and doctors expected him to suffer from severe mental and physical handicaps. To combat such harsh expectations, his parents chose a powerful name for their newborn son. \"There was no name that signified honor and respect more than 'President',\" he says. Now healthy, he's ready to finish his associate degree at Laney College in Oakland, and transfer to Howard University in the fall. Davies bears witness to the stark contrast in voting among his peers. \"Very few of my friends vote,\" he says. \"The ones who do are in college, and the rest who aren't in school are busy trying to find jobs.\" Davies' observation is consistent with national data that suggests a huge class divide within black civic engagement. In 2004, 47 percent of black youth turned out to vote ( PDF) , the highest level in the past 30 years and only 2.5 percentage points fewer than white voters. Yet black college students vote at much higher rates than youth without any college experience. Davies notes that a lack of time and a surplus of apathy don't explain his friends voting behavior. \"A lot of people feel disenfranchised,\" he said. \"If you don't feel connected to the society, why vote?\" Black Youth and Voting Contrary to popular belief, black youth are actually turning out to vote in record numbers. - In 2004, 47 percent of black youth (18-25) voted, the highest level in the past 30 years and only 2.5 percentage points fewer than white voters. - Since 1972, young black women (18-24) consistently voted at higher numbers than young black men. -Young black college students, however, vote at much higher rates than working-class youths without any college experience. In this year's primary elections, eight out of every ten voters were college students. *Source: Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement ( CIRCLE ) Still not registered to vote? It's quick and easy. Register! When asked if politicians address the issues he and his community face every day, Davies says that most of their challenges are under-represented.

According to the Sentencing Project , a research and advocacy organization that examines felony disenfranchisement, an estimated 5.3 million Americans are denied the right to vote because of felony convictions. That leaves 13 percent of black men unable to vote. \"You don't feel like a part of society. You actually feel like an outlaw, like somebody who has been left behind.

The 27-year-old black man was charged with a felony when he was younger and has since been stripped of his right to vote. Phillips is one of many black men who couldn't vote even if they wanted to. More than 60 percent of prisoners in the US are ethnic minorities. For black males in their twenties, statistics show that roughly one in nine is incarcerated. According to the Sentencing Project , a research and advocacy organization that examines felony disenfranchisement, an estimated 5.3 million Americans are denied the right to vote because of felony convictions. That leaves 13 percent of black men unable to vote. \"You don't feel like a part of society. You actually feel like an outlaw, like somebody who has been left behind. You did your time, you paid your dues and yet you are still punished,\" said Phillips. He grew up in San Francisco's Bayview - Hunters Point , a notoriously tough neighborhood. His childhood was made even more difficult after both of his parents were sent to prison. Left to provide for his sisters any way he could, he got into trouble with the law at an early age. \"You realize it's hard to get a job.

For Shakir, voting is a necessary component of justice. \"We, as a people, want power,\" he says. \"The way the system is set up, the power is in the political process.\" Yet that path toward justice is neither direct nor easy. More than a century after the Reconstruction Amendments were passed, granting them the right to vote, many black men are still focused on basic living. \"Voting is something you do when you're beyond survival mode,\" says Shakir. \"You don't vote when you're in survival mode.

For Rose Braz, the case is no different. As campaign director for Critical Resistance , she's part of a national network of grassroots organizers, community members, academics and former prisoners whose mission is as straightforward as it is challenging: to abolish prisons. Her Oakland office is filled with boxes, pamphlets and fliers. During this busy presidential campaign season, hers is one of the few national organizations not organizing directly to get out the vote. \"One in 100 adults are in jail in the United States,\" she says. \"For young black men between the ages of 20 and 34, that number is one in nine, and we're surprised that people don't want to vote?\" Critical Resistance views prisons as merely one part of the equation. The group's focus is on dismantling what advocates often refer to as the prison-industrial complex - namely, private businesses such as security firms and construction companies that profit from warehousing millions of people with little hope for rehabilitation. \"People are a little defeated,\" she says. \"The way the prison system is set up, you don't have to be behind bars to feel disenfranchised.\" Despite record numbers of young and new voters in this historical presidential election, voter disenfranchisement remains an issue for many young black men. New Voters, Old Barriers After the Civil War, Congress passed three important pieces of legislation known as the Reconstruction Amendments . The 13th Amendment to the Constitution abolished slavery, the 14th secured the constitutional rights of former slaves and the 15th gave black men the right to vote.

According to the Sentencing Project , a research and advocacy organization that examines felony disenfranchisement, an estimated 5.3 million Americans are denied the right to vote because of felony convictions. That leaves 13 percent of black men unable to vote. \"You don't feel like a part of society. You actually feel like an outlaw, like somebody who has been left behind. You did your time, you paid your dues and yet you are still punished,\" said Phillips. He grew up in San Francisco's Bayview - Hunters Point , a notoriously tough neighborhood. His childhood was made even more difficult after both of his parents were sent to prison. Left to provide for his sisters any way he could, he got into trouble with the law at an early age. \"You realize it's hard to get a job. You can't vote because you have a record, you can't go certain places. Your life is stripped from you. It doesn't stop [when you] get out of jail. You don't have a lot of freedom you should have.\" Eric now works with The Beat Within , a magazine that helps amplify the creative voices of incarcerated youth.

With 19 years in the game, Leadership Excellence is a major part of the lives of many young black youth in and around Oakland. Its signature program, Camp Akili , focuses on violence, critical thinking, building self-esteem and self-determination. This approach is coupled with identifying internalized depression in African and African-American youth and addressing it in a positive way with workshops and training programs. Shakir is the grandson of Carter Gilmore , the first black man elected to the Oakland City Council. A self-proclaimed native resident and homeowner in Oakland, Shakir says he chooses to vote out of respect for his ancestors' sacrifice. \"Growing up in East Oakland, I was trying to wear my Chuck Taylors and sport my red rag. I wasn't really tripping on voting,\" he said of his younger years. \"Voting became important between [the] ages of 18 and 21 when I was doing my own level of research around African and African-American history. I saw the struggle we went through as a people to get the right to vote, so I started voting.\" The question of how to get more working-class black men involved in the political process remains important. For Shakir, voting is a necessary component of justice. \"We, as a people, want power,\" he says. \"The way the system is set up, the power is in the political process.\" Yet that path toward justice is neither direct nor easy. More than a century after the Reconstruction Amendments were passed, granting them the right to vote, many black men are still focused on basic living. \"Voting is something you do when you're beyond survival mode,\" says Shakir. \"You don't vote when you're in survival mode.

The 27-year-old black man was charged with a felony when he was younger and has since been stripped of his right to vote. Phillips is one of many black men who couldn't vote even if they wanted to. More than 60 percent of prisoners in the US are ethnic minorities. For black males in their twenties, statistics show that roughly one in nine is incarcerated. According to the Sentencing Project , a research and advocacy organization that examines felony disenfranchisement, an estimated 5.3 million Americans are denied the right to vote because of felony convictions. That leaves 13 percent of black men unable to vote. \"You don't feel like a part of society. You actually feel like an outlaw, like somebody who has been left behind. You did your time, you paid your dues and yet you are still punished,\" said Phillips. He grew up in San Francisco's Bayview - Hunters Point , a notoriously tough neighborhood. His childhood was made even more difficult after both of his parents were sent to prison. Left to provide for his sisters any way he could, he got into trouble with the law at an early age. \"You realize it's hard to get a job.

Shakir is the grandson of Carter Gilmore , the first black man elected to the Oakland City Council. A self-proclaimed native resident and homeowner in Oakland, Shakir says he chooses to vote out of respect for his ancestors' sacrifice. \"Growing up in East Oakland, I was trying to wear my Chuck Taylors and sport my red rag. I wasn't really tripping on voting,\" he said of his younger years. \"Voting became important between [the] ages of 18 and 21 when I was doing my own level of research around African and African-American history. I saw the struggle we went through as a people to get the right to vote, so I started voting.\" The question of how to get more working-class black men involved in the political process remains important. For Shakir, voting is a necessary component of justice. \"We, as a people, want power,\" he says. \"The way the system is set up, the power is in the political process.\" Yet that path toward justice is neither direct nor easy. More than a century after the Reconstruction Amendments were passed, granting them the right to vote, many black men are still focused on basic living. \"Voting is something you do when you're beyond survival mode,\" says Shakir. \"You don't vote when you're in survival mode.

More than 60 percent of prisoners in the US are ethnic minorities. For black males in their twenties, statistics show that roughly one in nine is incarcerated. According to the Sentencing Project , a research and advocacy organization that examines felony disenfranchisement, an estimated 5.3 million Americans are denied the right to vote because of felony convictions. That leaves 13 percent of black men unable to vote. \"You don't feel like a part of society. You actually feel like an outlaw, like somebody who has been left behind. You did your time, you paid your dues and yet you are still punished,\" said Phillips. He grew up in San Francisco's Bayview - Hunters Point , a notoriously tough neighborhood. His childhood was made even more difficult after both of his parents were sent to prison. Left to provide for his sisters any way he could, he got into trouble with the law at an early age. \"You realize it's hard to get a job. You can't vote because you have a record, you can't go certain places. Your life is stripped from you. It doesn't stop [when you] get out of jail. You don't have a lot of freedom you should have.\" Eric now works with The Beat Within , a magazine that helps amplify the creative voices of incarcerated youth. Survival Mode Brother Saleem Shakir, associate director of the African-American youth development agency Leadership Excellence , works about a block from Critical Resistance. He's one of many young black men working to address systemic issues in his community outside of the more conventional definitions of civic engagement. With 19 years in the game, Leadership Excellence is a major part of the lives of many young black youth in and around Oakland. Its signature program, Camp Akili , focuses on violence, critical thinking, building self-esteem and self-determination. This approach is coupled with identifying internalized depression in African and African-American youth and addressing it in a positive way with workshops and training programs. Shakir is the grandson of Carter Gilmore , the first black man elected to the Oakland City Council. A self-proclaimed native resident and homeowner in Oakland, Shakir says he chooses to vote out of respect for his ancestors' sacrifice. \"Growing up in East Oakland, I was trying to wear my Chuck Taylors and sport my red rag. I wasn't really tripping on voting,\" he said of his younger years. \"Voting became important between [the] ages of 18 and 21 when I was doing my own level of research around African and African-American history. I saw the struggle we went through as a people to get the right to vote, so I started voting.\" The question of how to get more working-class black men involved in the political process remains important. For Shakir, voting is a necessary component of justice. \"We, as a people, want power,\" he says. \"The way the system is set up, the power is in the political process.\" Yet that path toward justice is neither direct nor easy. More than a century after the Reconstruction Amendments were passed, granting them the right to vote, many black men are still focused on basic living. \"Voting is something you do when you're beyond survival mode,\" says Shakir. \"You don't vote when you're in survival mode. And we have been conditioned in this country to stay in survival mode.\" Donny Lumpkins is a regular host, author and content producer for YO! Youth Outlook Multimedia .

When Obama greets his political allies, he does not give a simple, firm, businesslike handshake. Instead he offers the sort of dap-a little English in the wrist and a one-armed hug-that black males spend much of their adolescence perfecting. If elected, surely Obama will be the first President to greet foreign dignitaries with a pound. Obama warms up on election morning not by running a three-miler or swimming laps but by shooting hoops. The Illinois senator sports a flawless and ever-fresh Caesar demonstrative of the razorwork native to only one side of the tracks. Think Jay-Z-\"I'm not looking at you dudes/I'm looking past you\"-not Jay Rockefeller. Likewise, Obama's wife, Michelle, is not merely a black woman but a black woman bearing the diction of that particular tribe of overachieving South Side Chicago blacks who, as children, were corrected with old adages like \" ain't is not a word.\" Reporters have been stunned by her raw wit, by her unwillingness to fawn and gush over her husband. But that's standard procedure in black America, where conflicts stretching back to slave ships have taught women to spurn the Stepford act and view every alleged Lancelot askance. At campaign events Obama is known to crack himself up-once at a barbershop he began snapping, unprompted, on a customer's alligator shoes. During a speech in South Carolina, to the amusement of himself and a predominantly black crowd, Obama noted that his opponents were trying to \"bamboozle\" and \"hoodwink\" the voters. He pulled up after noting that he was \"having too much fun.\" The schooled observer could have seen through the first layer of laughter and beheld the real fun-here is a black man running for President by paraphrasing Malcolm X. Obama's favorite TV series is The Wire . His favorite character is Omar, the coal-black antihero who prowls the streets of West Baltimore toting a shotgun and robbing drug dealers. Of course, there's the matter of Obama's retired pastor, Jeremiah Wright, and his United Church of Christ, which right-wingers have taken to equating with Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, respectively. A few months before the professional babblers began frothing at the mouth over Wright, the Obama campaign got wind that it might have an image problem. Its response? Filming a YouTube spot of what must be one of only five white members praising the church's openness. It's the old \"some of my best friends are black\" misdirection play, but executed from the left side.

These pronouncements are almost always made by men who would most likely be hard-pressed to recall the last time they sat down to dinner with a black family. Their viewpoints are shaped by focus groups, polls and warmed-over bromides like \"defense moms\" and \"NASCAR dads.\" I can't think of a group more ill equipped to bear witness to humanity, much less a phenomenon as intricate and complicated as race in America. Meanwhile, African-American voters have broken for Obama in margins that make Hillary Clinton look about as popular in the neighborhood as Rudy Giuliani. In this, the hamfisted and befuddled intellects of the world see the \"advantages\" of being black: chief among them a mindless mass of zombies willing to stumble into poll booths and press a button for the black guy. But what the African-American Obama voter sees is so much more than just the first black President. Indeed, she sees the blackest man to take the public stage ever. Forget about reparations, welfare and white guilt. Forget about 400 years, forty acres and a mule. Forget about the Confederate flag, marching through Jena and Duke lacrosse. Barack Obama is black in the Zen-like way in which white people are white-without explanation. Without self-consciousness. Without permission. While we're at it, forget the man himself: the clearest evidence of Obama's blackness is his utter invisibility as a black man to the thinking class. The idea that took root as soon as Obama hit the national stage was that the junior senator from Illinois was not really black because he was raised in Hawaii by a white mother and does not scream about race every five minutes. When Obama made his now famous address to the 2004 Democratic convention, most of the earliest reactions denied the man's very existence. In the wake of his speech, most commentators sounded variations on the same false note. Christopher Buckley, in the New York Times , called him \"the new Tiger Woods of American politics,\" while William Saletan, in Slate , said, \"Obama isn't exactly black.\" In all justice, the blindness extended across the races. After the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination was under way, Stanley Crouch asserted that Obama does not \"share a heritage with the majority of black Americans,\" while Debra Dickerson simply stated that Obama wasn't black. Meanwhile, the Civil Rights Industrial Complex (CRIC), firmly allied with Hillary, did its best to dislodge Obama from the community he claimed as his own. Last fall, Andrew Young announced his support for Clinton on a local Atlanta news show; he'd probed his (presumably black) political connections in Chicago about Obama and reported that \"they don't know anybody around him.\" Then Young pushed things further, claiming that Bill Clinton is \"every bit as black as Barack.\" Since its conception in the guilt-wracked minds of slave traders, blackness has repeatedly sucked the light from otherwise intelligent folks, rendering them empty, dim vessels in its presence. But pundits did not simply stop at noting Obama's lack of soul; they went on to charge that their measure was somehow universal, that their pronouncements could be trusted as the Doppler radar of electoral breezes and gusts in the black community. The result was a flurry of stories, which employed the most preliminary of polls, asserting that Hillary Clinton's roots in the black community would ultimately trump Obama's. The swipe was twofold: it posited a black community wracked by xenophobic suspicion of Obama while putting distance between the obvious complexity of Obama and the assumed simple-mindedness of black people. In fact, the notion that Barack Obama would be banished because of his ancestry is the sort of unlettered theorizing that presumes black people are just a mirror image of whites. But unlike white Americans, blacks have centuries of experience dealing (sometimes not so kindly) with biracial people in their midst. For African-Americans, the blessing of the one-drop rule is blackness as a big tent. Indeed, the first Barack Obama was Frederick Douglass, a biracial slave and autodidact who throttled his slave breaker, fled to the North, traveled the world as an abolitionist, became an ally of Lincoln and published his poignant memoir, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave . For his troubles, Douglass was vilified in his time. Critics of his day asserted that no slave, current or ex, could write so movingly. Whites, on the other hand, often tend to be interested only in someone's biracial parentage, as if there's some credit to be taken. As Obama has acknowledged, were he a notorious drug lord-no matter his background-there would be no rush to analyze the impact of his biraciality. He would be black. There'd be no other choice. More recently, actual black people who do not talk for a living have rarely reached for the tool of public banishment. At our roots, there is something cloying about us. Having masqueraded as the great American pariah for all our collective lives, we are quick to flock to the banner of even those who want nothing to do with us. O.J. Simpson, who seemed to spurn his origins at every turn, was suddenly transformed into Malcolm X after he was accused of murder. The idea that a black community wracked by misfortune would reject a handsome, Ivy League-educated civil rights lawyer turned senator turned presidential candidate, who'd married a black woman and made his home on the South Side of Chicago-who actually had a chance to win-is, and was, laughable. The fraud was exposed as soon as South Carolina's exit polls started rolling in. Here is the lesson of it all: never write a book that can be summed up in a four-minute segment of Hardball . Item: Shelby Steele's A Bound Man: Why We Are Excited About Obama and Why He Can't Win . Christened \"America's foremost black intellectual\" by George Will-an unsurpassed authority in these matters-Steele is an artifact of the identity culture wars that plagued the 1980s and '90s. And when charged with analyzing Obama-mania, Steele declines to refit his spectacles for the post-9/11 era and instead reaches for the same rusting frames he's been using for almost two decades. \"The post-sixties black identity is essentially a totalitarian identity,\" he writes. \"It wants to be an activist identity; it wants black protest to be built into each black person's sense of self.\" What follows is a flat and contemptuous rendering of black America. Steele argues that Obama can't win because blacks will not vote for a man who doesn't yell \"white supremacy\" whenever he's presented with an open mike. Steele, like his compatriots in the pundit class, isn't one to allow actual people to get in the way of a good argument. Writing on hip-hop, he argues that rappers can never assume the iconic status needed to transcend America's racial divide. This would come as news to Will Smith, the first rapper to win a Grammy and currently the most bankable star in Hollywood. At his roots, Steele lacks the nuance to approach black America not as an idea but as a collection of actual thinking, breathing, contradicting (and self-contradictory) human beings. This is why so much of what's been said about Barack Obama and African-Americans has been so shockingly wrong. Intellectuals examining Obama are trapped in an ancient dynamic-one that even in its heyday was overstated-in which white and black America are constantly at each other's throats, and agree on nothing. The either/or fallacy is their default setting. (\"Assimilation, not blackness, is the road to success,\" writes Steele.) They were made for a world where affirmative action and welfare reform were campaign issues, not one where universal healthcare and the Iraq War have dominated the debate. A Bound Man has the whiff of an author who spends very little time around the people he deigns to judge. The book misses the essential power of Barack Obama: that he is revealing for white America the quiet mass of black people who do not spend their days calculating the wages of slavery. Steele can't grasp that blackness, like any cultural force, works quietly and has no desire to be folded into square minds. Fortunately, it's people, not caricatures, who vote. Thus, if you need any more evidence of Obama's blackness, do nothing more than look at the exit polls where he's dominated most demographics, but especially his own. I would like to say that this is beyond identity politics, but really it isn't. In South Carolina, where Obama's hoarding of the black vote began, Al Sharpton, four years earlier, finished third among black voters. But Sharpton, like his comrades among the CRIC, is weighted to a media-driven definition of blackness defined by opposition. Obama's blackness is at once futuristic and conservative. It recalls the blackness displayed in the novels of Zora Neale Hurston, in which racial paranoia is rendered an afterthought; it also reflects the experience of generations of black people who've encountered white America not as an idea but as a collection of individuals. Barack Obama hails from Hawaii, but he also has roots in a rather large tribe of African-Americans of recent vintage who are intimately acquainted with both Americas. Some of them were raised in the affluent suburbs by parents who'd known only the rot of inner cities. Many others, like Obama, are the product of interracial unions, privileged to experience both white and black people on intimate levels. They are the ones who spurned the Ivy League for Spelman and Morehouse, or who rebuffed offers from corporate law firms for a return to the streets. I speak not as one of them. I grew up like most of black America, de facto segregated. When I went off to college at historically black Howard University, blackness was only what I'd seen-row houses with shallow porches, a nasty crossover dribble, hard-driving parents and reverence for Nat Turner. But in my first year at Howard, I met all kinds-math majors fluent in Russian, Marilyn Manson fans, kids straight out of Jack and Jill with fond debutante memories. The first girl I ever fell for had an Indian father and a black mother. She would flash pictures from a photo album of her visits to the subcontinent. The next girl had turned down NYU for Howard and now ran the campus's embattled gay and lesbian club. What they all shared was a flight from bastions of whiteness, where their names were often shackled to the prefixes \"first\" and \"only.\" What they shared was a constant flurry of backhanded compliments from their white peers, who, having witnessed them succeed at anything nonathletic (AP English, debate team, smile), would assure them that they \"were not really black\" or at least \"were not like other blacks.\" From their unspoken variety, from the Alphas and Omegas, from the buoyant Afros and long dreads, from the night-blacks to those who were almost passing, I drew the great lesson that black was a country, a broad, beautiful America refracted through a smoky lens. For sure, they were different from me. I was young and bursting with militancy and nationalism-among my treasured effects were obscure tomes of proto-Afrocentricity, a burgeoning collection of music, a stack of notebooks crowded with bad poetry of the \"Kill Whitey\" persuasion. But when we talked, I could feel the shared essence between us. They were some of the most confident black people I'd ever known. All our lives we'd been raised to see white people as wraiths, as demigods worthy of either complete subservience or unrelenting opposition. This was the logic of our parents, who'd never been free to see whites as fully human and thus to see themselves in the same way. It's also the logic that Shelby Steele thinks still dominates black America. What I learned from the black émigrés who've walked through America, and what I gathered as I aged and walked the land myself, was that the much-ballyhooed powers of white people were neither good nor wicked, just overrated. This is the blackness of Barack Obama. It is an identity that asserts itself without conscious thought. It has no need of marches and placards. It rejects an opportunistic ignorance of racism but understands that esoteric ramblings about white-skin privilege do not move the discussion further. It does not need to bluster, to scream, to hyperbolize. Obama's blackness is like any other secure marker of identity, subtle and irreducible to a list of demands. It also lines up perfectly with even those younger blacks who've never ventured beyond the veil but who, minus the shadow of segregation, have concluded that their skin is as worthy as the next man's. This is why all the fuss over how much or how little Obama addresses racism misses the point. Obama mentions white racism about as often as black people actually think about white racism-which is to say rarely. This is not an endorsement. I came up waving The Final Call and convinced that the answer to everything lay in the last words of Frantz Fanon. To which most of my friends would reply, \"So, who won the game last night?\" Survey the average voter in Harlem, Detroit or West Baltimore, ask her to rank her presidential concerns and see where \"reparations\" or \"abolishing the Confederate flag\" compares with, say, \"healthcare\" or \"ending the war.\" In the wake of Obama's speech on race in Philadelphia, the pundits swooned, marveling specifically at Obama's willingness to say that those who fled inner-city America, who opposed affirmative action, were not racist. It is the final insult of segregation that such unthinking logic is allowed to stand. In fact, anyone who knows black folks understands that Obama had nothing to lose-black people have been fleeing those same inner-city neighborhoods since the 1970s. To see Obama's point as a mark of courage or even a concession, you'd have to imagine a black America that woke up, every morning, thinking only about welfare and affirmative action. The olive branch Obama extended to white people came directly from the grove of black America, not from some newly discovered transracial hinterland. This is why Obama was able to secure South Carolina without becoming entrenched in the patronage schemes of various black preachers. Obama is a black man, and thus he needed no surrogates to translate for him, no verification from the crumbling CRIC. Whatever comes of it from here on out for the larger country, Obama has redefined blackness for white America, has served notice that wherever we are, we are. What he is positing is blackness as a valid ethnic identity with its own particular folkways and yet still existing within the broader American continuum. Already a wave of black politicos-Deval Patrick, Corey Booker, Jesse Jackson Jr.-have raised a similar banner, and there is nothing \"postracial,\" \"postblack\" or \"transcendental\" about it. (By the way, does anyone call Joe Lieberman \"post-Jewish-American\" or Mel Martinez \"post-Cuban-American\"?) Indeed, it is a deeper black, the mark of a less defensive, more self-assured African-American leadership. Our forebears, God bless them, held blackness like an albatross, which they sought to affix around the neck of white America. But this generation, Obama's generation, holds blackness like a garland, sure in the knowledge that the only neck it belongs around is our own.\n\nTo say that Barack Obama is our first serious black presidential candidate drastically understates the matter. When Obama greets his political allies, he does not give a simple, firm, businesslike handshake. Instead he offers the sort of dap-a little English in the wrist and a one-armed hug-that black males spend much of their adolescence perfecting.

A Bound Man has the whiff of an author who spends very little time around the people he deigns to judge. The book misses the essential power of Barack Obama: that he is revealing for white America the quiet mass of black people who do not spend their days calculating the wages of slavery. Steele can't grasp that blackness, like any cultural force, works quietly and has no desire to be folded into square minds. Fortunately, it's people, not caricatures, who vote. Thus, if you need any more evidence of Obama's blackness, do nothing more than look at the exit polls where he's dominated most demographics, but especially his own. I would like to say that this is beyond identity politics, but really it isn't. In South Carolina, where Obama's hoarding of the black vote began, Al Sharpton, four years earlier, finished third among black voters. But Sharpton, like his comrades among the CRIC, is weighted to a media-driven definition of blackness defined by opposition. Obama's blackness is at once futuristic and conservative. It recalls the blackness displayed in the novels of Zora Neale Hurston, in which racial paranoia is rendered an afterthought; it also reflects the experience of generations of black people who've encountered white America not as an idea but as a collection of individuals. Barack Obama hails from Hawaii, but he also has roots in a rather large tribe of African-Americans of recent vintage who are intimately acquainted with both Americas. Some of them were raised in the affluent suburbs by parents who'd known only the rot of inner cities. Many others, like Obama, are the product of interracial unions, privileged to experience both white and black people on intimate levels. They are the ones who spurned the Ivy League for Spelman and Morehouse, or who rebuffed offers from corporate law firms for a return to the streets. I speak not as one of them. I grew up like most of black America, de facto segregated. When I went off to college at historically black Howard University, blackness was only what I'd seen-row houses with shallow porches, a nasty crossover dribble, hard-driving parents and reverence for Nat Turner. But in my first year at Howard, I met all kinds-math majors fluent in Russian, Marilyn Manson fans, kids straight out of Jack and Jill with fond debutante memories. The first girl I ever fell for had an Indian father and a black mother. She would flash pictures from a photo album of her visits to the subcontinent. The next girl had turned down NYU for Howard and now ran the campus's embattled gay and lesbian club. What they all shared was a flight from bastions of whiteness, where their names were often shackled to the prefixes \"first\" and \"only.\" What they shared was a constant flurry of backhanded compliments from their white peers, who, having witnessed them succeed at anything nonathletic (AP English, debate team, smile), would assure them that they \"were not really black\" or at least \"were not like other blacks.\" From their unspoken variety, from the Alphas and Omegas, from the buoyant Afros and long dreads, from the night-blacks to those who were almost passing, I drew the great lesson that black was a country, a broad, beautiful America refracted through a smoky lens. For sure, they were different from me. I was young and bursting with militancy and nationalism-among my treasured effects were obscure tomes of proto-Afrocentricity, a burgeoning collection of music, a stack of notebooks crowded with bad poetry of the \"Kill Whitey\" persuasion. But when we talked, I could feel the shared essence between us. They were some of the most confident black people I'd ever known. All our lives we'd been raised to see white people as wraiths, as demigods worthy of either complete subservience or unrelenting opposition. This was the logic of our parents, who'd never been free to see whites as fully human and thus to see themselves in the same way. It's also the logic that Shelby Steele thinks still dominates black America. What I learned from the black émigrés who've walked through America, and what I gathered as I aged and walked the land myself, was that the much-ballyhooed powers of white people were neither good nor wicked, just overrated. This is the blackness of Barack Obama. It is an identity that asserts itself without conscious thought. It has no need of marches and placards. It rejects an opportunistic ignorance of racism but understands that esoteric ramblings about white-skin privilege do not move the discussion further. It does not need to bluster, to scream, to hyperbolize. Obama's blackness is like any other secure marker of identity, subtle and irreducible to a list of demands. It also lines up perfectly with even those younger blacks who've never ventured beyond the veil but who, minus the shadow of segregation, have concluded that their skin is as worthy as the next man's. This is why all the fuss over how much or how little Obama addresses racism misses the point. Obama mentions white racism about as often as black people actually think about white racism-which is to say rarely. This is not an endorsement. I came up waving The Final Call and convinced that the answer to everything lay in the last words of Frantz Fanon. To which most of my friends would reply, \"So, who won the game last night?\" Survey the average voter in Harlem, Detroit or West Baltimore, ask her to rank her presidential concerns and see where \"reparations\" or \"abolishing the Confederate flag\" compares with, say, \"healthcare\" or \"ending the war.\" In the wake of Obama's speech on race in Philadelphia, the pundits swooned, marveling specifically at Obama's willingness to say that those who fled inner-city America, who opposed affirmative action, were not racist. It is the final insult of segregation that such unthinking logic is allowed to stand. In fact, anyone who knows black folks understands that Obama had nothing to lose-black people have been fleeing those same inner-city neighborhoods since the 1970s. To see Obama's point as a mark of courage or even a concession, you'd have to imagine a black America that woke up, every morning, thinking only about welfare and affirmative action. The olive branch Obama extended to white people came directly from the grove of black America, not from some newly discovered transracial hinterland. This is why Obama was able to secure South Carolina without becoming entrenched in the patronage schemes of various black preachers. Obama is a black man, and thus he needed no surrogates to translate for him, no verification from the crumbling CRIC. Whatever comes of it from here on out for the larger country, Obama has redefined blackness for white America, has served notice that wherever we are, we are. What he is positing is blackness as a valid ethnic identity with its own particular folkways and yet still existing within the broader American continuum. Already a wave of black politicos-Deval Patrick, Corey Booker, Jesse Jackson Jr.-have raised a similar banner, and there is nothing \"postracial,\" \"postblack\" or \"transcendental\" about it. (By the way, does anyone call Joe Lieberman \"post-Jewish-American\" or Mel Martinez \"post-Cuban-American\"?) Indeed, it is a deeper black, the mark of a less defensive, more self-assured African-American leadership. Our forebears, God bless them, held blackness like an albatross, which they sought to affix around the neck of white America. But this generation, Obama's generation, holds blackness like a garland, sure in the knowledge that the only neck it belongs around is our own.\n\nLikewise, Obama's wife, Michelle, is not merely a black woman but a black woman bearing the diction of that particular tribe of overachieving South Side Chicago blacks who, as children, were corrected with old adages like \" ain't is not a word.\" Reporters have been stunned by her raw wit, by her unwillingness to fawn and gush over her husband. But that's standard procedure in black America, where conflicts stretching back to slave ships have taught women to spurn the Stepford act and view every alleged Lancelot askance. At campaign events Obama is known to crack himself up-once at a barbershop he began snapping, unprompted, on a customer's alligator shoes. During a speech in South Carolina, to the amusement of himself and a predominantly black crowd, Obama noted that his opponents were trying to \"bamboozle\" and \"hoodwink\" the voters. He pulled up after noting that he was \"having too much fun.\" The schooled observer could have seen through the first layer of laughter and beheld the real fun-here is a black man running for President by paraphrasing Malcolm X. Obama's favorite TV series is The Wire . His favorite character is Omar, the coal-black antihero who prowls the streets of West Baltimore toting a shotgun and robbing drug dealers. Of course, there's the matter of Obama's retired pastor, Jeremiah Wright, and his United Church of Christ, which right-wingers have taken to equating with Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, respectively. A few months before the professional babblers began frothing at the mouth over Wright, the Obama campaign got wind that it might have an image problem. Its response? Filming a YouTube spot of what must be one of only five white members praising the church's openness. It's the old \"some of my best friends are black\" misdirection play, but executed from the left side.

These pronouncements are almost always made by men who would most likely be hard-pressed to recall the last time they sat down to dinner with a black family. Their viewpoints are shaped by focus groups, polls and warmed-over bromides like \"defense moms\" and \"NASCAR dads.\" I can't think of a group more ill equipped to bear witness to humanity, much less a phenomenon as intricate and complicated as race in America. Meanwhile, African-American voters have broken for Obama in margins that make Hillary Clinton look about as popular in the neighborhood as Rudy Giuliani. In this, the hamfisted and befuddled intellects of the world see the \"advantages\" of being black: chief among them a mindless mass of zombies willing to stumble into poll booths and press a button for the black guy. But what the African-American Obama voter sees is so much more than just the first black President. Indeed, she sees the blackest man to take the public stage ever. Forget about reparations, welfare and white guilt. Forget about 400 years, forty acres and a mule. Forget about the Confederate flag, marching through Jena and Duke lacrosse. Barack Obama is black in the Zen-like way in which white people are white-without explanation. Without self-consciousness. Without permission. While we're at it, forget the man himself: the clearest evidence of Obama's blackness is his utter invisibility as a black man to the thinking class. The idea that took root as soon as Obama hit the national stage was that the junior senator from Illinois was not really black because he was raised in Hawaii by a white mother and does not scream about race every five minutes. When Obama made his now famous address to the 2004 Democratic convention, most of the earliest reactions denied the man's very existence. In the wake of his speech, most commentators sounded variations on the same false note. Christopher Buckley, in the New York Times , called him \"the new Tiger Woods of American politics,\" while William Saletan, in Slate , said, \"Obama isn't exactly black.\" In all justice, the blindness extended across the races. After the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination was under way, Stanley Crouch asserted that Obama does not \"share a heritage with the majority of black Americans,\" while Debra Dickerson simply stated that Obama wasn't black. Meanwhile, the Civil Rights Industrial Complex (CRIC), firmly allied with Hillary, did its best to dislodge Obama from the community he claimed as his own. Last fall, Andrew Young announced his support for Clinton on a local Atlanta news show; he'd probed his (presumably black) political connections in Chicago about Obama and reported that \"they don't know anybody around him.\" Then Young pushed things further, claiming that Bill Clinton is \"every bit as black as Barack.\" Since its conception in the guilt-wracked minds of slave traders, blackness has repeatedly sucked the light from otherwise intelligent folks, rendering them empty, dim vessels in its presence. But pundits did not simply stop at noting Obama's lack of soul; they went on to charge that their measure was somehow universal, that their pronouncements could be trusted as the Doppler radar of electoral breezes and gusts in the black community. The result was a flurry of stories, which employed the most preliminary of polls, asserting that Hillary Clinton's roots in the black community would ultimately trump Obama's. The swipe was twofold: it posited a black community wracked by xenophobic suspicion of Obama while putting distance between the obvious complexity of Obama and the assumed simple-mindedness of black people. In fact, the notion that Barack Obama would be banished because of his ancestry is the sort of unlettered theorizing that presumes black people are just a mirror image of whites. But unlike white Americans, blacks have centuries of experience dealing (sometimes not so kindly) with biracial people in their midst. For African-Americans, the blessing of the one-drop rule is blackness as a big tent. Indeed, the first Barack Obama was Frederick Douglass, a biracial slave and autodidact who throttled his slave breaker, fled to the North, traveled the world as an abolitionist, became an ally of Lincoln and published his poignant memoir, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave . For his troubles, Douglass was vilified in his time. Critics of his day asserted that no slave, current or ex, could write so movingly. Whites, on the other hand, often tend to be interested only in someone's biracial parentage, as if there's some credit to be taken. As Obama has acknowledged, were he a notorious drug lord-no matter his background-there would be no rush to analyze the impact of his biraciality. He would be black. There'd be no other choice. More recently, actual black people who do not talk for a living have rarely reached for the tool of public banishment. At our roots, there is something cloying about us. Having masqueraded as the great American pariah for all our collective lives, we are quick to flock to the banner of even those who want nothing to do with us. O.J. Simpson, who seemed to spurn his origins at every turn, was suddenly transformed into Malcolm X after he was accused of murder. The idea that a black community wracked by misfortune would reject a handsome, Ivy League-educated civil rights lawyer turned senator turned presidential candidate, who'd married a black woman and made his home on the South Side of Chicago-who actually had a chance to win-is, and was, laughable. The fraud was exposed as soon as South Carolina's exit polls started rolling in. Here is the lesson of it all: never write a book that can be summed up in a four-minute segment of Hardball . Item: Shelby Steele's A Bound Man: Why We Are Excited About Obama and Why He Can't Win .

And when charged with analyzing Obama-mania, Steele declines to refit his spectacles for the post-9/11 era and instead reaches for the same rusting frames he's been using for almost two decades. \"The post-sixties black identity is essentially a totalitarian identity,\" he writes. \"It wants to be an activist identity; it wants black protest to be built into each black person's sense of self.\" What follows is a flat and contemptuous rendering of black America. Steele argues that Obama can't win because blacks will not vote for a man who doesn't yell \"white supremacy\" whenever he's presented with an open mike. Steele, like his compatriots in the pundit class, isn't one to allow actual people to get in the way of a good argument. Writing on hip-hop, he argues that rappers can never assume the iconic status needed to transcend America's racial divide. This would come as news to Will Smith, the first rapper to win a Grammy and currently the most bankable star in Hollywood. At his roots, Steele lacks the nuance to approach black America not as an idea but as a collection of actual thinking, breathing, contradicting (and self-contradictory) human beings. This is why so much of what's been said about Barack Obama and African-Americans has been so shockingly wrong.

A Bound Man has the whiff of an author who spends very little time around the people he deigns to judge. The book misses the essential power of Barack Obama: that he is revealing for white America the quiet mass of black people who do not spend their days calculating the wages of slavery. Steele can't grasp that blackness, like any cultural force, works quietly and has no desire to be folded into square minds. Fortunately, it's people, not caricatures, who vote. Thus, if you need any more evidence of Obama's blackness, do nothing more than look at the exit polls where he's dominated most demographics, but especially his own. I would like to say that this is beyond identity politics, but really it isn't. In South Carolina, where Obama's hoarding of the black vote began, Al Sharpton, four years earlier, finished third among black voters. But Sharpton, like his comrades among the CRIC, is weighted to a media-driven definition of blackness defined by opposition. Obama's blackness is at once futuristic and conservative. It recalls the blackness displayed in the novels of Zora Neale Hurston, in which racial paranoia is rendered an afterthought; it also reflects the experience of generations of black people who've encountered white America not as an idea but as a collection of individuals. Barack Obama hails from Hawaii, but he also has roots in a rather large tribe of African-Americans of recent vintage who are intimately acquainted with both Americas. Some of them were raised in the affluent suburbs by parents who'd known only the rot of inner cities. Many others, like Obama, are the product of interracial unions, privileged to experience both white and black people on intimate levels. They are the ones who spurned the Ivy League for Spelman and Morehouse, or who rebuffed offers from corporate law firms for a return to the streets. I speak not as one of them. I grew up like most of black America, de facto segregated. When I went off to college at historically black Howard University, blackness was only what I'd seen-row houses with shallow porches, a nasty crossover dribble, hard-driving parents and reverence for Nat Turner. But in my first year at Howard, I met all kinds-math majors fluent in Russian, Marilyn Manson fans, kids straight out of Jack and Jill with fond debutante memories. The first girl I ever fell for had an Indian father and a black mother. She would flash pictures from a photo album of her visits to the subcontinent. The next girl had turned down NYU for Howard and now ran the campus's embattled gay and lesbian club. What they all shared was a flight from bastions of whiteness, where their names were often shackled to the prefixes \"first\" and \"only.\" What they shared was a constant flurry of backhanded compliments from their white peers, who, having witnessed them succeed at anything nonathletic (AP English, debate team, smile), would assure them that they \"were not really black\" or at least \"were not like other blacks.\" From their unspoken variety, from the Alphas and Omegas, from the buoyant Afros and long dreads, from the night-blacks to those who were almost passing, I drew the great lesson that black was a country, a broad, beautiful America refracted through a smoky lens. For sure, they were different from me. I was young and bursting with militancy and nationalism-among my treasured effects were obscure tomes of proto-Afrocentricity, a burgeoning collection of music, a stack of notebooks crowded with bad poetry of the \"Kill Whitey\" persuasion. But when we talked, I could feel the shared essence between us. They were some of the most confident black people I'd ever known. All our lives we'd been raised to see white people as wraiths, as demigods worthy of either complete subservience or unrelenting opposition. This was the logic of our parents, who'd never been free to see whites as fully human and thus to see themselves in the same way. It's also the logic that Shelby Steele thinks still dominates black America. What I learned from the black émigrés who've walked through America, and what I gathered as I aged and walked the land myself, was that the much-ballyhooed powers of white people were neither good nor wicked, just overrated. This is the blackness of Barack Obama. It is an identity that asserts itself without conscious thought. It has no need of marches and placards. It rejects an opportunistic ignorance of racism but understands that esoteric ramblings about white-skin privilege do not move the discussion further. It does not need to bluster, to scream, to hyperbolize. Obama's blackness is like any other secure marker of identity, subtle and irreducible to a list of demands. It also lines up perfectly with even those younger blacks who've never ventured beyond the veil but who, minus the shadow of segregation, have concluded that their skin is as worthy as the next man's. This is why all the fuss over how much or how little Obama addresses racism misses the point. Obama mentions white racism about as often as black people actually think about white racism-which is to say rarely. This is not an endorsement. I came up waving The Final Call and convinced that the answer to everything lay in the last words of Frantz Fanon. To which most of my friends would reply, \"So, who won the game last night?\" Survey the average voter in Harlem, Detroit or West Baltimore, ask her to rank her presidential concerns and see where \"reparations\" or \"abolishing the Confederate flag\" compares with, say, \"healthcare\" or \"ending the war.\" In the wake of Obama's speech on race in Philadelphia, the pundits swooned, marveling specifically at Obama's willingness to say that those who fled inner-city America, who opposed affirmative action, were not racist. It is the final insult of segregation that such unthinking logic is allowed to stand. In fact, anyone who knows black folks understands that Obama had nothing to lose-black people have been fleeing those same inner-city neighborhoods since the 1970s. To see Obama's point as a mark of courage or even a concession, you'd have to imagine a black America that woke up, every morning, thinking only about welfare and affirmative action. The olive branch Obama extended to white people came directly from the grove of black America, not from some newly discovered transracial hinterland. This is why Obama was able to secure South Carolina without becoming entrenched in the patronage schemes of various black preachers. Obama is a black man, and thus he needed no surrogates to translate for him, no verification from the crumbling CRIC. Whatever comes of it from here on out for the larger country, Obama has redefined blackness for white America, has served notice that wherever we are, we are. What he is positing is blackness as a valid ethnic identity with its own particular folkways and yet still existing within the broader American continuum. Already a wave of black politicos-Deval Patrick, Corey Booker, Jesse Jackson Jr.-have raised a similar banner, and there is nothing \"postracial,\" \"postblack\" or \"transcendental\" about it. (By the way, does anyone call Joe Lieberman \"post-Jewish-American\" or Mel Martinez \"post-Cuban-American\"?) Indeed, it is a deeper black, the mark of a less defensive, more self-assured African-American leadership. Our forebears, God bless them, held blackness like an albatross, which they sought to affix around the neck of white America. But this generation, Obama's generation, holds blackness like a garland, sure in the knowledge that the only neck it belongs around is our own.\n\nObama's favorite TV series is The Wire . His favorite character is Omar, the coal-black antihero who prowls the streets of West Baltimore toting a shotgun and robbing drug dealers. Of course, there's the matter of Obama's retired pastor, Jeremiah Wright, and his United Church of Christ, which right-wingers have taken to equating with Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, respectively. A few months before the professional babblers began frothing at the mouth over Wright, the Obama campaign got wind that it might have an image problem. Its response? Filming a YouTube spot of what must be one of only five white members praising the church's openness. It's the old \"some of my best friends are black\" misdirection play, but executed from the left side.

These pronouncements are almost always made by men who would most likely be hard-pressed to recall the last time they sat down to dinner with a black family. Their viewpoints are shaped by focus groups, polls and warmed-over bromides like \"defense moms\" and \"NASCAR dads.\" I can't think of a group more ill equipped to bear witness to humanity, much less a phenomenon as intricate and complicated as race in America. Meanwhile, African-American voters have broken for Obama in margins that make Hillary Clinton look about as popular in the neighborhood as Rudy Giuliani. In this, the hamfisted and befuddled intellects of the world see the \"advantages\" of being black: chief among them a mindless mass of zombies willing to stumble into poll booths and press a button for the black guy. But what the African-American Obama voter sees is so much more than just the first black President. Indeed, she sees the blackest man to take the public stage ever. Forget about reparations, welfare and white guilt. Forget about 400 years, forty acres and a mule. Forget about the Confederate flag, marching through Jena and Duke lacrosse. Barack Obama is black in the Zen-like way in which white people are white-without explanation. Without self-consciousness. Without permission. While we're at it, forget the man himself: the clearest evidence of Obama's blackness is his utter invisibility as a black man to the thinking class. The idea that took root as soon as Obama hit the national stage was that the junior senator from Illinois was not really black because he was raised in Hawaii by a white mother and does not scream about race every five minutes. When Obama made his now famous address to the 2004 Democratic convention, most of the earliest reactions denied the man's very existence. In the wake of his speech, most commentators sounded variations on the same false note. Christopher Buckley, in the New York Times , called him \"the new Tiger Woods of American politics,\" while William Saletan, in Slate , said, \"Obama isn't exactly black.\" In all justice, the blindness extended across the races. After the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination was under way, Stanley Crouch asserted that Obama does not \"share a heritage with the majority of black Americans,\" while Debra Dickerson simply stated that Obama wasn't black. Meanwhile, the Civil Rights Industrial Complex (CRIC), firmly allied with Hillary, did its best to dislodge Obama from the community he claimed as his own. Last fall, Andrew Young announced his support for Clinton on a local Atlanta news show; he'd probed his (presumably black) political connections in Chicago about Obama and reported that \"they don't know anybody around him.\" Then Young pushed things further, claiming that Bill Clinton is \"every bit as black as Barack.\" Since its conception in the guilt-wracked minds of slave traders, blackness has repeatedly sucked the light from otherwise intelligent folks, rendering them empty, dim vessels in its presence. But pundits did not simply stop at noting Obama's lack of soul; they went on to charge that their measure was somehow universal, that their pronouncements could be trusted as the Doppler radar of electoral breezes and gusts in the black community. The result was a flurry of stories, which employed the most preliminary of polls, asserting that Hillary Clinton's roots in the black community would ultimately trump Obama's. The swipe was twofold: it posited a black community wracked by xenophobic suspicion of Obama while putting distance between the obvious complexity of Obama and the assumed simple-mindedness of black people. In fact, the notion that Barack Obama would be banished because of his ancestry is the sort of unlettered theorizing that presumes black people are just a mirror image of whites. But unlike white Americans, blacks have centuries of experience dealing (sometimes not so kindly) with biracial people in their midst. For African-Americans, the blessing of the one-drop rule is blackness as a big tent. Indeed, the first Barack Obama was Frederick Douglass, a biracial slave and autodidact who throttled his slave breaker, fled to the North, traveled the world as an abolitionist, became an ally of Lincoln and published his poignant memoir, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave . For his troubles, Douglass was vilified in his time. Critics of his day asserted that no slave, current or ex, could write so movingly. Whites, on the other hand, often tend to be interested only in someone's biracial parentage, as if there's some credit to be taken. As Obama has acknowledged, were he a notorious drug lord-no matter his background-there would be no rush to analyze the impact of his biraciality. He would be black. There'd be no other choice. More recently, actual black people who do not talk for a living have rarely reached for the tool of public banishment. At our roots, there is something cloying about us. Having masqueraded as the great American pariah for all our collective lives, we are quick to flock to the banner of even those who want nothing to do with us. O.J. Simpson, who seemed to spurn his origins at every turn, was suddenly transformed into Malcolm X after he was accused of murder. The idea that a black community wracked by misfortune would reject a handsome, Ivy League-educated civil rights lawyer turned senator turned presidential candidate, who'd married a black woman and made his home on the South Side of Chicago-who actually had a chance to win-is, and was, laughable. The fraud was exposed as soon as South Carolina's exit polls started rolling in. Here is the lesson of it all: never write a book that can be summed up in a four-minute segment of Hardball . Item: Shelby Steele's A Bound Man: Why We Are Excited About Obama and Why He Can't Win . Christened \"America's foremost black intellectual\" by George Will-an unsurpassed authority in these matters-Steele is an artifact of the identity culture wars that plagued the 1980s and '90s. And when charged with analyzing Obama-mania, Steele declines to refit his spectacles for the post-9/11 era and instead reaches for the same rusting frames he's been using for almost two decades. \"The post-sixties black identity is essentially a totalitarian identity,\" he writes. \"It wants to be an activist identity; it wants black protest to be built into each black person's sense of self.\" What follows is a flat and contemptuous rendering of black America. Steele argues that Obama can't win because blacks will not vote for a man who doesn't yell \"white supremacy\" whenever he's presented with an open mike. Steele, like his compatriots in the pundit class, isn't one to allow actual people to get in the way of a good argument. Writing on hip-hop, he argues that rappers can never assume the iconic status needed to transcend America's racial divide. This would come as news to Will Smith, the first rapper to win a Grammy and currently the most bankable star in Hollywood. At his roots, Steele lacks the nuance to approach black America not as an idea but as a collection of actual thinking, breathing, contradicting (and self-contradictory) human beings. This is why so much of what's been said about Barack Obama and African-Americans has been so shockingly wrong. Intellectuals examining Obama are trapped in an ancient dynamic-one that even in its heyday was overstated-in which white and black America are constantly at each other's throats, and agree on nothing. The either/or fallacy is their default setting. (\"Assimilation, not blackness, is the road to success,\" writes Steele.) They were made for a world where affirmative action and welfare reform were campaign issues, not one where universal healthcare and the Iraq War have dominated the debate.

What they all shared was a flight from bastions of whiteness, where their names were often shackled to the prefixes \"first\" and \"only.\" What they shared was a constant flurry of backhanded compliments from their white peers, who, having witnessed them succeed at anything nonathletic (AP English, debate team, smile), would assure them that they \"were not really black\" or at least \"were not like other blacks.\" From their unspoken variety, from the Alphas and Omegas, from the buoyant Afros and long dreads, from the night-blacks to those who were almost passing, I drew the great lesson that black was a country, a broad, beautiful America refracted through a smoky lens. For sure, they were different from me. I was young and bursting with militancy and nationalism-among my treasured effects were obscure tomes of proto-Afrocentricity, a burgeoning collection of music, a stack of notebooks crowded with bad poetry of the \"Kill Whitey\" persuasion. But when we talked, I could feel the shared essence between us. They were some of the most confident black people I'd ever known. All our lives we'd been raised to see white people as wraiths, as demigods worthy of either complete subservience or unrelenting opposition. This was the logic of our parents, who'd never been free to see whites as fully human and thus to see themselves in the same way. It's also the logic that Shelby Steele thinks still dominates black America. What I learned from the black émigrés who've walked through America, and what I gathered as I aged and walked the land myself, was that the much-ballyhooed powers of white people were neither good nor wicked, just overrated. This is the blackness of Barack Obama. It is an identity that asserts itself without conscious thought. It has no need of marches and placards. It rejects an opportunistic ignorance of racism but understands that esoteric ramblings about white-skin privilege do not move the discussion further. It does not need to bluster, to scream, to hyperbolize. Obama's blackness is like any other secure marker of identity, subtle and irreducible to a list of demands. It also lines up perfectly with even those younger blacks who've never ventured beyond the veil but who, minus the shadow of segregation, have concluded that their skin is as worthy as the next man's. This is why all the fuss over how much or how little Obama addresses racism misses the point. Obama mentions white racism about as often as black people actually think about white racism-which is to say rarely. This is not an endorsement. I came up waving The Final Call and convinced that the answer to everything lay in the last words of Frantz Fanon. To which most of my friends would reply, \"So, who won the game last night?\" Survey the average voter in Harlem, Detroit or West Baltimore, ask her to rank her presidential concerns and see where \"reparations\" or \"abolishing the Confederate flag\" compares with, say, \"healthcare\" or \"ending the war.\" In the wake of Obama's speech on race in Philadelphia, the pundits swooned, marveling specifically at Obama's willingness to say that those who fled inner-city America, who opposed affirmative action, were not racist. It is the final insult of segregation that such unthinking logic is allowed to stand. In fact, anyone who knows black folks understands that Obama had nothing to lose-black people have been fleeing those same inner-city neighborhoods since the 1970s. To see Obama's point as a mark of courage or even a concession, you'd have to imagine a black America that woke up, every morning, thinking only about welfare and affirmative action. The olive branch Obama extended to white people came directly from the grove of black America, not from some newly discovered transracial hinterland. This is why Obama was able to secure South Carolina without becoming entrenched in the patronage schemes of various black preachers. Obama is a black man, and thus he needed no surrogates to translate for him, no verification from the crumbling CRIC. Whatever comes of it from here on out for the larger country, Obama has redefined blackness for white America, has served notice that wherever we are, we are. What he is positing is blackness as a valid ethnic identity with its own particular folkways and yet still existing within the broader American continuum. Already a wave of black politicos-Deval Patrick, Corey Booker, Jesse Jackson Jr.-have raised a similar banner, and there is nothing \"postracial,\" \"postblack\" or \"transcendental\" about it. (By the way, does anyone call Joe Lieberman \"post-Jewish-American\" or Mel Martinez \"post-Cuban-American\"?) Indeed, it is a deeper black, the mark of a less defensive, more self-assured African-American leadership. Our forebears, God bless them, held blackness like an albatross, which they sought to affix around the neck of white America. But this generation, Obama's generation, holds blackness like a garland, sure in the knowledge that the only neck it belongs around is our own.\n\nMeanwhile, African-American voters have broken for Obama in margins that make Hillary Clinton look about as popular in the neighborhood as Rudy Giuliani. In this, the hamfisted and befuddled intellects of the world see the \"advantages\" of being black: chief among them a mindless mass of zombies willing to stumble into poll booths and press a button for the black guy. But what the African-American Obama voter sees is so much more than just the first black President. Indeed, she sees the blackest man to take the public stage ever. Forget about reparations, welfare and white guilt. Forget about 400 years, forty acres and a mule. Forget about the Confederate flag, marching through Jena and Duke lacrosse. Barack Obama is black in the Zen-like way in which white people are white-without explanation. Without self-consciousness. Without permission. While we're at it, forget the man himself: the clearest evidence of Obama's blackness is his utter invisibility as a black man to the thinking class. The idea that took root as soon as Obama hit the national stage was that the junior senator from Illinois was not really black because he was raised in Hawaii by a white mother and does not scream about race every five minutes. When Obama made his now famous address to the 2004 Democratic convention, most of the earliest reactions denied the man's very existence. In the wake of his speech, most commentators sounded variations on the same false note. Christopher Buckley, in the New York Times , called him \"the new Tiger Woods of American politics,\" while William Saletan, in Slate , said, \"Obama isn't exactly black.\" In all justice, the blindness extended across the races. After the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination was under way, Stanley Crouch asserted that Obama does not \"share a heritage with the majority of black Americans,\" while Debra Dickerson simply stated that Obama wasn't black. Meanwhile, the Civil Rights Industrial Complex (CRIC), firmly allied with Hillary, did its best to dislodge Obama from the community he claimed as his own. Last fall, Andrew Young announced his support for Clinton on a local Atlanta news show; he'd probed his (presumably black) political connections in Chicago about Obama and reported that \"they don't know anybody around him.\" Then Young pushed things further, claiming that Bill Clinton is \"every bit as black as Barack.\" Since its conception in the guilt-wracked minds of slave traders, blackness has repeatedly sucked the light from otherwise intelligent folks, rendering them empty, dim vessels in its presence. But pundits did not simply stop at noting Obama's lack of soul; they went on to charge that their measure was somehow universal, that their pronouncements could be trusted as the Doppler radar of electoral breezes and gusts in the black community. The result was a flurry of stories, which employed the most preliminary of polls, asserting that Hillary Clinton's roots in the black community would ultimately trump Obama's. The swipe was twofold: it posited a black community wracked by xenophobic suspicion of Obama while putting distance between the obvious complexity of Obama and the assumed simple-mindedness of black people. In fact, the notion that Barack Obama would be banished because of his ancestry is the sort of unlettered theorizing that presumes black people are just a mirror image of whites. But unlike white Americans, blacks have centuries of experience dealing (sometimes not so kindly) with biracial people in their midst. For African-Americans, the blessing of the one-drop rule is blackness as a big tent. Indeed, the first Barack Obama was Frederick Douglass, a biracial slave and autodidact who throttled his slave breaker, fled to the North, traveled the world as an abolitionist, became an ally of Lincoln and published his poignant memoir, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave . For his troubles, Douglass was vilified in his time. Critics of his day asserted that no slave, current or ex, could write so movingly. Whites, on the other hand, often tend to be interested only in someone's biracial parentage, as if there's some credit to be taken. As Obama has acknowledged, were he a notorious drug lord-no matter his background-there would be no rush to analyze the impact of his biraciality. He would be black. There'd be no other choice. More recently, actual black people who do not talk for a living have rarely reached for the tool of public banishment. At our roots, there is something cloying about us. Having masqueraded as the great American pariah for all our collective lives, we are quick to flock to the banner of even those who want nothing to do with us. O.J. Simpson, who seemed to spurn his origins at every turn, was suddenly transformed into Malcolm X after he was accused of murder. The idea that a black community wracked by misfortune would reject a handsome, Ivy League-educated civil rights lawyer turned senator turned presidential candidate, who'd married a black woman and made his home on the South Side of Chicago-who actually had a chance to win-is, and was, laughable. The fraud was exposed as soon as South Carolina's exit polls started rolling in. Here is the lesson of it all: never write a book that can be summed up in a four-minute segment of Hardball . Item: Shelby Steele's A Bound Man: Why We Are Excited About Obama and Why He Can't Win . Christened \"America's foremost black intellectual\" by George Will-an unsurpassed authority in these matters-Steele is an artifact of the identity culture wars that plagued the 1980s and '90s. And when charged with analyzing Obama-mania, Steele declines to refit his spectacles for the post-9/11 era and instead reaches for the same rusting frames he's been using for almost two decades. \"The post-sixties black identity is essentially a totalitarian identity,\" he writes. \"It wants to be an activist identity; it wants black protest to be built into each black person's sense of self.\" What follows is a flat and contemptuous rendering of black America. Steele argues that Obama can't win because blacks will not vote for a man who doesn't yell \"white supremacy\" whenever he's presented with an open mike. Steele, like his compatriots in the pundit class, isn't one to allow actual people to get in the way of a good argument. Writing on hip-hop, he argues that rappers can never assume the iconic status needed to transcend America's racial divide. This would come as news to Will Smith, the first rapper to win a Grammy and currently the most bankable star in Hollywood. At his roots, Steele lacks the nuance to approach black America not as an idea but as a collection of actual thinking, breathing, contradicting (and self-contradictory) human beings. This is why so much of what's been said about Barack Obama and African-Americans has been so shockingly wrong. Intellectuals examining Obama are trapped in an ancient dynamic-one that even in its heyday was overstated-in which white and black America are constantly at each other's throats, and agree on nothing. The either/or fallacy is their default setting. (\"Assimilation, not blackness, is the road to success,\" writes Steele.) They were made for a world where affirmative action and welfare reform were campaign issues, not one where universal healthcare and the Iraq War have dominated the debate. A Bound Man has the whiff of an author who spends very little time around the people he deigns to judge. The book misses the essential power of Barack Obama: that he is revealing for white America the quiet mass of black people who do not spend their days calculating the wages of slavery. Steele can't grasp that blackness, like any cultural force, works quietly and has no desire to be folded into square minds. Fortunately, it's people, not caricatures, who vote. Thus, if you need any more evidence of Obama's blackness, do nothing more than look at the exit polls where he's dominated most demographics, but especially his own. I would like to say that this is beyond identity politics, but really it isn't. In South Carolina, where Obama's hoarding of the black vote began, Al Sharpton, four years earlier, finished third among black voters. But Sharpton, like his comrades among the CRIC, is weighted to a media-driven definition of blackness defined by opposition. Obama's blackness is at once futuristic and conservative. It recalls the blackness displayed in the novels of Zora Neale Hurston, in which racial paranoia is rendered an afterthought; it also reflects the experience of generations of black people who've encountered white America not as an idea but as a collection of individuals. Barack Obama hails from Hawaii, but he also has roots in a rather large tribe of African-Americans of recent vintage who are intimately acquainted with both Americas. Some of them were raised in the affluent suburbs by parents who'd known only the rot of inner cities. Many others, like Obama, are the product of interracial unions, privileged to experience both white and black people on intimate levels. They are the ones who spurned the Ivy League for Spelman and Morehouse, or who rebuffed offers from corporate law firms for a return to the streets. I speak not as one of them. I grew up like most of black America, de facto segregated. When I went off to college at historically black Howard University, blackness was only what I'd seen-row houses with shallow porches, a nasty crossover dribble, hard-driving parents and reverence for Nat Turner. But in my first year at Howard, I met all kinds-math majors fluent in Russian, Marilyn Manson fans, kids straight out of Jack and Jill with fond debutante memories. The first girl I ever fell for had an Indian father and a black mother. She would flash pictures from a photo album of her visits to the subcontinent. The next girl had turned down NYU for Howard and now ran the campus's embattled gay and lesbian club. What they all shared was a flight from bastions of whiteness, where their names were often shackled to the prefixes \"first\" and \"only.\" What they shared was a constant flurry of backhanded compliments from their white peers, who, having witnessed them succeed at anything nonathletic (AP English, debate team, smile), would assure them that they \"were not really black\" or at least \"were not like other blacks.\" From their unspoken variety, from the Alphas and Omegas, from the buoyant Afros and long dreads, from the night-blacks to those who were almost passing, I drew the great lesson that black was a country, a broad, beautiful America refracted through a smoky lens. For sure, they were different from me.

As Obama has acknowledged, were he a notorious drug lord-no matter his background-there would be no rush to analyze the impact of his biraciality. He would be black. There'd be no other choice. More recently, actual black people who do not talk for a living have rarely reached for the tool of public banishment. At our roots, there is something cloying about us. Having masqueraded as the great American pariah for all our collective lives, we are quick to flock to the banner of even those who want nothing to do with us. O.J. Simpson, who seemed to spurn his origins at every turn, was suddenly transformed into Malcolm X after he was accused of murder. The idea that a black community wracked by misfortune would reject a handsome, Ivy League-educated civil rights lawyer turned senator turned presidential candidate, who'd married a black woman and made his home on the South Side of Chicago-who actually had a chance to win-is, and was, laughable. The fraud was exposed as soon as South Carolina's exit polls started rolling in. Here is the lesson of it all: never write a book that can be summed up in a four-minute segment of Hardball . Item: Shelby Steele's A Bound Man: Why We Are Excited About Obama and Why He Can't Win . Christened \"America's foremost black intellectual\" by George Will-an unsurpassed authority in these matters-Steele is an artifact of the identity culture wars that plagued the 1980s and '90s. And when charged with analyzing Obama-mania, Steele declines to refit his spectacles for the post-9/11 era and instead reaches for the same rusting frames he's been using for almost two decades. \"The post-sixties black identity is essentially a totalitarian identity,\" he writes. \"It wants to be an activist identity; it wants black protest to be built into each black person's sense of self.\" What follows is a flat and contemptuous rendering of black America. Steele argues that Obama can't win because blacks will not vote for a man who doesn't yell \"white supremacy\" whenever he's presented with an open mike. Steele, like his compatriots in the pundit class, isn't one to allow actual people to get in the way of a good argument. Writing on hip-hop, he argues that rappers can never assume the iconic status needed to transcend America's racial divide. This would come as news to Will Smith, the first rapper to win a Grammy and currently the most bankable star in Hollywood. At his roots, Steele lacks the nuance to approach black America not as an idea but as a collection of actual thinking, breathing, contradicting (and self-contradictory) human beings. This is why so much of what's been said about Barack Obama and African-Americans has been so shockingly wrong. Intellectuals examining Obama are trapped in an ancient dynamic-one that even in its heyday was overstated-in which white and black America are constantly at each other's throats, and agree on nothing. The either/or fallacy is their default setting. (\"Assimilation, not blackness, is the road to success,\" writes Steele.) They were made for a world where affirmative action and welfare reform were campaign issues, not one where universal healthcare and the Iraq War have dominated the debate. A Bound Man has the whiff of an author who spends very little time around the people he deigns to judge. The book misses the essential power of Barack Obama: that he is revealing for white America the quiet mass of black people who do not spend their days calculating the wages of slavery. Steele can't grasp that blackness, like any cultural force, works quietly and has no desire to be folded into square minds. Fortunately, it's people, not caricatures, who vote. Thus, if you need any more evidence of Obama's blackness, do nothing more than look at the exit polls where he's dominated most demographics, but especially his own. I would like to say that this is beyond identity politics, but really it isn't. In South Carolina, where Obama's hoarding of the black vote began, Al Sharpton, four years earlier, finished third among black voters. But Sharpton, like his comrades among the CRIC, is weighted to a media-driven definition of blackness defined by opposition. Obama's blackness is at once futuristic and conservative. It recalls the blackness displayed in the novels of Zora Neale Hurston, in which racial paranoia is rendered an afterthought; it also reflects the experience of generations of black people who've encountered white America not as an idea but as a collection of individuals. Barack Obama hails from Hawaii, but he also has roots in a rather large tribe of African-Americans of recent vintage who are intimately acquainted with both Americas. Some of them were raised in the affluent suburbs by parents who'd known only the rot of inner cities. Many others, like Obama, are the product of interracial unions, privileged to experience both white and black people on intimate levels. They are the ones who spurned the Ivy League for Spelman and Morehouse, or who rebuffed offers from corporate law firms for a return to the streets. I speak not as one of them. I grew up like most of black America, de facto segregated. When I went off to college at historically black Howard University, blackness was only what I'd seen-row houses with shallow porches, a nasty crossover dribble, hard-driving parents and reverence for Nat Turner. But in my first year at Howard, I met all kinds-math majors fluent in Russian, Marilyn Manson fans, kids straight out of Jack and Jill with fond debutante memories. The first girl I ever fell for had an Indian father and a black mother. She would flash pictures from a photo album of her visits to the subcontinent. The next girl had turned down NYU for Howard and now ran the campus's embattled gay and lesbian club. What they all shared was a flight from bastions of whiteness, where their names were often shackled to the prefixes \"first\" and \"only.\" What they shared was a constant flurry of backhanded compliments from their white peers, who, having witnessed them succeed at anything nonathletic (AP English, debate team, smile), would assure them that they \"were not really black\" or at least \"were not like other blacks.\" From their unspoken variety, from the Alphas and Omegas, from the buoyant Afros and long dreads, from the night-blacks to those who were almost passing, I drew the great lesson that black was a country, a broad, beautiful America refracted through a smoky lens. For sure, they were different from me. I was young and bursting with militancy and nationalism-among my treasured effects were obscure tomes of proto-Afrocentricity, a burgeoning collection of music, a stack of notebooks crowded with bad poetry of the \"Kill Whitey\" persuasion. But when we talked, I could feel the shared essence between us. They were some of the most confident black people I'd ever known. All our lives we'd been raised to see white people as wraiths, as demigods worthy of either complete subservience or unrelenting opposition. This was the logic of our parents, who'd never been free to see whites as fully human and thus to see themselves in the same way. It's also the logic that Shelby Steele thinks still dominates black America. What I learned from the black émigrés who've walked through America, and what I gathered as I aged and walked the land myself, was that the much-ballyhooed powers of white people were neither good nor wicked, just overrated. This is the blackness of Barack Obama. It is an identity that asserts itself without conscious thought. It has no need of marches and placards. It rejects an opportunistic ignorance of racism but understands that esoteric ramblings about white-skin privilege do not move the discussion further. It does not need to bluster, to scream, to hyperbolize. Obama's blackness is like any other secure marker of identity, subtle and irreducible to a list of demands. It also lines up perfectly with even those younger blacks who've never ventured beyond the veil but who, minus the shadow of segregation, have concluded that their skin is as worthy as the next man's. This is why all the fuss over how much or how little Obama addresses racism misses the point. Obama mentions white racism about as often as black people actually think about white racism-which is to say rarely. This is not an endorsement. I came up waving The Final Call and convinced that the answer to everything lay in the last words of Frantz Fanon. To which most of my friends would reply, \"So, who won the game last night?\" Survey the average voter in Harlem, Detroit or West Baltimore, ask her to rank her presidential concerns and see where \"reparations\" or \"abolishing the Confederate flag\" compares with, say, \"healthcare\" or \"ending the war.\" In the wake of Obama's speech on race in Philadelphia, the pundits swooned, marveling specifically at Obama's willingness to say that those who fled inner-city America, who opposed affirmative action, were not racist. It is the final insult of segregation that such unthinking logic is allowed to stand. In fact, anyone who knows black folks understands that Obama had nothing to lose-black people have been fleeing those same inner-city neighborhoods since the 1970s. To see Obama's point as a mark of courage or even a concession, you'd have to imagine a black America that woke up, every morning, thinking only about welfare and affirmative action. The olive branch Obama extended to white people came directly from the grove of black America, not from some newly discovered transracial hinterland. This is why Obama was able to secure South Carolina without becoming entrenched in the patronage schemes of various black preachers. Obama is a black man, and thus he needed no surrogates to translate for him, no verification from the crumbling CRIC. Whatever comes of it from here on out for the larger country, Obama has redefined blackness for white America, has served notice that wherever we are, we are. What he is positing is blackness as a valid ethnic identity with its own particular folkways and yet still existing within the broader American continuum. Already a wave of black politicos-Deval Patrick, Corey Booker, Jesse Jackson Jr.-have raised a similar banner, and there is nothing \"postracial,\" \"postblack\" or \"transcendental\" about it. (By the way, does anyone call Joe Lieberman \"post-Jewish-American\" or Mel Martinez \"post-Cuban-American\"?) Indeed, it is a deeper black, the mark of a less defensive, more self-assured African-American leadership. Our forebears, God bless them, held blackness like an albatross, which they sought to affix around the neck of white America. But this generation, Obama's generation, holds blackness like a garland, sure in the knowledge that the only neck it belongs around is our own.\n\nSince its conception in the guilt-wracked minds of slave traders, blackness has repeatedly sucked the light from otherwise intelligent folks, rendering them empty, dim vessels in its presence. But pundits did not simply stop at noting Obama's lack of soul; they went on to charge that their measure was somehow universal, that their pronouncements could be trusted as the Doppler radar of electoral breezes and gusts in the black community. The result was a flurry of stories, which employed the most preliminary of polls, asserting that Hillary Clinton's roots in the black community would ultimately trump Obama's. The swipe was twofold: it posited a black community wracked by xenophobic suspicion of Obama while putting distance between the obvious complexity of Obama and the assumed simple-mindedness of black people. In fact, the notion that Barack Obama would be banished because of his ancestry is the sort of unlettered theorizing that presumes black people are just a mirror image of whites. But unlike white Americans, blacks have centuries of experience dealing (sometimes not so kindly) with biracial people in their midst. For African-Americans, the blessing of the one-drop rule is blackness as a big tent. Indeed, the first Barack Obama was Frederick Douglass, a biracial slave and autodidact who throttled his slave breaker, fled to the North, traveled the world as an abolitionist, became an ally of Lincoln and published his poignant memoir, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave . For his troubles, Douglass was vilified in his time. Critics of his day asserted that no slave, current or ex, could write so movingly. Whites, on the other hand, often tend to be interested only in someone's biracial parentage, as if there's some credit to be taken.

Indeed, the first Barack Obama was Frederick Douglass, a biracial slave and autodidact who throttled his slave breaker, fled to the North, traveled the world as an abolitionist, became an ally of Lincoln and published his poignant memoir, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave . For his troubles, Douglass was vilified in his time. Critics of his day asserted that no slave, current or ex, could write so movingly. Whites, on the other hand, often tend to be interested only in someone's biracial parentage, as if there's some credit to be taken. As Obama has acknowledged, were he a notorious drug lord-no matter his background-there would be no rush to analyze the impact of his biraciality. He would be black. There'd be no other choice. More recently, actual black people who do not talk for a living have rarely reached for the tool of public banishment. At our roots, there is something cloying about us. Having masqueraded as the great American pariah for all our collective lives, we are quick to flock to the banner of even those who want nothing to do with us. O.J. Simpson, who seemed to spurn his origins at every turn, was suddenly transformed into Malcolm X after he was accused of murder. The idea that a black community wracked by misfortune would reject a handsome, Ivy League-educated civil rights lawyer turned senator turned presidential candidate, who'd married a black woman and made his home on the South Side of Chicago-who actually had a chance to win-is, and was, laughable. The fraud was exposed as soon as South Carolina's exit polls started rolling in. Here is the lesson of it all: never write a book that can be summed up in a four-minute segment of Hardball . Item: Shelby Steele's A Bound Man: Why We Are Excited About Obama and Why He Can't Win . Christened \"America's foremost black intellectual\" by George Will-an unsurpassed authority in these matters-Steele is an artifact of the identity culture wars that plagued the 1980s and '90s. And when charged with analyzing Obama-mania, Steele declines to refit his spectacles for the post-9/11 era and instead reaches for the same rusting frames he's been using for almost two decades. \"The post-sixties black identity is essentially a totalitarian identity,\" he writes. \"It wants to be an activist identity; it wants black protest to be built into each black person's sense of self.\" What follows is a flat and contemptuous rendering of black America. Steele argues that Obama can't win because blacks will not vote for a man who doesn't yell \"white supremacy\" whenever he's presented with an open mike. Steele, like his compatriots in the pundit class, isn't one to allow actual people to get in the way of a good argument. Writing on hip-hop, he argues that rappers can never assume the iconic status needed to transcend America's racial divide. This would come as news to Will Smith, the first rapper to win a Grammy and currently the most bankable star in Hollywood. At his roots, Steele lacks the nuance to approach black America not as an idea but as a collection of actual thinking, breathing, contradicting (and self-contradictory) human beings. This is why so much of what's been said about Barack Obama and African-Americans has been so shockingly wrong. Intellectuals examining Obama are trapped in an ancient dynamic-one that even in its heyday was overstated-in which white and black America are constantly at each other's throats, and agree on nothing. The either/or fallacy is their default setting. (\"Assimilation, not blackness, is the road to success,\" writes Steele.) They were made for a world where affirmative action and welfare reform were campaign issues, not one where universal healthcare and the Iraq War have dominated the debate. A Bound Man has the whiff of an author who spends very little time around the people he deigns to judge. The book misses the essential power of Barack Obama: that he is revealing for white America the quiet mass of black people who do not spend their days calculating the wages of slavery. Steele can't grasp that blackness, like any cultural force, works quietly and has no desire to be folded into square minds. Fortunately, it's people, not caricatures, who vote. Thus, if you need any more evidence of Obama's blackness, do nothing more than look at the exit polls where he's dominated most demographics, but especially his own. I would like to say that this is beyond identity politics, but really it isn't. In South Carolina, where Obama's hoarding of the black vote began, Al Sharpton, four years earlier, finished third among black voters. But Sharpton, like his comrades among the CRIC, is weighted to a media-driven definition of blackness defined by opposition. Obama's blackness is at once futuristic and conservative. It recalls the blackness displayed in the novels of Zora Neale Hurston, in which racial paranoia is rendered an afterthought; it also reflects the experience of generations of black people who've encountered white America not as an idea but as a collection of individuals. Barack Obama hails from Hawaii, but he also has roots in a rather large tribe of African-Americans of recent vintage who are intimately acquainted with both Americas. Some of them were raised in the affluent suburbs by parents who'd known only the rot of inner cities. Many others, like Obama, are the product of interracial unions, privileged to experience both white and black people on intimate levels. They are the ones who spurned the Ivy League for Spelman and Morehouse, or who rebuffed offers from corporate law firms for a return to the streets. I speak not as one of them. I grew up like most of black America, de facto segregated. When I went off to college at historically black Howard University, blackness was only what I'd seen-row houses with shallow porches, a nasty crossover dribble, hard-driving parents and reverence for Nat Turner. But in my first year at Howard, I met all kinds-math majors fluent in Russian, Marilyn Manson fans, kids straight out of Jack and Jill with fond debutante memories. The first girl I ever fell for had an Indian father and a black mother. She would flash pictures from a photo album of her visits to the subcontinent. The next girl had turned down NYU for Howard and now ran the campus's embattled gay and lesbian club. What they all shared was a flight from bastions of whiteness, where their names were often shackled to the prefixes \"first\" and \"only.\" What they shared was a constant flurry of backhanded compliments from their white peers, who, having witnessed them succeed at anything nonathletic (AP English, debate team, smile), would assure them that they \"were not really black\" or at least \"were not like other blacks.\" From their unspoken variety, from the Alphas and Omegas, from the buoyant Afros and long dreads, from the night-blacks to those who were almost passing, I drew the great lesson that black was a country, a broad, beautiful America refracted through a smoky lens. For sure, they were different from me. I was young and bursting with militancy and nationalism-among my treasured effects were obscure tomes of proto-Afrocentricity, a burgeoning collection of music, a stack of notebooks crowded with bad poetry of the \"Kill Whitey\" persuasion. But when we talked, I could feel the shared essence between us. They were some of the most confident black people I'd ever known. All our lives we'd been raised to see white people as wraiths, as demigods worthy of either complete subservience or unrelenting opposition. This was the logic of our parents, who'd never been free to see whites as fully human and thus to see themselves in the same way. It's also the logic that Shelby Steele thinks still dominates black America. What I learned from the black émigrés who've walked through America, and what I gathered as I aged and walked the land myself, was that the much-ballyhooed powers of white people were neither good nor wicked, just overrated. This is the blackness of Barack Obama. It is an identity that asserts itself without conscious thought. It has no need of marches and placards. It rejects an opportunistic ignorance of racism but understands that esoteric ramblings about white-skin privilege do not move the discussion further. It does not need to bluster, to scream, to hyperbolize. Obama's blackness is like any other secure marker of identity, subtle and irreducible to a list of demands. It also lines up perfectly with even those younger blacks who've never ventured beyond the veil but who, minus the shadow of segregation, have concluded that their skin is as worthy as the next man's. This is why all the fuss over how much or how little Obama addresses racism misses the point. Obama mentions white racism about as often as black people actually think about white racism-which is to say rarely. This is not an endorsement. I came up waving The Final Call and convinced that the answer to everything lay in the last words of Frantz Fanon. To which most of my friends would reply, \"So, who won the game last night?\" Survey the average voter in Harlem, Detroit or West Baltimore, ask her to rank her presidential concerns and see where \"reparations\" or \"abolishing the Confederate flag\" compares with, say, \"healthcare\" or \"ending the war.\" In the wake of Obama's speech on race in Philadelphia, the pundits swooned, marveling specifically at Obama's willingness to say that those who fled inner-city America, who opposed affirmative action, were not racist. It is the final insult of segregation that such unthinking logic is allowed to stand. In fact, anyone who knows black folks understands that Obama had nothing to lose-black people have been fleeing those same inner-city neighborhoods since the 1970s. To see Obama's point as a mark of courage or even a concession, you'd have to imagine a black America that woke up, every morning, thinking only about welfare and affirmative action. The olive branch Obama extended to white people came directly from the grove of black America, not from some newly discovered transracial hinterland. This is why Obama was able to secure South Carolina without becoming entrenched in the patronage schemes of various black preachers. Obama is a black man, and thus he needed no surrogates to translate for him, no verification from the crumbling CRIC. Whatever comes of it from here on out for the larger country, Obama has redefined blackness for white America, has served notice that wherever we are, we are. What he is positing is blackness as a valid ethnic identity with its own particular folkways and yet still existing within the broader American continuum. Already a wave of black politicos-Deval Patrick, Corey Booker, Jesse Jackson Jr.-have raised a similar banner, and there is nothing \"postracial,\" \"postblack\" or \"transcendental\" about it. (By the way, does anyone call Joe Lieberman \"post-Jewish-American\" or Mel Martinez \"post-Cuban-American\"?) Indeed, it is a deeper black, the mark of a less defensive, more self-assured African-American leadership. Our forebears, God bless them, held blackness like an albatross, which they sought to affix around the neck of white America. But this generation, Obama's generation, holds blackness like a garland, sure in the knowledge that the only neck it belongs around is our own.\n\nWhites, on the other hand, often tend to be interested only in someone's biracial parentage, as if there's some credit to be taken. As Obama has acknowledged, were he a notorious drug lord-no matter his background-there would be no rush to analyze the impact of his biraciality. He would be black. There'd be no other choice.

But Sharpton, like his comrades among the CRIC, is weighted to a media-driven definition of blackness defined by opposition. Obama's blackness is at once futuristic and conservative. It recalls the blackness displayed in the novels of Zora Neale Hurston, in which racial paranoia is rendered an afterthought; it also reflects the experience of generations of black people who've encountered white America not as an idea but as a collection of individuals. Barack Obama hails from Hawaii, but he also has roots in a rather large tribe of African-Americans of recent vintage who are intimately acquainted with both Americas. Some of them were raised in the affluent suburbs by parents who'd known only the rot of inner cities. Many others, like Obama, are the product of interracial unions, privileged to experience both white and black people on intimate levels. They are the ones who spurned the Ivy League for Spelman and Morehouse, or who rebuffed offers from corporate law firms for a return to the streets. I speak not as one of them. I grew up like most of black America, de facto segregated. When I went off to college at historically black Howard University, blackness was only what I'd seen-row houses with shallow porches, a nasty crossover dribble, hard-driving parents and reverence for Nat Turner. But in my first year at Howard, I met all kinds-math majors fluent in Russian, Marilyn Manson fans, kids straight out of Jack and Jill with fond debutante memories. The first girl I ever fell for had an Indian father and a black mother. She would flash pictures from a photo album of her visits to the subcontinent. The next girl had turned down NYU for Howard and now ran the campus's embattled gay and lesbian club. What they all shared was a flight from bastions of whiteness, where their names were often shackled to the prefixes \"first\" and \"only.\" What they shared was a constant flurry of backhanded compliments from their white peers, who, having witnessed them succeed at anything nonathletic (AP English, debate team, smile), would assure them that they \"were not really black\" or at least \"were not like other blacks.\" From their unspoken variety, from the Alphas and Omegas, from the buoyant Afros and long dreads, from the night-blacks to those who were almost passing, I drew the great lesson that black was a country, a broad, beautiful America refracted through a smoky lens. For sure, they were different from me. I was young and bursting with militancy and nationalism-among my treasured effects were obscure tomes of proto-Afrocentricity, a burgeoning collection of music, a stack of notebooks crowded with bad poetry of the \"Kill Whitey\" persuasion. But when we talked, I could feel the shared essence between us. They were some of the most confident black people I'd ever known. All our lives we'd been raised to see white people as wraiths, as demigods worthy of either complete subservience or unrelenting opposition. This was the logic of our parents, who'd never been free to see whites as fully human and thus to see themselves in the same way. It's also the logic that Shelby Steele thinks still dominates black America. What I learned from the black émigrés who've walked through America, and what I gathered as I aged and walked the land myself, was that the much-ballyhooed powers of white people were neither good nor wicked, just overrated. This is the blackness of Barack Obama. It is an identity that asserts itself without conscious thought. It has no need of marches and placards. It rejects an opportunistic ignorance of racism but understands that esoteric ramblings about white-skin privilege do not move the discussion further. It does not need to bluster, to scream, to hyperbolize. Obama's blackness is like any other secure marker of identity, subtle and irreducible to a list of demands. It also lines up perfectly with even those younger blacks who've never ventured beyond the veil but who, minus the shadow of segregation, have concluded that their skin is as worthy as the next man's. This is why all the fuss over how much or how little Obama addresses racism misses the point. Obama mentions white racism about as often as black people actually think about white racism-which is to say rarely. This is not an endorsement. I came up waving The Final Call and convinced that the answer to everything lay in the last words of Frantz Fanon. To which most of my friends would reply, \"So, who won the game last night?\" Survey the average voter in Harlem, Detroit or West Baltimore, ask her to rank her presidential concerns and see where \"reparations\" or \"abolishing the Confederate flag\" compares with, say, \"healthcare\" or \"ending the war.\" In the wake of Obama's speech on race in Philadelphia, the pundits swooned, marveling specifically at Obama's willingness to say that those who fled inner-city America, who opposed affirmative action, were not racist. It is the final insult of segregation that such unthinking logic is allowed to stand. In fact, anyone who knows black folks understands that Obama had nothing to lose-black people have been fleeing those same inner-city neighborhoods since the 1970s. To see Obama's point as a mark of courage or even a concession, you'd have to imagine a black America that woke up, every morning, thinking only about welfare and affirmative action. The olive branch Obama extended to white people came directly from the grove of black America, not from some newly discovered transracial hinterland. This is why Obama was able to secure South Carolina without becoming entrenched in the patronage schemes of various black preachers. Obama is a black man, and thus he needed no surrogates to translate for him, no verification from the crumbling CRIC. Whatever comes of it from here on out for the larger country, Obama has redefined blackness for white America, has served notice that wherever we are, we are. What he is positing is blackness as a valid ethnic identity with its own particular folkways and yet still existing within the broader American continuum. Already a wave of black politicos-Deval Patrick, Corey Booker, Jesse Jackson Jr.-have raised a similar banner, and there is nothing \"postracial,\" \"postblack\" or \"transcendental\" about it. (By the way, does anyone call Joe Lieberman \"post-Jewish-American\" or Mel Martinez \"post-Cuban-American\"?) Indeed, it is a deeper black, the mark of a less defensive, more self-assured African-American leadership. Our forebears, God bless them, held blackness like an albatross, which they sought to affix around the neck of white America. But this generation, Obama's generation, holds blackness like a garland, sure in the knowledge that the only neck it belongs around is our own.\n\nWhat follows is a flat and contemptuous rendering of black America. Steele argues that Obama can't win because blacks will not vote for a man who doesn't yell \"white supremacy\" whenever he's presented with an open mike. Steele, like his compatriots in the pundit class, isn't one to allow actual people to get in the way of a good argument. Writing on hip-hop, he argues that rappers can never assume the iconic status needed to transcend America's racial divide. This would come as news to Will Smith, the first rapper to win a Grammy and currently the most bankable star in Hollywood. At his roots, Steele lacks the nuance to approach black America not as an idea but as a collection of actual thinking, breathing, contradicting (and self-contradictory) human beings. This is why so much of what's been said about Barack Obama and African-Americans has been so shockingly wrong. Intellectuals examining Obama are trapped in an ancient dynamic-one that even in its heyday was overstated-in which white and black America are constantly at each other's throats, and agree on nothing. The either/or fallacy is their default setting. (\"Assimilation, not blackness, is the road to success,\" writes Steele.) They were made for a world where affirmative action and welfare reform were campaign issues, not one where universal healthcare and the Iraq War have dominated the debate. A Bound Man has the whiff of an author who spends very little time around the people he deigns to judge. The book misses the essential power of Barack Obama: that he is revealing for white America the quiet mass of black people who do not spend their days calculating the wages of slavery. Steele can't grasp that blackness, like any cultural force, works quietly and has no desire to be folded into square minds. Fortunately, it's people, not caricatures, who vote. Thus, if you need any more evidence of Obama's blackness, do nothing more than look at the exit polls where he's dominated most demographics, but especially his own. I would like to say that this is beyond identity politics, but really it isn't.

To which most of my friends would reply, \"So, who won the game last night?\" Survey the average voter in Harlem, Detroit or West Baltimore, ask her to rank her presidential concerns and see where \"reparations\" or \"abolishing the Confederate flag\" compares with, say, \"healthcare\" or \"ending the war.\" In the wake of Obama's speech on race in Philadelphia, the pundits swooned, marveling specifically at Obama's willingness to say that those who fled inner-city America, who opposed affirmative action, were not racist. It is the final insult of segregation that such unthinking logic is allowed to stand. In fact, anyone who knows black folks understands that Obama had nothing to lose-black people have been fleeing those same inner-city neighborhoods since the 1970s. To see Obama's point as a mark of courage or even a concession, you'd have to imagine a black America that woke up, every morning, thinking only about welfare and affirmative action. The olive branch Obama extended to white people came directly from the grove of black America, not from some newly discovered transracial hinterland. This is why Obama was able to secure South Carolina without becoming entrenched in the patronage schemes of various black preachers. Obama is a black man, and thus he needed no surrogates to translate for him, no verification from the crumbling CRIC. Whatever comes of it from here on out for the larger country, Obama has redefined blackness for white America, has served notice that wherever we are, we are. What he is positing is blackness as a valid ethnic identity with its own particular folkways and yet still existing within the broader American continuum. Already a wave of black politicos-Deval Patrick, Corey Booker, Jesse Jackson Jr.-have raised a similar banner, and there is nothing \"postracial,\" \"postblack\" or \"transcendental\" about it. (By the way, does anyone call Joe Lieberman \"post-Jewish-American\" or Mel Martinez \"post-Cuban-American\"?) Indeed, it is a deeper black, the mark of a less defensive, more self-assured African-American leadership. Our forebears, God bless them, held blackness like an albatross, which they sought to affix around the neck of white America. But this generation, Obama's generation, holds blackness like a garland, sure in the knowledge that the only neck it belongs around is our own.\n\nBarack Obama hails from Hawaii, but he also has roots in a rather large tribe of African-Americans of recent vintage who are intimately acquainted with both Americas. Some of them were raised in the affluent suburbs by parents who'd known only the rot of inner cities. Many others, like Obama, are the product of interracial unions, privileged to experience both white and black people on intimate levels. They are the ones who spurned the Ivy League for Spelman and Morehouse, or who rebuffed offers from corporate law firms for a return to the streets. I speak not as one of them. I grew up like most of black America, de facto segregated. When I went off to college at historically black Howard University, blackness was only what I'd seen-row houses with shallow porches, a nasty crossover dribble, hard-driving parents and reverence for Nat Turner. But in my first year at Howard, I met all kinds-math majors fluent in Russian, Marilyn Manson fans, kids straight out of Jack and Jill with fond debutante memories. The first girl I ever fell for had an Indian father and a black mother. She would flash pictures from a photo album of her visits to the subcontinent. The next girl had turned down NYU for Howard and now ran the campus's embattled gay and lesbian club. What they all shared was a flight from bastions of whiteness, where their names were often shackled to the prefixes \"first\" and \"only.\" What they shared was a constant flurry of backhanded compliments from their white peers, who, having witnessed them succeed at anything nonathletic (AP English, debate team, smile), would assure them that they \"were not really black\" or at least \"were not like other blacks.\" From their unspoken variety, from the Alphas and Omegas, from the buoyant Afros and long dreads, from the night-blacks to those who were almost passing, I drew the great lesson that black was a country, a broad, beautiful America refracted through a smoky lens. For sure, they were different from me. I was young and bursting with militancy and nationalism-among my treasured effects were obscure tomes of proto-Afrocentricity, a burgeoning collection of music, a stack of notebooks crowded with bad poetry of the \"Kill Whitey\" persuasion. But when we talked, I could feel the shared essence between us. They were some of the most confident black people I'd ever known. All our lives we'd been raised to see white people as wraiths, as demigods worthy of either complete subservience or unrelenting opposition. This was the logic of our parents, who'd never been free to see whites as fully human and thus to see themselves in the same way. It's also the logic that Shelby Steele thinks still dominates black America. What I learned from the black émigrés who've walked through America, and what I gathered as I aged and walked the land myself, was that the much-ballyhooed powers of white people were neither good nor wicked, just overrated. This is the blackness of Barack Obama. It is an identity that asserts itself without conscious thought. It has no need of marches and placards. It rejects an opportunistic ignorance of racism but understands that esoteric ramblings about white-skin privilege do not move the discussion further. It does not need to bluster, to scream, to hyperbolize. Obama's blackness is like any other secure marker of identity, subtle and irreducible to a list of demands. It also lines up perfectly with even those younger blacks who've never ventured beyond the veil but who, minus the shadow of segregation, have concluded that their skin is as worthy as the next man's. This is why all the fuss over how much or how little Obama addresses racism misses the point.

(By the way, does anyone call Joe Lieberman \"post-Jewish-American\" or Mel Martinez \"post-Cuban-American\"?) Indeed, it is a deeper black, the mark of a less defensive, more self-assured African-American leadership. Our forebears, God bless them, held blackness like an albatross, which they sought to affix around the neck of white America. But this generation, Obama's generation, holds blackness like a garland, sure in the knowledge that the only neck it belongs around is our own.\n\nIt is the final insult of segregation that such unthinking logic is allowed to stand. In fact, anyone who knows black folks understands that Obama had nothing to lose-black people have been fleeing those same inner-city neighborhoods since the 1970s. To see Obama's point as a mark of courage or even a concession, you'd have to imagine a black America that woke up, every morning, thinking only about welfare and affirmative action. The olive branch Obama extended to white people came directly from the grove of black America, not from some newly discovered transracial hinterland. This is why Obama was able to secure South Carolina without becoming entrenched in the patronage schemes of various black preachers. Obama is a black man, and thus he needed no surrogates to translate for him, no verification from the crumbling CRIC. Whatever comes of it from here on out for the larger country, Obama has redefined blackness for white America, has served notice that wherever we are, we are.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Two-thirds of teenage mothers are white, two-thirds of welfare recipients are white and white youth commit most of the crime in this country. According to a recent survey, reported by the Oakland Tribune , the typical crack addict is a middle-class white male in his 40s. Michele Norris of a has cited a study that dis- covered \"no significant difference in the rate of drug use during pregnancy among women in the public clinics that serve a largely indigent population and those visiting private doctors who cater to upper-income patients.\" Yet in the popular imagination blacks are blamed for all these activities, in the manner that the Jews took the rap for the Black Plague, even in countries with little or no Jewish population. Now that network news shows have become \"profit centers,\" news producers have found a lucrative market in exhibiting black pathology, while coverage of pathologies such as drug addiction, child abuse, spousal battering and crime among whites and their \"model minorities\" is negligible. According to the news shows, you'd think that two black gangs, the Crips and the Bloods, are both the cause and the result of the nation's drug problem, even though this country was high long before these children were born. When it comes to singling out blacks as the cause of America's social problems, NBC and CNN are the worst offenders. (The owner of CNN, Ted Turner, once proposed that unemployed black males be hired to carry nuclear warheads on their backs; when pressed he said that he was only kidding.) Let's look at just one month: October of last year. General Electric's NBC Nightly News ran stones on child abuse, drug trafficking and cocaine pregnancy. Blacks were the actors in all these news shows, yet the August 30, 1988, front page of The New York Times reported that there is as much cocaine pregnancy in the suburbs as in the inner city. That same October, it was revealed on CNN's business program, Moneyline , that U.S. bankers have laundered $100 billion in drug money, $90 billion of which ends up overseas, contributing to the trillion dollars in debt owed by the United States, mugging millions of Americans of jobs and endangering the economic stability of the country. Also in October, CNN did a series called \"Crime in America.\" According to this series, whites don't commit crimes. They're either victims or on the side of the law-the line promoted by The New York Times , a black pathology supermarket that regularly blames crack use, crime, welfare and illegitimacy on black people and whose journalists and columnists still use the term \"black underclass\" even though studies, including Blacks and American Society , by the National Research Council, and The Persistence of Urban Poverty and its Demographic and Behavioral Correlates , by Terry K. Adams and Greg J. Duncan, have been unable to locate this underclass. Its neoconservative house organ, The New York Times Magazine , printed in its February 26 issue a puff piece about the ex-editors of the anti-Semitic, anti-black Dartmouth Review . Earlier last year, on August 20, CNN aired a special about drug-crazed Los Angeles street gangs. It proposed that gang activities were inspired by rap music. If rap music is forcing people to sell drugs, then how does one explain the participation in this industry of a Gregorian chant-loving ex-Vatican diplomat, the Rev. Lorenzo Zorza? How convenient it is to blame everything on a scapegoat, in this case black youth, who, according to public superstitions, are responsible for all the crime in this country. Yet Gerry Spence, citing a Bureau of National Affairs estimate, writes in his book With Justice for None: Destroying an American Myth , that \"the cost of corporate crime in America is over ten times greater than the combined larcenies, robberies, burglaries and auto-thefts committed by individuals. One in five of America's large corporations has been convicted of at least one major crime or has paid civil penalties for serious misbehavior. One way the Crips and the Bloods can improve their image is to do what the big crooks do, buy advertising on TV news shows so that their crimes will rarely be reported.\" The only difference between white pathology and black pathology is that white pathology is underreported. By putting out the lie that U.S. crime is black, the networks contributed millions of dollars in free advertising to Lee Atwater's most recent racist political campaign. Presenting the fact that pathologies are widespread in American society and that American society itself might be pathological would be like showing films about lung cancer to the millions addicted to cigarette smoking. To portray America as a pathological society would interrupt the country's cozy fetal sleep, which requires that the shrill half-wits it elects to office run the sort of campaign that former Confederate officers ran in the 1880s: They threatened whites with a black rapist in every bedroom, an image that's been commercialized by some millionaire feminists in novels and movies for the last decade, proving that the black pathology industry is an equal opportunity gold mine.\n\nBlack pathology is big business.

This year we asked students to send us an original, unpublished, 800-word essay detailing what they think is the most important issue facing their generation. We received hundreds of submissions from high school and college students in forty-one states. We chose one college and one high school winner and ten finalists total. The winners are Bryce Wilson Stucki of Virginia Tech University and Hannah Moon of Brooklyn College Academy in Brooklyn, New York. The winners receive a cash award of $1,000 and the finalists, $200 each. All receive Nation subscriptions. - The Editors A question not too many Americans are forced to ask themselves: Where are the people that look like me? Imagine with me for a moment you're just entering the ninth grade excited to see all your friends from last year, but as you walk into your high school you encounter a feeling completely foreign to you. You are the only one in your entire school who remotely looks like you. You are the only black face in an ocean of white faces, and every glance at you is an attempt to ignore your existence. No one even bothers to wave. Gone are the bonds with the friends you once had, gone are your lunch buddies, the table where everyone is like you, and where you are understood. This is my reality, a reality I'd grow to know well throughout my high school years as I watched black face after black face picked off one by one each year like a cancerous tumor, leaving only ragtag humiliatingly low numbers of survivors. And every year, as the solitary number seemed to inch closer and closer, I would ask myself, \"What is happening? Where are all the black kids going? Why doesn't anyone seem to care?\" A black face in my high school would become as foreign as a repressed memory that everyone just seemed to forget existed. I'd discover that this mysterious epidemic extended beyond the hallways and the lockers of my high school to infect schools across the city and the nation. In my city predominately black schools have the lowest graduation rates in the state of New York. At city schools, where the majority of students are black, only approximately 45.9 percent graduate, while predominately white schools in the suburbs have a graduation rate of 94 percent. Nationally, every twenty-six seconds a student drops out of school. This statistic for black Americans is a ticking time bomb for a race in which less than half of our students graduate. Political and cultural critics argue that the devastatingly high dropout rate of African-Americans is a direct consequence of the unfortunate and often \"typical\" circumstances affecting members of the African Diaspora, the age old tale of teenage pregnancies, single-parent households and rundown urban environments. By making such a one-sided assumption America places the blame firmly on the shoulders of African-Americans themselves. I believe the high dropout rates of black Americans are a consequence of a conservative white America's hunger for power; it is a result of a premeditated cycle of oppression that Americans pretend to ignore. A cycle created with laws forbidding black slaves to gain an education, transforming into further black disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction, as black Americans moved to urban centers and were confined to slums, a result of discrimination and unequal pay leading to white flight from cities, and the reality for so many of my generation, (black, poor white and brown) today. No one cares about us. Our cities are making budget cuts to our already substandard education; we do not have teachers dedicated to both understanding and meeting our needs, nor do we have adequate supplies. And no one has cared to make our education as much of a priority as it for white Americans. We are in the pothole that we see today as a result of centuries of constraint of the advancement of our status. It is a cycle that has enslaved us. An uneducated group cannot advance economically or socially because it cannot afford to break out of that which confines them to a slum. They do not have the means to leave. I have been a witness to America's failure within its high school educational system. I witnessed educators unwilling to make an effort to help minority students achieve academic success. And as a result of this I have watched black students become disempowered by circumstance and fall victim to a devastating statistic. And as I visited college campuses I found no greater hope. I am still in search of more who look like me, especially black males. I realize that I have, and so many other ethnic minorities, have become a commodity to so colleges and universities because of our color and rarity. What does this rarity mean? We as a nation have created a generation of uneducated minorities, who cannot be leaders, politicians or businessmen and cannot better their communities because the United States has for centuries used education as a weapon to keep individuals who look like me down. And if nothing continues to be done, the epidemic will demolish our communities. If a black kid falls out of school in the ghetto and no one is around to hear him, does he make a sound?\n\nThis is my reality, a reality I'd grow to know well throughout my high school years as I watched black face after black face picked off one by one each year like a cancerous tumor, leaving only ragtag humiliatingly low numbers of survivors.

The GOP has fielded multiple Black nominees for statewide office and encouraged South Carolina Senator Tim Scott to run for president. Although these are mainly cynical attempts to peel away some Black support from Democrats, these developments do pose a threat to the party-but not for the reason many pundits think. For a party whose political power is based on stoking white fear and resentment, the trend is certainly notable at first blush. In just the past three years, Republicans have nominated Black candidates for vitally important contests: US Senate in Michigan (John James in 2020) and Georgia (Herschel Walker in 2022), and the party's standard-bearer in this year's Kentucky gubernatorial contest (Daniel Cameron). In 2021, Winsome Sears won her race for Virginia lieutenant governor. And now, on top of all that, Tim Scott has thrown his hat into the ring for the 2024 presidential race. Scott's candidacy has captured the attention of many reporters in the mainstream media. For example, The New York Times recently published a roundtable on the implications of his bid. But most of these analyses incorrectly diagnose what is happening, why it's happening, and what the true threat is to Democrats. New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg is a good example of this misunderstanding, writing in an op-ed last month that \"at a time when the Democratic Party is losing Black men, a Tim Scott nomination would be a nightmare for Joe Biden.\" It is important to set the record straight that Democrats are not, in fact, losing support from Black men even when the GOP is running Black candidates. A cursory glance at the results from their recent races affirms this fact: In both the Georgia and Michigan Senate races, the Democratic nominee secured 90 percent of the vote, even when, in Michigan , the Republican opponent was a Black man. All available electoral data continues to affirm that Black men are the second-most-Democratic demographic group in the country, second only to Black women. The confusion over the Black vote seems to be coming from the fact that the margin by which Democrats have won Black men shrank in the Trump era. While Trump lost by 69 percent among Black males in 2016, that margin fell to 60 percent in 2020. That shift, however, does not mean what reporters like Goldberg think it means. Black voters are not switching to the Republican Party. Republicans are just doing a better job of increasing voter turnout among infrequent voters. Reporters often apply this same faulty reasoning to Latino voters, which I wrote about last year . As I pointed out there, Trump's \"gains happened among voters usually on the sidelines of politics.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Current Issue View our current issue And therein lies the real challenge and difficulty for Democrats. The greatest threat to Biden's reelection is not that Black voters will throng the polling places to embrace Scott; It's that those infrequent voters will not vote at all. F or decades, Democrats have failed to resolve a fundamental dilemma: Black people are their most reliable and strongest supporters, but fear of alienating white voters mutes their full-throated support for Black equality. This ambivalence is most profound when it comes to addressing one of the most important issues of all-the racial wealth gap. The average white family in America has six times more wealth than the average Black family. This is, of course, the result of centuries of government-sanctioned and -enforced public policies, from slavery to sharecropping to redlining to racial restrictions in the GI Bill and New Deal. Despite this reality-even after the murder of George Floyd and many other innocent Black people-Democrats, who controlled both houses of Congress at the time, could not summon the courage or resolve to pass a bill that would simply study the issue of reparations. Biden doesn't need any congressional support to establish a Presidential Commission to examine reparations, but he has failed to take this basic step. With a new race looming, the challenge for Democrats will be inspiring and mobilizing Black voters. The default posture of the party will be to tiptoe through the policy landscape and unleash a fire hose of spending targeting white people to try to convince them that Democrats still care about them. From 2016 to 2020 , Democrats have devoted the lion's share of their election spending on communicating with white voters, at the expense of working to inspire Black ones. The GOP's flirtation with Black candidates is something that Democrats should absolutely take seriously, and they should be alert that Republicans, while cynical and shameless, are nonetheless tinkering with their electoral formula. The most effective response would be to intensify the fight for true racial equality and signal unequivocal support for the Black struggle for justice. In doing so, Democrats would reinforce the cornerstone of their winning coalition, at which time Republicans would return to their regularly scheduled programming of running white candidates who come from the tradition of voicing white resentment.\n\nFor a party whose political power is based on stoking white fear and resentment, the trend is certainly notable at first blush.

The greatest threat to Biden's reelection is not that Black voters will throng the polling places to embrace Scott; It's that those infrequent voters will not vote at all. F or decades, Democrats have failed to resolve a fundamental dilemma: Black people are their most reliable and strongest supporters, but fear of alienating white voters mutes their full-throated support for Black equality. This ambivalence is most profound when it comes to addressing one of the most important issues of all-the racial wealth gap. The average white family in America has six times more wealth than the average Black family. This is, of course, the result of centuries of government-sanctioned and -enforced public policies, from slavery to sharecropping to redlining to racial restrictions in the GI Bill and New Deal. Despite this reality-even after the murder of George Floyd and many other innocent Black people-Democrats, who controlled both houses of Congress at the time, could not summon the courage or resolve to pass a bill that would simply study the issue of reparations. Biden doesn't need any congressional support to establish a Presidential Commission to examine reparations, but he has failed to take this basic step. With a new race looming, the challenge for Democrats will be inspiring and mobilizing Black voters. The default posture of the party will be to tiptoe through the policy landscape and unleash a fire hose of spending targeting white people to try to convince them that Democrats still care about them. From 2016 to 2020 , Democrats have devoted the lion's share of their election spending on communicating with white voters, at the expense of working to inspire Black ones. The GOP's flirtation with Black candidates is something that Democrats should absolutely take seriously, and they should be alert that Republicans, while cynical and shameless, are nonetheless tinkering with their electoral formula. The most effective response would be to intensify the fight for true racial equality and signal unequivocal support for the Black struggle for justice. In doing so, Democrats would reinforce the cornerstone of their winning coalition, at which time Republicans would return to their regularly scheduled programming of running white candidates who come from the tradition of voicing white resentment.\n\nScott's candidacy has captured the attention of many reporters in the mainstream media. For example, The New York Times recently published a roundtable on the implications of his bid. But most of these analyses incorrectly diagnose what is happening, why it's happening, and what the true threat is to Democrats. New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg is a good example of this misunderstanding, writing in an op-ed last month that \"at a time when the Democratic Party is losing Black men, a Tim Scott nomination would be a nightmare for Joe Biden.\" It is important to set the record straight that Democrats are not, in fact, losing support from Black men even when the GOP is running Black candidates. A cursory glance at the results from their recent races affirms this fact: In both the Georgia and Michigan Senate races, the Democratic nominee secured 90 percent of the vote, even when, in Michigan , the Republican opponent was a Black man. All available electoral data continues to affirm that Black men are the second-most-Democratic demographic group in the country, second only to Black women. The confusion over the Black vote seems to be coming from the fact that the margin by which Democrats have won Black men shrank in the Trump era. While Trump lost by 69 percent among Black males in 2016, that margin fell to 60 percent in 2020. That shift, however, does not mean what reporters like Goldberg think it means.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

It tracks the last day of Oscar Grant's life, the 22-year-old black man who was fatally shot on New Year's Day by an Oakland police officer. Ryan and I talked about Oscar's death and how it has impacted the way we see ourselves as young black men in America. The transcript has been lightly edited for clarity. Mychal Denzel Smith : Start by telling me what made you want to tell Oscar Grant's story. Ryan Coogler : For one, as a filmmaker, like any artist, when something affects me emotionally I think about it in those terms. It's my way of dealing with my thoughts, my fears and my hardships. I think the same can be said with any artist. For a musician, you're going to write a song about something that affects you emotionally. It's the same with a poet or a painter. What made me want to tell this story? It started with the incident, and being right there in the Bay Area when it happened. Being the same age as Oscar. Oscar was born in 1986. And I couldn't help seeing myself right there. Seeing that situation. Seeing his friends-they look like my friends. We wear the same clothes, the same complexion. So in seeing that I thought, what if that was me? And that is where the idea initially came from. Being so hurt and being so angry, and so frustrated, and confused about what happened. The same feeling everybody had when they were out protesting and rioting. And people on the other side on the Internet. And seeing the trial, I feel like it kind of got muddled over that Oscar is a human being. He became this saint or this idol that people held up. He became a rallying cry and a symbol for whatever kind of impressions you wanted to make him a symbol for. And the other side has demonized him. He's a criminal. He's a thug. He got what he deserved. Personally, he's not either one of those things. I feel like what was getting glossed over was the fact that this 22-year-old guy didn't make it home to the people that he mattered to most. And for unnecessary reasons-his life was cut short unnecessarily. And so many young black men's lives get cut short unnecessarily. [They're not seen as] human beings by people who don't know them or are on the other side of [this particular] conflict who don't seem to care.

I was the same age as Oscar when he was killed. I was 22. And I'm looking at it-us, young black men, our humanity isn't considered, like you were talking about. And I'm watching the trial of George Zimmerman for killing Trayvon Martin right now, and the way they're trying to paint Trayvon Martin, they're trying to reduce him to a thug or this dude who was high. But I think with Oscar, the thing that struck me, especially watching it unfold on social media, because I was watching it on Twitter and I was horrified clicking that link and watching this dude get shot for no reason. But it was the timing of it for me because we had just elected Barack Obama. And my political differences with Obama aside-that was a real big moment. That was a point of pride to watch, on election night, this black man be duly elected the president of the United States of America. But then, not even two months later, you're watching a brother your age get shot and killed by the police and you just realize again most of us are not going to be Barack Obama, but a lot of us could end up like Oscar Grant. You're a lot more likely to end up like Oscar Grant, for sure. It was a trip because it happened.... You know the Bay Area is a really liberal place. It [votes] Democratic. And we kind of look at ourselves at being a leader in terms of that. A leader in terms of race [relations], and gender equality, and just in terms of acceptance because it such a diverse place. So when that happened it was like a gut-punch at that time, because we were on a high when Obama got elected. And people were feeling good. It was a very optimistic time. And there was a lot of optimism across young black males at that time. And it was interesting talking to Sophie, Oscar's girlfriend, about what he was talking about on New Year's Eve, and you know Oscar just got out of prison. And he had a young daughter who he had been away from for a year and some change. And what they were taking about was resolutions-what he wanted to do for that next year. And I think that seeing Obama get elected, for a lot of us, gave us a little bit of additional hope. And to have that video come was like getting punched in the gut when you're reaching your arms up. And what you said about humanity. It's both a tactic and a defense mechanism to look at some people as full human beings and to look at others as not full human beings. You see that with any kind of conflict. You see that in Frisco, in the Bay and I see a lot of kids that are involved in [urban] conflicts. This gang right here, they have issues with that gang there that's across the street. And when you talk to these kids about the people they are at odds with, they don't see them as full human beings. They see their friends and their family and their side as full human beings, but over there, they see them as something else. So therefore, they're capability of doing things that would classify as [subhuman] to those people. You see that same kind of thing with any kind of conflict, whether it's the police and the people police see as thugs-especially with black men. There are so many people that don't come in contact with black men. Whether they live in a homogeneous area that's mostly white or whether they live in places where they don't have to come in contact with them. So what kind of contact do they have with African-American males? They have the media and that's it. We can look and see clearly that there is no regard for our humanity in mainstream media-you can look at the way stories get covered, from Oscar Grant, to the way mass incarceration is discussed, or what's happening in Chicago, what's happening in Detroit with all these brothers dying in the streets and everybody's basically writing them off. And that's the big thing to me, watching the film, was witnessing Oscar's potential. You work with incarcerated youth and seeing the potential in these young brothers, but policy-wise, and society-wise, people don't want to see the potential in young black men. People don't want to think that we have the ability to contribute to this society in an intellectual way, in a way that helps better our situation. And that to me is frustrating and infuriating. One thing that makes me mad is that when Is that these young men's lives are taken, no matter who's [holding the gun], there's ripple effect on society-the people that they leave behind are still here. Oscar's daughter is still here right now. She's going to go the rest of her life without her dad. And there's hundreds of Oscar Grants losing their lives everyday in this country. The thing about it is that we're dealing with a human rights issue on a massive scale. And you take people who have never met, never even spent time around African-American males. They see us as [criminals], they see us as thugs. They see us as this one-sided thing. People who know us intimately [know] that is a small minority of us. People's lives have value-they can't be monetized to a settlement. Once they're gone, they're gone. Lots of times people who don't come in contact with African-American males have power over their lives. These are the people coming up with policy. These are the people who are called to juries. These are the people who say \"I want to be a cop,\" getting a badge and a gun and shooting up these communities. Protecting people who they never really come in contact with. So it's a really interesting dynamic. I'm from the Bay Area, but I know for a fact, growing up, my number one fear of losing my life, which was an accurate fear, was getting shot. And nine times out of ten, the people who I had to watch the most are the people that look like you and me. Those are the people most likely to kill me. And the [other] people who [may] kill me were getting paid to protect my community. So it's an interesting way to come up. It's hard to come up in that. But I am looking out now and I am seeing you and this incredible film you made. And I'm looking at Michael B. Jordan, who stars in it and the amazing performance he gave. And I'm looking at Frank Ocean. And I'm looking at Kendrick Lamar. And I'm looking at my boy, Saeed Jones, who is an incredible writer. My generation is doing something different. We are rewriting the rules. We are taking control of it and demanding and asserting our humanity right now. Whether people want to cede that to us or not, against the odds, we're demanding to be recognized as fully human and we're rewriting the rules for what it means to a black man in America. Do you feel that? Absolutely, I feel it on so many levels. I'm seeing things from a lot of my peers. I am seeing cats raising their kids, [what I'm so proud of] is so many young black fathers that I know. You have people in the entertainment industry, people you read about [in the papers]. Seeing cats [realize] it starts with us. I was told this by someone, I'm not sure who said it and I'm not sure what context it was side, but I find it rings true: the strength of a society or a community is determined by the ability of the strong to take care of weak. The ability and willingness of the strong to take care of weak. We look at the African-American community, for a long time those of us who be considered strong-black men-for whatever reason, haven't done a good job of taking care of the weak. And we were doing things that render taking care of our youth and taking care of our women and our families impossible, when our lives are taken. Once you're killed, you can't care for your kids or your family anymore. When you're incarcerated [for those years], you can't care for your kids or your family anymore. So what I'm seeing and what I am looking forward to, what I hope is that I can see as we get older is that our generation, number one, that we stop killing each other. Number two, that we do what needs to be done to take care of ourselves so we're not getting incarcerated at a mass rate. Three, holding people accountable [for killing us unnecessarily]. And number four, that we take care of our families. That's our kids-that's our spouses. And I am seeing that with those people that have struggled with that.

But I am looking out now and I am seeing you and this incredible film you made. And I'm looking at Michael B. Jordan, who stars in it and the amazing performance he gave. And I'm looking at Frank Ocean. And I'm looking at Kendrick Lamar. And I'm looking at my boy, Saeed Jones, who is an incredible writer. My generation is doing something different. We are rewriting the rules. We are taking control of it and demanding and asserting our humanity right now. Whether people want to cede that to us or not, against the odds, we're demanding to be recognized as fully human and we're rewriting the rules for what it means to a black man in America. Do you feel that? Absolutely, I feel it on so many levels. I'm seeing things from a lot of my peers. I am seeing cats raising their kids, [what I'm so proud of] is so many young black fathers that I know. You have people in the entertainment industry, people you read about [in the papers]. Seeing cats [realize] it starts with us. I was told this by someone, I'm not sure who said it and I'm not sure what context it was side, but I find it rings true: the strength of a society or a community is determined by the ability of the strong to take care of weak. The ability and willingness of the strong to take care of weak. We look at the African-American community, for a long time those of us who be considered strong-black men-for whatever reason, haven't done a good job of taking care of the weak. And we were doing things that render taking care of our youth and taking care of our women and our families impossible, when our lives are taken. Once you're killed, you can't care for your kids or your family anymore. When you're incarcerated [for those years], you can't care for your kids or your family anymore. So what I'm seeing and what I am looking forward to, what I hope is that I can see as we get older is that our generation, number one, that we stop killing each other. Number two, that we do what needs to be done to take care of ourselves so we're not getting incarcerated at a mass rate. Three, holding people accountable [for killing us unnecessarily]. And number four, that we take care of our families. That's our kids-that's our spouses. And I am seeing that with those people that have struggled with that. Fruitvale Station is in select theaters now and opens nationwide July 26th.\n\nMychal Denzel Smith : Start by telling me what made you want to tell Oscar Grant's story. Ryan Coogler : For one, as a filmmaker, like any artist, when something affects me emotionally I think about it in those terms. It's my way of dealing with my thoughts, my fears and my hardships. I think the same can be said with any artist. For a musician, you're going to write a song about something that affects you emotionally. It's the same with a poet or a painter. What made me want to tell this story? It started with the incident, and being right there in the Bay Area when it happened. Being the same age as Oscar. Oscar was born in 1986. And I couldn't help seeing myself right there. Seeing that situation. Seeing his friends-they look like my friends. We wear the same clothes, the same complexion. So in seeing that I thought, what if that was me? And that is where the idea initially came from. Being so hurt and being so angry, and so frustrated, and confused about what happened. The same feeling everybody had when they were out protesting and rioting. And people on the other side on the Internet. And seeing the trial, I feel like it kind of got muddled over that Oscar is a human being. He became this saint or this idol that people held up. He became a rallying cry and a symbol for whatever kind of impressions you wanted to make him a symbol for. And the other side has demonized him. He's a criminal. He's a thug. He got what he deserved. Personally, he's not either one of those things. I feel like what was getting glossed over was the fact that this 22-year-old guy didn't make it home to the people that he mattered to most. And for unnecessary reasons-his life was cut short unnecessarily. And so many young black men's lives get cut short unnecessarily. [They're not seen as] human beings by people who don't know them or are on the other side of [this particular] conflict who don't seem to care.

I was the same age as Oscar when he was killed. I was 22. And I'm looking at it-us, young black men, our humanity isn't considered, like you were talking about. And I'm watching the trial of George Zimmerman for killing Trayvon Martin right now, and the way they're trying to paint Trayvon Martin, they're trying to reduce him to a thug or this dude who was high. But I think with Oscar, the thing that struck me, especially watching it unfold on social media, because I was watching it on Twitter and I was horrified clicking that link and watching this dude get shot for no reason. But it was the timing of it for me because we had just elected Barack Obama. And my political differences with Obama aside-that was a real big moment. That was a point of pride to watch, on election night, this black man be duly elected the president of the United States of America. But then, not even two months later, you're watching a brother your age get shot and killed by the police and you just realize again most of us are not going to be Barack Obama, but a lot of us could end up like Oscar Grant. You're a lot more likely to end up like Oscar Grant, for sure. It was a trip because it happened.... You know the Bay Area is a really liberal place. It [votes] Democratic. And we kind of look at ourselves at being a leader in terms of that. A leader in terms of race [relations], and gender equality, and just in terms of acceptance because it such a diverse place. So when that happened it was like a gut-punch at that time, because we were on a high when Obama got elected. And people were feeling good. It was a very optimistic time. And there was a lot of optimism across young black males at that time. And it was interesting talking to Sophie, Oscar's girlfriend, about what he was talking about on New Year's Eve, and you know Oscar just got out of prison. And he had a young daughter who he had been away from for a year and some change. And what they were taking about was resolutions-what he wanted to do for that next year. And I think that seeing Obama get elected, for a lot of us, gave us a little bit of additional hope. And to have that video come was like getting punched in the gut when you're reaching your arms up. And what you said about humanity. It's both a tactic and a defense mechanism to look at some people as full human beings and to look at others as not full human beings. You see that with any kind of conflict. You see that in Frisco, in the Bay and I see a lot of kids that are involved in [urban] conflicts. This gang right here, they have issues with that gang there that's across the street. And when you talk to these kids about the people they are at odds with, they don't see them as full human beings. They see their friends and their family and their side as full human beings, but over there, they see them as something else. So therefore, they're capability of doing things that would classify as [subhuman] to those people. You see that same kind of thing with any kind of conflict, whether it's the police and the people police see as thugs-especially with black men. There are so many people that don't come in contact with black men. Whether they live in a homogeneous area that's mostly white or whether they live in places where they don't have to come in contact with them. So what kind of contact do they have with African-American males? They have the media and that's it. We can look and see clearly that there is no regard for our humanity in mainstream media-you can look at the way stories get covered, from Oscar Grant, to the way mass incarceration is discussed, or what's happening in Chicago, what's happening in Detroit with all these brothers dying in the streets and everybody's basically writing them off. And that's the big thing to me, watching the film, was witnessing Oscar's potential. You work with incarcerated youth and seeing the potential in these young brothers, but policy-wise, and society-wise, people don't want to see the potential in young black men. People don't want to think that we have the ability to contribute to this society in an intellectual way, in a way that helps better our situation. And that to me is frustrating and infuriating. One thing that makes me mad is that when Is that these young men's lives are taken, no matter who's [holding the gun], there's ripple effect on society-the people that they leave behind are still here. Oscar's daughter is still here right now. She's going to go the rest of her life without her dad. And there's hundreds of Oscar Grants losing their lives everyday in this country. The thing about it is that we're dealing with a human rights issue on a massive scale. And you take people who have never met, never even spent time around African-American males. They see us as [criminals], they see us as thugs. They see us as this one-sided thing. People who know us intimately [know] that is a small minority of us. People's lives have value-they can't be monetized to a settlement. Once they're gone, they're gone. Lots of times people who don't come in contact with African-American males have power over their lives. These are the people coming up with policy. These are the people who are called to juries. These are the people who say \"I want to be a cop,\" getting a badge and a gun and shooting up these communities. Protecting people who they never really come in contact with. So it's a really interesting dynamic. I'm from the Bay Area, but I know for a fact, growing up, my number one fear of losing my life, which was an accurate fear, was getting shot. And nine times out of ten, the people who I had to watch the most are the people that look like you and me. Those are the people most likely to kill me. And the [other] people who [may] kill me were getting paid to protect my community. So it's an interesting way to come up. It's hard to come up in that.

These are the people who say \"I want to be a cop,\" getting a badge and a gun and shooting up these communities. Protecting people who they never really come in contact with. So it's a really interesting dynamic. I'm from the Bay Area, but I know for a fact, growing up, my number one fear of losing my life, which was an accurate fear, was getting shot. And nine times out of ten, the people who I had to watch the most are the people that look like you and me. Those are the people most likely to kill me. And the [other] people who [may] kill me were getting paid to protect my community. So it's an interesting way to come up. It's hard to come up in that. But I am looking out now and I am seeing you and this incredible film you made. And I'm looking at Michael B. Jordan, who stars in it and the amazing performance he gave. And I'm looking at Frank Ocean. And I'm looking at Kendrick Lamar. And I'm looking at my boy, Saeed Jones, who is an incredible writer. My generation is doing something different. We are rewriting the rules. We are taking control of it and demanding and asserting our humanity right now. Whether people want to cede that to us or not, against the odds, we're demanding to be recognized as fully human and we're rewriting the rules for what it means to a black man in America. Do you feel that? Absolutely, I feel it on so many levels. I'm seeing things from a lot of my peers. I am seeing cats raising their kids, [what I'm so proud of] is so many young black fathers that I know. You have people in the entertainment industry, people you read about [in the papers]. Seeing cats [realize] it starts with us. I was told this by someone, I'm not sure who said it and I'm not sure what context it was side, but I find it rings true: the strength of a society or a community is determined by the ability of the strong to take care of weak. The ability and willingness of the strong to take care of weak. We look at the African-American community, for a long time those of us who be considered strong-black men-for whatever reason, haven't done a good job of taking care of the weak. And we were doing things that render taking care of our youth and taking care of our women and our families impossible, when our lives are taken. Once you're killed, you can't care for your kids or your family anymore. When you're incarcerated [for those years], you can't care for your kids or your family anymore. So what I'm seeing and what I am looking forward to, what I hope is that I can see as we get older is that our generation, number one, that we stop killing each other. Number two, that we do what needs to be done to take care of ourselves so we're not getting incarcerated at a mass rate. Three, holding people accountable [for killing us unnecessarily]. And number four, that we take care of our families. That's our kids-that's our spouses. And I am seeing that with those people that have struggled with that.

I was the same age as Oscar when he was killed. I was 22. And I'm looking at it-us, young black men, our humanity isn't considered, like you were talking about. And I'm watching the trial of George Zimmerman for killing Trayvon Martin right now, and the way they're trying to paint Trayvon Martin, they're trying to reduce him to a thug or this dude who was high. But I think with Oscar, the thing that struck me, especially watching it unfold on social media, because I was watching it on Twitter and I was horrified clicking that link and watching this dude get shot for no reason. But it was the timing of it for me because we had just elected Barack Obama. And my political differences with Obama aside-that was a real big moment. That was a point of pride to watch, on election night, this black man be duly elected the president of the United States of America. But then, not even two months later, you're watching a brother your age get shot and killed by the police and you just realize again most of us are not going to be Barack Obama, but a lot of us could end up like Oscar Grant. You're a lot more likely to end up like Oscar Grant, for sure. It was a trip because it happened.... You know the Bay Area is a really liberal place. It [votes] Democratic. And we kind of look at ourselves at being a leader in terms of that. A leader in terms of race [relations], and gender equality, and just in terms of acceptance because it such a diverse place. So when that happened it was like a gut-punch at that time, because we were on a high when Obama got elected. And people were feeling good. It was a very optimistic time. And there was a lot of optimism across young black males at that time. And it was interesting talking to Sophie, Oscar's girlfriend, about what he was talking about on New Year's Eve, and you know Oscar just got out of prison. And he had a young daughter who he had been away from for a year and some change. And what they were taking about was resolutions-what he wanted to do for that next year. And I think that seeing Obama get elected, for a lot of us, gave us a little bit of additional hope. And to have that video come was like getting punched in the gut when you're reaching your arms up. And what you said about humanity. It's both a tactic and a defense mechanism to look at some people as full human beings and to look at others as not full human beings. You see that with any kind of conflict. You see that in Frisco, in the Bay and I see a lot of kids that are involved in [urban] conflicts. This gang right here, they have issues with that gang there that's across the street. And when you talk to these kids about the people they are at odds with, they don't see them as full human beings. They see their friends and their family and their side as full human beings, but over there, they see them as something else. So therefore, they're capability of doing things that would classify as [subhuman] to those people. You see that same kind of thing with any kind of conflict, whether it's the police and the people police see as thugs-especially with black men. There are so many people that don't come in contact with black men. Whether they live in a homogeneous area that's mostly white or whether they live in places where they don't have to come in contact with them. So what kind of contact do they have with African-American males? They have the media and that's it. We can look and see clearly that there is no regard for our humanity in mainstream media-you can look at the way stories get covered, from Oscar Grant, to the way mass incarceration is discussed, or what's happening in Chicago, what's happening in Detroit with all these brothers dying in the streets and everybody's basically writing them off. And that's the big thing to me, watching the film, was witnessing Oscar's potential. You work with incarcerated youth and seeing the potential in these young brothers, but policy-wise, and society-wise, people don't want to see the potential in young black men. People don't want to think that we have the ability to contribute to this society in an intellectual way, in a way that helps better our situation. And that to me is frustrating and infuriating. One thing that makes me mad is that when Is that these young men's lives are taken, no matter who's [holding the gun], there's ripple effect on society-the people that they leave behind are still here. Oscar's daughter is still here right now. She's going to go the rest of her life without her dad. And there's hundreds of Oscar Grants losing their lives everyday in this country. The thing about it is that we're dealing with a human rights issue on a massive scale. And you take people who have never met, never even spent time around African-American males. They see us as [criminals], they see us as thugs. They see us as this one-sided thing. People who know us intimately [know] that is a small minority of us. People's lives have value-they can't be monetized to a settlement. Once they're gone, they're gone. Lots of times people who don't come in contact with African-American males have power over their lives. These are the people coming up with policy. These are the people who are called to juries. These are the people who say \"I want to be a cop,\" getting a badge and a gun and shooting up these communities. Protecting people who they never really come in contact with.

People's lives have value-they can't be monetized to a settlement. Once they're gone, they're gone. Lots of times people who don't come in contact with African-American males have power over their lives. These are the people coming up with policy. These are the people who are called to juries. These are the people who say \"I want to be a cop,\" getting a badge and a gun and shooting up these communities. Protecting people who they never really come in contact with. So it's a really interesting dynamic. I'm from the Bay Area, but I know for a fact, growing up, my number one fear of losing my life, which was an accurate fear, was getting shot. And nine times out of ten, the people who I had to watch the most are the people that look like you and me. Those are the people most likely to kill me. And the [other] people who [may] kill me were getting paid to protect my community. So it's an interesting way to come up. It's hard to come up in that.

      "text": "What the Polls Really Say About Black Men's Support for Kamala Harris\n\nIn early October, just before Kamala Harris spoke at the Dort Financial Center, in Flint, Michigan, the N.B.A. Hall of Famer Magic Johnson took the stage to offer a few insights about the candidate and her campaign. The choice of Johnson, who is a Michigander, to introduce Harris made sense for several reasons. He has been an advocate for people with H.I.V./ AIDS -he has been H.I.V.-positive for more than thirty years-and Harris helped spearhead a Biden Administration effort to end the epidemic by 2030. He is a co-chair of the Athletes for Harris coalition. And, since he officially retired from basketball, in 1996, he has become known nearly as much for his shrewd investments in movie theatres and sports franchises as for his prowess as a point guard. In Flint, Johnson congratulated the Detroit Tigers on their playoff run, praised Harris for her economic proposals, and then spoke about a specific sliver of the electorate. \"Our Black men, we gotta get 'em out to vote,\" he said. \"Kamala's opponent promised a lot of things last time to the Black community that he did not deliver on, and we gotta make sure we help Black men understand that.\"\n\nJohnson was addressing a concern that has been alternately murmured and shouted in Democratic circles as Election Day nears: that Democrats are vulnerable with one of their most loyal constituencies, African American men. The statistical stalemate that the two major-party candidates have been locked in has led to a kind of obsessive demographic slicing in an effort to predict the election's outcome. In the traumatic wake of the 2016 contest, progressives blamed white women, more than fifty per cent of whom, initial reports alleged, had voted for Donald Trump , compared with forty-three per cent for Hillary Clinton. (Subsequent analysis revealed the numbers to be closer to forty-seven per cent for Trump and forty-five for Clinton, but it was still a win.) This year, Black men have come under special scrutiny as the potential weak link.\n\nA headline from a \"PBS NewsHour\" story in August noted that \"Trump Is Gaining Ground with Some Black Men.\" The same month, Mother Jones ran a story titled \"I Spent a Week with Black MAGA. Here's What I Learned.\" A Times piece led with \"Black Men Rally for Kamala Harris and Confront an Elephant in the Room.\" Trump himself weighed in, noting, \"I seem to be doing very well with Black males.\" In fact, according to a recent A.P.- NORC poll, only one in ten Black voters thinks that Trump would \"change the country for the better,\" and eight out of ten have a somewhat or very negative view of him. Trump won fourteen per cent of Black male voters in 2016, according to Pew, and just twelve per cent in 2020. But there was enough concern among Democrats that the Harris campaign gave a spot on the final night of the Democratic National Convention to the comedian D. L. Hughley to make the least common form of an endorsement speech: an apology.\n\nHughley confessed that, because Harris had been a prosecutor, he made assumptions about her, and \"often repeated them to a lot of people.\" But, he added, \"I was wrong. And I'm so very glad I was wrong, because, Kamala, you give me hope for the future.\" He said that Harris had contacted him to discuss his doubts, and that he had then educated himself about her record as a public servant. He now describes himself as a \"loud advocate\" for Harris. The radio host Charlamagne tha God offered a similar conversion narrative. After previously lamenting Harris's relatively low profile in the Biden Administration, he said during a CNN interview this summer that he'd held \"an unrealistic expectation\" of her as Vice-President. He cites Harris's support for mental-health funding and her economic plans as reasons that he now endorses her. This week, he is scheduled to air a special show with Harris as his guest.\n\nWhatever the perceptions, though, Harris is doing better with Black male voters than Joe Biden was earlier this year. According to a recent Pew survey, seventy-three per cent will vote or are leaning toward voting for her. Even in mid-July, before Biden dropped out of the race, Harris's favorability rating among Black voters in battleground states exceeded his by five points. A more recent poll from Howard University found that, in swing states, eighty-eight per cent of Black men over fifty and seventy-two per cent of those younger say they will likely vote for her. Still, Terrance Woodbury, who leads HIT Strategies, a firm that has done extensive polling on this part of the electorate, has pointed out that the issue goes far beyond Harris as a candidate, or-as Barack Obama chided last Thursday, at a campaign field office, before he spoke at a Harris rally in Pittsburgh-the reluctance that some Black men may have to vote for a woman for President. (It's worth remembering that Black men voted for Clinton in 2016 at a level that surpassed white women by thirty-six points.) Woodbury notes that \"Democrats have experienced erosion-a two-to-three-point erosion amongst Black men-in every election since Barack Obama exited the political stage. This is not just a Kamala Harris problem. This is a Democratic Party problem.\" A higher share of Black men than Black women identify as conservative. The declining number of Black male Democratic voters, like the Party's diminishing appeal to Latino and working-class white voters, may portend an ongoing realignment. Or it may, as Woodbury contends, simply reflect the Party's failure to craft messages that appeal to this part of its base.\n\nAccordingly, the Harris campaign has been preparing a package of policy initiatives that relate to the issues-entrepreneurship, homeownership-that consistently emerge in focus groups with Black male voters. But there is another dynamic that warrants mention: Trump's bombastic allure skews disproportionately male, and although young voters generally support Democrats, there is some evidence that young men may be a stealth asset for him in November. (Stephen Miller, Trump's erstwhile immigration czar, recently advised young men that proudly displaying their MAGA sympathies is the best way to impress women.) And Trump is more popular with Black men under the age of fifty than with any other segment of African Americans.\n\nThe election will turn upon a multitude of dynamics, some too subtle to be apparent ahead of time. In Flint, Magic Johnson worried that Black men might not understand that Trump hadn't kept his promises to the Black community. But comparatively few of them have found the siren song of Trump appealing. Should Kamala Harris not prevail in November, it will not be the fault of any single faction of the electorate. She will receive a large majority of Black men's votes. Whether that-and the turnout among the other parts of her coalition-will be enough to win her the Presidency remains to be seen. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "City Life\n\nSomewhere between the ball game played to an empty stadium and the arrest of six police officers on charges including manslaughter and murder, somewhere around the time that a leaked document suggested that a man who suffered a catastrophic spinal injury while in police custody had died of a self-inflicted wound, events in Baltimore slipped into the realm of the surreal. It was not a particularly unfamiliar journey. For a long time, our domestic affairs, or at least the portion of them most explicitly tied to race, have resembled a nightmare doomed to be repeated until the underlying conflict is resolved. President Obama addressed that recurrence in a press conference at the White House last Tuesday, when he spoke about the death of Freddie Gray and what has euphemistically been called the \"unrest\" in Baltimore:\n\nSince Ferguson, and the task force that we put together, we have seen too many instances of what appears to be police officers interacting with individuals-primarily African American, often poor-in ways that have raised troubling questions. And it comes up, it seems like, once a week now, or once every couple of weeks. . . . What I'd say is this has been a slow-rolling crisis. This has been going on for a long time. This is not new, and we shouldn't pretend that it's new.\n\nIt is true that we have grown adroit at feigning astonishment at the episodic convulsions of violence in American cities, but that doesn't make them any less predictable or their roots any less apparent. With the exception of the riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., every major riot by the black community of an American city since the Second World War has been ignited by a single issue: police tactics. (The explosion in Baltimore occurred in the same week as the twenty-third anniversary of the Rodney King riots, in Los Angeles.) Police departments point to the high rates of crime and violence that prevailed in previous years, and argue that aggressive police tactics to reduce them are therefore a hallmark of civic concern, not signs of callous disregard. The former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, who is a potential Presidential contender, echoed that sentiment after last Monday night's riot in Baltimore. As the city's mayor from 1999 to 2007, he had introduced zero-tolerance policing, and he told CNN that it was likely responsible for a thousand Baltimoreans being alive, rather than dead, as victims of homicide. Violent-crime and homicide rates in the city did decline, but the numbers today reveal a profane truth. Last year in Baltimore, there were two hundred and eleven homicides; a hundred and eighty-nine of the victims were black males. Those numbers are categorical: Baltimore doesn't have a homicide problem; it has a black-male-death problem.\n\nTalk to people in Baltimore-or Ferguson or Staten Island-and invariably you hear criticism of the police not as the police but as a symbol of an entire web of failed social policies, on education, employment, health, and housing. The real question is not one of police tactics: whether the use of body cameras can reduce civilian complaints or whether police-brutality cases should be handled by independent prosecutors. The real question is what life in an American city should be. The issues extend far beyond the parameters of race, but race is the narrative most easily seized upon. (It's worth noting our tendency to think of declining, mostly white Rust Belt cities elegiacally, and of largely black ones moralistically.)\n\nMidway through the twentieth century, cities-especially those, like Baltimore, which were sustained by ports-connoted a kind of American swagger. Today, the population of Baltimore is six hundred and twenty-three thousand; in 1950, it was nine hundred and fifty thousand. The Second World War diminished ethnic rivalries among white Americans and, with them, the tribal allotments of urban neighborhoods, but that process was accelerated by the fact that those areas were already becoming less appealing. When, in 1910, a black attorney bought a house on a white block in Baltimore, the Sun reported that the presence of blacks would drive down property values. That helped bring about a city ordinance-the first of its kind-establishing block-by-block segregation. It is generally assumed that white flight was a product of the political tumult and the spiking crime that afflicted American cities in the nineteen-sixties, but it may well have been the other way around. Baltimore, three-quarters white in 1950, is now two-thirds black. As the surrounding suburbs became increasingly white, transportation networks that once connected the city and the outlying county crumbled. Industry and employment relocated to the surrounding areas. By the late sixties, the city was marked by poverty, a persistent lack of opportunity, and violent crime.\n\nConservative commentators have pointed to Baltimore as a kind of anti-Ferguson, a city where, for decades, blacks have had a secure grasp on political leadership, including the mayor's office; a significant representation in the police force, including, now, the commissioner; and an African-American chief prosecutor, who announced the charges in Gray's death. Yet Baltimore witnessed the same volatile dynamics that we saw in Missouri last year. The implication is that the problem is not racialized policing but the intractable, fraught nature of securing poor, crime-prone communities. That doesn't quite square. As the Department of Justice's report on Ferguson suggests, black representation may diminish but by no means resolve policing practices that disproportionately target African-Americans. And the differences in leadership in the two cities belie their conflicts' common historical roots in segregation. Housing discrimination, of the sort intended by the Baltimore ordinance, was outlawed by a 1948 Supreme Court case, Shelley v. Kraemer, which originated in St. Louis, just a few miles from Ferguson.\n\nBetween 1980 and 2010, the population of Ferguson flipped from eighty-five per cent white to sixty-nine per cent black. At some point soon, Ferguson, like Baltimore, may have more proportional black representation, but the socioeconomic trends in that city won't automatically change. Gray died twenty-eight years after Baltimore's first black mayor took office, yet the statistical realities at the time of his death-a twenty-four-per-cent poverty rate, thirty-seven-per-cent unemployment among young black men-show how complicated and durable the dynamics of race and racism can be.\n\nLast week, the cover of Time featured an image of Baltimore aflame, with the year 1968 crossed out and 2015 pencilled in. On social media, split-screen images of the riot that followed King's death and the one that followed Gray's proliferated. The temptation is to believe that nothing has changed, but something has: Baltimore is blacker and poorer than it was then. It was not difficult to see who set buildings on fire there last week. The more salient concern is how cities become kindling in the first place. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Disparities\n\nJust over a year ago, during a high-school assembly in Jena, Louisiana, a black student asked the school's white principal if it would be all right to sit under an oak tree outside, an oasis of shade known as the \"white tree,\" because only Caucasian students congregated there. The principal said that the young man could sit where he liked. Later, the student and some African-American friends walked over to the oak and chatted with some white schoolmates. The next day, somebody fixed two nooses to the tree's branches.\n\nThe ropes inaugurated a narrative of conflict and small-town justice in the Deep South known today as the case of the Jena Six, a story populated by a disconcerting number of stock characters from the late Jim Crow era. Its origins signalled a theatrical quality that a swelling cast, including the Reverend Al Sharpton, has managed to sustain; an Off Broadway production (backlit oak tree, gentle wind machines, soliloquies about past and present) seems inevitable.\n\nAlthough some of the evidence in the Jena case is murky, a cumulative verdict of racial double standards lies beyond reasonable doubt. Between Reconstruction and the end of the Second World War, more than two hundred and fifty people in Louisiana, the great majority of them African-Americans, were lynched. Jena's recent noosemakers, identified as a trio of white students, were recommended for expulsion by the principal, who was evidently conscious of this history, but a white school superintendent imposed suspensions only, on the ground that the tree display was a prank. In the days leading up to that decision, fights had erupted between black and white students, and the local district attorney, Reed Walters, reportedly gave a speech in which he warned students, \"With a stroke of my pen, I can make your lives disappear.\"\n\nLast December, at the school, a black student coldcocked a white student, Justin Barker, knocking him briefly unconscious; other black students allegedly kicked the victim while he lay on the ground. Barker was treated for cuts and bruises at a hospital and released a few hours later. The police arrested six black students, aged fourteen to eighteen, and Walters charged them with attempted second-degree murder and a conspiracy count; if convicted, they faced up to seventy-five years in prison.\n\nJena prosecutors started reducing the charges to aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy. Still, last June an all-white jury convicted one of the defendants, Mychal Bell, who was sixteen years old at the time of the assault, of crimes that threatened him with up to twenty-two years in an adult state prison. Michael Baisden, a black syndicated radio talk-show host who normally specializes in romance and its perils, undertook an on-air protest, along with others, which spread across black radio and then to the Internet. In late September, thousands of demonstrators descended on Jena. Last Thursday, Bell, whose convictions had been thrown out, was released on bail, after ten months in jail; Reed Walters has agreed to retry him as a juvenile.\n\nLast week, in the Times , Walters defended his work; he described himself as just \"a lawyer obligated to enforce the laws of my state.\" A devotion to the sanctity of statutes is, of course, essential in a nation governed by laws, but equally important is the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, derived from an intuitive commitment to fairness and common sense. If Walters had possessed a modest measure of such judgment, he might have rescued himself and the town of Jena from notoriety many months ago.\n\nHis bullheadedness, however, does not explain why Jena's narrative has resonated so broadly. Many African-Americans understand the case not only as the civil-rights era redux but as a stark illustration of a here-and-now problem, one about which whites are mainly silent: the mass incarceration of black youths-America's \"school-to-prison pipeline,\" as some scholars have christened it.\n\nThe number of blacks in prison has quadrupled since 1980. There are many overlapping causes, among them severe automated federal sentencing rules; a passionate but badly managed \"war on drugs\" prosecuted most heavily in African-American neighborhoods; and deepening inequalities in personal income and access to education, whose effects fall hardest on urban teen-agers. One study estimates that, if recent trends continue, a third of the black males born in 2001 can expect to do time.\n\nThe state of Louisiana, true to its reputation for rococo extremism in all matters political, locks up in prison a higher percentage of its population-black, white, and all other races combined-than any other state in the nation. It might be of some comfort to politicians, then, if the Jena case, like the disgraceful treatment of displaced African-American victims of Hurricane Katrina, could be rationalized as an isolated, swamp-inspired exception to a more temperate American norm.\n\nThe opposite is true, however. In July, the Sentencing Project, a research and advocacy group, released a state-by-state study of prison populations that identified where blacks endured the highest rates of incarceration. The top four states were South Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Vermont; the top ten included Utah, Montana, and Colorado-not places renowned for their African-American subcultures. In the United States today, driving while black-or shoplifting while black, or taking illegal drugs, or hitting schoolmates-often carries the greatest risk of incarceration, in comparison to the risk faced by whites, in states where people of color are rare, including a few states that are liberal, prosperous, and not a little self-satisfied. Ex-slave states that are relatively poor and have large African-American populations, such as Louisiana, display less racial disparity.\n\nDiscrimination in the American justice system is not only a Deep South thing; it is a national embarrassment. Tocqueville, who initially came to America to study its penal system, might wonder how a democracy can so earnestly debate the justice of detaining foreign nationals at Guantánamo while displaying not a whiff of discomfort about the record number of its own citizens-now more than two million-stuffed into jails and prisons, or about the causes of racial disparity in this forgotten population. America's predominant response to racism, of course, has long been denial. In Jena, the town fathers effected a vivid evasion. Their problem, they concluded, was not themselves but their tree: they cut down the offending oak and hauled it away. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Black and White Ball\n\nAbout thirty minutes into Joy Gregory and David Schwimmer's adaptation of Studs Terkel's 1992 oral history \"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession\" (a Lookingglass Theatre Company première at the Water Tower Water Works, in Chicago), the moral heaviness of the production lifts for a moment, and we're given a glimpse of the errant form of humor that could have catapulted the show past the confines of theatre-as-sociology. In one of the skits into which the evening is divided, the maniacally upbeat host (Andrew White) of a game show called \"Name That Stereotype,\" who wears his cheesiness as proudly as his loud blue-and-white jacket, introduces three contestants-a black man (Cedric Young), an Asian woman (Cheryl Hamada), and a white woman (Corryn Cummins)-who compete in a kind of race raffle by acting out our most unattractive preconceptions. First up, playing \"white trash,\" is the gifted Cummins, whose comic ability is perfectly balanced by her lyrical humanism. She becomes a living embodiment of urban blight: a drug freak working a welfare scam who cares little, if at all, for her fellow-man. Just as we can almost picture her dirty trailer littered with beer cans and food stamps, a bell goes off, \"Jeopardy\" style, and she is followed by Young playing a watermelon-and-pig-foot-eating Stepin Fetchit (\"I'll be happy to be your token darkie-why, heck, y'all can even put me on the Supreme Court if'n you want, so's y'all won't have to make any real changes. Dat'd be fine by me\"), and then by Hamada's compliant geisha (\"My name is Spicy Tuna but you can call me Lotus Blossom\"). In her alluring red kimono, she giggles, eyes downcast, takes tiny pigeon steps across the stage to a white male audience member, bows, and starts to massage his feet. When she suspects that he's unsatisfied with her services, she becomes hysterical and commits hara-kiri. Better death than the dishonor of serving badly. The scene leaves us with questions, which unfortunately the rest of the show fails to answer: Where did these caricatures come from? How have racial stereotypes been promoted in our culture over the years? To what extent have we passively accepted them? How parochial are we? How naïve?\n\nSatire assumes a common experience on the part of its audience-as well as common limitations. The urge to gnaw away at those limitations is what made the standup comedians Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor philosophers of a sort. Neither set out to dissect the role of racism in our national consciousness, but each, in his own way, exposed bigotry. Schwimmer-who was one of the founders of the Lookingglass, and who directed the show and also stars in the television series \"Friends\"-borrows liberally from the conventions of standup comedy, as well as from sitcoms, Lily Tomlin's one-woman performances, and the playwright George C. Wolfe's unforgettable comedic treatise on race, \"The Colored Museum.\" Schwimmer has produced a tight and entertaining show, but one whose technique is more sophisticated than its content, and whose didacticism comes off less as critical analysis than as a plea for the liberal cause.\n\nThe show opens in the dark to the swampy sounds of crickets chirping and water gurgling. As the lights come up, a commanding black woman in an old overcoat (Cheryl Lynn Bruce) circles the stage. She is Mamie Till Mobley, and she is telling the story of her fourteen-year-old son, Emmett Till, who was shot, beaten, and dumped in a swamp while visiting relatives in Money, Mississippi, in 1955. Till was accused of whistling at a white woman. The charge may have been apocryphal, but the \"justice\" it engendered was not-his white assailants were acquitted after jurors deliberated for just over an hour. Defiant, Mrs. Mobley insisted that her son's battered and bloated body be shipped home to Chicago and openly displayed at his funeral, so that America could witness the real face of racism. This story-or, rather, the way it is played here-is instructive. Bruce is a fine actress, but she leans far too heavily on the idea of her character as a formidable, long-suffering black woman-which is in itself a stereotype. As it happens, the real Mrs. Mobley was a complicated figure, a small, light-skinned woman with a girlish flirtatiousness, who delighted in recounting the details of her life, with and without Emmett. To play her, Bruce channels instead Claudia McNeil's Bible-quoting, spiritual-humming matriarch in the 1961 film version of \"A Raisin in the Sun\"-an image of the black woman as paragon of moral virtue which Wolfe quite rightly satirized in a skit in \"The Colored Museum\" entitled \"The Last Mama-on-the-Couch Play.\" Bruce also appears as Ann Atwater, a fiery \"domestic and activist\" who is forced to negotiate school-integration policy with a white Klansman (Tony Fitzpatrick). Predictably, the two can't stand each other-not until they bond over their shared problems as low-income Americans. Now he \"trusts blacks,\" Atwater says with a smile at the end of the scene. It's a ludicrous and painful moment.\n\nSchwimmer knows a lot about the attention span of the contemporary audience, and his seamless direction masks the fact that the play is made up of undeveloped fragments connected only by the subject of race. But one wishes that his ambition had been greater. While each segment is staged with theatrical imagination, none of the characters are written with enough subtlety for us truly to believe in them, and the script is full of missed opportunities. Schwimmer and Gregory could, for instance, have explored one of the great urban American stories: the ways in which blacks and Jews, ghettoized and living in close proximity, have been both united by their common history of oppression and divided by it. To be fair, \"Race\" does include one anecdote about two former high-school friends, Richie (Andrew White), who is Jewish, and Joseph (Reginald Nelson), who is black. \"When the neighborhood was white, I used to get harassed and beaten up for being Jewish,\" Richie says. \"The guys who didn't like me for being Jewish definitely didn't like the blacks for being black. So when the black kids started to move in, I had immediate allies. . . . I was screwed up because I was a reverse racist. Blacks could do no harm.\" But, as in Terkel's book, Joseph becomes a Farrakhan-following Muslim and an anti-assimilationist. We're shown Richie's feelings of rejection (\"I have a hard time understanding what he's into\"), but, in a scene that lasts less than ten minutes, there's no serious attempt to explore the paradigm.\n\nSchwimmer and Gregory do incorporate elements that are not in Terkel's book (there are references to the 1992 beating of Reginald Denny, for instance, and to the 1998 dragging death of James Byrd, Jr.), and it would have been marvellous if they'd tossed away more of Terkel and incorporated other, more resonant voices on marginalization-Bernard Malamud or James Baldwin or James Agee, say, whose \"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men\" captured the racial divide with heartrending exactitude. But instead of voices we hear facts and figures: \"Black males have the lowest life expectancy of any group in the United States,\" one actor says. \"Their unemployment rate is more than twice that of white males. Even black men with college degrees are three times more likely to be unemployed than their white counterparts.\" Another actor adds, \"Suicide is the third leading cause of death for young black males. Since 1960, suicide rates for young black males have nearly tripled, and doubled for black females.\" While this is distressing, it's information we look for in the Times , not in the theatre. What we want here is catharsis, which can lead to a change of heart or mind. What we get is Terkel's homilies, his pedestrian humanism, and a surface-level sociology that reflects the mind of an industrious but uninvested journalist. \"Race\" makes a powerful case for Schwimmer's potential as a director, but one hopes that next time he'll stage less perfunctory material. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Police Dog Bites Black Man\n\nThe Department of Justice's report on the Ferguson Police Department is full of eye-catching numbers that reveal a culture plagued by significant racism. Statistically significant. For instance, nearly ninety per cent of the people who prompted a \"use of force\" by the F.P.D. were black. Even among such skewed percentages, there are some standouts. Among cases in which a suspect was bitten by an attack dog and the suspect's race was recorded, what percentage were black?\n\nA hundred per cent.\n\nThere is little nuance in the incidents described in the report; the police simply sicced their dogs on unarmed black males. According to the F.P.D's own guidelines , handlers should not release the hounds \"if a lower level of force could reasonably be expected to control the suspect or allow for the apprehension.\" But the report reveals that the F.P.D. is quick to set loose its trained attack dogs-often on black children.\n\nIn one account, a dog was sent after an unarmed sixteen-year-old who was also Tasered. The electric shock of that weapon partially paralyzes a person. If that were to happen while a dog was tearing at your arms and legs, all you could do would be to watch in immobilized horror.\n\nAnother case involved four police officers, including a canine handler, trapping an unarmed fourteen-year-old in an abandoned basement. The crime? Trespassing. The D.O.J. report recounts what the boy says happened to him: \"When he saw the dog at the top of the steps, he turned to run, but the dog quickly bit him on the ankle and then the thigh, causing him to fall to the floor. The dog was about to bite his face or neck but instead got his left arm, which the boy had raised to protect himself. F.P.D. officers struck him while he was on the ground, one of them putting a boot on the side of his head. He recalled the officers laughing about the incident afterward.\"\n\nThe starkness of these accounts prompts some questions. Were no white suspects ever subdued with dogs? Were all the white suspects perceived as less dangerous (than a kid playing hookie)? Was this just overt Bull Connor-style racism? Or was there something more subtle going on in these incidents-an unconscious cuing by the dog's handlers as to whom the animals should attack the most aggressively.\n\nThe use of canines in American policing and surveillance has spiked since 9/11. They have been hired to work as bomb-detection dogs, methamphetamine-sniffing dogs, and cadaver dogs, and they have been trained to detect mines . There are arson dogs, of course, but there are also dogs trained to detect bed bugs and dogs that specialize in locating invasive quagga mussels at boat landings. Then there are dogs trained to find orca scat , or forbidden mobile phones in prison, or Townsend's Big-Eared Bats . The conventional wisdom is simply that dogs have supersensitive, trustworthy noses. We hear about these dogs that perform amazing feats, such as sniffing out cancer , and it reinforces our common faith that they are nearly flawless in this regard-a trust that is further reinforced when we recall our childhood dog, who loved us unconditionally (Wendy, you big loveball), or maybe our favorite on-screen canine star (depending on your generation: Petey, Lassie, Old Yeller, Comet, Hooch, Brian Griffin). The Supreme Court agrees , resisting evidence that a dog's power to smell and detect might be anything less than an unquestionable fact. In a 2006 paper about detector dogs , Richard Myers, a law professor at the University of North Carolina, summarized the lazy rhetoric that courts often use to avoid questioning supposedly tried-and-true methodologies: \"The use of [insert technology here] is well-settled in the law of this [state/circuit] and we need not revisit it here.\"\n\nIt would appear that science supports giving dogs' noses the benefit of the doubt. Humans have about five million olfactory cells, while dogs have as many as two hundred and twenty million. And one study of the canine snout found that it is able to detect scents at concentrations as low as five hundred parts per trillion. But there's a catch, which most of us (including the Supreme Court, a few years back) don't consider: dogs are also astute at picking up on subconscious cues from their handlers-a talent that, like their sense of smell, is exquisite and astonishingly fine-tuned. Science fans may recall the story of Clever Hans-the German horse that, at the turn of the twentieth century, wowed audiences by telling time, reading calendars and solving math problems. Two Berlin academics, named Pfungst and Stumpf, figured out that Hans was reading not only his handler but also the faces of the audience to know when to stop pawing the ground as he had arrived at the right mathematical answer. Around the same time, Americans were being entertained by a similarly talented horse, named Beautiful Jim Key. In later years there came Lady Wonder, the telepathic horse, and Jim the Wonder Dog, another psychic. Domesticated animals are pretty good at figuring out what we want them to do, and for good reason. Training a dog to smell, say, salamander dung (it's been done) requires that the trainer teach the animal cues at the beginning of the training. The dog is eventually weaned off its reliance on human signals, but the cues remain the foundation of the learned behavior. Moreover, dogs have been co-evolving with humans for roughly fifteen thousand years, learning to read us. It shouldn't come as a surprise that a trained dog has a powerful inclination to do what we secretly want them to do.\n\nA 2011 study published in the journal Animal Cognition found that even expertly trained dogs and the most professional handlers cannot evade what is called the Clever Hans effect. In tests, dogs trained to detect explosives and drugs were sent, with their handlers, into a series of rooms to find non-existent contraband. In one room, there was a decoy that had been scented with sausage; in another, there was an unscented decoy accompanied by a sign telling the handler, falsely, that it smelled of contraband; a control room had no decoys. The investigators found, overall, that \"human more than dog influences affected alert locations\": the meat decoy attracted more false alarms than anything in the control room, but the decoy with the sign prompted nearly twice as many false alerts as the one with the tempting scent. In other words, the dogs found their handlers' unconscious cues significantly more compelling than the sausage. Trained animals, it turns out, are arguably better at reading our cues than we are at suppressing them.\n\nA friend of mine recently saw a detection dog at a Metro-North station in Connecticut go into full alert when a fifty-something white businessman in a suit walked by. The trainer pulled the dog back and nodded for the man to pass. My friend noted, \"Training a dog is not something that happens once and then it's over. They are always being trained.\" And so that Metro-North dog has begun a kind of continuing education. Repeat that action and the dog will learn: give middle-aged white guys in brogues a pass.\n\nIn 2011, the Chicago _Tribune _ analyzed three years' worth of data related to police dogs working in suburban Chicago. The analysis revealed how easy it is for certain cultural stereotypes-in this case, of drug-dealing Hispanics­-to travel straight down the leash. When dogs alerted their handlers to the presence of drugs during traffic stops, the officers found drugs forty-four per cent of the time overall. In cases involving Latino drivers, that number fell to twenty-seven per cent. In other words, the dogs were erroneously implicating people of Hispanic descent far more frequently than other people. When this disparity was made public, the question naturally arose of whether handlers' unconscious cues might be the cause? Paul Waggoner, a scientist at Auburn University's Canine Detection Research Institute, who was interviewed by the Tribune , provided the answer . A \"big, resounding yes,\" he said.\n\nThere is a paradox in police-dog work, post-Ferguson. Depending on its training, a dog may or may not be good at alerting us to drugs or bombs. But there is one social ill that all detection dogs, even the poorly trained ones, reveal with searing accuracy: the hidden racial prejudices of the police officers who deploy them.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "A Sermon on Race from National Review\n\nThe killing of Trayvon Martin has created no shortage of complicated reactions and unlikely alliances. Although many politicians and community leaders had called for the arrest of Martin's killer, George Zimmerman, they had mixed feelings about the state attorney leading the prosecution-and, quite likely, about prosecutors in general. Lots of the same people who believe that the criminal-justice system locks up too many defendants for too long were nonetheless aghast to see a jury give the benefit of the doubt to this defendant, this time. Meanwhile, many of Zimmerman's staunchest defenders found themselves seized by a sudden concern for African-American murder victims in Chicago-as if violent crime in the Midwest should somehow cancel out the anguish over a dead boy in Florida. And the A.C.L.U. responded to Zimmerman's acquittal with an embarrassing mixup : the organization couldn't decide whether or not it wanted the government to consider trying him on federal charges.\n\nAmong the strangest reactions of all, though, was an essay, published on Tuesday, called \" Facing Facts about Race .\" It was published on National Review Online, the smart and lively Web site of the venerable conservative magazine. And its author was Victor Davis Hanson, a noted polymath whose fields of expertise range from military history to farming. Hanson framed his essay in part as a response to a speech given at the N.A.A.C.P.'s annual convention by Eric Holder, the U.S. Attorney General. Holder recalled the day his father sat him down for \"a conversation-which is, no doubt, familiar to many of you-about how, as a young black man, I should interact with the police. What to say and how to conduct myself if I was ever stopped or confronted in a way that I thought was unwarranted.\" Holder lamented that, in the wake of Martin's death, he had felt it necessary to have a similar conversation with his own teen-age son.\n\nOf course, there's nothing inherently objectionable, or tragic, about telling a boy to be polite to police officers. For Holder, the tragedy is in the unspoken subtext: the belief that an African-American boy is likely to be stopped, often, and the fear that if he responds in anger to a police officer-or, for that matter, to a private citizen patrolling his neighborhood-he might be at special risk for rough treatment, or worse. To Hanson, Holder's speech seemed somewhat inflammatory; it was, he wrote, \"not aimed at binding wounds.\" And so Hanson decided to relate his own version of Holder's \"conversation\": a \"sermon,\" he called it, that \"non-African-Americans,\" like him, hear from their own fathers, and deliver to their own sons. Evidently, this advice, the wisdom of generations, can be summarized in a single sentence: \"When you go to San Francisco, be careful if a group of black youths approaches you.\"\n\nThis premise has a history at National Review , and not a happy one. Last year, one of the magazine's contributors, John Derbyshire, wrote a strikingly similar essay called \" The Talk: Nonblack Version .\" Although Derbyshire's essay included some rather provocative assertions about \"the mean intelligence of blacks,\" its advice was notably similar to Hanson's: \"Avoid concentrations of blacks not all known to you personally.\" Derbyshire's essay was published not in National Review but in Taki's Magazine , whose aim is to \"shake up the stodgy world of so-called 'conservative' opinion.\" Apparently, Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review , didn't appreciate this form of agitation: he fired Derbyshire, two days after the column was posted.\n\nHanson's essay doesn't mention Derbyshire, either to defend him, after the fact, or to explain why this new \"sermon\" is different from Derbyshire's old \"talk.\" And as of Wednesday afternoon, thirty-six hours after publication, Hanson still seems to be employed at National Review . One of the people who noticed this was Derbyshire himself, who responded with a wry comment at VDARE .com, another conservative site that might be described as un-\"stodgy.\" (Its editor is Peter Brimelow, a former National Review editor, and its list of contributors includes Jared Taylor, whom Brimelow describes as a \"white nationalist.\") \"Numerous kind souls have emailed in to tell me that Victor Davis Hanson has confessed to having given his son 'The Talk, Nonblack Version,' and published his confession at, of all places, National Review Online ,\" Derbyshire wrote . He seemed to view Hanson's essay as bittersweet vindication. \"In matters ideological, timing is everything,\" he added. He appended George Orwell's famous quotation about the rewriting of history: \"Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia!\"\n\nPart of what's puzzling about Hanson's \"sermon\" is that it doesn't seem very useful. If the \"group of black youths\" in San Francisco really does have ill intentions, it might not be possible to \"be careful\" once they have already approached-although Hanson's father, who seems to have been mugged while parking, might have had a chance to drive away. (A different anxious father, drawing a different lesson from the Zimmerman case, might offer a simpler, more traditional piece of advice: when you go to the big city, bring a gun.) Hanson also adds a story from his own life: \"When I was a graduate student living in East Palo Alto, two adult black males once tried to break through the door of my apartment-while I was in it.\" This sounds terrifying, but it doesn't really speak to the wisdom of Hanson's \"sermon\": if two men are trying to break down your apartment door, you are probably well past the point of social precaution.\n\nHanson's broader aim is to focus attention on what seems to him a startling fact: \"a small percentage of Americans,\" he says, are \"committing violent crimes at rates far exceeding their proportion of the general population.\" He is referring to \"young African-American males,\" and, to underscore his point, he writes about a recent jewelry-store robbery in San Francisco: two employees were killed and the owner was injured. All three victims were Asian-American; the suspect was African-American. \"In such cases, too many Americans find there is a sort of tired sameness,\" he writes. \"The victims were white or Asian. The murder and robbery suspects were young African-American males.\"\n\nOne hesitates to disagree with \"too many Americans,\" but research would appear to show something different. Government studies suggest that African-Americans are overrepresented among both offenders and victims, and that much violent crime is intraracial. (One study , which looked at nearly thirty years of data, suggested that blacks were nearly eight times as likely as whites to commit homicide, and about six times as likely to be victims of it.) It's strange, then, to read Hanson writing as if the fear of violent crime were mainly a \"white or Asian\" problem, about which African-Americans might be uninformed, or unconcerned-as if African-American parents weren't already giving their children more detailed and nuanced versions of Hanson's \"sermon,\" sharing his earnest and absurd hope that the right words might keep trouble at bay.\n\nIn many ways, the Trayvon Martin affair makes an awkward civil-rights rallying point: there's no obvious and direct connection between the fate of George Zimmerman and the fate of the \"young African-American males\" that so many people, for so many reasons, are worried about. Even the most committed gun-restriction advocates might concede, if pressed, that neighborhoods with astonishingly high homicide rates are unlikely to be transformed by the repeal of \"stand your ground\" laws. But Hanson is wrong to act as if the anguish over Martin's death were a mere distraction from concerns about crime in black America. This was, in some ways, a freak shooting, but it created an outpouring of mourning and anger, inspired, in part, by all the other shootings that have come to seem normal. It's not hard to imagine that Hanson, in a different mood, might have seen fit to join this commemoration, whatever his views about Zimmerman's legal culpability. He might find that African-American parents are as worried about their children as he is about his-probably more so.\n\nPhotograph by Anda Chu/Bay Area News Group/AP.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Secret Project That Led to Black Lives Matter Murals Coast to Coast\n\nThis past Thursday, at 6 P.M. , Keyonna Jones received an unexpected call from a fellow-artist, about a secret project starting in just a few hours. Was Jones available? The mother of two kids under ten, Jones scrambled to find child care. At eight o'clock, she joined a Zoom call; the lead artist explained that Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, D.C., had commissioned eight artists to paint a mural of fifty-foot-high letters spelling out \"Black Lives Matter\" across two blocks of the street leading to the White House. \"This needed to be perfect,\" Jones , the executive director of the Congress Heights Arts and Culture Center, told me. The group plotted how to make the mural-in a bold shade of yellow-where to get supplies, and the logistics of finishing by midday. Several were nervous about the political consequences. \"Some were unsure of the possible backlash-if it was a political play between the mayor and President Trump . They didn't know if the mayor would back them up if something happened, or if President Trump would retaliate,\" Jones recalled. Four days earlier, federal and local law-enforcement officials had used flash grenades, chemical spray, and smoke to drive hundreds of mostly peaceful protesters out of the area around the White House so Trump could walk to St. John's Church and wave a Bible , briefly, in front of photographers. The mural was supposed to finish in front of the church. \"In the Zoom call, it got a little uncomfortable,\" Jones, who is African-American, recalled. The artists agreed that they would participate only if they could remain anonymous. Jones was the only member of the group who would talk to me on the record.\n\nThat night, Washington was also hit by a torrential storm with crackling thunder and lightning that struck the Washington Monument and injured two National Guardsmen stationed near the White House. The giant mural was to be painted on city streets that spanned two blocks. The artists feared that the pavement might not dry in time.\n\nSworn to secrecy, the eight artists met at 3:30 A.M. on Friday. \"The first 'B' took us three hours,\" Jones recalled. \"I kept saying, 'Oh, my goodness, are we going to make it in time?' \" Once they figured out the measurements and proportions, four of the artists moved down the street blocking letters while the other four painted. Then they ran out of paint-they had only three gallons-partway through the \"L\" in \"Black.\" They didn't get more paint until 7 A.M. -and it was a different shade of yellow. The deadline was only four hours away. Then the rollers started breaking.\n\nAs the city came to life, people on Sixteenth Street, which leads to the White House, stopped to watch. Word quickly spread on social media. \"People were coming up from all over, asking if they could help. We didn't know what to say,\" Jones said. At the time, the small multiracial crew had no idea that the mayor intended to speak publicly after the mural was finished or that a new street sign was being put up that declared the area \"Black Lives Matter Plaza.\" Running out of time, Jones and the other muralists started directing volunteers where to paint. Among them was a guy named Toby who was in a suit and on in-line skates. \"The community took over,\" Jones said. \"I don't know how many there were in the end.\"\n\nThree days later, Jones was still processing the history she'd helped to make with a mural that has since landed on front pages across the world and been photographed from space. \"I didn't prepare myself for what I was doing. This went from an internal assignment to a communal experience to global really quick,\" she said. \"The mayor knew what she was doing. She had this planned, but she kept it low, which is what helped make it as bold as it was. You woke up, and there it was.\"\n\nThe street sign was the other key part of the project. It was created by Wayne Bennett Pettus, a sign-fabrication technician for the D.C. government by day, and a rapper, under the name Benxett, in his off-hours. Pettus's supervisor asked him to make the \" Black Lives Matter Plaza \" sign. \"It really was a secret,\" he told me. The complication was that all street signs in Washington are a bright green substrate vinyl with white lettering-to make them reflective, for visibility-and the mayor's office wanted the sign in black and white. \"I had to figure a workaround, and no one thought we could do it.\" Pettus toyed with ink to adapt the available materials and still make the sign reflective. It took several trials. \"The rest is history,\" he told me.\n\nAfter we talked, Pettus sent me lyrics from several of his songs that respond to the spate of killings of African-Americans by police. They were all written before George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis police, on May 25th. Among them was this one:\n\nThey told us tuck our head, and don't say shit Told us play the game, so we tried being patient Told us \"appreciate the arrangement\" Forget about the past, as if all their crimes were ancient So swept under the rug, it's in the basement Had us shot and killed all for their entertainment I ain't even talkin' reparations System got a problem, and we need to make some changes.\n\nThe Washington, D.C., chapter of Black Lives Matter condemned the mural and Pettus's street sign. In a tweet, the group called the project \"a performative distraction from real policy changes\" and said, \"Bowser has consistently been on the wrong side of BLMDC history.\" The movement added, \"This is to appease white liberals while ignoring our demands. Black Lives Matter means defund the police.\" Pettus said he understood. \"We don't want this to be a vanity project,\" he told me. \"People have a feeling of joy from these signs but also a lot of skepticism. We want to see what is next-and hoping that this is not it.\"\n\nIn the end, the mural and the street sign were completed on time. Afterward, Bowser held a press conference. \"There are people who are craving to be heard and to be seen and to have their humanity recognized,\" she said . \"We had the opportunity to send that message loud and clear on a very important street in our city.\"\n\nSteve Hansen , a city-council member in Sacramento, was watching news coverage of the new Washington mural on CNN. He was inspired. \"New art for Capitol Mall?\" he posted, on his Facebook page, at 9:09 A.M. Pacific Time. Hansen had previously sponsored art projects in support of other political issues, including immigration. His first instinct, he told me, was that the project was a good fit for BAMR , a local African-American artist whose real name is Demetris Washington. ( BAMR stands for Becoming a Man Righteously.) But Hansen didn't know how to reach him. He contacted Atrium , a local artist collaborative, with an offer to fund and facilitate a mural along the grassy plaza around Sacramento's capitol. Atrium contacted several artists, who also suggested BAMR . The muralist initially turned it down, but, by 11:08 A.M. , he agreed to do it.\n\nThe Sacramento story mirrored the speed of the Washington project-with its own challenges. BAMR arrived at the plaza at 2 P.M. \"I saw how big it was, and I said, 'Holy shit, I'm supposed to do this before curfew at 8 P.M. ?' \" he told me. He had no finalized design, no supplies, no help-and the area was roughly the size of three football fields. To fill the space, each letter would have to be roughly twenty feet by thirty feet, with five feet between letters. \"We did a lot of quick math,\" he told me. BAMR scrambled to get supplies; he and a friend were back by just after 4 P.M. , with only four hours left before a curfew went into force. The day was unusually windy; then the paint didn't stick. \"We were in the middle of the grass, and we tried rollers, but it was useless,\" he told me. The muralist put out an SOS on Instagram.\n\nAs in Washington, complete strangers showed up. BAMR still doesn't know from where. They came with rakes and brooms and blowers to remove the dead grass from the plaza. Volunteers brought weed sprayers to use for the paint; they initially worked but then started clogging. \"Out of nowhere, someone showed up with an airless sprayer for paint,\" BAMR said. \"Someone else brought a generator. There were conversations among people. Some were running home to get other things.\" In the end, at least three hundred volunteers participated. \"People were giving me credit for coördinating, but it was spontaneous,\" BAMR said. \"I have never seen anything like this in my life.\"\n\nIn the middle of the mayhem, a local d.j. came out with a turntable. Someone else provided a snack booth. \"It was like a flash party,\" BAMR said. Shira Lane, the founder of the Atrium art group, called the turnout \"magical.\" Hansen insured that permits were obtained and that they could work past curfew. \"Everyone was confident that they wouldn't be shot,\" BAMR said. By 8:45 P.M. , the huge mural was finished-in just under five hours.\n\nThe artist described it as a paradigm shift. \"As a black man, you feel so suffocated all your life. It's unspoken. Portrayals of black males center on the hood or selling drugs or crime,\" he told me. Blacks have been taught that you grow up in the conditions to which they are exposed. To be given a platform to tell the world what is happening-and the world should listen-was different, he said. \"So, for us, this was empowerment, to put this message on the front lawn of our capitol,\" he told me. \"This is a shift of energy on our planet.\" Over the last four days, other murals have been painted in big public spaces in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Oakland, California. They are unlikely to be the last.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Obama, Trayvon, and the \"American Dilemma\"\n\nFour days after President Obama took to the White House podium to talk about the outcome of the Trayvon Martin case, many people are still discussing what he said, which isn't surprising. In some ways, it was a bravura performance.\n\nIn explaining how history shapes the way many African-Americans view the criminal-justice system, and in personalizing some of the trivial but humiliating slights experienced by young black men, even college-educated ones like himself, the President gave voice to realities that are too often ignored. In pointing to high crime rates among African-American youths, and the problem of black-on-black crime, he acknowledged another reality, one that shapes how many non-whites perceive blacks. And in taking a few well-aimed jabs at Florida's Stand Your Ground laws, he highlighted the one indisputable message of the Martin case: guns do, indeed, kill people. (Had George Zimmerman been unarmed when he came across Martin, we almost certainly wouldn't have heard of either of them.)\n\nAll of these things needed saying, and Obama said them well, deftly avoiding the dangers of coming across as angry or professorial. But one thing that the President didn't do was call for a rethink of race relations in terms of broader social and economic policies, nor did he call for a big political debate about race. \"I haven't seen that be particularly productive when politicians try to organize conversations,\" he noted. Rather, he asked for \"soul-searching,\" calling on Americans to ask themselves some questions, such as, \"Am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can? Am I judging people as much as I can, based on not the color of their skin but the content of their character? That would, I think, be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy.\"\n\nAppropriate, certainly. But sufficient for the scale of the larger problem?\n\nIn thinking about racism, and racial issues, it is surely a bit artificial to try to restrict the analysis purely to the private sphere, or, indeed to law and order. (Obama also suggested that the Justice Department could work with local authorities to improve police training and other things.) The criminal-justice system is where racial tensions and disparities often play out, and occasionally erupt, but it isn't at the core of the matter. The core issue, as the Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal pointed out in his classic 1944 study, \"An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy,\" is the enduring contradiction between America's stated ideals-liberty, justice, equality of opportunity-and the subjugated conditions in which many black Americans live out their lives.\n\nOf course, many things have changed for the better since Myrdal and his research collaborator, Ralph Bunche, published their findings. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed racial discrimination in schools, restaurants, polling stations, and other public places, and the Voting Rights Act, the following year, finally opened the polls in the South. New careers opened to blacks and other minorities. Poverty rates fell in black communities, and education levels rose: over time, many more blacks moved to the suburbs and joined the middle classes. But many got stuck behind, and the terms of the debate about what was responsible for their failures changed dramatically.\n\nIn 1965, the year Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then a freshly minted Harvard Ph.D., wrote a report for the Labor Department titled \"The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,\" which pinned responsibility for things like persistent poverty, high dropout rates, and rampant crime on the breakdown of two-parent families in the black community. As the years went on, other conservatively inclined analysts blamed Johnson's Great Society programs for creating a culture of dependency. On the progressive side of the political divide, academics such as William Julius Wilson-another Harvard man, by way of Chicago-strenuously resisted these arguments, pointing to the demise of the manufacturing industries on which blacks depended for employment, and to the continuing reality of racial discrimination and segregation.\n\nBitter battles were fought over these issues, political campaigns were waged, friendships were broken. Following twenty years of right-wing agitation about the deleterious effects of anti-poverty programs, President Clinton signed the 1996 welfare-reform act, which obliged the recipients of cash assistance to work twenty hours a week, and placed a five-year limit on state handouts. With the economy buoyant, the critics who said these actions would lead to a surge in homelessness, crime, and other problems proved to be mistaken, but so did those who argued that welfare reform would transform minority communities for the better.\n\nLast month, in a useful report titled \" The Moynihan Report Revisited ,\" the Urban Institute highlighted the continuing disparities between black America and white America, and the stubborn endurance in poor black communities of the \"tangle of pathologies\" that Moynihan had observed. Here are some of the report's findings:\n\nIn non-Hispanic white families, twenty-nine per cent of babies are born out of wedlock. In non-Hispanic black families, seventy-three per cent of babies are born out of wedlock.\n\nLargely because black children are far more likely to be living with a single parent, they are much more likely to be living in poverty. In 2010, about thirteen per cent of non-Hispanic white children were living in poverty, compared with close to forty per cent of non-Hispanic black children.\n\nAs has been the case since at least the nineteen-fifties, unemployment rates among black men are roughly twice as high as among white men. (Among white men aged twenty and over, the jobless rate is 6.2 per cent. Among black males, the rate is thirteen per cent.)\n\nIn 2010, white men in full-time employment earned about $52,000 a year, on average. Black men in full-time employment earned, on average, about $35,000.\n\nLargely as a result of the war on drugs, incarceration rates for black males have risen sharply since the nineteen-seventies. By 2010, almost one in six black males had spent some time in prison. The rate for white males was roughly one in thirty-three.\n\nThe report confirmed that some things have changed for the better. Since the nineteen-sixties, over-all rates of residential segregation have declined significantly, dropout rates among blacks has fallen, and the proportion of blacks graduating from college has more than doubled. But the report also demonstrated that progress is relative. Particularly in poor areas, economically enforced racial segregation remains the norm. And, over all, blacks are still five times more likely than whites to live in high poverty neighborhoods-i.e., areas where more than forty per cent of the inhabitants live in poverty. Those neighborhoods tend to have worse schools. In higher education, too, there remains a big gap between the races. In 2010, close to thirty per cent of white men had completed four years of college, compared to about twelve per cent of black males.\n\nHere is part of the report's conclusion:\n\nAlmost five decades after Daniel Patrick Moynihan issued his report on black families, the United States still struggles with many of the problems he identified. Although social progress has created opportunities for many talented members of the black community, success has been made more difficult by the high barriers many blacks face....\n\nStructural barriers to black progress include criminal justice policy, residential segregation and concentrated poverty, the state of public schools in predominantly black communities, and lingering and pernicious racial discrimination....\n\nAlthough the level of overt discrimination in the United States has diminished markedly since the 1960s, race remains a factor in determining economic opportunities and outcomes. Whether discrimination is overt, subconscious, or based on statistical profiling, it impedes black economic progress. Continued, aggressive enforcement of antidiscrimination statutes as well as affirmative action policies are required to ensure equal opportunity.\n\nWhat does Obama think of all this? As America's first black President, he embodies the fact that race relations have changed, and that some blacks have breached the uppermost echelons of the American establishment. As a former community organizer, he doesn't need a report from the Urban Institute to remind him of the problems faced by many who are less fortunate.\n\nStill, apart from an occasional speech to black colleges , he has largely avoided addressing racial issues during his term of office-a stance that some critics in the black community have described as politically craven, but which may also be politically astute. With budgets pinched, and with Republicans in control of the House of Representatives, the President knows all too well that there is little prospect of obtaining funding for new anti-poverty programs aimed explicitly at minorities. And with the G.O.P. also holding power in a majority of state houses and state legislatures, where many sentencing policies are determined, there is little chance of reforming the drug laws. In such circumstances, a strong argument can be made for focussing on race-blind policies that happen to benefit minorities disproportionately, such as widening access to health care, protecting income-support programs, and trying to toughen up the federal gun laws.\n\nIn choosing the aftermath of George Zimmerman's acquittal to talk about race, Obama also kept his comments carefully circumscribed. Suggesting it was time to think about \"how do we bolster and reinforce our African-American boys?\" he explicitly acknowledged that big new federal initiatives were non-starters. What he seemed to advocate was stepping up private-sector efforts and mentoring programs of the sort encouraged, twenty-odd years ago, by George H. W. Bush, with his much mocked \"thousand points of light\" initiative.\n\nIn a nod to his role as the symbol of hope rather than disappointment, Obama closed his remarks on a markedly upbeat note: \"As difficult and challenging as this whole episode has been for a lot of people, I don't want us to lose sight that things are getting better.\" As he often does, he brought up his daughters, Malia and Sasha. After listening to them, he said, and seeing them interact with their friends-some of whom, presumably, are white girls who attend the the exclusive Sidwell Friends School-he was confident that the younger generation is \"better than we were on these issues. And that's true in every community that I've visited all across the country.\" He went on: \"We should also have confidence that kids these days, I think, have more sense than we did back then, and certainly more than our parents did or our grandparents did; and that along this long, difficult journey, we're becoming a more perfect union-not a perfect union but a more perfect union.\"\n\nPhotograph by Win McNamee/Getty.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Darker Than Blue: Policing While Black in N.Y.C.\n\nSamuel Battle's first three attempts to become a police officer were rejected because he allegedly had a heart murmur. Before his fourth attempt, Battle went to an independent doctor, and, in 1911, after receiving a clean bill of health, he became the first black officer appointed to the metropolitan New York City Police Department. Battle was stationed in the West Sixty-eighth Street precinct. Almost fifty years after he joined the force, he participated in a Columbia University oral-history project . Battle communicated an impression of strength. He was a big guy-six feet three inches, two hundred and eighty-five pounds-and his personality seems to reflect that, especially when he tells one story about how he was treated at the precinct.\n\nThey never made any threats personally, to me. Never. Nobody would ever do that. But there was one occasion, when I was at the flag loft-and this was before Sergeant Stewart came up there to stay with me-I found a note pinned right over my bed, with a hole in it about the size of a bullet hole. It could have been done; I don't think they shot off a gun, but it was something to make it look like a bullet hole. And on this note was written: \"Nigger, if you don't quit, this is what will happen to you.\"\n\nOn the day he was appointed, Battle said, Rhinelander Waldo, who was then the commissioner, told him, \"You will have some difficulties, but I know you will overcome them.\" Perhaps his reaction to the note fulfilled that premonition: \"After this note was left there, it didn't faze me at all,\" he said. \"I didn't care; it didn't make any difference. I knew whoever did it was a coward.\"\n\nBattle also recalled a riot, in 1919, at 135th Street and Lenox Avenue in Harlem, where, he said, \"The white officers worked in an all-Negro neighborhood, practically, and they needed me as much as I needed them, and sometimes more.\" He was promoted to sergeant in 1926, and to lieutenant in 1935. In 1941, he became New York City's first black parole commissioner. In 2009, the intersection at 135th and Lenox was named Samuel J. Battle Plaza.\n\nBattle became an officer at a time when integration seemed to be the prevailing solution for what was then called the \"race problem.\" Police departments are not only institutions that aim to insure public safety; departments, and their unions, are powerful political machines, and in politics representation is important. But efforts to integrate police departments, however successful, have not erased tensions between police departments and black communities.\n\nThe origins of American policing, the historian W. Marvin Dulaney argues, cannot be fully understood without considering slavery and racism. \"By the beginning of the eighteenth century, most American colonies had enacted laws to regulate the behavior of African slaves,\" Dulaney writes in his book \"Black Police in America.\" \"The codes also established the slave patrol or 'patterollers.' The slave patrol was the first distinctively American police system, and it set the pattern of policing that Americans of African descent would experience throughout their history in America.\"\n\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century, as abolitionist movements gained momentum, the policing of black Americans-both free and enslaved-intensified. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 authorized federal agents to help find, detain, and return escaped persons to slavery, and required citizens to assist in the recovery. Moreover, the act stipulated, \"In no trial or hearing under this act shall the testimony of such alleged fugitive be admitted in evidence.\" The groups of white men that had constituted slave patrols a century before evolved into official, protected actors of the state, incentivized to use force to insure the existence of slavery. By passing the law, Congress made a moral calculation. Congressional leaders wanted to avoid a civil war. To that end, California entered the union as a free state, and the slave trade ended in Washington, D.C. Western territories could become slave states by popular vote. And, by way of the Fugitive Slave Act, the free parts of the country would police African-Americans in ways that foreshadowed the tragedies that would befall Eric Garner , Michael Brown , Walter Scott , and many others.\n\nDuring this period, some African-Americans also became police officers. \"By accepting the racial status quo and the legal oppression of other blacks, these law enforcement officers became the first African Americans to confront the paradox of policing a society where the color of a person's skin often determined guilt or innocence,\" Dulaney writes. \"They also became the first to accept such roles because they believed that they could improve their own precarious position in a society where status was based on skin color.\"\n\nSince Trayvon Martin's death in February, 2012, Americans have been discussing the relationship between young black men and law enforcement with new intensity. The Dream Defenders, the Ferguson protests, the #blacklivesmatter hashtag, and other social-justice efforts make it difficult for anyone to ignore the hostility between police departments and black men and women. In the past three years, we have become familiar with a long list of names, including Rekia Boyd, Kimani Gray, Garner, Brown, Akai Gurley, Tamir Rice, Scott, and Freddie Gray . As demonstrated in the Department of Justice's report on Ferguson , the killings tell only part of the story. \"Our investigation has shown that distrust of the Ferguson Police Department is longstanding and largely attributable to Ferguson's approach to law enforcement,\" the report states. \"This approach results in patterns of unnecessarily aggressive and at times unlawful policing; reinforces the harm of discriminatory stereotypes; discourages a culture of accountability; and neglects community engagement.\"\n\nIn New York City, things came to a breaking point this past December, when two N.Y.P.D. officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, were killed by a man who, at least according to his social-media postings, was seeking revenge for the deaths of Garner and Brown. In the last days of 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio gathered with Governor Andrew Cuomo, Vice-President Joseph Biden, and others to pay tribute to officers Ramos and Liu. At the funeral for Ramos, as the mayor rose to speak, many of the police officers watching on screens outside of the church turned their backs to his image in dissent. In the opinion of many of the officers, de Blasio had fanned public discontent with the N.Y.P.D. by making statements that month about how he had warned his son, Dante, to be careful when engaging with police officers. \"Look, if a police officer stops you, do everything he tells you to do. Don't move suddenly, don't reach for your cell phone,\" de Blasio said he told his son. \"Because we knew, sadly, there's a greater chance it might be misinterpreted if it was a young man of color.\"\n\nNew York City Police Commissioner William Bratton also eulogized the two police officers. \"We don't see each other-the police, the people who are angry at the police, the people who support us but want us to be better,\" Bratton said. \"If we can learn to see each other; to see that our cops are people, like Officer Ramos and Officer Liu; to see that our communities are filled with people just like them, too; if we can learn to see each other, then when we see each other, we'll heal.\"\n\nIn February, 2015, Commissioner Bratton spoke to a large crowd assembled at One Police Plaza for the department's celebration of Black History Month. The N.Y.P.D. employs close to thirty-five thousand uniformed officers, about six thousand of whom identify as black. These officers of all ranks gathered alongside their families, children, and community members to celebrate the \"progress within our diaspora,\" as the program of the day stated. During his remarks, however, Bratton noted what he saw as a regression. \"Your numbers in this department are declining, numbers in our recruit classes are declining, even as your numbers in this city are increasing,\" he said. He made an appeal:\n\nIf you like this job, if you like this profession, if you like what it's done for your family, if you like what it's done for you, and what we, collectively, can do for this city, then I ask you to share-to share the responsibility for insuring that, as the march continues, there are many more marchers, many more African-American marchers, many more black marchers. We will work hard-the leadership of this department-to have that happen, but we cannot do it alone.\n\nBratton's request, though, reflected a common confusion about race. What our eyes identify as race is a signifier that divides our country along the indices of wealth, power, and full citizenship: white Americans, with their relative ease of access to those goals, and black Americans, aspirant but still largely excluded. Black officers in New York City stand at the intersection of those lines. Those officers embody the difficulties that racism presents for our police forces, and their struggles show how current N.Y.P.D. policies would need to change before there can be anything like healing.\n\nNot long after the police officers turned their backs on de Blasio at Officer Ramos's funeral, I met with a black transit officer who has been on the force for seven years. One of the first things he asked me was whether or not I wanted to hear the truth about his experience. He did not feel comfortable discussing his experiences without anonymity, fearing that telling the truth could result in on-the-job reprisals and jeopardize his chances for promotions. (Numerous other policemen I spoke with either declined to comment or asked that their remarks be kept off the record. Their fears are not unfounded: an N.Y.P.D. officer named Adhyl Polanco was suspended, and later reassigned, after he complained internally about stop-and-frisk .) And so the officer, comfortable with the terms of anonymity, began to tell me his story:\n\n\"Born and raised in Brooklyn. I had a real tough childhood. Caribbean descent. My parents came here chasing the American Dream like anyone else,\" he said. As a teen-ager, he recalled, \"I didn't want to become a police officer, yet I kept getting stopped-about the age of fourteen, fifteen. I started getting stopped a lot. I just didn't get it, because I know I wasn't doing anything wrong, although there were people in the area that were.\" One particular moment sticks out in his mind. At eighteen, he was walking with his girlfriend when an officer stopped him and began \"searching through every pocket, going through everything, as if I was under arrest,\" he said. \"And on the adjacent corner were the actual criminals, watching me get searched.\" He told me that he realized then that, in the eyes of the police, \"we're all just criminals.\" His desire to know if, or how, the police academy was encouraging officers to treat citizens that way sparked his interest in becoming an officer.\n\nThe training he received at the police academy, he said, was actually quite good. Reflecting on the times when he was stopped as a teen-ager, he said, \"I learned in the police academy that those stops were unlawful.\" When Bratton ran the N.Y.P.D. in the nineteen-nineties, he introduced a policing tool called CompStat, which is used to identify patterns and locations of crimes throughout the city. Greater intelligence about where crime happens is not controversial on its own. But CompStat is also used as a tool for measuring officers' performance; it sharply raises the accountability of precinct-level commanders and officers who work in areas where the most crime occurs. Broken-windows policing operates on the belief that focussing on minor infractions will discourage more serious crimes, and CompStat created a way to measure which officers have done the most to stop those minor infractions. The N.Y.P.D. began implementing versions of stop-and-frisk in the nineteen-seventies; the introduction of CompStat marks one point at which stop-and-frisk tactics expanded. The N.Y.P.D. has drastically curtailed stop-and-frisk in recent years. Among criminologists, there is little consensus on why crime rates have decreased in New York City. Whether or not broken-windows policing prevents crime without inflicting unnecessary and unjust harm is the question that animates the current disputes, and is what concerns the officers I spoke with.\n\nA 2014 report by John Jay College of Criminal Justice found that, from 1990 to 2013, as violent and non-violent crime rates dropped across the city, \"the greatest increases in misdemeanor arrests have been experienced by young minority men.\" For instance, the report states, \"the rate of misdemeanor arrests for Black males aged 18-20 almost tripled.\" The transit cop I spoke to argues that broken-windows policing insures that such discrepancies will continue.\n\nThe N.Y.P.D. is, of course, only one part of the city's criminal-justice system: high numbers of low-level arrests and summonses strain resources for courts, jails, and taxpayers. In April, city officials announced plans to reform the summons process . The changes will include redesigning the paper ticket that a person receives, reminding people of their court dates, elucidating the consequences of a missed court date, and adding a section on the form where officers can note a person's race. In May, Bratton said that he is open to clearing the 1.2 million or so open warrants that have resulted from missed court appearances for low-level summonses. Still, the threat of disproportionate punishment-a summons, an arrest, police brutality, or death-hangs over impoverished, largely black and Hispanic communities throughout the city. \"Given the way that crime has fallen in New York City, a so-called high-crime area just means there's higher crime than in other parts of the City, but with the low numbers that the police department is reporting it's still not really high crime,\" Delores Jones-Brown, the founding director of the John Jay College Center on Race, Crime and Justice, told me. \"In those so-called high-crime areas, people who can least afford to have anything else affect their employability are being strapped with these low-level offenses.\" The transit officer I spoke with corroborates Jones-Brown's research. \"Because of broken windows, any arrest is a good arrest,\" he said. \"I arrest you for spitting on the floor-it's a good arrest. It's a quality-of-life arrest.\" He added, \"Because of CompStat, we need more arrests.\"\n\nBroken-windows policing relies on officer discretion, but with the incentives heavily stacked toward making an arrest, proper training and a good conscience can easily be overwhelmed. Arrests and summonses are what officers \"live and die by,\" the transit officer told me. \"As a commanding officer, if you want to be promoted to a higher rank there's no more exams; it has to be done at the discretion of the top brass, and the only thing that they judge you by, what your effectiveness as a commanding officer is, is how many arrests you have in comparison to this point last year.\" Because of his upbringing, though, he chooses not to engage in the types of policing that prioritize arrests; this choice, he says, might threaten his chance to be promoted. \"As an officer of color, it doesn't sit well with me whatsoever. And, personally, I don't engage in it.\"\n\nWhen I asked him what, in the face of this internal struggle, keeps him going, he said,\n\nI was always big on giving back to the community, doing for others. My father, he raised me saying, \"Just because you're capable of helping someone means you have to. It's not an option.\" I'd always known that I was going to give back and do something, somehow. I had no idea that it'd be through this job. But I think that's my calling. I think this is what I need to do, where I need to be. At least twice a month, after interacting with someone, they tell me that it's the first time that they've actually felt the service of what policing is supposed to be. And that keeps me going-just the people.\n\n135th and Lenox is a busy intersection. On one corner, a street sign marks Samuel J. Battle Plaza. Here, Lenox Avenue is also called Malcolm X Boulevard.

      "text": "Zimmerman, Everyman\n\nIn his first days on trial, George Zimmerman offered a new twist on an old truism: if tragedy plus time yields comedy, his demeanor suggested that those ingredients might also yield lethargy. By the end of the first week, he'd had an uptick from drowsy to sober, and, with the exception of a brief smile while his former professor testified, sobriety has remained his bearing throughout. Observers have pondered the meaning of his substantial weight gain-whether its cause is the defense's strategy to present their client as a cherubic, hapless neighborhood watchman, or simply stress. Given Zimmerman's decision not to testify before his defense rested its case on Wednesday afternoon, that speculation takes on a new dimension. Zimmerman the man may remain as much an enigma as the events of the night in question. The fixation with his girth, his inattentiveness, and his over-all presentation pointed to a truth: we long ago recognized that Trayvon Martin was deeply symbolic, but, for a good number of people, Zimmerman is, too. And whatever the verdict, it will be followed by an outpouring of support for the defendant.\n\nOn one level, it appears that focussing on George Zimmerman in a discussion of crime and profiling is as useless as believing that Paula Deen's utterance of the word \"nigger\" is a barometer of the state of labor relations: the concerns are far broader and deeper than the public faces momentarily associated with them. The N.R.A.'s success in passing proactive self-defense laws like Florida's Stand Your Ground is tied to a decades-long concern with crime that is only marginally tethered to the threat it actually poses. A nation doesn't generate the largest prison population in the world by making assessments based solely on reason instead of emotion. But in other ways, Zimmerman's fate, and the status he has achieved among those who support him, says something about this particular moment.\n\nLast winter, George Zimmerman saw a hoodie-clad black male cutting through a subdivision in the rain, and registered him as a threat. There are many white people who do not think of themselves as racist who can imagine themselves drawing the same conclusion. From this perspective, blandishments about Trayvon Martin's right to move through that neighborhood unmolested are only so much political correctness. And as a result, Zimmerman becomes a sympathetic figure, a man who did what anyone would do under the circumstances-a man whose cause can generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations. There's a made-for-TV quality to the narrative attached to him: pudgy man joins a boxing gym, sheds upwards of sixty pounds, and diligently patrols a besieged neighborhood. Save for his bad credit, he might've been a police officer in Prince William County, Virginia-but, in the wake of a housing collapse, who would hold such a thing against him? That Zimmerman now reportedly wears a disguise and body armor in public completes his sacrificial mythology.\n\nIn a 2012 study , some fifty-six per cent of Americans were found to hold what the Associated Press terms implicit \"anti-black sentiments,\" an increase of seven percentage points in four years. Fifty-one per cent of respondents in the same study \"express[ed] explicit anti-black attitudes.\" At the same time, fifty-six per cent of the public believes that the rate of crimes committed with guns has gone up over the past twenty years, when in fact the firearm homicide rate dropped by forty-nine per cent from 1993 to 2010, and the rate of non-fatal violent crimes that involved a gun fell by seventy-two per cent. Thus the assumption among his defenders that Zimmerman was, at worst, wrong for all the right reasons.\n\nWe live in an era in which the protocol for addressing even the most severely bigoted behavior very often includes a conditional apology to the offender-a declaration that he has made a terrible error, but is, of course, in no way racist-and, eventually, an outpouring of support for the fallible transgressor, victim of the media and the \"race-hustlers.\" We grade racism on the severest of curves, and virtually no one qualifies. This apparent contradiction-the prevalence of racist attitudes, the disavowal of actual racism-is key to understanding the way Zimmerman has been received. His actions are understandable, even reasonable, because it doesn't take a racist to believe black males equal danger. To bridge the gap between those assumptions and the objective fact of Martin as an unarmed teen on a snack run, it's been necessary for Zimmerman's defenders-legal and otherwise-to assassinate a dead teen-ager's character, to turn him from a slight seventeen-year-old into a rapper in his thirties with facial tattoos . Traces of weed, a few vile tweets, and a suspension from school don't usually get you menace-to-society status, but for some Zimmerman diehards, it's close enough to round up.\n\nAn increasingly loud din originating in the conspiratorial right wing, but by no means confined to it, has begun warning of impending race riots should Zimmerman be acquitted. This is only partly about tensions stemming from a high-profile trial-it's also about a segment of America that feels threatened. That the defense seemingly deployed every known synonym for \"weak\" in describing their client only makes him resonate even more with people already fearful of crime and worried about angry black mobs taking to the streets. In fairness, Broward County sheriffs have proactively begun meeting with community leaders and clergy to plan post-verdict strategies for keeping the peace. But riots tend to happen when people expect one thing and get another, and, at this point, a Zimmerman acquittal would shock no one.\n\nThe same study showing the preponderance of anti-black attitudes indicated that fifty-two per cent of whites expressed anti-Hispanic sentiments, and fifty-seven per cent had implicit anti-Hispanic attitudes-which makes the events unfolding in the Seminole County courtroom all the more compelling. Zimmerman's mother is Hispanic, from Peru, and his father is white. The officer who arrested Zimmerman listed him as white; the jail's intake officers amended that to \"white Hispanic.\" Zimmerman is not often mentioned or thought of as a person of color, but in the crime-paranoid and immigrant-hostile climate we live in, it's not hard to imagine a person with his skin color being profiled for reasons not entirely distinct from the ones that first brought Martin to his attention.\n\nFor the moment, Zimmerman exists in a sort of racial penumbra. He'll retain that status for as long as he's thought of as a Charles Bronson figure for people who are or believe themselves besieged by crime, people who know well the resentments that come in tandem with fear. Circumstances like this trial inspire any number of actions, but self-reflection isn't one of them. Whatever the troubling rationales for Zimmerman's behavior, they'll remain subsumed by the drama in the courtroom and the inevitable tide of recrimination in the wake of the verdict, whatever it is. Each side will take up their defensive positions, but, no matter what happens, we'll still find ourselves witness to an undeclared war on crime and our own fears, one led by private citizens and in which a seventeen-year-old became collateral damage.\n\nRead more of our coverage of the George Zimmerman trial and Trayvon Martin.\n\nPhotograph by Orlando Sentinel/Getty.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "3 theories why Democrats have lost support among Black men\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt's an erosion that's taken place over the last decade.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nFor years, Black men have been an integral part of the Democratic coalition.\n\nIn 2012, 87 percent of Black men backed former President Barack Obama; in 2016, 82 percent backed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; and in 2020, 79 percent backed President Joe Biden , according to NBC exit polls . This year, 70 percent have said they're backing Vice President Kamala Harris, per a recent New York Times/Siena poll .\n\nAs those numbers make clear, the group overwhelmingly supports Democrats, but their loyalty has begun to wane, a shift that stretches across the last several campaigns. That attrition has something to do with the candidates themselves, but also with voters' longstanding disillusionment with the party. Despite being one of Democrats' most loyal voting blocs, some Black voters have felt ignored and taken for granted as campaign promises and change have been slow to materialize.\n\n\"People are disappointed with the Democrats,\" says David Childs, a history professor and director of the Black Studies Program at Northern Kentucky University. \"A lot of people feel disenfranchised. They don't feel like they have a voice.\"\n\nAn added twist is some evidence that the Democrats' leftward shift on social issues may also be a factor. Reviewing polling on respondents' views on LGBTQ issues, Thomas Edsall of the New York Times noted that views expressed by Black voters in one survey suggested that \"some aspects of Democratic liberal orthodoxy contribute to the exodus of conservative minorities from the party.\"\n\nThe erosion Democrats have seen could be attributed to any number of reasons. But broadly, here are three theories that can explain why some Black men are feeling cool toward the party this cycle:\n\nIn the last four years, Black Americans have faced the same economic challenges as everyone else, while also navigating racial wealth and wage gaps that mean many Black families feel the effects of rising costs and inflation more keenly than their white counterparts.\n\nWhile Black unemployment reached an all-time low during the Biden administration, it's still twice as high as white unemployment . Similarly, while the Black poverty rate reached a record low in 2022 , that all-time low still meant nearly one in five Black Americans was living in poverty, nearly double the poverty rate of white Americans .\n\n\"In focus groups and conversations with party leaders, Black men have stated repeatedly that their material conditions have remained unchanged under Democratic and Republican presidential administrations,\" the New York Times's Maya King reports . And as costs have risen during the Biden administration - mostly due to inflation - that feeling of stagnation has only grown more pronounced.\n\nSuch sentiments have prompted some voters to weigh whether voting for an alternative option - like Trump - could help produce a different outcome.\n\n\"Nothing has come to fruition. Look at the schools, the playgrounds, the parks. Downtown is struggling. In our community, typically, we vote for Democrats. How has that panned out for us?\" Ahmad Taylor, an undecided Michigan voter who previously voted for Biden, told the Washington Post's Michael Brice-Saddler.\n\nMultiple Covid-19 aid packages also helped stem the economic pain some voters experienced because of the pandemic during the Trump administration and the beginning of the Biden administration. These included stimulus checks, small business funding, and expansions to unemployment payments.\n\nA number of these payments, however, expired during the Biden administration because Republicans in Congress balked at passing a continuation of programs like an expanded child tax. That's left voters dealing with both higher costs on consumer goods and a drop-off in aid that could help soften the blow.\n\nBecause the first wave of stimulus checks was sent out during the Trump administration and also bore his name , some voters have been under the mistaken impression that he's solely to credit for them. That idea has taken hold even though the aid was passed by a Democratic House and a Republican Senate, and even though stimulus payments were distributed during the Biden administration as well.\n\nAnother dynamic at play is more conservative attitudes among some Black voters on social issues. In particular, as Democrats have shifted leftward on LGBTQ rights - just over a decade ago, Obama was hesitant to back same-sex marriage - some of these voters have chafed at the party's current stance.\n\nThis cycle, Republicans have ramped up attacks on LGBTQ rights, particularly those targeting trans people , and that may be resonating with certain voters , including Black men . In one attack ad on Harris that played during football games, the Trump campaign has gone after her support for funding gender-affirming surgeries for trans inmates - something, it should be noted, that prisons also offered under Trump . \"Kamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you,\" the ad states.\n\nCharlamagne Tha God, an influential media personality and one of the hosts of the syndicated radio show The Breakfast Club , has described the ad as \"effective.\"\n\nOther voters have spoken of Democrats' support for gay rights as a problem. \"That's when I left Democrats alone,\" one voter, identified as J, told NPR , noting that the legalization of same-sex marriage, a milestone made possible by the Supreme Court but celebrated by Democrats, was his tipping point away from the party.\n\nThose socially conservative viewpoints can extend to gender as well. When it comes to Harris's candidacy, specifically, sexism might well be a real issue for some voters, including Black men.\n\n\"There are traditional values that come out of a lot of the Black homes that are still around,\" Childs says. \"Even though many Black males were raised by a mother, by a matriarch, there's still this notion that women have a certain place in our society.\"\n\nCliff Albright, executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, notes that he's heard the sentiment from a small percentage of voters he's spoken to. \"You got some percentage that will come out and tell you, like in your face: 'I don't think a woman should be president,'\" he says.\n\nA problem that only amplifies Democrats' struggles is the rise of disinformation, multiple experts posited.\n\nChilds notes that influencers on the right have seized on real concerns Black men may have - like economic frustration - to advance false messages about how Harris and Biden haven't accomplished anything to help members of this group.\n\nIn one example that Charlamagne Tha God cited during a town hall with Harris this week, he referenced a viral clip from a Harris interview with the Grio that was taken out of context and has been cut so it looks like she's saying she won't do anything specifically for Black people.\n\nThese claims often begin with pundits on the right, or even Trump himself, and get amplified over social media by celebrities, podcasters, and other prominent personalities. The singer Janet Jackson , for instance, recently elevated lies that Trump had told questioning Harris's ethnicity.\n\nMultiple surveys, including an August NAACP poll , have found a stark generational divide among Black men, with voters under 50 far less likely to support Harris than those over 50. Albright believes this points to the effect disinformation on social media has had, as younger voters are more likely to get news from these sources.\n\n\"It's like a living organism, this disinformation. It grows from a cell, and then it reaches the point where it takes on a life of its own, and it just grows all kinds of tentacles,\" Albright tells Vox. \"And ... it's touching millions of Black voters.\"\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Jenée Desmond-Harris\n\n\"There are more black men in jail than in college.\"\n\nIvory A. Toldson - Howard University professor, senior research analyst for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, and deputy director of the White House Initiative on HBCUs - called this, in a 2013 column for the Root , \"the most frequently quoted statistic about black men in the United States.\"\n\nIt's also dead wrong.\n\nIn 2002, the Justice Policy Institute, a national nonprofit dedicated to reducing incarceration, released a report titled \" Cellblocks or Classrooms : The Funding of Higher Education and Corrections and its Impact on African American Men.\"\n\nOne of its key sobering findings was this: \" Nearly a third more African-American men are incarcerated than in higher education .\"\n\nThe statistic almost instantly became a talking point. It was often deployed by those who wanted to explain just how dire racial disparities in the United States were, and how desperately the situation facing black men needed attention and intervention.\n\nEven Barack Obama has mentioned it. At a 2007 NAACP forum that he attended as a presidential candidate, he told the crowd, \"We have more work to do when more young black men languish in prison than attend colleges and universities across America.\"\n\nThe stat was also repeated by those who wanted to anchor their arguments that that African American communities - and black men in particular - suffered from a dangerous cultural pathology.\n\nIn 2012, former NBA player Charles Barkley, explaining why he felt he had to carry a gun , said, \"You know, we as black people always, we don't have respect for one another. You know, we've got more black men in prison than we do in college, and crime in our neighborhoods is running rampant.\"\n\nThe Census estimates that approximately 18,508,926 people in the U.S. population are black males, of all ages. In 2013, 1,437,363 were in college, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics.\n\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Prisoner Statistics Program reports that in that same year, 526,000 were in state or federal prisons, and, as of mid-year 2013, 219,660 were in local jails, making for a total of about 745,000 behind bars. The millions of black men not included in those numbers, of course, have already finished college, already served a prison sentence, have a life trajectory that does not involve college or prison, or are too young for either to apply.\n\nAccording to Toldson, the 2002 \"Cell Blocks Versus Classroom\" report that provided the basis of \"more black men in prison than in college\" was based on data that was was likely incomplete at the time, and has definitely become outdated since.\n\n\"I pulled the data from 2001 that the Justice Policy Institute used [for the \"Cellblocks of Classrooms\" report] and I noticed that at least 1,000 colleges weren't reporting their head count of black males then,\" he told NPR in 2013. \"And I also noticed that a lot of colleges that didn't report any numbers, when the Justice Policy Institute wrote their report, were historically black universities. They were big, state universities that I'm pretty sure had some black males present at the time.\"\n\nThat's right. The number of black men in college used in the report wasn't actually the number of black men in college. It was the number of black men at schools that chose to report this data - a much smaller figure.\n\nPlus, things have changed. Thanks to a variety of factors including the popularity of for-profit colleges, the raw numbers show that enrollment of black males in college increased from 693,044 in 2001 to 1,437,363 in 2013.\n\nNumbers aside, the college vs. prison comparison is problematic on its face. Men (of all races) can be incarcerated at any point in their lives for any length of time, while enrollment in college typically happens during a narrow age range and a short timespan. So contrasting the two experiences is an apples-to-oranges exercise that doesn't tell us much about what's happening with any population.\n\nWhile the scary statistic was probably handy for creating some drama around the plight of black men (and it's true - there are far too many in prison), it's not accurate, and probably never was.\n\nRepeating this false statement does far more harm than good. As Toldson said, \"[W]e will not sufficiently support black male college students - nor college-bound students - if we simply keep perpetuating the myth that juxtaposes their needs with those of black males in the criminal-justice system.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nNothing will cure you of perfectionism faster than trying to grow living things.\n\n3 theories for Gen Z's return to God and faith.\n\nTrump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate his ban on trans military service, after a lower court blocked it.\n\nHow a day off can (and can't) help children.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nVox analyzed dozens of studies and found that racism adds up in insidious ways.\n\nby Sean Collins and Izzie Ramirez\n\nData visualization by Alvin Chang for Vox and Capital B\n\nPart of the discrimination issue of The Highlight . This story was produced in partnership with Capital B .\n\nAfter a long search, Keisha Orr - a human resources manager working on Wall Street in the early 2000s - believed she had found the perfect candidate for a job at her financial tech company. The applicant had it all: an ambitious resume, a decorated educational career, and poise. Keisha asked her supervisor and the hiring manager to move the candidate to the next round. They bristled.\n\nEven though the client service position didn't require a degree, the hiring manager told Orr that the candidate wasn't eligible because he hadn't finished college, never mind that he was a college senior a few months away from completing his bachelor's at New York University. Orr couldn't help but wonder whether the resistance was because the potential hire was Black.\n\n\"It was almost like I was cosigning for him in some ways,\" Orr, who is a Black woman, told Vox. \"No one we had interviewed even held a candle to him. It was very baffling and mind-blowing to me.\"\n\nThanks to Orr's persistence, the candidate was eventually hired, staying with the company for years. Yet she's never gotten over the sense of angst that she might be held responsible if he didn't meet expectations. Only now, 20 years later, does Keisha recognize that what happened was discriminatory.\n\nWhen something is as ubiquitous as discrimination, it becomes familiar, and what is familiar quickly becomes so ordinary as to be almost imperceptible. That's why discrimination is regularly dismissed, even by those whom it affects the most. The hurdle for Keisha and others has long been that it's often hard to prove.\n\nOur collaboration launched with a comprehensive look at Juneteenth as it became the nation's newest federal holiday. You can read the entire discrimination package here .\n\nDecades' worth of discrimination studies collected by researchers at the University of Chicago and shared with Vox, however, spotlight how common experiences like Keisha's really are. In the face of denials from many white Americans that systemic racism exists, the myriad studies provide tangible proof that it is, in fact, pervasive, affecting many areas of life.\n\n\"The thing we were surprised by was after George Floyd, there was this debate about, 'I don't know, is discrimination really systematic?'\" said Devin Pope, a professor of behavioral science and economics and one of the University of Chicago researchers who set out to compile the data. \"We're like, wait, people don't realize that this is a closed topic? The evidence is overwhelming that Black Americans get treated differently than white Americans in so many points of their lives.\"\n\nResearch around discrimination in America continues to grow and capture attention. There are the big examples: Black people dying needlessly while giving birth , receiving smaller paychecks than their white colleagues , being excluded from certain neighborhoods and all the amenities and opportunities they provide. Discrimination steals their health, degrading their cells through a process known as weathering. It makes the American dream of embracing the freedom of the open road a nightmare. It prevents folks from accessing quality health care . It is buried in the code that powers the digital world. Each of those circumstances comes with its own anxiety and angst.\n\nThe studies provided to Vox by the University of Chicago researchers - Pope, Oeindrila Dube, and Sendhil Mullainathan - illuminate the everyday experiences: having emails go unanswered , having trouble getting help in public , being undertreated when in pain . Those quotidian tasks make up the average American's day, yet when tainted by racism, they can make daily life for Black Americans more difficult, with myriad repercussions.\n\nVox's review of more than 40 studies, which were conducted over nearly 50 years, animates a reality that any Black American could expound upon at length, offering a view into what discrimination snatches from individual Black Americans every day of their lives. It's one thing to know that racism exists; that it has made life more challenging in both hidden and obvious ways and has not meaningfully improved in the last few decades . It's another to see those experiences boldly affirmed in reams of data, to have tangible proof that what you think you're experiencing isn't just in your head, and that it is systemic and endemic.\n\nThe research used various methodologies (including correspondence studies , field experiments , statistical analyses , and review studies ) and were conducted in a range of locations from North Carolina to Chicago to Seattle , looking at a range of ages and class divides. (The University of Chicago researchers worked on some of the studies; others informed their own work.) They all drew the same, insidious conclusion: Anti-Black discrimination practiced by Americans, white and otherwise, routinely robs Black people of opportunity, money, health, safety, and dignity.\n\nBlack life isn't just unfairly strenuous; it's also artificially short. The National Center for Health Statistics projects that the average life span for a Black American is 70.8 years. The projection for a white American? 76.4 years. That gap makes time all the more of the essence for Black people.\n\nYet anti-Black discrimination wastes their time - a lot of it.\n\nVox analyzed the data from the studies to provide an expansive picture of just how much. We learned that the average Black American could lose years, if not decades, of their life to discrimination.\n\nThe studies collected by Pope and his colleagues, as well as a breadth of other research, contain countless examples of this time-stealing phenomenon. Black Americans have to wait days longer for an appointment with a new doctor . They must be prepared to wait one day longer for a response for information about joining a new church and have to send out twice as many emails to get a response from a potential roommate . They spend more time applying for mortgages , and they see more Uber rides canceled - the list goes on.\n\nOrr is just one example. She lost time - to worry, sleepless nights, and nerve-racking conversations with leadership - that she could have spent advancing her career or taking care of herself and her family.\n\nA longer wait time doesn't necessarily mean racism. Yet Black Americans feel negative consequences even from potentially discriminatory actions, the studies showed.\n\n\"The minute you point out what you think or feel, it's 'You're playing the race card' and it immediately diminishes what is a reality,\" said Henrika McCoy, a professor of social work at the University of Texas at Austin who researches equity in mental health for Black males and writes about institutional racism. \"Racism is not about intent. Racism is about power to implement the prejudice that you have, but it's also about the outcome.\"\n\nA 2015 study by Tara Goddard, Kimberly Barsamian Kahn, and Arlie Adkins contains a particularly acute example of the irrelevance of intent. They measured the time it took for cars to stop for Black and white pedestrians at a crosswalk without a signal in Portland, Oregon. The researchers found that Black pedestrians had to wait an extra 2.4 seconds to cross the street on average.\n\nWhat is 2.4 seconds? Ephemera, seven blinks . But what if you are an average Black American and you live to age 70.8? What if you cross the street once a day? Then you've spent about 17.16 hours longer waiting to cross the street than you would have if you were white. That's more than a full waking day of your life taken by discrimination.\n\nSay you're a civic-minded Black American and you never miss an election. A 2022 study by M. Keith Chen, Kareem Haggag, Pope, and Ryne Rohla used smartphone location data and neighborhood demographics information to track wait times in voting lines across the US for the 2016 presidential election . They found that Black Americans living in majority-Black areas have to wait longer to vote, sometimes more than 30 minutes. How long depends on where you live, but on average, wait times in areas with all Black residents were 5.23 minutes longer than in areas with no Black residents. Across a lifetime of elections, that can add up to about more than an hour waiting in line.\n\n\"If everything takes you 15 minutes more, now you've got less time with your kids, you have less time at work, you have less sleep,\" Chen told Vox. \"It adds up.\"\n\nEven fun can be tainted. Trinity Alicia, a 23-year-old living in Boston, recalled an evening she spent at a Cambridge bar. It was an unfamiliar space: Everyone was older and white. Her friends were busy, and so she'd come alone.\n\n\"The bartender just was like, 'You know, you can get a drink somewhere else,'\" Alicia said. \"He definitely served other people that came to the bar after me. And I was wondering, like, 'What is this?' I was confused because I hadn't had a hidden discrimination experience like that before.\"\n\nDeflated, Alicia went home. She'd spent time getting ready, commuting, trying to get the bartender's attention. Four hours of her life. Vaporized.\n\nOne could argue that a few lost hours at a bar aren't the end of the world. Stolen hours quickly become days and years, however, and that time tariff becomes far more significant in important areas like housing, finances, and employment.\n\nThe wage disparity between Black and white Americans is well documented : Black people in this country persistently make less than white people. Black women make less than their male peers and face a double discriminatory tariff, due to both race and sex. An Economic Policy Institute analysis found that in 2022, the average white employee made $34.49 an hour, while the average Black employee made $25.61 - a difference of $8.88, or nearly 30 percent. This can mean the difference between having food on the table, emergency savings money, a 401(k), and student loan debt paid, or not.\n\nThe discrepancy means that Black time - that same time stolen by discrimination - is worth markedly less than white time: 43 cents per minute versus 57 cents. To make up the pay gap caused by discrimination, a Black worker must toil an extra 2.7 hours each day. Over the course of a career (assuming one starts working at 22 and retires at 65), that's the equivalent of 3.4 years of extra work - years that the worker could have spent with their family or friends, or frittering away any way they wanted.\n\nThe time tariff affects many other areas of employment, too. In a seminal 2004 study, Mullainathan, collaborating with Marianne Bertrand , found that Black Americans needed an extra eight years of experience to receive the same number of interview requests as a white American of equal qualifications. In the eyes of recruiters, that makes a 22-year-old white job seeker from Princeton University looking for employment in the financial sector equivalent to a 30-year-old Black Princeton graduate who started working in the industry right out of college.\n\nAs many wealthy Black Americans have noted, money is no aegis against racism . In fact, scholars Stephen Holt and Katie Vinopal analyzed data from the American Time Use Survey, which tracks how people in the US ages 15 and older use their time. They found that while poorer Black Americans and poorer white Americans spent roughly the same amount of time waiting for goods and services in an average day, wealthy Black Americans spent 26 more minutes than their equally moneyed white counterparts waiting; that's 1.3 years wasted.\n\nDiscrimination as it exists today is sustained by the interlocking gears of history, white supremacy, white nationalism, sexism, and classism. To destroy discrimination, one must first obliterate its component parts. There's not always societal or political will to do so. It can also be hard to constantly acknowledge the presence of discrimination and its emotional toll.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we live in a society where, in order to be successful as a person of color, especially as a Black person, you have to move past [discrimination], because if you don't, you'll probably never get anything done,\" said McCoy, the social work professor.\n\nPlus, Valerie Wilson, director of the Economic Policy Institute's program on race, ethnicity, and the economy , points out, it's a huge burden for an individual to prove discrimination. \"The system currently is set up in a way that you have to have the experience of discrimination before anything happens,\" she said, \"as opposed to us putting more resources and energy into preventing it or limiting opportunities for it to happen in the first place.\"\n\nAt the same time, the large body of existing discrimination research can be used to slowly chip away at the issues discrimination causes, several of the researchers Vox interviewed said. It can be effectively used to support arguments in lawsuits, for instance - and has been, perhaps most famously in Brown v. Board of Education , in which the plaintiffs relied on an experiment known as the \"Doll Test\" to advance their arguments. In closed rooms, where bureaucracy relies on data, these studies provide evidence.\n\nThere is no easy solution to the problems discrimination causes, no easy way to get back the time it saps. \"We have to get creative,\" said Seft Hunter, the director of Black-led organizing and power-building at the DC-based nonprofit Community Change Action. \"We know there are folks who are just happy not knowing what's happening, because then they're not in a position to have to confront what it means to see these disparities play out uninterrupted all across the country.\" Purloined time becomes yet another issue our eyes gloss over, something bad that's part of the normal fabric of the everyday.\n\nThat's what makes discrimination so frustrating. It is deadly, expensive, tiring, and dehumanizing. It's also a complete waste of time.\n\nSean Collins is a news editor with Vox's politics and policy team.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby German Lopez\n\nMost of the racial prejudice Americans harbor today is subtle and manifests itself in stealthier ways than it did in the past. It shows up in how employers view potential hires, how salespeople choose to assist people at high-end stores, or how teachers dole out punishments to misbehaving students. Often subconscious, these race-based evaluations of character or intelligence have wide-ranging effects.\n\nExtensive research on the subject shows that just about everyone carries this subconscious prejudice, known as implicit bias, no matter how well-meaning they might be. In the criminal justice system, this implicit bias may contribute to the many racial disparities in law enforcement. When it comes to police officers, implicit bias is a widespread concern, precisely because of how devastating its effects can be, with trade publications and federal programs taking steps to address it through training and awareness.\n\nThere are law enforcement officials who understand how devastating the effects of implicit bias can be, but no one understands this more than the people living in communities where racial minorities are disproportionately targeted by police and arrested. The reaction to police killings since the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri - most recently, the police shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma - is about more than a specific individual incident; it's also about the overall system that makes such deaths at the hands of police disproportionately common.\n\nBut it's not just police shootings. When looking at the criminal justice system as a whole, there are many, many racial disparities - in incarceration rates, length of prison sentences for the exact same crimes, and even the death penalty .\n\nSome of the disparities are explained by socioeconomic factors - such as poverty, unemployment, and segregation - that make black Americans much more likely to commit crime than their white counterparts. But a 2015 study by researcher Cody Ross found, \"There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.\" That suggests something else - such as, potentially, racial bias - is going on.\n\nCops stereotype black men without being aware of it Lorie Fridell is a University of South Florida criminologist who works with cops to help them resist subconscious biases, particularly against young black men. She previously talked to me about how these biases can work.\n\n\"Similarly to explicit bias, [implicit bias] groups people into stereotypes and prejudices,\" Fridell said. \"What's different is it doesn't come with outward hostility.\"\n\nIn police work, this bias can show itself when an officer stops a subject he views as a potential threat. Police officers are legally allowed to use force based on their perception of a threat, so long as their perception is defined as reasonable (usually as judged by a prosecutor, judge, jury, or grand jury). That doesn't, however, mean they always use force. \"Police very often use a lesser level of force even when they're justified at a higher level,\" Fridell said.\n\nBut if some cops automatically consider black men more dangerous, they probably won't show nearly as much restraint against a black suspect as they would against, say, an elderly white woman. So police officers might be more likely to use deadly force against black people that's legally justified but perhaps not totally necessary.\n\nResearchers at the University of Colorado Boulder and California State University Northridge in May 2014 reviewed a decade of empirical evidence about cops and implicit bias. They found police officers seem to possess implicit bias that might make them more likely to shoot black suspects than white ones. But this bias may be partly controlled through proper training, and police officers appear to perform better - meaning they show less implicit bias - than participants from the general public.\n\nTo test these disparities, researchers have run all sorts of simulations with police officers and other participants. In the earlier days, these simulations would quickly flash images of black and white people along with different objects, and ask participants to identify if the object was a gun. More recently, researchers have used video games to see how people react to suspects of different races.\n\nJosh Correll, a University of Colorado Boulder psychology professor, ran some of these tests with a shooter video game . His initial findings showed police officers generally did a good job of avoiding shooting unarmed targets of all races, but when shooting was warranted, officers pulled the trigger more quickly against black suspects than white ones. This suggests that officers exhibit some racial bias in shooting.\n\nIn the real world, this could lead police to shoot black people at disproportionate rates. Real policing situations, after all, are often much more complicated: Factors - such as a real threat to the officer's life and whether a bullet will miss and accidentally hit a passerby - can make the situation much more confusing to officers.\n\nSo if cops, as Correll's simulations suggest, tend to shoot black suspects more quickly, it's possible that could lead to more errors - such as shooting a black suspect when it's not necessary - in the field. \"In the very situation in which [officers] most need their training,\" he previously told me, \"we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them.\"\n\nOther research found that the public and police are less likely to view black people as innocent. As part of a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 2014, researchers studied 176 mostly white, male police officers, and tested them to see if they held an unconscious \"dehumanization bias\" against black people by having them match photos of people with photos of big cats or apes. Researchers found that officers commonly dehumanized black people, and those who did were most likely to be the ones who had a record of using force on black children in custody.\n\nIn the same study, researchers interviewed 264 mostly white, female college students and found that they tended to perceive black children ages 10 and older as \"significantly less innocent\" than their white counterparts.\n\n\"Children in most societies are considered to be in a distinct group with characteristics such as innocence and the need for protection,\" Phillip Goff, a UCLA researcher and author of the study, said in a statement. \"Our research found that black boys can be seen as responsible for their actions at an age when white boys still benefit from the assumption that children are essentially innocent.\"\n\nThe one optimistic part of all this grim research is that implicit biases may be reduced over time through practice and experience. The longer officers and other participants took part in the simulations, the less likely they were to make errors. Some of Correll's research also found that certain types of training can diminish racial bias.\n\nFridell, of the University of South Florida, capitalizes on this research to help police departments around the country train their officers all along the chain of command.\n\nThe training relies mainly on the types of shooting simulations used by Correll and other researchers to test cops, but the training sessions are redeveloped to purposely disprove stereotypes against race, gender, age, and other factors. As a result, the training sessions help officers learn to focus more on other cues - body language, what someone is holding - instead of race. (This training isn't generally required by law, but it's becoming more common as concerns grow about racial disparities in the criminal justice system.)\n\nFridell said that this training needs to look beyond race. \"In the same way we as humans have stereotypes linking blacks to crime and aggressiveness, we also have stereotypes of lack of crime and aggressiveness,\" she said, pointing to women and the elderly as two examples. \"For a police officer, this might lead him to be under-vigilant against certain groups.\"\n\nNeill Franklin, a retired major who served for 34 years in the Maryland State Police and Baltimore Police Department, previously told me that the need for this kind of training is something he witnessed in his everyday work. As the commander in training units in both the state and local police forces, he often pushed for officers to consider their bias before taking any official action as a cop.\n\n\"[W]e all have this subconscious bias. Even me, as a black police officer, I felt the same,\" Franklin said. \"When I would be in certain parts of the city and see young black males, it would run through my mind, 'What are they up to? Are they dealing?' That's because of what we've been bombarded with for so many years from so many different directions, including the media.\"\n\nBeyond the simulations and training, Fridell said community policing, which focuses on building ties between local police departments and their communities, can help break down stereotypes. This is what's called the contact theory : Positive interactions with stereotyped groups can reduce explicit and implicit biases. A cop who interacts with black residents in his town might realize that many of his previous prejudices, implicit or not, weren't warranted.\n\nCommunity policing can work in two directions. Just as police's perceptions toward the community change, so do community perceptions toward police. This could, Fridell explained, make communities less defensive - and therefore less aggressive - during police interactions.\n\nFranklin, now the executive director of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , which opposes the war on drugs , worries the training might not be enough in the face of perverse incentives in the criminal justice system. Local police departments are under constant pressure to obtain federal grants , which can be tied in part to, for instance, how many arrests they carry out. As was the case in Ferguson , the tickets issued by police officers can also make up a huge source of money for local governments, which encourages police to issue as many tickets as possible - potentially in the black communities they're more likely to be deployed in - to bring in more revenue.\n\nGiven those incentives, Franklin said, police are encouraged to go after \"low-hanging fruit\" often found in minority communities that lack political and financial power, magnifying the effects of implicit bias.\n\nThere are also broader issues with how police are deployed and the tactics they use. Since some of the highest-crime communities are often majority black or brown, police are disproportionately deployed in these areas in a very aggressive manner - often encouraged to, for example, chase down suspects at almost any cost. That's why some reformers say it's necessary to also change how police are deployed and act on the job - not solely to reduce racial biases but to reduce the need to use force in general. (Of course, because of racial biases, the benefits here would largely go to black communities.)\n\nAs Ronald Davis, a former police chief who heads the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, put it to the Washington Post : Police \"need to stop chasing down suspects, hopping fences, and landing on top of someone with a gun. When they do that, they have no choice but to shoot.\"\n\nIt's these types of systemic issues, noted by Franklin and Davis, that are at the root of the problem - and might perpetuate systemic racial disparities even if officers are properly trained in how to deal with implicit bias.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA recent report points out another racial disparity in the criminal justice system.\n\nby German Lopez\n\nIf you kill someone, whether the criminal justice system throws you in prison may come down to your race.\n\nThat's the takeaway from a recent report by Daniel Lathrop and Anna Flagg at the Marshall Project . They looked at federal data to analyze the circumstances in which a homicide was deemed \"justifiable\" by police. Their findings were astounding:\n\nIn almost 17 percent of cases when a black man was killed by a non-Hispanic white civilian over the last three decades, the killing was categorized as justifiable, which is the term used when a police officer or a civilian kills someone committing a crime or in self-defense. Overall, the police classify fewer than 2 percent of homicides committed by civilians as justifiable. ...\n\nIn comparison, when Hispanics killed black men, about 5.5 percent of cases were called justifiable. When whites killed Hispanics, it was 3.1 percent. When blacks killed whites, the figure was just 0.8 percent. When black males were killed by other blacks, the figure was about 2 percent, the same as the overall rate.\n\nThe racial disparity held up after controlling for different circumstances. When they adjusted for how well the killer and victim knew each other and how the victim was killed, white-on-black-men homicides were two to 10 times as likely to be called \"justifiable.\" And when controlling for age in addition to those other factors, white-on-black-men homicides remained 4.7 times as likely to be called \"justifiable\" as other cases. The disparity also seemed to hold up across the country, according to the report.\n\nOne caveat: The data used by the Marshall Project is incomplete, since not all police departments participate in the FBI database used for the analysis. Still, the Marshall Project looked at 400,000 cases dating from 1980 through 2014 - a large pool of data.\n\nIt's also possible that the findings aren't explained solely by racism. The Marshall Project points to another study: \"If, for instance, white-on-black homicides were mainly defensive shootings in a residence or business, and black-on-white shootings mainly occurred during the commission of a street crime, then the [racial] disparity would be warranted,\" researcher John Roman wrote in a 2013 Urban Institute study of justifiable homicides.\n\nBut this is far from the only racial disparity in the criminal justice system, with similar findings existing at practically every level. Based on nationwide data collected by the Guardian , police in 2016 killed black Americans at a rate of 6.66 per 1 million people, compared to 2.9 per 1 million for white Americans. According to the Prison Policy Initiative , black people are nearly six times as likely to be incarcerated as white people. And according to a 2012 report from the US Sentencing Commission, black people often receive harsher sentences than white people for the same crime; for example, drug trafficking sentences for black men were 13.1 percent longer than those for white men between 2007 and 2009.\n\nThe list could go on. From the harshness of speeding tickets to punishments for car crashes to arrests for drug crimes to clearance rates for murder investigations , racial disparities permeate the criminal justice system.\n\nHigher crime rates in black communities do not fully explain these differences. A review of the research by the Sentencing Project concluded that throughout various time periods in the past few decades, the higher crime rates in black communities only explained about 61 to 80 percent of black overrepresentation in prisons. And another study , from 2015, by researcher Cody Ross found \"[t]here is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.\"\n\nThe Marshall Project, for its part, said that racial biases may explain the difference found in justifiable homicides.\n\nSeveral studies have found that race plays a powerful role in how the general public - and, by extension, those in the criminal justice system - see people. A recent series of studies published by the American Psychological Association, for example, found that people are more likely to see black men as larger and more threatening than white men, even if the black men are not actually larger. Another study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 2014 found that people are more likely to view black children 10 years and older as \"significantly less innocent\" than their white counterparts.\n\nThat helps explain how we got to a point where a person's skin color seems to decide, at least in part, whether a homicide is deemed okay by the police.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

You know, to be a better American?\"\n\nby German Lopez\n\nWhen Heather McGhee, president of the public policy group Demos , got a question from a caller during her appearance at C-SPAN, it was not about the progressive ideals her group is known for. The question, instead, was about a different issue - directed, seemingly, at McGhee's race (she's black):\n\nI'm a white male, and I am prejudiced. And the reason it is is something I wasn't taught, but it's kind of something that I learned. When I open up the papers, I get very discouraged at what young black males are doing to each other and the crime rate. I understand that they live in an environment with a lot of drugs - you have to get money for drugs - and it is a deep issue that goes beyond that. But when, I have these different fears, and I don't want my fears to come true. You know, so I try to avoid that, and I come off as being prejudiced, but I just have fears. I don't like to be forced to like people. I like to be led to like people through example. What can I do to change? You know, to be a better American?\n\nThe caller presented a surprising, open admission of racism on national television - and, even more surprisingly, it came with a request to help address that racism.\n\nMcGhee thanked the caller for his honesty and question. Then she explained how all Americans of all races can help solve the subconscious racial biases that study after study have found almost all of us have:\n\nSo what can you do? Get to know black families, who are not all and not even any majority are involved in crime and gangs. Turn off the news at night, because we know ... that, actually, nightly news and many media markets that have been studied actually over-represents African-American crime and under-represents crimes that happen by white people. Join a church if you are a religious person that is a black church or a church that is interracial. Start to read about the history of the African-American community in this country. Foster conversation in your family and in your neighborhood where you're asking exactly those kinds of questions.\n\nThis fear of communities that we do not live near ... We are still a very, very segregated country. Millions of white Americans live in places where they rarely see anyone of a different race. This fear and set of ideas that we only get from the worst possible news, it's tearing us apart. And we know that in order to be - our name means the people of a nation, \"Demos\" - in order to be a Demos, that is united across lines of race and class and gender and age, we have to foster relationships. We have to get to know who one another actually is. And we're always, I think, as Americans, surprised when we build relationships across race.\n\nThere is certainly a lot of research to back what McGhee is saying here. Studies show, for instance, that people tend to associate black people with criminality, even if they don't hold explicitly racist beliefs.\n\nAs part of a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 2014, researchers studied 176 mostly white, male police officers, and tested them to see if they held an unconscious \"dehumanization bias\" against black people by having them match photos of people with photos of big cats or apes.

A cop who interacts with black residents in his town might realize that many of his previous prejudices, implicit or not, weren't warranted.\n\nThe idea is simple: One of the possible causes of implicit bias is exposure to persistent negative images of black people - studies have found, for example, that the nightly news can present a very skewed picture of race and crime. So exposure in the opposite direction can help mitigate those effects.\n\nThis is essentially what McGhee suggested. It's something that many Americans may not be able to do in their day to day, since the US remains very racially segregated .

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThis is how bad things have gotten.\n\nby German Lopez\n\nHow bad are racial disparities in the criminal justice system? This week, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court - the highest court in the state - concluded that black people may flee from the police due to fear of racial profiling.\n\nAs WBUR reported , the court's ruling cited data from the ACLU and the Boston Police Department to reach its conclusions:\n\nWe do not eliminate flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion analysis whenever a black male is the subject of an investigatory stop. However, in such circumstances, flight is not necessarily probative of a suspect's state of mind or consciousness of guilt. Rather, the finding that black males in Boston are disproportionately and repeatedly targeted for FIO [Field Interrogation and Observation] encounters suggests a reason for flight totally unrelated to consciousness of guilt. Such an individual, when approached by the police, might just as easily be motivated by the desire to avoid the recurring indignity of being racially profiled as by the desire to hide criminal activity. Given this reality for black males in the city of Boston, a judge should, in appropriate cases, consider the report's findings in weighing flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion calculus.\n\nSo before concluding that a fleeing suspect is reasonably suspicious, police now must consider whether the suspect is fleeing not because he's trying to hide a crime, but because he's scared of the police. How exactly this will be enforced in practice is hard to say, but it is now the legal standard for police stops and searches in Massachusetts.\n\nBoston Police Commissioner Bill Evans criticized the ruling. He argued that the police's stop-and-frisk policies \"were targeting the individuals that were driving violence in the city and the hot spots.\"\n\nBut the data backs up the court's conclusion: The ACLU report found that 63 percent of Boston stop-and-frisk encounters involved black people between 2007 and 2010, when the city's black population was 24 percent. Whether a neighborhood had high criminal activity did not explain the disparity. And among the 204,000-plus reports analyzed by the ACLU, police only seized weapons, drugs, or other contraband in 2.5 percent of cases - although it's not clear, due to a lack of data, how many stops led to arrests.\n\nSimilarly, the Boston Police Department's own analysis found that, after controlling for criminal history, gang affiliation, and violent crime areas, black people were 8 percent more likely to be repeatedly stopped and 12 percent more likely to be searched and frisked.\n\nThe court's ruling only applies to Massachusetts, but national police data shows similar disparities.\n\nAn analysis of the available FBI data by Vox's Dara Lind shows that US police kill black people at disproportionate rates: They accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims in 2012, even though they made up just 13 percent of the US population. Although the data is incomplete, since it's based on voluntary reports from police agencies around the country, it highlights the vast disparities in how police use force.\n\nAgain, crime doesn't fully explain the disparities. A 2015 study by researcher Cody Ross found, \"There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.\" That suggests something else - such as, potentially, racial bias - is going on.\n\nThese kinds of figures are why police shootings over the past few years, from Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, to Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina, have drawn so much scrutiny. Black people have long known that they face discrimination at the hands of police - and now the situation is so dire that a state's highest court is stepping in to give some relief.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Underdiagnosed and undertreated, young Black males with ADHD get left behind\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nNovember 7, 2023 / 5:00 AM EST / KFF Health News\n\nAs a kid, Wesley Jackson Wade should have been set up to succeed. His father was a novelist and corporate sales director and his mother was a special education teacher. But Wade said he struggled through school even though he was an exceptional writer and communicator. He played the class clown when he wasn't feeling challenged. He got in trouble for talking back to teachers. And, the now 40-year-old said, he often felt anger that he couldn't bottle up.\n\nAs one of the only Black kids in predominantly white schools in upper-middle-class communities - including the university enclaves of Palo Alto, California, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina - he often got detention for chatting with his white friends during class, while they got only warnings. He chalked it up to his being Black. Ditto, he said, when he was wrongly arrested as an eighth grader for a bomb threat at his school while evacuating with his white friends. So he wasn't surprised that his behavioral issues drew punishment, even as some of his white friends with similar symptoms instead started getting treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\n\n\"Black kids at a very young age, we start dealing with race, we have a lot of racial stamina,\" said Wade, who now lives outside of Durham, North Carolina. \"But I didn't understand until later on that there was probably something else going on.\"\n\nAfter spending years grappling with self-doubt and difficult relationships - and smoking what he called \"Snoop Dogg volumes of weed\" from middle school until his 20s - he learned he had ADHD and dyslexia , two diagnoses that often overlap. He was 37.\n\nIt's long been known that Black children are underdiagnosed for ADHD compared with white peers. A Penn State report published in Psychiatry Research in September studied the extent of the gap by following more than 10,000 elementary students nationwide from kindergarten to fifth grade through student assessments and parent and teacher surveys. The researchers estimated the odds that Black students got diagnosed with the neurological condition were 40% lower than for white students, with all else being equal - including controlling for economic status, student achievement, behavior, and executive functioning.\n\nFor young Black males, the odds of being diagnosed with ADHD were especially stark: almost 60% lower than for white boys in similar circumstances, even though research suggests the prevalence of the condition is likely the same.\n\nThe racial ADHD divide isn't merely a health concern. It's deepening inequity for Black children, and especially Black males, said the study's lead author, Paul Morgan , the former director of the Center for Educational Disparities Research at Penn State. He now leads the Institute for Social and Health Equity at the University of Albany.\n\nADHD has been diagnosed in nearly 1 in 10 children in the United States, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in 2022, with rates surging nearly 70% in the past two decades. It is often a lifetime condition that can be managed with treatments including therapy and medication. Untreated, children with ADHD face much greater health risks, including drug addiction, self-harm, suicidal behavior, accidents, and untimely death. By adulthood, many people with undiagnosed ADHD have spent years feeling isolated and hopeless, just as Wade did.\n\nEven before Wade's diagnosis, he was helping similar college students in a career counseling role at North Carolina State University. Today, he's a licensed mental health and addiction counselor and doctoral student, but he said it's been hard to see his successes.\n\n\"To the rest of the world, this is a Black man with two master's degrees, and he's a PhD candidate, and he has two licenses and certifications,\" he said. \"But to me, I'm a brother who's had a lot of bad luck with people and jobs I've gotten fired from. I've never been promoted, ever, in my professional life.\"\n\nWade's experiences of race and ADHD are intertwined. \"ADHD is an accelerant to my Black experience,\" he said. \"I can't separate my experiences as a Black boy and Black man from my experiences of understanding my neurodivergent identity.\"\n\nPeople who study and treat ADHD cite several reasons why young Black males fall under the radar, including teachers who are racially biased or have lower expectations of Black students and don't recognize an underlying disability, and Black parents who are distrustful of teachers and doctors, fearing they'll label and stigmatize their children.\n\n\"We've known for a long time that ADHD diagnoses are not made in a vacuum. They're made in a geographic context, cultural context, racial context,\" said George DuPaul , a psychology professor at Lehigh University who studies nonmedication interventions for ADHD.\n\nStudies have shown that ADHD underdiagnosis contributes to harsher school discipline and to the \" school-to-prison pipeline .\" Black kids routinely face punishment, including criminal prosecution, for problem behavior and mental health conditions such as ADHD, while white kids are more likely to be diagnosed with behavioral conditions and receive medical treatment and support. There's a common saying: \"Black kids get cops, white kids get docs.\"\n\nCourtney Zulauf-McCurdy , a researcher and clinician at the University of Washington School of Medicine, focuses on decreasing mental health disparities in early childhood. By preschool, she said, Black children with ADHD symptoms are more likely to be expelled and less likely to receive appropriate treatment than their white peers.\n\nHer research has found that teachers' judgments of children are heavily influenced by their opinions of the kids' parents, and that often determines whether those children are evaluated for behavioral conditions and given appropriate support - or simply kicked out of class. She said the Penn State findings confirm what she's seen in clinics and heard from parents.\n\nZulauf-McCurdy also pointed to research that shows Black children are 2.4 times as likely as white kids to receive a diagnosis of conduct disorder compared with a diagnosis of ADHD. She said the racial bias and overdiagnosis of conditions such as oppositional defiant disorder , defined by symptoms of being uncooperative and hostile toward authority figures, result in more punitive consequences such as being isolated in separate classrooms.\n\nTo fix inequities in ADHD diagnosis, mental health experts see a need for increasing culturally sensitive screening and addressing Black families' concerns about potential bias and racism. Ensuring access to information about symptoms and treatments for ADHD may help address obstacles to care.\n\nLooking back, Wade said, he is grateful he got diagnosed, even if it came late. But, he said, learning about his condition earlier would have given him more confidence navigating school, work, and life. \"If I was able to get a diagnosis, I would have had a lot more support and love in my life,\" he said.\n\nBehavioral tools and medication have made it easier for him to focus and to regulate his mood. The diagnosis has also helped him become more aware of how to manage his depression and anxiety.\n\n\"Now it's an understanding of how I exist, how my brain works,\" Wade said. \"I don't think that I'm just broken.\"\n\nStill, Wade wonders what the ADHD label would have meant for him as a child - despite his family's privileges of money and education - before more awareness existed about the condition. Even now, he said, the remaining stigma around the diagnosis is probably worse for Black kids, who still get less benefit of the doubt than white children.\n\nToday, Wade is helping Black and neurodivergent youth and adults identify ADHD and other conditions. It's part of his work, but it's also deeply personal.\n\n\"I remember how it felt to not be seen, to not be heard, and to have your needs dismissed,\" he said. \"It feels good to see other people getting the help that they need and know that it helps Black people as a whole and generations of those families.\"\n\nKFF Health News , formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF - the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.\n\nKFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is part of KFF,  an independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.\n\nCopyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Troubling Statistics For African-American Males In The Classroom\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nApril 10, 2014 / 8:56 PM PDT / CBS San Francisco\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) -- Young African American men are falling behind their peers in the classroom. PBS reports only 54% of African Americans graduate from high school, compared to more than 75% of their Caucasian and Asian American peers. Black male students in grades K-12 were \"nearly 2.5 times more likely to be suspended from school in 2000 as white students,\" and their twelfth-grade reading scores are currently lower than any other racial and ethnic group.\n\nBarriers in high school lead to a glass ceiling for higher education. According to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation (CBCF), black males ages 18 and older make up just 5.5% of all college students. Of the young black males who do make it to college, only one in six will receive a college degree.\n\nThe NAACP warns African American males are filling up prisons nationwide in disproportionate numbers, comprising 1 million out of the total 2.3 million incarcerated. In fact, if current trends continue, \"one in three black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during his lifetime.\" Our affiliate, CBS Philly , reported in January that a shocking 49% of African American males have been arrested before their 23 rd birthday.\n\nMany young African Americans live in deep poverty, which can cripple their chances of education and, ultimately, upward mobility. According to a 2010 Census survey , the poverty rate for black children is the highest rate of any race group-38.2% live below the US average. For them, obtaining and consistently holding a job is significantly more difficult. The State of Young America report (2011) revealed that one in three African American men age 18-24 is unemployed. Similarly, the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee reports unemployment for young black men is \"roughly twice as high as the rate for all young men.\"\n\nThe National Center for Victims of Crime gives troubling statistics about African American young males and crime, reporting \"black youth are three times more likely to be victims of reported child abuse or neglect, three times more likely to be victims of robbery, and five times more likely to be victims of homicide. In fact, homicide is the leading cause of death among African American youth ages 15 to 24.\"\n\nWhile African American young males have lower rates of licit and illicit substance use compared to white men, they are at greater risk for drug-related issues. The Drug Policy Alliance reports that African Americans are also more likely to end up incarcerated for their drug-related activity, comprising only 14% of users but 37% of those arrested. And according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse , African American drug users also \"experience higher rates of drug-related health problems than do users from other ethnic groups\" despite having lower rates of drug use overall.\n\n© 2014 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

He's got an A average, and he's ambitious -  he wants to be a psychiatrist.\n\n\"I'm looking at Berkeley and Stanford as my top schools,\" Danial said.\n\nBut here's a troubling sign of the times: achieving, black, male students like Danial are increasingly rare in America's schools.\n\n\"The overall academic achievement of African American males was appallingly low, not only in cities, but nationwide,\" said Michael Casserly, the executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools.\n\nAccording to a new study released Tuesday by the Council of the Great City Schools, by fourth grade only 12 percent of black male students read at or above grade level, while 38 percent of white males do. By eighth grade it falls to just 9 percent for black males, 33 percent for whites. Black male students are almost twice as likely as white males to drop out of school.  And in some big American cities the dropout rate is around 50 percent.\n\nIn some south L.A. neighborhoods, black males getting arrested seem more common than graduating from high school.\n\n\"Black males now make up only 5 percent of college enrollment nationally, but 36 percent of the prison population,\" Casserly said.\n\nResearchers say this isn't just a crisis affecting African Americans - this crisis affects all Americans.\n\nDropouts cost taxpayers more than $8 billion annually in public assistance programs like food stamps. It costs on average $25,000 to incarcerate an inmate for a year and only about $14,000 a year of community college.\n\n\"We ought to be concerned about the fact that so much talent, so much potential is being wasted and squandered,\" Casserly said.\n\nResearchers call these dismal numbers a call to action for scholars across the country to study this problem and come up with real solutions.\n\n\"The problem can't be quarantined,\" said Michael Eric Dyson, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's not as if the problems of black males will stay in black communities.

      "text": "Suicide attempts are rising among young Black men. Experts say they face a 'perfect storm' of hardships.\n\nWhile rates of suicide ideation and anxiety have risen sharply during the pandemic, a new study finds that suicide attempts, particularly among adolescents, have been rising at an alarming rate long before COVID-19.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the journal JAMA, found that teenagers attempting suicide increased 22% over the course of nearly three decades, but the trend varied depending on sex and race.\n\nBlack males had the highest increase in suicide attempts compared to any other race in the group, for example, increasing nearly 80%.\n\nOther females groups had this upward trend, too. More white women attempted suicide from 2009-2019, for example. Suicide ideation has also increased for white, Black, and Hispanic women.\n\nResearchers at Indiana and Purdue University surveyed 183,563 high school students from 1991 to 2019 in the US. The survey was given twice a year and asked three questions about suicide ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts.\n\nThe study authors said young Black men face financial hardship, among other stressors, and may have untreated mental health needs.\n\n\"It's an awful perfect storm of a number of factors,\" Alfiee M. Breland-Noble , Ph.D. and founder of the AAKOMA project , said about the reasons behind the upward trend.\n\nBreland-Noble pointed to the fact that young Black men are discriminated against in school and can often be perceived as older than they are.\n\nThere is also a lack of Black therapists to speak to young Black men about the hardships they face. No matter how well-meaning a non-Black psychologist is, Breland-Noble said, they can't relate to the lived experiences of a young Black man.\n\n\"They don't understand the concepts that your family has to deal with, the day-to-day stressors. They don't understand racial trauma, they don't understand racism-induced stress,\" Breland-Noble said.\n\nBreland-Noble told Insider she has been heartened to see famous men of color, like Wayne Brady and Charlamagne tha God, talking about their mental health problems, inspiring young Black men to open up.\n\n\"They're able to see people who look like them who have said 'Yeah, this is something I struggle with too.' That in a tiny way decreases the stigma in terms of the conversation,\" Breland-Noble said.\n\nBut both Breland-Noble and the authors of the JAMA study said it's not on young Black men, but on the medical community to meet them where they are.\n\n\"For males and Black youths in particular,\" the authors wrote, \"growing risks, such as adverse childhood experiences, systematic racism, discrimination , neighborhood violence, and socioeconomic disparities\" need to be addressed.\n\nBreland-Noble agreed. \"There's some really significant differences in terms of how communities approach mental health, approach suicide, and approach seeking mental health care.\"\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing depression or has had thoughts of harming themself or taking their own life, get help. In the US, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline , which provides 24/7, free, confidential support for people in distress, as well as best practices for professionals and resources to aid in prevention and crisis situations.

We will continue to work hard with all parties to raise aspirations and attainment to improve access to higher education.\"\n\nTwenty-year-old engineering student Folajimi Babasola, who appears in the Facebook photo, said he \"wants the image to challenge the 'stereotype' of a Cambridge student,\" according to the BBC .\n\n\"The aim of the picture was really to encourage more black students to apply here because many people get discouraged by a particular image or stereotype of a Cambridge student that they have in their mind, thinking that they won't fit in or be accepted,\" he said .\n\n19-year-old English student William Gore added: \"There are people here at Cambridge from different backgrounds, who don't fit the stereotypical image of what a Cambridge student looks like, doing their thing and killing it.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Portland has become the focal point of Black Lives Matter protests in America, but it has a tortured history when it comes to race\n\nFollowing George Floyd's death in May, Portland was one of many cities across the US to react with massive racial-justice protests.\n\nMore than two months later, the Portland protests rage on, even as they have diminished in size in most other places.\n\nFor many, this is unsurprising since the Oregon city is seen as a stereotypical coastal liberal enclave.\n\nBut in reality, Portland has been called the \"whitest city in America,\" and the state of Oregon has a troubled history of excluding Black people.\n\nDuring the pioneer era in the 19th century, Oregon was seen as a beacon of hope for many Americans hoping to go west and create a better life. But that vision did not include Black Americans.\n\nIn Oregon's early history, lawmakers passed a series of so-called \"exclusion laws\" to keep Black people out of the territory, which later became the state.\n\nThe first of these laws was passed in 1844 by the provisional government, setting a deadline of two years for Black males and three years for Black females to leave the territory, or else face a public lashing, according to the Oregon Historical Society (OHS) .\n\nThe Territorial Legislature passed the second exclusion law in 1849, which forbade Black people from entering or residing in Oregon, with the exception of those already in the region.\n\nThe aim of the law, according to OHS, was to discourage Black seamen from jumping ship, out of fear that they would \"intermix with Indians, instilling into their minds feelings of hostility toward the white race.\"\n\nThe final exclusion law was passed in 1857, as Oregon was becoming a state and had its constitutional convention. During the convention, lawmakers decided on whether to be a slave state or not, and while they decided to prohibit slavery, they also passed a law that barred Black people from coming to the state, owning property, or making contracts.\n\nOregon's exclusion laws were all eventually overturned by amendments to the US Constitution, and were rarely enforced in their lifetime, but \"they had their intended effect of discouraging Black settlers,\" OHS says on its website.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan thrived in Oregon, where it had about 35,000 members - the biggest contingent west of the Mississippi River, according to the local Willamette Week .\n\nThe Klan openly marched through Oregon streets and held rallies in Portland.\n\nThe white-supremacist group was so influential that it even helped Democrat Walter M. Pierce win the governorship in 1923, according to Willamette Week.\n\nAfter it supported Pierce in the race, he backed its bill to require all children to attend public schools, a move intended to stop Catholic education in the state. The Supreme Court ruled that bill illegal three years later.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "A Portland hotel fired 2 employees after they called the police on a black guest\n\nA hotel in Portland, Oregon, announced Saturday it fired two employees over mistreating a black guest, whom they asked to leave last week before calling the police.\n\nJermaine Massey, 34, said he was talking to his mother on his phone in lobby of the DoubleTree by Hilton hotel last Saturday when a security guard approached him to ask if he was a guest, and what his room number was.\n\nMassey said that even though he showed the guard his hotel key, the guard told him to leave and a manager called the police and accused Massey of loitering.\n\nIn an Instagram post, Massey said he believed he was targeted by the hotel staff due to his race.\n\n\"It is never ok to discriminate against guests for the color of their skin and to prejudge them based on your own bias against that race,\" Massey wrote.\n\nRead more : A hotel in Portland called the police on a black guest who was taking a phone call in the lobby\n\nTonight I was racially profiled and discriminated against for taking a phone call in the lobby of my hotel room at the @doubletreepdx @doubletree. The security guard \"Earl\" decided that he would call the police on me, the exact reason is still unclear to me. He said that I was a safety threat to the other guests and that I was trespassing and said that I was a disturbance because I took a personal phone call from my mom in a more remote area of the lobby. The manager who actually called the cops, \"Luis\" actually asked me AFTER he called the cops, what happened? They already had in their minds that they didn't want me there so I waited for the cops to show up and when they did, I explained my side of the story and they didn't want to hear it. They asked me if I had personal items in my room (which of course I did) and asked me to go retrieve them. They told me that since the hotel requested me to leave, that if I didn't I would be considered a trespasser and would be thrown in jail. I complied and cooperated and was not issued a refund for my room. I packed my stuff and went to another hotel. I cannot believe the level of professionalism that this hotel property had with me tonight. It is never ok to discriminate against guests for the color of their skin and to prejudge them based on your own bias against that race. Earl is a disgrace, calls himself a man but calls the Portland Police Dept on a man who was minding his own business in the lobby of his hotel. I had my hotel key in my hand the entire conversation, he knew I was a guest. He wanted to prove a point and did it in the worst way. Not really shocked that this happened but just extremely disappointed. I will be seeking justice. Believe that. @doubletree @doubletreepdx @hiltonhonors #hilton #hiltonhotels #racism #racisminamerica #racismisreal @shaunking\n\nA post shared by  m a i n e (@mymainereason) on Dec 23, 2018 at 2:04am PST Dec 23, 2018 at 2:04am PST\n\nThe hotel included an apology to Massey in its tweet on Saturday.\n\n\"DoubleTree by Hilton has zero tolerance for racism,\" the hotel tweeted, adding that it had \"terminated 2 employees involved in the mistreatment of Mr. Massey and is working with Diversity & Inclusion experts. Hilton deeply apologizes to Mr. Massey.\"\n\nMassey spoke out about the incident on CNN on Friday, saying he felt hurt and humiliated by the situation.\n\n\"I'm a person, at the end of the day, just like everyone else. And I deserve respect and fair treatment, and I did not receive that on Saturday,\" Massey said. \"I think that there's a lot of perceptions about black males, in particular. That we're threats, and we're harmful, and we're just fearful individuals. And that bias impacts these situations and it's harmful to us as a people.\"\n\nThe police call at the DoubleTree is just the latest in a series of instances where white people have called the police on black people for seemingly innocuous behavior, prompting viral outrage and raising concerns of racial bias.\n\nIn October, a white woman in Brooklyn called the police on a black child she wrongly accused of sexual assault, later admitting she had been mistaken. In April, two young black men were forcibly removed from a Starbucks in Philadelphia by police as they sat in the café waiting for a business meeting.\n\nIn May, a graduate student at Yale University was questioned by police after a fellow student reported her for sleeping in the common area of their dormitory. In June, one black firefighter in uniform was reported to police as he conducted a city-mandated inspection on homes in a neighborhood in Oakland, California.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Striking maps show how race keeps kids from climbing the economic ladder across the US\n\nA new mapping tool from Harvard-based policy group Opportunity Insights reveals just how difficult it can be to overcome race-based economic barriers in the US.\n\nWhile a person's neighborhood can have a significant impact on future earnings, the effects of race seem to run deeper than any town, city, or state line.\n\nIn coordination with the US Census, the researchers compiled a detailed record of economic opportunity across individual neighborhoods. The data traces the average household income of 20 million Americans who were born between 1978 and 1983 and grew up in a given Census tract.\n\nThe results can be sorted according to race, gender, and parental income, giving a highly nuanced depiction of where - and under what conditions - the American Dream is made possible.\n\nThe researchers discovered, for instance, that poor children who grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina earn an average of just $26,000 as adults in their thirties. And in Miami, Florida, areas that have more two-parent households tend to have higher rates of upward mobility.\n\nBut when we look at children across all income levels and neighborhoods in America, we find a more sweeping picture of how race restricts economic opportunity. Take a look at the maps below.\n\nThe above map shows the mobility levels for children who grew up in different income brackets. The scale ranges from red to blue, with blue representing mobility levels that are higher than the national average and red indicating mobility levels that are lower than the national average.\n\nHere we see that economic mobility is lowest in the South - particularly in states like Georgia and Mississippi. By contrast, North Dakota has some of the highest levels of economic mobility, along with other Great Plains neighborhoods.\n\nThese results change drastically when we filter for black Americans who grew up with varying income levels. The map becomes a sea of dark red, with only a few blips of orange, yellow, and blue. The few exceptions are neighborhoods in Utah, Washington, Iowa, and the Dakotas, though each of these states displays its fair share of red.\n\nThis means that black Americans saw lower levels of economic mobility across many neighborhoods in the US, regardless of whether they grew up poor, wealthy, or middle-income. Even when we filtered for income level, there was little variation in the map's colors. The researchers determine that these lower levels of mobility apply predominantly to black men.\n\nThe map for white Americans who grew up with varying income levels is almost the exact opposite: It's covered in shades of blue, with sparse patches of yellow and orange (levels of economic mobility that are close to the nationwide average).\n\nFor the most part, neighborhoods where white Americans grew up to have particularly low levels of economic mobility are located in Kentucky. By contrast, New England and the Great Plains saw the darkest shades of blue, along with select areas of Texas and California.\n\nThis data changes when we filter for childhood income levels. When we look at white Americans who grew up poor, the map becomes mostly red. But when we consider white Americans who grew up wealthy, it transforms into a giant stretch of deep blue.\n\nThe map for Hispanic Americans is mostly orange, with a large swath of red along the South. While Hispanic children from high-income neighborhoods seem to have a better chance at moving up the economic ladder than black children, for the most part their mobility levels are commensurate with their socioeconomic status growing up.\n\nAsian Americans, on the other hand, have consistently high levels of economic mobility. Even Asian children from low-income families often out-earn their white counterparts.\n\nAlthough this map is not quite as robust as the map for white Americans, it, too, is covered in shades of blue. Neighborhoods where Asian Americans saw the most economic mobility are located in the Rust Belt, a region in economic decline.\n\nNo group was more disadvantaged compared to the national average than American Indian children. Almost the entire map is covered in red, and there are even fewer patches of yellow, orange, and blue compared to map for black Americans.\n\nThat said, American Indians had a slightly better chance of improving their economic condition if they were raised in a high-income household.\n\nThis suggests that, of all the children represented in the project, black males face the most persistent obstacles to climbing the economic ladder.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Some blacks see a racial double standard in Kavanaugh case\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Marcus Dixon was sentenced to 10 years behind bars in Georgia for having sex with an underage white girl when he was 18. Dayonn Davis, another black youth, got a five-year prison sentence for stealing a $100 pair of shoes at gunpoint when he was 15.\n\nIt's cases like those that minorities and others point to with frustration when they hear some of Brett Kavanaugh's defenders say the sexual assault and underage-drinking accusations against the Supreme Court nominee fall under the category of \"Boys will be boys.\"\n\nSome see a racial double standard at work, complaining that when young blacks get into trouble, their actions rarely are viewed as youthful folly in the way that the misdeeds of privileged whites are.\n\n\"I think there is a very distinct difference between the benefit of the doubt that is extended to black males and to white males,\" said Jarvis DeBerry, columnist and deputy opinion editor of NOLA.com/Times Picayune.\n\nStudies show young blacks are often perceived as older and less innocent than whites their age, a phenomenon some say translates all too often into African-American youths being demonized as \"thugs,\" arrested, incarcerated and sometimes killed.\n\nKavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, says a drunken Kavanaugh held her down, tried to take off her clothes and covered her mouth to muffle her screams when they were high school students in the 1980s. Kavanaugh has forcefully denied doing any such thing to anyone, and many supporters say they believe him.\n\nOthers have suggested that if it did happen, he might deserve a pass.\n\n\"Let's say he did this exactly as she said. Should the fact that a 17-year-old, presumably very drunk kid did this, should this be disqualifying? That's the question at the end of the day, isn't it?\" Bari Weiss, a New York Times opinion editor, said on MSNBC.\n\nMinnesota state Sen. Scott Newman tweeted: \"Even if true, teenagers!\"\n\nSome black commentators and others have recoiled at that line of argument, pointing to the killings of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was shot by a white Cleveland police officer in 2014 while carrying what turned out to be a pellet gun; Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old whose shooting by police that same year touched off violence in Ferguson, Missouri; and 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was gunned down in 2012 by a neighborhood watch volunteer while carrying iced tea and a bag of Skittles.\n\n\"The right wants Brett Kavanaugh to get another chance because, hey, he was just a teenager, but they also believe teenagers like Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown got what they deserved,\" author and critic Toure tweeted.\n\nOpel Jones, a black Democrat running for the Howard County Council in Maryland, said that in the case of Martin, \"you have the issue of the perception that this young man, he's an adult, he's bigger, he's stronger, he's such a savage, a beast, all the things that young black men especially get.\"\n\n\"Wherein the public, some are excusing Brett Kavanaugh as 'Oh, he's young, he's white, he was just having fun,'\" Jones said. \"I don't want to use the term racist, but they kind of are.\"\n\nDixon was accused by a 15-year-old classmate of raping her in 2003. Dixon's attorneys argued that the sex was consensual and that the underage girl fabricated the rape story to avoid getting in trouble with her father. A jury acquitted him of rape but found him guilty of statutory rape and aggravated child molestation.\n\nDixon spent 15 months behind bars in Georgia before his 10-year sentence was thrown out.\n\nAs for Davis, the teenager sentenced in June for stealing a pair of Nikes in Georgia while an accomplice pulled a gun, he was prosecuted as an adult, even though his lawyer said he had no prior record.\n\nBlack boys as young as 10 are more likely to be mistaken as older, be perceived as guilty and face police violence if accused of a crime, according to an American Psychological Association report in 2014.\n\nAdults likewise think that black girls are less innocent, are less in need of protection and nurturing, and seem older than white girls, according to a 2017 report from the Center on Poverty and Inequality at the Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nEileen M. Ahlen, assistant professor of criminal justice at Penn State University at Harrisburg, said it is not just young people who are treated differently.\n\nAhlen said research shows that there is disparate treatment at all stages of the justice system - who's stopped, who's arrested, who gets bail, who gets prosecuted, severity of sentence, who gets parole - with whites able to exit the criminal justice system earlier and with less impact than minorities.\n\nEven when accounting for similar crimes, \"generally, all else being equal, a person of color is going to receive a harsher sentence,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Deepti Hajela in New York contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nJesse J.

That's of great concern for me.\"\n\nCarville then remarked further about what he saw as the lack of male engagement with the Democratic Party.\n\n\"I think President Biden could win the election, but in terms of identifying with the party as you go forward ... the male detachment in the United States is a significant problem, particularly among non-white males,\" he added.\n\nCarville's comments came after The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd recently spoke with him for a wide-ranging interview in which he said that \"preachy females\" were alienating blocs of men from the party.\n\n\"If you listen to Democratic elites - NPR is my go-to place for that - the whole talk is about how women, and women of color, are going to decide this election,\" he told Dowd . \"I'm like: 'Well, 48% of the people that vote are males.

Being black males we just wanted to assist. Diversity is something we're both passionate about. It was just us raising our hand wanting to help out,\" Braswell told Business Insider.\n\n(He feels so strongly about paying it back that the Yale grad once wrote a book called Yes, You Can: The Secrets Revealed for How to Get into and Succeed at America's Top Universities and Colleges .)\n\nSoon, they wanted to do more than just help at their own company. They wanted to really solve diversity for all companies.\n\nTheir idea: to build a job-hunting site dedicated to matching people from minority backgrounds (namely Black, Latino/Hispanic and Native American) with great jobs and internships, particularly in tech.\n\nNeither of them were programmers, but that didn't stop them. They quit their jobs at their prestigious company in 2014 and bootstrapped until they had enough of the site together to get into the startup accelerator Ycombinator.\n\nAnd things took off from there. People loved their idea.\n\n\"We have 57 investors, between angel rounds and seed rounds. There's a lot of interest in what we're doing,\" says Williams.\n\nBackers include the San Francisco 49ers, Joe Montana and Magic Johnson, says Braswell. (Montana and Johnson are both doing more angel investing these days).\n\nAll told, Jopwell has raised $4.25 million between angel and seed money, they say. That includes investment from Andreessen Horowitz, Kapor Capital, Omidyar Network, others.\n\nJopwell officially launched in January, 2015. Fast forward to today and the co-founders say they have more than 50 companies using their tech to find candidates. Companies using the site include Microsoft, Airbnb, Pinterest, Facebook, LinkedIn and Spotify.\n\nPlus other companies have joined it too, like Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, KPMG and The New York Times.\n\nIt has also attracted \"tens of thousands\" of job candidates, Braswell says, and all told has helped these people make 15,000 connections with possible employers through the site, it says.\n\nLaura Lopez, a first-generation Mexican American, used Jopwell when it first launched to help her change careers.\n\nShe had spent her college career focusing on public service, including an internship as a diplomat with the US State Department.\n\nBut she had decided public service wasn't right for her and didn't know how to change course. She heard about Jopwell through her college, applied and landed a fellowship at Venture for America. That led her to her current job doing communications at VentureLab.\n\nShe liked working through Jopwell because the companies on it are making an effort to be more inclusive.\n\n\"I wanted to make sure I was working for a company that has considered that,\" she told Business Insider. Plus, it helped her find an opportunity she wouldn't have found on her own. \"It put a company and a career path on my radar.\"\n\nAdds Braswell: \"We hope this has ripple effects of long lasting economic value. We have a strong mission of changing the dynamics of employment. In some sense, this is giving back. We were part of diversity internship programs and we want to continue that tradition and expose more people.\"\n\nJump to"

Photography : @nateshuls @kusumadjaja Casting: @aamo_casting\n\nA post shared by  Bstroy (@bstroy.us) on Sep 15, 2019 at 10:58am PDT Sep 15, 2019 at 10:58am PDT\n\nDuey Catorze, who also cofounded Bstroy, shared a screenshot of his response to an Instagram user's criticism on his story.\n\n\"Super whack,\" one person wrote to Catorze. \"Is it supposed to be cool to wear the location of a school shooting on your distressed hoodie?\"\n\n\"*Art,\" Catorze wrote in response to the user.\n\nCatorze also shared a second screenshot on his Instagram story that purports to show an argument with another user over the intentions behind Bstroy's hoodies.\n\n\"Despite your attempt to minimize me into whatever assumptions you've made, knowing nothing about me or the intentions of my art, I still love you as a human and wish the best for you,\" Catorze wrote.\n\nCatorze later shared a screenshot of a private message he purportedly received from an Instagram user who claimed they were present for one of the school shootings referenced in Bstroy's fashion show.\n\n\"Block out the noise. I was there during the shooting and I support your message,\" an Instagram user appeared to write to Catorze in the private message.\n\nSpeaking to Insider, Catorze said Bstroy \"wanted to make reference to the victims with reverence,\" while also telling a story \"that depicts them as heroes.\"\n\n\"At Bstroy, we have always used our platform to shed light and begin conversations on overlooked issues from reality,\" Catorze said. \"Our premiere show was in Atlanta's subway to highlight the purposeful under management of the public transportation system to contain the poor there. Channel 2 news covered it and there's been notable change.\"\n\n\"We wanted to make a comment on gun violence and the type of gun violence that needs preventative attention and what its origins are, while also empowering the survivors of tragedy through storytelling in the clothes,\" he continued, adding that he believes the brand's clothing has been overlooked by people who \"want to release hateful energy.\"\n\nAccording to Catorze, Bstroy makes everything \"from scratch independently,\" and said the brand \"takes process and quality very seriously.\"\n\nCatorze said he believes his and Owens' \"image as young black males\" also plays a part in how their work has been received.\n\n\"Our image as young black males has not been traditionally awarded credit for introducing avant-garde ideas,\" Catorze said. \"So many people have assumed our message to be lazy just because of what they've been taught about black men.\"\n\n\"These hoodies were made with all of these intentions in mind - to explore all of these societal issues,\" he continued. \"Not just the surface layer of gun violence in schools, but also the different ways that we relate to each other and the dated ideas that still shape the assumptions we make about each other.\"\n\nWhile Catorze says Bstroy never intended to sell the hoodies, it may do so now. \"The hoodies have only been shown, not sold, and the school-shooting hoodies were initially intended to be just for the show and not to sell,\" Catorze said. \"But that may change now.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Brick Owens did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nUPDATE: September 17, 2019: This story has been updated to reflect comment Catorze provided to Insider following publication.\n\nFollow INSIDER on Facebook .\n\nJump to"

At top center is Jesse Williams, the project's executive producer. Question Bridge: Black Males hide caption\n\n\"Question Bridge: Black Males\" attempts to represent black male identity in America via a video question-and-answer exchange. At top center is Jesse Williams, the project's executive producer.\n\nHow would you like to be remembered, in a word or two? That question was posed by a black man and answered by other black men in a multimedia art project called \"Question Bridge: Black Males.\"\n\nSome of the answers to that query included \"warrior,\" \"sincere,\" \"motivated,\" \"dedicated,\" \"family-oriented\" and \"father.\"\n\nA group of black artists created \"Question Bridge\" and they're getting an Infinity Award this coming week from the International Center of Photography, recognizing their achievement in new media. Executive producer Jesse Williams, an actor best known for playing Dr. Jackson Avery on Grey's Anatomy, says the project is an attempt to take back the narrative of \"this country's most opaque and feared demographic,\" and to expand society's idea of who African-American men are and what they can do.\n\n\"Can he be the doctor, can he be the lead? Can he not be the jivey best friend who talks about how black people don't know how to swim?\" Williams says. \"Can we just be ... people?\"\n\nThe \"Question Bridge\" artists went to nine different cities across the country. They talked with all kinds of people - dads, businessmen, incarcerated men, gay men - and filmed them asking and answering each others' questions.\n\n\"Question Bridge: Black Males\" traveled to museums across the country, but is now a website and mobile app where black men can upload their own videos. Missouri History Museum and Cary Horton hide caption\n\n\"Question Bridge: Black Males\" traveled to museums across the country, but is now a website and mobile app where black men can upload their own videos.\n\n\"We just cast as wide a net as possible to try and find diversity in how they looked, diversity in perspective, class, education, age,\" says Bayeté Ross Smith, a Harlem-based artist and one of the \"Question Bridge\" creators. \"Our youngest participant was 8 and our oldest was 80.\"\n\nThey used those videos to curate virtual conversations that traveled to art museums across the country. But to move beyond the museum-going crowd, they've also established a website and mobile app where black men can upload their own videos.\n\nThe artists let their subjects ask whatever comes to mind. So, if you visit questionbridge.com you might drop in on a virtual conversation sparked by young men curious to know when you've met the woman you should marry or those eager to find out why the civil rights generation didn't leave a blueprint for their generation to follow. Some questions are profound, some not - at least on the surface.\n\n\"I want to know if I'm the only one who has problems eating chicken, watermelon and bananas in front of white people,\" says one of the men on the site. (There are no names or titles on the videos).\n\nSmith says the man posing the question is a filmmaker. \"He was talking about being on set and how it was hot and in the summer and they brought out some watermelon, and he was like, 'Oooo, watermelon!' \" Smith says. \"Then he realized he was the only black person there and he felt like he needed to wait and let some white people get the watermelon first. He didn't want to just run over there.\"\n\nSmith says what he loved about that question were the thoughtful responses that followed the initial laughter from most of the men. Racist imagery connected to fried chicken, watermelon and bananas ended up being a real concern for some. Others said they ate those foods with pride. A businessman whose family has sold watermelon since 1953 said he had no problem eating watermelon and concluded by saying, \"I like fried chicken - in fact, I'm going to make some tonight.\"\n\nSmith and Williams say there's always been an appetite among black men for a media space where they can speak for themselves. Because the police-involved deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Walter Scott and now Freddie Gray have put the public spotlight on society's perceptions of black men, there's more demand than ever for \"Question Bridge: Black Males.\"\n\nWilliams says they eventually want to expand the project to other demographics - but not just yet: \"Let's just let them have their thing for a second; let's have this dinner table conversation, let's have this private exploration into identity and all the different things that demonstrate that the black male in this country is not a monolithic group.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Black Male Privilege?\n\nA new look at the cross section of race and empowerment as it relates to black men has spelled out a new theory that one sociologist dubs \"black male privilege.\"  Host Michel Martin speaks with L'Heureux Lewis, assistant professor of sociology at the City University of New York, for more on why he thinks black male privilege exists.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, host: Im Michel Martin, and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Coming up, a look at the most powerful woman in television, and how she also helped revolutionize the film industry, Oprah Winfrey. Its part of our Divas on Screen series about black women in film. The Oscars are this weekend. Thats coming up. But first, we want to talk about black men for a moment because on just about any day, there is some tragic story about black men in the news on the Internet or bandied about at the water cooler. And often those stories are about how black men are mistreated by police or underserved by educators or about how they are falling short in some way. But sociologist LHeureux Lewis, who is himself a black man, has been thinking about and documenting a fresh take on the question of black men and race and power, as a theory that he calls black male privilege. And if that raises your eyebrows, you are not alone. So, we called him to find out more. Hes - LHeureux Lewis is an assistant professor of sociology at the City University of New York, and he joins us now. Welcome, thank you for joining us. Professor LHEUREUX LEWIS (Sociology, City University of New York): Thank you for having me on. MARTIN: So, define black male privilege. Im sure thats a phrase on its face that will get people to sit up and take notice. Prof. LEWIS: My working definition is really a system of built-in and often overlooked systematic advantages that center the experience and the concerns of black males while minimizing the power that black males hold, which is a fancy way of saying, we are absolutely used to talking about African-American men in crisis. And we can talk about this crisis so much that we miss the ways in which black men are oppressed and can also serve as oppressors. MARTIN: And when you say privileged, I think generally people think of privilege in relation to whom. So, when you think of privilege, are you speaking relative to someone? Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. Black male privilege is first centered as being relative to black women. Im not comparing black males privilege to white male privilege. I think one could argue that, but itd be a very dangerous leap. When we look in the African-American community, there are actually spaces where black men are advantaged and often sometimes dominate a dialogue, when we should be listening more carefully to whats happening with black women equally. MARTIN: Give an example. Prof. LEWIS: In particular, if we think about the narrative of mass incarceration, we think about the ways in which black men and black boys have been locked up at increasing rates since the 1980s. While this is true, the fastest growing incarceration rate is particularly among black and Latino women. And because we havent thought seriously about whats happening with black girls and Latino girls, we tend to make the issue of incarceration solely male, and we miss the different ways in which we need to be intervening not just for our young boys, but also our young girls. MARTIN: Well, give another example then, because I think people would say focusing on those who are even worse off than you doesnt mean youre well off. Prof. LEWIS: Well, the first time I really came to think about black male privilege was when I was a freshman at Morehouse College. And at that point, there was actually an incident of sexual assault between a Morehouse student and a Spelman student. And what I found quickly were that black men were -instead of actually talking seriously about issues of sexual assault, which are very common in our community, it became a discussion about the ways in which black men become vilified. So, what happens is we often look at issues like domestic violence or sexual assault, and instead of actually dealing with those who are survivors or the victims of it, predominantly African-American women, we re-center it on black men. MARTIN: Whats driving this, in your view? Is it their idea that group solidarity is so important in the African-American community, somehow the community has made a decision that when theres an issue involving black men and black women that black men are to be favored? Prof. LEWIS: I think youve unfortunately identified one of the central issues of black male privilege. So often, black men are used to being under attacked that when it comes to being accountable for the actions we may have, we quickly say, well, I couldnt possibly be doing anything wrong. Look at all the ways in which Im oppressed. Look at all the ways in which Im at the bottom of the barrel. What that does is rob us of an opportunity to actually build stronger community and it robs black men of a chance to actually take hold of the actions that they have so that we can empower the community. MARTIN: What reaction do you get when you talk to people about this? Prof. LEWIS: Among black women, in particular, I get a lot of amens and saying, thank for actually exposing this. Among black men, one of the most common ones I get is, well, this seems ridiculous. Its an oxymoron. How could black men be privileged? Its like jumbo shrimp. It doesnt add up. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. LEWIS: And they say, you know, what did my black male privilege get me? Im unemployed. What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have. And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get.

When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get.

Coming up, a look at the most powerful woman in television, and how she also helped revolutionize the film industry, Oprah Winfrey. Its part of our Divas on Screen series about black women in film. The Oscars are this weekend. Thats coming up. But first, we want to talk about black men for a moment because on just about any day, there is some tragic story about black men in the news on the Internet or bandied about at the water cooler. And often those stories are about how black men are mistreated by police or underserved by educators or about how they are falling short in some way. But sociologist LHeureux Lewis, who is himself a black man, has been thinking about and documenting a fresh take on the question of black men and race and power, as a theory that he calls black male privilege. And if that raises your eyebrows, you are not alone. So, we called him to find out more. Hes - LHeureux Lewis is an assistant professor of sociology at the City University of New York, and he joins us now. Welcome, thank you for joining us. Professor LHEUREUX LEWIS (Sociology, City University of New York): Thank you for having me on. MARTIN: So, define black male privilege. Im sure thats a phrase on its face that will get people to sit up and take notice. Prof. LEWIS: My working definition is really a system of built-in and often overlooked systematic advantages that center the experience and the concerns of black males while minimizing the power that black males hold, which is a fancy way of saying, we are absolutely used to talking about African-American men in crisis. And we can talk about this crisis so much that we miss the ways in which black men are oppressed and can also serve as oppressors. MARTIN: And when you say privileged, I think generally people think of privilege in relation to whom. So, when you think of privilege, are you speaking relative to someone? Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. Black male privilege is first centered as being relative to black women. Im not comparing black males privilege to white male privilege. I think one could argue that, but itd be a very dangerous leap. When we look in the African-American community, there are actually spaces where black men are advantaged and often sometimes dominate a dialogue, when we should be listening more carefully to whats happening with black women equally. MARTIN: Give an example. Prof. LEWIS: In particular, if we think about the narrative of mass incarceration, we think about the ways in which black men and black boys have been locked up at increasing rates since the 1980s. While this is true, the fastest growing incarceration rate is particularly among black and Latino women. And because we havent thought seriously about whats happening with black girls and Latino girls, we tend to make the issue of incarceration solely male, and we miss the different ways in which we need to be intervening not just for our young boys, but also our young girls. MARTIN: Well, give another example then, because I think people would say focusing on those who are even worse off than you doesnt mean youre well off. Prof. LEWIS: Well, the first time I really came to think about black male privilege was when I was a freshman at Morehouse College. And at that point, there was actually an incident of sexual assault between a Morehouse student and a Spelman student. And what I found quickly were that black men were -instead of actually talking seriously about issues of sexual assault, which are very common in our community, it became a discussion about the ways in which black men become vilified. So, what happens is we often look at issues like domestic violence or sexual assault, and instead of actually dealing with those who are survivors or the victims of it, predominantly African-American women, we re-center it on black men. MARTIN: Whats driving this, in your view? Is it their idea that group solidarity is so important in the African-American community, somehow the community has made a decision that when theres an issue involving black men and black women that black men are to be favored? Prof. LEWIS: I think youve unfortunately identified one of the central issues of black male privilege. So often, black men are used to being under attacked that when it comes to being accountable for the actions we may have, we quickly say, well, I couldnt possibly be doing anything wrong. Look at all the ways in which Im oppressed. Look at all the ways in which Im at the bottom of the barrel. What that does is rob us of an opportunity to actually build stronger community and it robs black men of a chance to actually take hold of the actions that they have so that we can empower the community. MARTIN: What reaction do you get when you talk to people about this? Prof. LEWIS: Among black women, in particular, I get a lot of amens and saying, thank for actually exposing this. Among black men, one of the most common ones I get is, well, this seems ridiculous. Its an oxymoron. How could black men be privileged? Its like jumbo shrimp. It doesnt add up. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. LEWIS: And they say, you know, what did my black male privilege get me? Im unemployed. What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have. And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community.

Prof. LEWIS: I think youve unfortunately identified one of the central issues of black male privilege. So often, black men are used to being under attacked that when it comes to being accountable for the actions we may have, we quickly say, well, I couldnt possibly be doing anything wrong. Look at all the ways in which Im oppressed. Look at all the ways in which Im at the bottom of the barrel. What that does is rob us of an opportunity to actually build stronger community and it robs black men of a chance to actually take hold of the actions that they have so that we can empower the community. MARTIN: What reaction do you get when you talk to people about this? Prof. LEWIS: Among black women, in particular, I get a lot of amens and saying, thank for actually exposing this. Among black men, one of the most common ones I get is, well, this seems ridiculous. Its an oxymoron. How could black men be privileged? Its like jumbo shrimp. It doesnt add up. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. LEWIS: And they say, you know, what did my black male privilege get me? Im unemployed. What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have. And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get.

Its part of our Divas on Screen series about black women in film. The Oscars are this weekend. Thats coming up. But first, we want to talk about black men for a moment because on just about any day, there is some tragic story about black men in the news on the Internet or bandied about at the water cooler. And often those stories are about how black men are mistreated by police or underserved by educators or about how they are falling short in some way. But sociologist LHeureux Lewis, who is himself a black man, has been thinking about and documenting a fresh take on the question of black men and race and power, as a theory that he calls black male privilege. And if that raises your eyebrows, you are not alone. So, we called him to find out more. Hes - LHeureux Lewis is an assistant professor of sociology at the City University of New York, and he joins us now. Welcome, thank you for joining us. Professor LHEUREUX LEWIS (Sociology, City University of New York): Thank you for having me on. MARTIN: So, define black male privilege. Im sure thats a phrase on its face that will get people to sit up and take notice. Prof. LEWIS: My working definition is really a system of built-in and often overlooked systematic advantages that center the experience and the concerns of black males while minimizing the power that black males hold, which is a fancy way of saying, we are absolutely used to talking about African-American men in crisis. And we can talk about this crisis so much that we miss the ways in which black men are oppressed and can also serve as oppressors. MARTIN: And when you say privileged, I think generally people think of privilege in relation to whom. So, when you think of privilege, are you speaking relative to someone? Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. Black male privilege is first centered as being relative to black women. Im not comparing black males privilege to white male privilege. I think one could argue that, but itd be a very dangerous leap. When we look in the African-American community, there are actually spaces where black men are advantaged and often sometimes dominate a dialogue, when we should be listening more carefully to whats happening with black women equally. MARTIN: Give an example. Prof. LEWIS: In particular, if we think about the narrative of mass incarceration, we think about the ways in which black men and black boys have been locked up at increasing rates since the 1980s. While this is true, the fastest growing incarceration rate is particularly among black and Latino women. And because we havent thought seriously about whats happening with black girls and Latino girls, we tend to make the issue of incarceration solely male, and we miss the different ways in which we need to be intervening not just for our young boys, but also our young girls. MARTIN: Well, give another example then, because I think people would say focusing on those who are even worse off than you doesnt mean youre well off. Prof. LEWIS: Well, the first time I really came to think about black male privilege was when I was a freshman at Morehouse College. And at that point, there was actually an incident of sexual assault between a Morehouse student and a Spelman student. And what I found quickly were that black men were -instead of actually talking seriously about issues of sexual assault, which are very common in our community, it became a discussion about the ways in which black men become vilified. So, what happens is we often look at issues like domestic violence or sexual assault, and instead of actually dealing with those who are survivors or the victims of it, predominantly African-American women, we re-center it on black men. MARTIN: Whats driving this, in your view? Is it their idea that group solidarity is so important in the African-American community, somehow the community has made a decision that when theres an issue involving black men and black women that black men are to be favored? Prof. LEWIS: I think youve unfortunately identified one of the central issues of black male privilege. So often, black men are used to being under attacked that when it comes to being accountable for the actions we may have, we quickly say, well, I couldnt possibly be doing anything wrong. Look at all the ways in which Im oppressed. Look at all the ways in which Im at the bottom of the barrel. What that does is rob us of an opportunity to actually build stronger community and it robs black men of a chance to actually take hold of the actions that they have so that we can empower the community. MARTIN: What reaction do you get when you talk to people about this? Prof. LEWIS: Among black women, in particular, I get a lot of amens and saying, thank for actually exposing this. Among black men, one of the most common ones I get is, well, this seems ridiculous. Its an oxymoron. How could black men be privileged? Its like jumbo shrimp. It doesnt add up. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. LEWIS: And they say, you know, what did my black male privilege get me? Im unemployed. What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have. And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center.

Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what?

Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates.

Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community?

But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get. Prof. LEWIS: Thank you for having me on. Copyright © 2010 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

And often those stories are about how black men are mistreated by police or underserved by educators or about how they are falling short in some way. But sociologist LHeureux Lewis, who is himself a black man, has been thinking about and documenting a fresh take on the question of black men and race and power, as a theory that he calls black male privilege. And if that raises your eyebrows, you are not alone. So, we called him to find out more. Hes - LHeureux Lewis is an assistant professor of sociology at the City University of New York, and he joins us now. Welcome, thank you for joining us. Professor LHEUREUX LEWIS (Sociology, City University of New York): Thank you for having me on. MARTIN: So, define black male privilege. Im sure thats a phrase on its face that will get people to sit up and take notice. Prof. LEWIS: My working definition is really a system of built-in and often overlooked systematic advantages that center the experience and the concerns of black males while minimizing the power that black males hold, which is a fancy way of saying, we are absolutely used to talking about African-American men in crisis. And we can talk about this crisis so much that we miss the ways in which black men are oppressed and can also serve as oppressors. MARTIN: And when you say privileged, I think generally people think of privilege in relation to whom. So, when you think of privilege, are you speaking relative to someone? Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. Black male privilege is first centered as being relative to black women. Im not comparing black males privilege to white male privilege. I think one could argue that, but itd be a very dangerous leap. When we look in the African-American community, there are actually spaces where black men are advantaged and often sometimes dominate a dialogue, when we should be listening more carefully to whats happening with black women equally. MARTIN: Give an example. Prof. LEWIS: In particular, if we think about the narrative of mass incarceration, we think about the ways in which black men and black boys have been locked up at increasing rates since the 1980s. While this is true, the fastest growing incarceration rate is particularly among black and Latino women. And because we havent thought seriously about whats happening with black girls and Latino girls, we tend to make the issue of incarceration solely male, and we miss the different ways in which we need to be intervening not just for our young boys, but also our young girls. MARTIN: Well, give another example then, because I think people would say focusing on those who are even worse off than you doesnt mean youre well off. Prof. LEWIS: Well, the first time I really came to think about black male privilege was when I was a freshman at Morehouse College. And at that point, there was actually an incident of sexual assault between a Morehouse student and a Spelman student. And what I found quickly were that black men were -instead of actually talking seriously about issues of sexual assault, which are very common in our community, it became a discussion about the ways in which black men become vilified. So, what happens is we often look at issues like domestic violence or sexual assault, and instead of actually dealing with those who are survivors or the victims of it, predominantly African-American women, we re-center it on black men. MARTIN: Whats driving this, in your view? Is it their idea that group solidarity is so important in the African-American community, somehow the community has made a decision that when theres an issue involving black men and black women that black men are to be favored? Prof. LEWIS: I think youve unfortunately identified one of the central issues of black male privilege. So often, black men are used to being under attacked that when it comes to being accountable for the actions we may have, we quickly say, well, I couldnt possibly be doing anything wrong. Look at all the ways in which Im oppressed. Look at all the ways in which Im at the bottom of the barrel. What that does is rob us of an opportunity to actually build stronger community and it robs black men of a chance to actually take hold of the actions that they have so that we can empower the community. MARTIN: What reaction do you get when you talk to people about this? Prof. LEWIS: Among black women, in particular, I get a lot of amens and saying, thank for actually exposing this. Among black men, one of the most common ones I get is, well, this seems ridiculous. Its an oxymoron. How could black men be privileged? Its like jumbo shrimp. It doesnt add up. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. LEWIS: And they say, you know, what did my black male privilege get me? Im unemployed. What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have. And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages.

And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative.

MARTIN: So, define black male privilege. Im sure thats a phrase on its face that will get people to sit up and take notice. Prof. LEWIS: My working definition is really a system of built-in and often overlooked systematic advantages that center the experience and the concerns of black males while minimizing the power that black males hold, which is a fancy way of saying, we are absolutely used to talking about African-American men in crisis. And we can talk about this crisis so much that we miss the ways in which black men are oppressed and can also serve as oppressors. MARTIN: And when you say privileged, I think generally people think of privilege in relation to whom. So, when you think of privilege, are you speaking relative to someone? Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. Black male privilege is first centered as being relative to black women. Im not comparing black males privilege to white male privilege. I think one could argue that, but itd be a very dangerous leap. When we look in the African-American community, there are actually spaces where black men are advantaged and often sometimes dominate a dialogue, when we should be listening more carefully to whats happening with black women equally. MARTIN: Give an example. Prof. LEWIS: In particular, if we think about the narrative of mass incarceration, we think about the ways in which black men and black boys have been locked up at increasing rates since the 1980s. While this is true, the fastest growing incarceration rate is particularly among black and Latino women. And because we havent thought seriously about whats happening with black girls and Latino girls, we tend to make the issue of incarceration solely male, and we miss the different ways in which we need to be intervening not just for our young boys, but also our young girls. MARTIN: Well, give another example then, because I think people would say focusing on those who are even worse off than you doesnt mean youre well off. Prof. LEWIS: Well, the first time I really came to think about black male privilege was when I was a freshman at Morehouse College. And at that point, there was actually an incident of sexual assault between a Morehouse student and a Spelman student. And what I found quickly were that black men were -instead of actually talking seriously about issues of sexual assault, which are very common in our community, it became a discussion about the ways in which black men become vilified. So, what happens is we often look at issues like domestic violence or sexual assault, and instead of actually dealing with those who are survivors or the victims of it, predominantly African-American women, we re-center it on black men. MARTIN: Whats driving this, in your view? Is it their idea that group solidarity is so important in the African-American community, somehow the community has made a decision that when theres an issue involving black men and black women that black men are to be favored? Prof. LEWIS: I think youve unfortunately identified one of the central issues of black male privilege. So often, black men are used to being under attacked that when it comes to being accountable for the actions we may have, we quickly say, well, I couldnt possibly be doing anything wrong. Look at all the ways in which Im oppressed. Look at all the ways in which Im at the bottom of the barrel. What that does is rob us of an opportunity to actually build stronger community and it robs black men of a chance to actually take hold of the actions that they have so that we can empower the community. MARTIN: What reaction do you get when you talk to people about this? Prof. LEWIS: Among black women, in particular, I get a lot of amens and saying, thank for actually exposing this. Among black men, one of the most common ones I get is, well, this seems ridiculous. Its an oxymoron. How could black men be privileged? Its like jumbo shrimp. It doesnt add up. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. LEWIS: And they say, you know, what did my black male privilege get me? Im unemployed. What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have. And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole?

And we can talk about this crisis so much that we miss the ways in which black men are oppressed and can also serve as oppressors. MARTIN: And when you say privileged, I think generally people think of privilege in relation to whom. So, when you think of privilege, are you speaking relative to someone? Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. Black male privilege is first centered as being relative to black women. Im not comparing black males privilege to white male privilege. I think one could argue that, but itd be a very dangerous leap. When we look in the African-American community, there are actually spaces where black men are advantaged and often sometimes dominate a dialogue, when we should be listening more carefully to whats happening with black women equally. MARTIN: Give an example. Prof. LEWIS: In particular, if we think about the narrative of mass incarceration, we think about the ways in which black men and black boys have been locked up at increasing rates since the 1980s. While this is true, the fastest growing incarceration rate is particularly among black and Latino women. And because we havent thought seriously about whats happening with black girls and Latino girls, we tend to make the issue of incarceration solely male, and we miss the different ways in which we need to be intervening not just for our young boys, but also our young girls. MARTIN: Well, give another example then, because I think people would say focusing on those who are even worse off than you doesnt mean youre well off. Prof. LEWIS: Well, the first time I really came to think about black male privilege was when I was a freshman at Morehouse College. And at that point, there was actually an incident of sexual assault between a Morehouse student and a Spelman student. And what I found quickly were that black men were -instead of actually talking seriously about issues of sexual assault, which are very common in our community, it became a discussion about the ways in which black men become vilified. So, what happens is we often look at issues like domestic violence or sexual assault, and instead of actually dealing with those who are survivors or the victims of it, predominantly African-American women, we re-center it on black men. MARTIN: Whats driving this, in your view? Is it their idea that group solidarity is so important in the African-American community, somehow the community has made a decision that when theres an issue involving black men and black women that black men are to be favored? Prof. LEWIS: I think youve unfortunately identified one of the central issues of black male privilege. So often, black men are used to being under attacked that when it comes to being accountable for the actions we may have, we quickly say, well, I couldnt possibly be doing anything wrong. Look at all the ways in which Im oppressed. Look at all the ways in which Im at the bottom of the barrel. What that does is rob us of an opportunity to actually build stronger community and it robs black men of a chance to actually take hold of the actions that they have so that we can empower the community. MARTIN: What reaction do you get when you talk to people about this? Prof. LEWIS: Among black women, in particular, I get a lot of amens and saying, thank for actually exposing this. Among black men, one of the most common ones I get is, well, this seems ridiculous. Its an oxymoron. How could black men be privileged? Its like jumbo shrimp. It doesnt add up. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. LEWIS: And they say, you know, what did my black male privilege get me? Im unemployed. What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have. And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get.

I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get. Prof. LEWIS: Thank you for having me on. Copyright © 2010 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

And we can talk about this crisis so much that we miss the ways in which black men are oppressed and can also serve as oppressors. MARTIN: And when you say privileged, I think generally people think of privilege in relation to whom. So, when you think of privilege, are you speaking relative to someone? Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. Black male privilege is first centered as being relative to black women. Im not comparing black males privilege to white male privilege. I think one could argue that, but itd be a very dangerous leap. When we look in the African-American community, there are actually spaces where black men are advantaged and often sometimes dominate a dialogue, when we should be listening more carefully to whats happening with black women equally. MARTIN: Give an example. Prof. LEWIS: In particular, if we think about the narrative of mass incarceration, we think about the ways in which black men and black boys have been locked up at increasing rates since the 1980s. While this is true, the fastest growing incarceration rate is particularly among black and Latino women. And because we havent thought seriously about whats happening with black girls and Latino girls, we tend to make the issue of incarceration solely male, and we miss the different ways in which we need to be intervening not just for our young boys, but also our young girls. MARTIN: Well, give another example then, because I think people would say focusing on those who are even worse off than you doesnt mean youre well off. Prof. LEWIS: Well, the first time I really came to think about black male privilege was when I was a freshman at Morehouse College. And at that point, there was actually an incident of sexual assault between a Morehouse student and a Spelman student. And what I found quickly were that black men were -instead of actually talking seriously about issues of sexual assault, which are very common in our community, it became a discussion about the ways in which black men become vilified. So, what happens is we often look at issues like domestic violence or sexual assault, and instead of actually dealing with those who are survivors or the victims of it, predominantly African-American women, we re-center it on black men. MARTIN: Whats driving this, in your view? Is it their idea that group solidarity is so important in the African-American community, somehow the community has made a decision that when theres an issue involving black men and black women that black men are to be favored? Prof. LEWIS: I think youve unfortunately identified one of the central issues of black male privilege. So often, black men are used to being under attacked that when it comes to being accountable for the actions we may have, we quickly say, well, I couldnt possibly be doing anything wrong. Look at all the ways in which Im oppressed. Look at all the ways in which Im at the bottom of the barrel. What that does is rob us of an opportunity to actually build stronger community and it robs black men of a chance to actually take hold of the actions that they have so that we can empower the community. MARTIN: What reaction do you get when you talk to people about this? Prof. LEWIS: Among black women, in particular, I get a lot of amens and saying, thank for actually exposing this. Among black men, one of the most common ones I get is, well, this seems ridiculous. Its an oxymoron. How could black men be privileged? Its like jumbo shrimp. It doesnt add up. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. LEWIS: And they say, you know, what did my black male privilege get me? Im unemployed. What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have. And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right.

Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get. Prof. LEWIS: Thank you for having me on. Copyright © 2010 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Audio on npr.org may be edited after its original broadcast or publication. The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nProf. LEWIS: Absolutely. Black male privilege is first centered as being relative to black women. Im not comparing black males privilege to white male privilege. I think one could argue that, but itd be a very dangerous leap. When we look in the African-American community, there are actually spaces where black men are advantaged and often sometimes dominate a dialogue, when we should be listening more carefully to whats happening with black women equally. MARTIN: Give an example. Prof. LEWIS: In particular, if we think about the narrative of mass incarceration, we think about the ways in which black men and black boys have been locked up at increasing rates since the 1980s. While this is true, the fastest growing incarceration rate is particularly among black and Latino women. And because we havent thought seriously about whats happening with black girls and Latino girls, we tend to make the issue of incarceration solely male, and we miss the different ways in which we need to be intervening not just for our young boys, but also our young girls. MARTIN: Well, give another example then, because I think people would say focusing on those who are even worse off than you doesnt mean youre well off. Prof. LEWIS: Well, the first time I really came to think about black male privilege was when I was a freshman at Morehouse College. And at that point, there was actually an incident of sexual assault between a Morehouse student and a Spelman student. And what I found quickly were that black men were -instead of actually talking seriously about issues of sexual assault, which are very common in our community, it became a discussion about the ways in which black men become vilified. So, what happens is we often look at issues like domestic violence or sexual assault, and instead of actually dealing with those who are survivors or the victims of it, predominantly African-American women, we re-center it on black men. MARTIN: Whats driving this, in your view? Is it their idea that group solidarity is so important in the African-American community, somehow the community has made a decision that when theres an issue involving black men and black women that black men are to be favored? Prof. LEWIS: I think youve unfortunately identified one of the central issues of black male privilege. So often, black men are used to being under attacked that when it comes to being accountable for the actions we may have, we quickly say, well, I couldnt possibly be doing anything wrong. Look at all the ways in which Im oppressed. Look at all the ways in which Im at the bottom of the barrel. What that does is rob us of an opportunity to actually build stronger community and it robs black men of a chance to actually take hold of the actions that they have so that we can empower the community. MARTIN: What reaction do you get when you talk to people about this? Prof. LEWIS: Among black women, in particular, I get a lot of amens and saying, thank for actually exposing this. Among black men, one of the most common ones I get is, well, this seems ridiculous. Its an oxymoron. How could black men be privileged? Its like jumbo shrimp. It doesnt add up. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. LEWIS: And they say, you know, what did my black male privilege get me? Im unemployed. What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have. And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store.

And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get. Prof. LEWIS: Thank you for having me on. Copyright © 2010 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Prof. LEWIS: In particular, if we think about the narrative of mass incarceration, we think about the ways in which black men and black boys have been locked up at increasing rates since the 1980s. While this is true, the fastest growing incarceration rate is particularly among black and Latino women. And because we havent thought seriously about whats happening with black girls and Latino girls, we tend to make the issue of incarceration solely male, and we miss the different ways in which we need to be intervening not just for our young boys, but also our young girls. MARTIN: Well, give another example then, because I think people would say focusing on those who are even worse off than you doesnt mean youre well off. Prof. LEWIS: Well, the first time I really came to think about black male privilege was when I was a freshman at Morehouse College. And at that point, there was actually an incident of sexual assault between a Morehouse student and a Spelman student. And what I found quickly were that black men were -instead of actually talking seriously about issues of sexual assault, which are very common in our community, it became a discussion about the ways in which black men become vilified. So, what happens is we often look at issues like domestic violence or sexual assault, and instead of actually dealing with those who are survivors or the victims of it, predominantly African-American women, we re-center it on black men. MARTIN: Whats driving this, in your view? Is it their idea that group solidarity is so important in the African-American community, somehow the community has made a decision that when theres an issue involving black men and black women that black men are to be favored? Prof. LEWIS: I think youve unfortunately identified one of the central issues of black male privilege. So often, black men are used to being under attacked that when it comes to being accountable for the actions we may have, we quickly say, well, I couldnt possibly be doing anything wrong. Look at all the ways in which Im oppressed. Look at all the ways in which Im at the bottom of the barrel. What that does is rob us of an opportunity to actually build stronger community and it robs black men of a chance to actually take hold of the actions that they have so that we can empower the community. MARTIN: What reaction do you get when you talk to people about this? Prof. LEWIS: Among black women, in particular, I get a lot of amens and saying, thank for actually exposing this. Among black men, one of the most common ones I get is, well, this seems ridiculous. Its an oxymoron. How could black men be privileged? Its like jumbo shrimp. It doesnt add up. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. LEWIS: And they say, you know, what did my black male privilege get me? Im unemployed. What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have. And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center.

I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get. Prof. LEWIS: Thank you for having me on. Copyright © 2010 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nMARTIN: Well, give another example then, because I think people would say focusing on those who are even worse off than you doesnt mean youre well off. Prof. LEWIS: Well, the first time I really came to think about black male privilege was when I was a freshman at Morehouse College. And at that point, there was actually an incident of sexual assault between a Morehouse student and a Spelman student. And what I found quickly were that black men were -instead of actually talking seriously about issues of sexual assault, which are very common in our community, it became a discussion about the ways in which black men become vilified. So, what happens is we often look at issues like domestic violence or sexual assault, and instead of actually dealing with those who are survivors or the victims of it, predominantly African-American women, we re-center it on black men. MARTIN: Whats driving this, in your view? Is it their idea that group solidarity is so important in the African-American community, somehow the community has made a decision that when theres an issue involving black men and black women that black men are to be favored? Prof. LEWIS: I think youve unfortunately identified one of the central issues of black male privilege. So often, black men are used to being under attacked that when it comes to being accountable for the actions we may have, we quickly say, well, I couldnt possibly be doing anything wrong. Look at all the ways in which Im oppressed. Look at all the ways in which Im at the bottom of the barrel. What that does is rob us of an opportunity to actually build stronger community and it robs black men of a chance to actually take hold of the actions that they have so that we can empower the community. MARTIN: What reaction do you get when you talk to people about this? Prof. LEWIS: Among black women, in particular, I get a lot of amens and saying, thank for actually exposing this. Among black men, one of the most common ones I get is, well, this seems ridiculous. Its an oxymoron. How could black men be privileged? Its like jumbo shrimp. It doesnt add up. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. LEWIS: And they say, you know, what did my black male privilege get me? Im unemployed. What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have. And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received.

Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get. Prof. LEWIS: Thank you for having me on. Copyright © 2010 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

And at that point, there was actually an incident of sexual assault between a Morehouse student and a Spelman student. And what I found quickly were that black men were -instead of actually talking seriously about issues of sexual assault, which are very common in our community, it became a discussion about the ways in which black men become vilified. So, what happens is we often look at issues like domestic violence or sexual assault, and instead of actually dealing with those who are survivors or the victims of it, predominantly African-American women, we re-center it on black men. MARTIN: Whats driving this, in your view? Is it their idea that group solidarity is so important in the African-American community, somehow the community has made a decision that when theres an issue involving black men and black women that black men are to be favored? Prof. LEWIS: I think youve unfortunately identified one of the central issues of black male privilege. So often, black men are used to being under attacked that when it comes to being accountable for the actions we may have, we quickly say, well, I couldnt possibly be doing anything wrong. Look at all the ways in which Im oppressed. Look at all the ways in which Im at the bottom of the barrel. What that does is rob us of an opportunity to actually build stronger community and it robs black men of a chance to actually take hold of the actions that they have so that we can empower the community. MARTIN: What reaction do you get when you talk to people about this? Prof. LEWIS: Among black women, in particular, I get a lot of amens and saying, thank for actually exposing this. Among black men, one of the most common ones I get is, well, this seems ridiculous. Its an oxymoron. How could black men be privileged? Its like jumbo shrimp. It doesnt add up. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. LEWIS: And they say, you know, what did my black male privilege get me? Im unemployed. What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have. And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege.

What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get. Prof. LEWIS: Thank you for having me on. Copyright © 2010 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

So often, black men are used to being under attacked that when it comes to being accountable for the actions we may have, we quickly say, well, I couldnt possibly be doing anything wrong. Look at all the ways in which Im oppressed. Look at all the ways in which Im at the bottom of the barrel. What that does is rob us of an opportunity to actually build stronger community and it robs black men of a chance to actually take hold of the actions that they have so that we can empower the community. MARTIN: What reaction do you get when you talk to people about this? Prof. LEWIS: Among black women, in particular, I get a lot of amens and saying, thank for actually exposing this. Among black men, one of the most common ones I get is, well, this seems ridiculous. Its an oxymoron. How could black men be privileged? Its like jumbo shrimp. It doesnt add up. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. LEWIS: And they say, you know, what did my black male privilege get me? Im unemployed. What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have. And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged.

And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get.

Among black men, one of the most common ones I get is, well, this seems ridiculous. Its an oxymoron. How could black men be privileged? Its like jumbo shrimp. It doesnt add up. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. LEWIS: And they say, you know, what did my black male privilege get me? Im unemployed. What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have.

As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get. Prof. LEWIS: Thank you for having me on. Copyright © 2010 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

What did my black male privilege get me? Im in jail. And what I have to unfortunately explain is one of the things that black male privilege allows you to do is center your oppression to the exclusion of others. So, instead of saying, why, yes, there are ways in which black men are promoted more often than black women. Why, yes, there are ways in which you reach certain educational levels, black men get higher pay rates than their black female counterparts who are equally skilled. We should be turning that on its head and saying, how do we make sure black women have equal parity to us, instead of saying: Hey, I've got to keep the little ground that I have. And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that.

What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get.

And I think that, for a long time, the reason that black women are often speaking up in support of this is because black feminists have challenged us to think differently and said: Hey, black men, brothers, could you look out for us as we look out for the whole? As black feminists have taught us. There can be no liberation for half a race. MARTIN: How did you get started on this? Because I take your point that this is a point of view that has been advanced - not popularly - by, you know, African-American women and particularly African-American feminists, but it is not one that has been particularly well received. So Im interested in how you, as a male scholar, got interested in this. Prof. LEWIS: Initially, my first exposure was actually around the Million Man March. I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged.

How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get. Prof. LEWIS: Thank you for having me on. Copyright © 2010 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

I felt that I was transformed by the Million Man March, and I thought it was one of the most powerful events ever. And I was having a conversation in class with a professor, Dr. Beverly Guy Sheftall, and she said that she couldnt support the Million Man March because it was very patriarchal and it put black men at the center. And I said, well, it doesnt always have to patriarchal. You dont always have to put black men at the center. And if she said, isnt it an amazing privilege to tell someone else what they dont have to take seriously? And that paused me for a moment. And I said, wow. What is it in my past that makes me say I can define what someone else would think of as important? MARTIN: If youre just joining us, youre listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Im speaking with LHeureux Lewis. He's a professor of sociology at the City University of New York. And were talking about his theory of black male privilege. The other sensitive area that is talked about in this is - you know, how can I put this in a way that is something that we can discuss in a family setting -negotiating sex. Prof. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men.

As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York.

Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get.

Audio on npr.org may be edited after its original broadcast or publication. The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nProf. LEWIS: Absolutely. MARTIN: Which is an issue that's - is, you know, a very real and much-discussed issue in the African-American community. Is it partly your theory that the imbalance on the college campuses, the imbalance in education, high incarceration rates - partly because of all those things that black men who are not subject to those issues, those negatives, and who are, in essence, taking advantage by being - what? Selfish when it comes to negotiating sex, or kind of using their power. Prof. LEWIS: I think it's a perfect example of privilege, with a shrinking number of eligible of black men who are educated, who are employed et cetera. Those of us who have made it through the ranks made it through the crisis, right, as they often call it. We end up having or engaging in dating practices - and even married men - in practices in which instead of actually exercising discretion, its like a kid in a candy store. Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men.

Its like, well, I can have Reese's and I can Hersheys and I can have M&M's. And then when you ask brothers what theyre doing, they're like, well, as Jewel Woods has found in his book \"Dont Blame It on Rio,\" theyll suggest that it's actually reward for all of the issues that they faced as a black man, which now we have this ongoing narrative of black single women who cant find mates. And it centers on what are the issues of black women. Of course, Jimi Izrael just released a book, \"The Denzel Principle,\" and it says why black women cant find good black men, versus saying: Well, what are the things that brothers are doing that are also impacting how people date, impacting mate selection and impact how we build a community? MARTIN: What do you - what about that argument? That if black men are saying that, you know, maybe they didnt get a chance to experience the patriarchy back when it was fashionable for white men, you know. Maybe they didnt get to sort of have that power position in society, and they say its my turn. What do you say to that? Prof. LEWIS: Well, I say it can be your turn if youre most concerned with your own self aggrandizement. If youre interested in a community growing and developing, you have to realize when you put the brakes on privilege. All too often, people who have the opportunity to change a system when they get to the top continue it. Particularly as black men, we should be aware that those who are in power will often try to recreate the same cycles of oppression. Why would we want to do that to our sisters, to our mothers and to our community at large? MARTIN: What would you say to those - and this has been an argument since the '60s, as you know - that, in fact, the African-American is, in fact, matriarchal, that African-American women - relative to men - have more power than among other groups and are, in fact, the privileged. The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative. MARTIN: LHeureux Lewis is assistant professor of sociology and black studies at the City University of New York. He was kind enough to join us from our bureau in New York. If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get.

If you want to see him present his paper at Morehouse, well have a link on our Web site. Just go to npr.org, click on Programs, then on TELL ME MORE. Professor Lewis, thank you so much for speaking with us, and do keep us in touch as you talk more about this. Well be interested in reactions that you continue to get.

The argument is that they are more tolerable or more accepted by the white power structure, that they are considered easier to get along with, that they, in fact, have more power within families because they tend to be the heads of households. What do you say to those who argue that, in fact, this community is matriarchal? Prof. LEWIS: Right. I think - you know, and I fully address it as the myth of black matriarchy, because what youre talking about are limited spaces and zones of power. We do know, among service sector jobs, that black women are more likely to employed. But we do know among the jobs that provide the greatest amount of advancement, the greatest amount of security, black women are less likely to get hired, less likely to get promoted and less likely to have suitable wages. When you have a system that doesnt allow a black woman full opportunity, then theyre going to have to try to operate in small spaces in which they make have some form of power. When people started advancing and suggesting, well, the black community is matriarchal because black women are heads of households, it was often because of the absence of black men. Black men absolving the responsibility or trying to step around it have left black women trying to run things on their own. And I think as a community, its our job to come together as egalitarian bodies to try to make for a better family structure, a better community. MARTIN: What do you want to happen now as a result of the conversations that you have sparked with this? I know you presented your thoughts at your alma mater. I dont know what reaction you got there. (Soundbite of laughter) MARTIN: And - so what do you want to have happen? Prof. LEWIS: Right. As you alluded to, I presented this talk at Morehouse, which actually had the courage to invite me down, and then even put it up on the Internet. So I want to salute them for that. One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative.

One of the things I said we need to do seriously on college campuses is take the issue of men's studies -how does a gender operate? Not just for women, but for men. What does it mean to be between privilege and peril? We need to ask black men, also, engage study circles. Its not just what you do in the classroom, but what you do outside. How do you learn and figure out how you negotiate and how you can actually be someone who's not just helpful to the individual, but the community as a whole? And lastly, even if youre not in school, be accountable. When you see brothers acting out in ways that can be damaging to themselves, to their families and the larger community, just look out for a brother and say: Hey, is that actually the way you want to go? Because more times than not, when I actually engaged black men, I find that making us consider the actions were doing can be revolutionarily and transformative.

      "text": "Are There Really More Black Men In Prison Than College?\n\nActivists, filmmakers, and even the president invoke the conventional wisdom that there are more black men in prison than in college. Ivory Toldson, a professor at Howard University, says that's a myth; he explains his findings to host Michel Martin.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Now, we'd like to take a critical look at a piece of conventional wisdom that you've probably heard more than once. You might have heard this in a movie; you might have heard this from a politician; you might have heard this from a TV pundit. But you've probably heard that there are more African-American men in jail than in college. Even then-candidate Barack Obama talked about this at an NAACP candidate forum, back in 2007. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We have more work to do when more young black men languish in prison than attend colleges and universities across America. MARTIN: Now, that's a powerful image, but is that really true? Something our next guest has taken a look at. Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote about this for TheRoot.com, and he says... IVORY TOLDSON: It's wrong. There are 1.4 million black men in college right now, and there are about 840,000 black men in prison. MARTIN: That is a huge difference. TOLDSON: Yeah. MARTIN: Now, is that because those numbers were always wrong, or are there more black men in college now than in prison now? TOLDSON: I believe they were always wrong, and there is some debate about that. The citation of that stat came from the Justice Policy Institute's report \"Cell Blocks Versus Classroom,\" which they wrote in 2002. When they analyzed the data, they looked at the National Center for Educational Statistics head count of black men in college, and compared that to the Department of Justice count of inmates at the time. And they came up with almost 100,000 more black men in prison than in college. Now, what's transpired since then is there's been more than a 100 percent increase in the number of black men in college, as reported by the National Center for Educational statistics. And so what I did was, I pulled the data from 2001 that the Justice Policy Institute used; and I noticed that at least 1,000 colleges weren't reporting their head count of black males then. And I also noticed that a lot of colleges that didn't report any numbers, when the Justice Policy Institute wrote their report, were historically black universities. They were big, state universities that I'm pretty sure had some black males present at the time. MARTIN: Why do you think that this myth has persisted? TOLDSON: Yeah. Well, in the '90s, there was a rapid expanse of the criminal justice population and right now, the rate of incarceration among black males is seven times that of white males. And so I think that we had this feeling that something was wrong, and so we got this catchy stat to go along with it. MARTIN: Well, what do you think have been the consequences of this widespread belief - do you think there is one? TOLDSON: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think there's consequences to young, black males who are trying to figure out how to get into college. Then they have this ominous stat that they are more likely to go to prison than to college. Also, a lot of people who work with our young, black males in high school settings and middle school settings don't really understand the black community that well. Eighty percent of all teachers are white; and so if this frames their understanding of who our young, black males are, then their expectations are a little bit lower. I also think it influences the types of programs that we use to help them get into college - because the way that we have juxtaposed college and prison has led to some erroneous assumptions, like if we put in violence-prevention programs and gang- abatement programs, that's somehow going to inspire young, black males to go to college because we've looked at them on this mythical fork, you know, of one foot in college and the other foot in prison. MARTIN: So your argument is that this kind of leads to this idea that young, black men need to be contained as opposed to encouraged to seek college? TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: And you think it should be the other way because, in fact... TOLDSON: Yes, yes. MARTIN: ...you say that's really where the population is. You also say, in your piece for TheRoot.com, that it's not that there aren't enough black men in college. It's that there is a problem that there aren't enough black men in competitive colleges. TOLDSON: Exactly. Yeah. MARTIN: What do you mean by that? TOLDSON: Well, if you look at the representation of black males in college, they represent about 5 percent of the college population. If you look at the adult population of black males in the United States, we represent about 5.5 percent of the adult population. So contrary to popular belief, we aren't under-represented in higher education, but we are under-represented at competitive universities and over-represented at community colleges. The black males who... MARTIN: Just to give your stat, you said that - in your piece, you say that the top 10 colleges for enrolling black males consist of three for-profit colleges, four community colleges and... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...three public, four-year institutions. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: What's the problem with that? TOLDSON: The problem is that young, black males are not being advised to seek out the most competitive alternatives, and they're not being prepared in the way that we should be preparing them, I think, because we believe that just getting them into any college is a success. MARTIN: Or keeping them out of prison is its own success, where... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...therefore, the expectations are low. TOLDSON: Yes. MARTIN: You know, you teach at one of the premier historically black... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...universities in the country, Howard University. Have you talked about this with your students? And what do they say, when you raise this? TOLDSON: A lot of them are surprised. They all understand, though. And in fact, during our convocation speech, our keynote speaker mentioned that there are more black men in prison than in college, and during... MARTIN: Did you jump up and wave? TOLDSON: No. I... MARTIN: Did you wave, no? TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though. Do your numbers include the number of young, black men under criminal-justice supervision? If they're not in prison... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...they may be on probation. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different. We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college. So I would like to see the advocates who are working on fair practices at school, reducing these resource disparities where we have under-qualified teachers teaching our young black males; but we lack college preparatory classes, and a curriculum that would even get them admitted to the most competitive universities. That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference. MARTIN: Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote a piece for TheRoot.com. That's an online publication that focuses on issues of particular interest to African-Americans. The title is \"More Black Men in Jail than in College: Wrong.\" And he was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D.C., studios. Professor Toldson, thank you for speaking with us. TOLDSON: All right. Thank you so much for inviting me. MARTIN: We'd like to mention that we did reach out to the Justice Policy Institute. Their representative said the organization stood by the findings in their 2002 report - which was titled \"Cell Blocks or Classrooms?\"  - and that more information about their methodology is available on their website.

If you look at the adult population of black males in the United States, we represent about 5.5 percent of the adult population. So contrary to popular belief, we aren't under-represented in higher education, but we are under-represented at competitive universities and over-represented at community colleges. The black males who... MARTIN: Just to give your stat, you said that - in your piece, you say that the top 10 colleges for enrolling black males consist of three for-profit colleges, four community colleges and... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...three public, four-year institutions. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: What's the problem with that? TOLDSON: The problem is that young, black males are not being advised to seek out the most competitive alternatives, and they're not being prepared in the way that we should be preparing them, I think, because we believe that just getting them into any college is a success. MARTIN: Or keeping them out of prison is its own success, where... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...therefore, the expectations are low. TOLDSON: Yes. MARTIN: You know, you teach at one of the premier historically black... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...universities in the country, Howard University. Have you talked about this with your students? And what do they say, when you raise this? TOLDSON: A lot of them are surprised. They all understand, though. And in fact, during our convocation speech, our keynote speaker mentioned that there are more black men in prison than in college, and during... MARTIN: Did you jump up and wave? TOLDSON: No. I... MARTIN: Did you wave, no? TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though. Do your numbers include the number of young, black men under criminal-justice supervision? If they're not in prison... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...they may be on probation. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different. We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college. So I would like to see the advocates who are working on fair practices at school, reducing these resource disparities where we have under-qualified teachers teaching our young black males; but we lack college preparatory classes, and a curriculum that would even get them admitted to the most competitive universities. That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference. MARTIN: Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote a piece for TheRoot.com. That's an online publication that focuses on issues of particular interest to African-Americans. The title is \"More Black Men in Jail than in College: Wrong.\" And he was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D.C., studios. Professor Toldson, thank you for speaking with us. TOLDSON: All right. Thank you so much for inviting me. MARTIN: We'd like to mention that we did reach out to the Justice Policy Institute. Their representative said the organization stood by the findings in their 2002 report - which was titled \"Cell Blocks or Classrooms?\"  - and that more information about their methodology is available on their website.

You might have heard this in a movie; you might have heard this from a politician; you might have heard this from a TV pundit. But you've probably heard that there are more African-American men in jail than in college. Even then-candidate Barack Obama talked about this at an NAACP candidate forum, back in 2007. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We have more work to do when more young black men languish in prison than attend colleges and universities across America. MARTIN: Now, that's a powerful image, but is that really true? Something our next guest has taken a look at. Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote about this for TheRoot.com, and he says... IVORY TOLDSON: It's wrong. There are 1.4 million black men in college right now, and there are about 840,000 black men in prison. MARTIN: That is a huge difference. TOLDSON: Yeah. MARTIN: Now, is that because those numbers were always wrong, or are there more black men in college now than in prison now? TOLDSON: I believe they were always wrong, and there is some debate about that. The citation of that stat came from the Justice Policy Institute's report \"Cell Blocks Versus Classroom,\" which they wrote in 2002. When they analyzed the data, they looked at the National Center for Educational Statistics head count of black men in college, and compared that to the Department of Justice count of inmates at the time. And they came up with almost 100,000 more black men in prison than in college. Now, what's transpired since then is there's been more than a 100 percent increase in the number of black men in college, as reported by the National Center for Educational statistics. And so what I did was, I pulled the data from 2001 that the Justice Policy Institute used; and I noticed that at least 1,000 colleges weren't reporting their head count of black males then. And I also noticed that a lot of colleges that didn't report any numbers, when the Justice Policy Institute wrote their report, were historically black universities. They were big, state universities that I'm pretty sure had some black males present at the time. MARTIN: Why do you think that this myth has persisted? TOLDSON: Yeah. Well, in the '90s, there was a rapid expanse of the criminal justice population and right now, the rate of incarceration among black males is seven times that of white males. And so I think that we had this feeling that something was wrong, and so we got this catchy stat to go along with it. MARTIN: Well, what do you think have been the consequences of this widespread belief - do you think there is one? TOLDSON: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think there's consequences to young, black males who are trying to figure out how to get into college. Then they have this ominous stat that they are more likely to go to prison than to college. Also, a lot of people who work with our young, black males in high school settings and middle school settings don't really understand the black community that well. Eighty percent of all teachers are white; and so if this frames their understanding of who our young, black males are, then their expectations are a little bit lower. I also think it influences the types of programs that we use to help them get into college - because the way that we have juxtaposed college and prison has led to some erroneous assumptions, like if we put in violence-prevention programs and gang- abatement programs, that's somehow going to inspire young, black males to go to college because we've looked at them on this mythical fork, you know, of one foot in college and the other foot in prison. MARTIN: So your argument is that this kind of leads to this idea that young, black men need to be contained as opposed to encouraged to seek college? TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: And you think it should be the other way because, in fact... TOLDSON: Yes, yes. MARTIN: ...you say that's really where the population is. You also say, in your piece for TheRoot.com, that it's not that there aren't enough black men in college. It's that there is a problem that there aren't enough black men in competitive colleges.

And so I think that we had this feeling that something was wrong, and so we got this catchy stat to go along with it. MARTIN: Well, what do you think have been the consequences of this widespread belief - do you think there is one? TOLDSON: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think there's consequences to young, black males who are trying to figure out how to get into college. Then they have this ominous stat that they are more likely to go to prison than to college. Also, a lot of people who work with our young, black males in high school settings and middle school settings don't really understand the black community that well. Eighty percent of all teachers are white; and so if this frames their understanding of who our young, black males are, then their expectations are a little bit lower. I also think it influences the types of programs that we use to help them get into college - because the way that we have juxtaposed college and prison has led to some erroneous assumptions, like if we put in violence-prevention programs and gang- abatement programs, that's somehow going to inspire young, black males to go to college because we've looked at them on this mythical fork, you know, of one foot in college and the other foot in prison. MARTIN: So your argument is that this kind of leads to this idea that young, black men need to be contained as opposed to encouraged to seek college? TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: And you think it should be the other way because, in fact... TOLDSON: Yes, yes. MARTIN: ...you say that's really where the population is. You also say, in your piece for TheRoot.com, that it's not that there aren't enough black men in college. It's that there is a problem that there aren't enough black men in competitive colleges. TOLDSON: Exactly. Yeah. MARTIN: What do you mean by that? TOLDSON: Well, if you look at the representation of black males in college, they represent about 5 percent of the college population. If you look at the adult population of black males in the United States, we represent about 5.5 percent of the adult population. So contrary to popular belief, we aren't under-represented in higher education, but we are under-represented at competitive universities and over-represented at community colleges. The black males who... MARTIN: Just to give your stat, you said that - in your piece, you say that the top 10 colleges for enrolling black males consist of three for-profit colleges, four community colleges and... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...three public, four-year institutions. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: What's the problem with that? TOLDSON: The problem is that young, black males are not being advised to seek out the most competitive alternatives, and they're not being prepared in the way that we should be preparing them, I think, because we believe that just getting them into any college is a success. MARTIN: Or keeping them out of prison is its own success, where... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...therefore, the expectations are low. TOLDSON: Yes. MARTIN: You know, you teach at one of the premier historically black... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...universities in the country, Howard University. Have you talked about this with your students? And what do they say, when you raise this? TOLDSON: A lot of them are surprised. They all understand, though. And in fact, during our convocation speech, our keynote speaker mentioned that there are more black men in prison than in college, and during... MARTIN: Did you jump up and wave? TOLDSON: No. I... MARTIN: Did you wave, no? TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though. Do your numbers include the number of young, black men under criminal-justice supervision? If they're not in prison... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...they may be on probation. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different. We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college. So I would like to see the advocates who are working on fair practices at school, reducing these resource disparities where we have under-qualified teachers teaching our young black males; but we lack college preparatory classes, and a curriculum that would even get them admitted to the most competitive universities. That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference. MARTIN: Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote a piece for TheRoot.com. That's an online publication that focuses on issues of particular interest to African-Americans. The title is \"More Black Men in Jail than in College: Wrong.\" And he was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D.C., studios. Professor Toldson, thank you for speaking with us. TOLDSON: All right. Thank you so much for inviting me. MARTIN: We'd like to mention that we did reach out to the Justice Policy Institute.

MARTIN: Now, that's a powerful image, but is that really true? Something our next guest has taken a look at. Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote about this for TheRoot.com, and he says... IVORY TOLDSON: It's wrong. There are 1.4 million black men in college right now, and there are about 840,000 black men in prison. MARTIN: That is a huge difference. TOLDSON: Yeah. MARTIN: Now, is that because those numbers were always wrong, or are there more black men in college now than in prison now? TOLDSON: I believe they were always wrong, and there is some debate about that. The citation of that stat came from the Justice Policy Institute's report \"Cell Blocks Versus Classroom,\" which they wrote in 2002. When they analyzed the data, they looked at the National Center for Educational Statistics head count of black men in college, and compared that to the Department of Justice count of inmates at the time. And they came up with almost 100,000 more black men in prison than in college. Now, what's transpired since then is there's been more than a 100 percent increase in the number of black men in college, as reported by the National Center for Educational statistics. And so what I did was, I pulled the data from 2001 that the Justice Policy Institute used; and I noticed that at least 1,000 colleges weren't reporting their head count of black males then. And I also noticed that a lot of colleges that didn't report any numbers, when the Justice Policy Institute wrote their report, were historically black universities. They were big, state universities that I'm pretty sure had some black males present at the time. MARTIN: Why do you think that this myth has persisted? TOLDSON: Yeah. Well, in the '90s, there was a rapid expanse of the criminal justice population and right now, the rate of incarceration among black males is seven times that of white males.

And so what I did was, I pulled the data from 2001 that the Justice Policy Institute used; and I noticed that at least 1,000 colleges weren't reporting their head count of black males then. And I also noticed that a lot of colleges that didn't report any numbers, when the Justice Policy Institute wrote their report, were historically black universities. They were big, state universities that I'm pretty sure had some black males present at the time. MARTIN: Why do you think that this myth has persisted? TOLDSON: Yeah. Well, in the '90s, there was a rapid expanse of the criminal justice population and right now, the rate of incarceration among black males is seven times that of white males. And so I think that we had this feeling that something was wrong, and so we got this catchy stat to go along with it. MARTIN: Well, what do you think have been the consequences of this widespread belief - do you think there is one? TOLDSON: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think there's consequences to young, black males who are trying to figure out how to get into college. Then they have this ominous stat that they are more likely to go to prison than to college. Also, a lot of people who work with our young, black males in high school settings and middle school settings don't really understand the black community that well. Eighty percent of all teachers are white; and so if this frames their understanding of who our young, black males are, then their expectations are a little bit lower. I also think it influences the types of programs that we use to help them get into college - because the way that we have juxtaposed college and prison has led to some erroneous assumptions, like if we put in violence-prevention programs and gang- abatement programs, that's somehow going to inspire young, black males to go to college because we've looked at them on this mythical fork, you know, of one foot in college and the other foot in prison. MARTIN: So your argument is that this kind of leads to this idea that young, black men need to be contained as opposed to encouraged to seek college? TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: And you think it should be the other way because, in fact... TOLDSON: Yes, yes. MARTIN: ...you say that's really where the population is. You also say, in your piece for TheRoot.com, that it's not that there aren't enough black men in college. It's that there is a problem that there aren't enough black men in competitive colleges. TOLDSON: Exactly. Yeah. MARTIN: What do you mean by that? TOLDSON: Well, if you look at the representation of black males in college, they represent about 5 percent of the college population. If you look at the adult population of black males in the United States, we represent about 5.5 percent of the adult population. So contrary to popular belief, we aren't under-represented in higher education, but we are under-represented at competitive universities and over-represented at community colleges. The black males who... MARTIN: Just to give your stat, you said that - in your piece, you say that the top 10 colleges for enrolling black males consist of three for-profit colleges, four community colleges and... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...three public, four-year institutions. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: What's the problem with that? TOLDSON: The problem is that young, black males are not being advised to seek out the most competitive alternatives, and they're not being prepared in the way that we should be preparing them, I think, because we believe that just getting them into any college is a success. MARTIN: Or keeping them out of prison is its own success, where... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...therefore, the expectations are low. TOLDSON: Yes. MARTIN: You know, you teach at one of the premier historically black... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...universities in the country, Howard University. Have you talked about this with your students? And what do they say, when you raise this? TOLDSON: A lot of them are surprised. They all understand, though. And in fact, during our convocation speech, our keynote speaker mentioned that there are more black men in prison than in college, and during... MARTIN: Did you jump up and wave? TOLDSON: No. I... MARTIN: Did you wave, no? TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though. Do your numbers include the number of young, black men under criminal-justice supervision? If they're not in prison... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...they may be on probation. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different. We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college. So I would like to see the advocates who are working on fair practices at school, reducing these resource disparities where we have under-qualified teachers teaching our young black males; but we lack college preparatory classes, and a curriculum that would even get them admitted to the most competitive universities. That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference. MARTIN: Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote a piece for TheRoot.com. That's an online publication that focuses on issues of particular interest to African-Americans. The title is \"More Black Men in Jail than in College: Wrong.\" And he was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D.C., studios. Professor Toldson, thank you for speaking with us. TOLDSON: All right. Thank you so much for inviting me. MARTIN: We'd like to mention that we did reach out to the Justice Policy Institute. Their representative said the organization stood by the findings in their 2002 report - which was titled \"Cell Blocks or Classrooms?\"  - and that more information about their methodology is available on their website.

There are 1.4 million black men in college right now, and there are about 840,000 black men in prison. MARTIN: That is a huge difference. TOLDSON: Yeah.

TOLDSON: I believe they were always wrong, and there is some debate about that. The citation of that stat came from the Justice Policy Institute's report \"Cell Blocks Versus Classroom,\" which they wrote in 2002.

MARTIN: Well, what do you think have been the consequences of this widespread belief - do you think there is one? TOLDSON: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think there's consequences to young, black males who are trying to figure out how to get into college. Then they have this ominous stat that they are more likely to go to prison than to college. Also, a lot of people who work with our young, black males in high school settings and middle school settings don't really understand the black community that well. Eighty percent of all teachers are white; and so if this frames their understanding of who our young, black males are, then their expectations are a little bit lower. I also think it influences the types of programs that we use to help them get into college - because the way that we have juxtaposed college and prison has led to some erroneous assumptions, like if we put in violence-prevention programs and gang- abatement programs, that's somehow going to inspire young, black males to go to college because we've looked at them on this mythical fork, you know, of one foot in college and the other foot in prison. MARTIN: So your argument is that this kind of leads to this idea that young, black men need to be contained as opposed to encouraged to seek college? TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: And you think it should be the other way because, in fact... TOLDSON: Yes, yes. MARTIN: ...you say that's really where the population is. You also say, in your piece for TheRoot.com, that it's not that there aren't enough black men in college. It's that there is a problem that there aren't enough black men in competitive colleges. TOLDSON: Exactly. Yeah. MARTIN: What do you mean by that? TOLDSON: Well, if you look at the representation of black males in college, they represent about 5 percent of the college population. If you look at the adult population of black males in the United States, we represent about 5.5 percent of the adult population. So contrary to popular belief, we aren't under-represented in higher education, but we are under-represented at competitive universities and over-represented at community colleges. The black males who... MARTIN: Just to give your stat, you said that - in your piece, you say that the top 10 colleges for enrolling black males consist of three for-profit colleges, four community colleges and... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...three public, four-year institutions. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: What's the problem with that? TOLDSON: The problem is that young, black males are not being advised to seek out the most competitive alternatives, and they're not being prepared in the way that we should be preparing them, I think, because we believe that just getting them into any college is a success. MARTIN: Or keeping them out of prison is its own success, where... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...therefore, the expectations are low. TOLDSON: Yes. MARTIN: You know, you teach at one of the premier historically black... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...universities in the country, Howard University. Have you talked about this with your students? And what do they say, when you raise this? TOLDSON: A lot of them are surprised. They all understand, though. And in fact, during our convocation speech, our keynote speaker mentioned that there are more black men in prison than in college, and during... MARTIN: Did you jump up and wave? TOLDSON: No. I... MARTIN: Did you wave, no? TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though. Do your numbers include the number of young, black men under criminal-justice supervision? If they're not in prison... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...they may be on probation. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different. We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college. So I would like to see the advocates who are working on fair practices at school, reducing these resource disparities where we have under-qualified teachers teaching our young black males; but we lack college preparatory classes, and a curriculum that would even get them admitted to the most competitive universities. That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference. MARTIN: Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote a piece for TheRoot.com. That's an online publication that focuses on issues of particular interest to African-Americans. The title is \"More Black Men in Jail than in College: Wrong.\" And he was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D.C., studios. Professor Toldson, thank you for speaking with us. TOLDSON: All right. Thank you so much for inviting me. MARTIN: We'd like to mention that we did reach out to the Justice Policy Institute. Their representative said the organization stood by the findings in their 2002 report - which was titled \"Cell Blocks or Classrooms?\"  - and that more information about their methodology is available on their website.

MARTIN: Now, is that because those numbers were always wrong, or are there more black men in college now than in prison now? TOLDSON: I believe they were always wrong, and there is some debate about that. The citation of that stat came from the Justice Policy Institute's report \"Cell Blocks Versus Classroom,\" which they wrote in 2002. When they analyzed the data, they looked at the National Center for Educational Statistics head count of black men in college, and compared that to the Department of Justice count of inmates at the time. And they came up with almost 100,000 more black men in prison than in college. Now, what's transpired since then is there's been more than a 100 percent increase in the number of black men in college, as reported by the National Center for Educational statistics. And so what I did was, I pulled the data from 2001 that the Justice Policy Institute used; and I noticed that at least 1,000 colleges weren't reporting their head count of black males then. And I also noticed that a lot of colleges that didn't report any numbers, when the Justice Policy Institute wrote their report, were historically black universities. They were big, state universities that I'm pretty sure had some black males present at the time. MARTIN: Why do you think that this myth has persisted? TOLDSON: Yeah. Well, in the '90s, there was a rapid expanse of the criminal justice population and right now, the rate of incarceration among black males is seven times that of white males.

MARTIN: And you think it should be the other way because, in fact... TOLDSON: Yes, yes. MARTIN: ...you say that's really where the population is. You also say, in your piece for TheRoot.com, that it's not that there aren't enough black men in college. It's that there is a problem that there aren't enough black men in competitive colleges. TOLDSON: Exactly. Yeah. MARTIN: What do you mean by that? TOLDSON: Well, if you look at the representation of black males in college, they represent about 5 percent of the college population. If you look at the adult population of black males in the United States, we represent about 5.5 percent of the adult population. So contrary to popular belief, we aren't under-represented in higher education, but we are under-represented at competitive universities and over-represented at community colleges. The black males who... MARTIN: Just to give your stat, you said that - in your piece, you say that the top 10 colleges for enrolling black males consist of three for-profit colleges, four community colleges and... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...three public, four-year institutions. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: What's the problem with that? TOLDSON: The problem is that young, black males are not being advised to seek out the most competitive alternatives, and they're not being prepared in the way that we should be preparing them, I think, because we believe that just getting them into any college is a success. MARTIN: Or keeping them out of prison is its own success, where... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...therefore, the expectations are low. TOLDSON: Yes. MARTIN: You know, you teach at one of the premier historically black... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...universities in the country, Howard University. Have you talked about this with your students? And what do they say, when you raise this? TOLDSON: A lot of them are surprised. They all understand, though. And in fact, during our convocation speech, our keynote speaker mentioned that there are more black men in prison than in college, and during... MARTIN: Did you jump up and wave? TOLDSON: No. I... MARTIN: Did you wave, no? TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though. Do your numbers include the number of young, black men under criminal-justice supervision? If they're not in prison... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...they may be on probation. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different. We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college. So I would like to see the advocates who are working on fair practices at school, reducing these resource disparities where we have under-qualified teachers teaching our young black males; but we lack college preparatory classes, and a curriculum that would even get them admitted to the most competitive universities. That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference. MARTIN: Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote a piece for TheRoot.com. That's an online publication that focuses on issues of particular interest to African-Americans. The title is \"More Black Men in Jail than in College: Wrong.\" And he was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D.C., studios. Professor Toldson, thank you for speaking with us. TOLDSON: All right. Thank you so much for inviting me. MARTIN: We'd like to mention that we did reach out to the Justice Policy Institute. Their representative said the organization stood by the findings in their 2002 report - which was titled \"Cell Blocks or Classrooms?\"  - and that more information about their methodology is available on their website.

The citation of that stat came from the Justice Policy Institute's report \"Cell Blocks Versus Classroom,\" which they wrote in 2002. When they analyzed the data, they looked at the National Center for Educational Statistics head count of black men in college, and compared that to the Department of Justice count of inmates at the time. And they came up with almost 100,000 more black men in prison than in college. Now, what's transpired since then is there's been more than a 100 percent increase in the number of black men in college, as reported by the National Center for Educational statistics. And so what I did was, I pulled the data from 2001 that the Justice Policy Institute used; and I noticed that at least 1,000 colleges weren't reporting their head count of black males then. And I also noticed that a lot of colleges that didn't report any numbers, when the Justice Policy Institute wrote their report, were historically black universities. They were big, state universities that I'm pretty sure had some black males present at the time. MARTIN: Why do you think that this myth has persisted? TOLDSON: Yeah. Well, in the '90s, there was a rapid expanse of the criminal justice population and right now, the rate of incarceration among black males is seven times that of white males. And so I think that we had this feeling that something was wrong, and so we got this catchy stat to go along with it. MARTIN: Well, what do you think have been the consequences of this widespread belief - do you think there is one? TOLDSON: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think there's consequences to young, black males who are trying to figure out how to get into college. Then they have this ominous stat that they are more likely to go to prison than to college. Also, a lot of people who work with our young, black males in high school settings and middle school settings don't really understand the black community that well. Eighty percent of all teachers are white; and so if this frames their understanding of who our young, black males are, then their expectations are a little bit lower. I also think it influences the types of programs that we use to help them get into college - because the way that we have juxtaposed college and prison has led to some erroneous assumptions, like if we put in violence-prevention programs and gang- abatement programs, that's somehow going to inspire young, black males to go to college because we've looked at them on this mythical fork, you know, of one foot in college and the other foot in prison.

We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college. So I would like to see the advocates who are working on fair practices at school, reducing these resource disparities where we have under-qualified teachers teaching our young black males; but we lack college preparatory classes, and a curriculum that would even get them admitted to the most competitive universities. That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference. MARTIN: Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote a piece for TheRoot.com. That's an online publication that focuses on issues of particular interest to African-Americans. The title is \"More Black Men in Jail than in College: Wrong.\" And he was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D.C., studios. Professor Toldson, thank you for speaking with us. TOLDSON: All right. Thank you so much for inviting me. MARTIN: We'd like to mention that we did reach out to the Justice Policy Institute. Their representative said the organization stood by the findings in their 2002 report - which was titled \"Cell Blocks or Classrooms?\"  - and that more information about their methodology is available on their website.

Well, in the '90s, there was a rapid expanse of the criminal justice population and right now, the rate of incarceration among black males is seven times that of white males. And so I think that we had this feeling that something was wrong, and so we got this catchy stat to go along with it. MARTIN: Well, what do you think have been the consequences of this widespread belief - do you think there is one? TOLDSON: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think there's consequences to young, black males who are trying to figure out how to get into college. Then they have this ominous stat that they are more likely to go to prison than to college. Also, a lot of people who work with our young, black males in high school settings and middle school settings don't really understand the black community that well. Eighty percent of all teachers are white; and so if this frames their understanding of who our young, black males are, then their expectations are a little bit lower. I also think it influences the types of programs that we use to help them get into college - because the way that we have juxtaposed college and prison has led to some erroneous assumptions, like if we put in violence-prevention programs and gang- abatement programs, that's somehow going to inspire young, black males to go to college because we've looked at them on this mythical fork, you know, of one foot in college and the other foot in prison. MARTIN: So your argument is that this kind of leads to this idea that young, black men need to be contained as opposed to encouraged to seek college? TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: And you think it should be the other way because, in fact... TOLDSON: Yes, yes. MARTIN: ...you say that's really where the population is. You also say, in your piece for TheRoot.com, that it's not that there aren't enough black men in college. It's that there is a problem that there aren't enough black men in competitive colleges. TOLDSON: Exactly. Yeah. MARTIN: What do you mean by that? TOLDSON: Well, if you look at the representation of black males in college, they represent about 5 percent of the college population. If you look at the adult population of black males in the United States, we represent about 5.5 percent of the adult population. So contrary to popular belief, we aren't under-represented in higher education, but we are under-represented at competitive universities and over-represented at community colleges. The black males who... MARTIN: Just to give your stat, you said that - in your piece, you say that the top 10 colleges for enrolling black males consist of three for-profit colleges, four community colleges and... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...three public, four-year institutions. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: What's the problem with that? TOLDSON: The problem is that young, black males are not being advised to seek out the most competitive alternatives, and they're not being prepared in the way that we should be preparing them, I think, because we believe that just getting them into any college is a success. MARTIN: Or keeping them out of prison is its own success, where... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...therefore, the expectations are low. TOLDSON: Yes. MARTIN: You know, you teach at one of the premier historically black... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...universities in the country, Howard University. Have you talked about this with your students? And what do they say, when you raise this? TOLDSON: A lot of them are surprised. They all understand, though. And in fact, during our convocation speech, our keynote speaker mentioned that there are more black men in prison than in college, and during... MARTIN: Did you jump up and wave? TOLDSON: No. I... MARTIN: Did you wave, no? TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though. Do your numbers include the number of young, black men under criminal-justice supervision? If they're not in prison... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...they may be on probation. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different.

We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college. So I would like to see the advocates who are working on fair practices at school, reducing these resource disparities where we have under-qualified teachers teaching our young black males; but we lack college preparatory classes, and a curriculum that would even get them admitted to the most competitive universities. That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference. MARTIN: Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote a piece for TheRoot.com. That's an online publication that focuses on issues of particular interest to African-Americans. The title is \"More Black Men in Jail than in College: Wrong.\" And he was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D.C., studios. Professor Toldson, thank you for speaking with us. TOLDSON: All right. Thank you so much for inviting me. MARTIN: We'd like to mention that we did reach out to the Justice Policy Institute. Their representative said the organization stood by the findings in their 2002 report - which was titled \"Cell Blocks or Classrooms?\"  - and that more information about their methodology is available on their website.

I think there's consequences to young, black males who are trying to figure out how to get into college. Then they have this ominous stat that they are more likely to go to prison than to college. Also, a lot of people who work with our young, black males in high school settings and middle school settings don't really understand the black community that well. Eighty percent of all teachers are white; and so if this frames their understanding of who our young, black males are, then their expectations are a little bit lower. I also think it influences the types of programs that we use to help them get into college - because the way that we have juxtaposed college and prison has led to some erroneous assumptions, like if we put in violence-prevention programs and gang- abatement programs, that's somehow going to inspire young, black males to go to college because we've looked at them on this mythical fork, you know, of one foot in college and the other foot in prison. MARTIN: So your argument is that this kind of leads to this idea that young, black men need to be contained as opposed to encouraged to seek college? TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: And you think it should be the other way because, in fact... TOLDSON: Yes, yes. MARTIN: ...you say that's really where the population is. You also say, in your piece for TheRoot.com, that it's not that there aren't enough black men in college. It's that there is a problem that there aren't enough black men in competitive colleges. TOLDSON: Exactly. Yeah. MARTIN: What do you mean by that? TOLDSON: Well, if you look at the representation of black males in college, they represent about 5 percent of the college population. If you look at the adult population of black males in the United States, we represent about 5.5 percent of the adult population. So contrary to popular belief, we aren't under-represented in higher education, but we are under-represented at competitive universities and over-represented at community colleges. The black males who... MARTIN: Just to give your stat, you said that - in your piece, you say that the top 10 colleges for enrolling black males consist of three for-profit colleges, four community colleges and... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...three public, four-year institutions. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: What's the problem with that? TOLDSON: The problem is that young, black males are not being advised to seek out the most competitive alternatives, and they're not being prepared in the way that we should be preparing them, I think, because we believe that just getting them into any college is a success. MARTIN: Or keeping them out of prison is its own success, where... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...therefore, the expectations are low. TOLDSON: Yes. MARTIN: You know, you teach at one of the premier historically black... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...universities in the country, Howard University. Have you talked about this with your students? And what do they say, when you raise this? TOLDSON: A lot of them are surprised. They all understand, though. And in fact, during our convocation speech, our keynote speaker mentioned that there are more black men in prison than in college, and during... MARTIN: Did you jump up and wave? TOLDSON: No. I... MARTIN: Did you wave, no? TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though. Do your numbers include the number of young, black men under criminal-justice supervision? If they're not in prison... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...they may be on probation. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different.

TOLDSON: The problem is that young, black males are not being advised to seek out the most competitive alternatives, and they're not being prepared in the way that we should be preparing them, I think, because we believe that just getting them into any college is a success. MARTIN: Or keeping them out of prison is its own success, where... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...therefore, the expectations are low. TOLDSON: Yes. MARTIN: You know, you teach at one of the premier historically black... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...universities in the country, Howard University. Have you talked about this with your students? And what do they say, when you raise this? TOLDSON: A lot of them are surprised. They all understand, though. And in fact, during our convocation speech, our keynote speaker mentioned that there are more black men in prison than in college, and during... MARTIN: Did you jump up and wave? TOLDSON: No. I... MARTIN: Did you wave, no? TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though. Do your numbers include the number of young, black men under criminal-justice supervision? If they're not in prison... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...they may be on probation. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different. We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college. So I would like to see the advocates who are working on fair practices at school, reducing these resource disparities where we have under-qualified teachers teaching our young black males; but we lack college preparatory classes, and a curriculum that would even get them admitted to the most competitive universities. That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference. MARTIN: Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote a piece for TheRoot.com. That's an online publication that focuses on issues of particular interest to African-Americans. The title is \"More Black Men in Jail than in College: Wrong.\" And he was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D.C., studios. Professor Toldson, thank you for speaking with us. TOLDSON: All right. Thank you so much for inviting me. MARTIN: We'd like to mention that we did reach out to the Justice Policy Institute. Their representative said the organization stood by the findings in their 2002 report - which was titled \"Cell Blocks or Classrooms?\"  - and that more information about their methodology is available on their website.

MARTIN: And you think it should be the other way because, in fact... TOLDSON: Yes, yes. MARTIN: ...you say that's really where the population is. You also say, in your piece for TheRoot.com, that it's not that there aren't enough black men in college. It's that there is a problem that there aren't enough black men in competitive colleges. TOLDSON: Exactly. Yeah. MARTIN: What do you mean by that? TOLDSON: Well, if you look at the representation of black males in college, they represent about 5 percent of the college population. If you look at the adult population of black males in the United States, we represent about 5.5 percent of the adult population. So contrary to popular belief, we aren't under-represented in higher education, but we are under-represented at competitive universities and over-represented at community colleges.

MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different. We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college. So I would like to see the advocates who are working on fair practices at school, reducing these resource disparities where we have under-qualified teachers teaching our young black males; but we lack college preparatory classes, and a curriculum that would even get them admitted to the most competitive universities. That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference. MARTIN: Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote a piece for TheRoot.com. That's an online publication that focuses on issues of particular interest to African-Americans. The title is \"More Black Men in Jail than in College: Wrong.\" And he was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D.C., studios. Professor Toldson, thank you for speaking with us. TOLDSON: All right. Thank you so much for inviting me. MARTIN: We'd like to mention that we did reach out to the Justice Policy Institute. Their representative said the organization stood by the findings in their 2002 report - which was titled \"Cell Blocks or Classrooms?\"  - and that more information about their methodology is available on their website.

You also say, in your piece for TheRoot.com, that it's not that there aren't enough black men in college. It's that there is a problem that there aren't enough black men in competitive colleges. TOLDSON: Exactly. Yeah. MARTIN: What do you mean by that? TOLDSON: Well, if you look at the representation of black males in college, they represent about 5 percent of the college population. If you look at the adult population of black males in the United States, we represent about 5.5 percent of the adult population. So contrary to popular belief, we aren't under-represented in higher education, but we are under-represented at competitive universities and over-represented at community colleges. The black males who... MARTIN: Just to give your stat, you said that - in your piece, you say that the top 10 colleges for enrolling black males consist of three for-profit colleges, four community colleges and... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...three public, four-year institutions. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: What's the problem with that? TOLDSON: The problem is that young, black males are not being advised to seek out the most competitive alternatives, and they're not being prepared in the way that we should be preparing them, I think, because we believe that just getting them into any college is a success. MARTIN: Or keeping them out of prison is its own success, where... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...therefore, the expectations are low. TOLDSON: Yes. MARTIN: You know, you teach at one of the premier historically black... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...universities in the country, Howard University. Have you talked about this with your students? And what do they say, when you raise this? TOLDSON: A lot of them are surprised. They all understand, though. And in fact, during our convocation speech, our keynote speaker mentioned that there are more black men in prison than in college, and during... MARTIN: Did you jump up and wave? TOLDSON: No. I... MARTIN: Did you wave, no? TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though.

TOLDSON: The problem is that young, black males are not being advised to seek out the most competitive alternatives, and they're not being prepared in the way that we should be preparing them, I think, because we believe that just getting them into any college is a success. MARTIN: Or keeping them out of prison is its own success, where... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...therefore, the expectations are low. TOLDSON: Yes. MARTIN: You know, you teach at one of the premier historically black... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...universities in the country, Howard University. Have you talked about this with your students? And what do they say, when you raise this? TOLDSON: A lot of them are surprised. They all understand, though. And in fact, during our convocation speech, our keynote speaker mentioned that there are more black men in prison than in college, and during... MARTIN: Did you jump up and wave? TOLDSON: No. I... MARTIN: Did you wave, no? TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though. Do your numbers include the number of young, black men under criminal-justice supervision? If they're not in prison... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...they may be on probation. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different. We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college. So I would like to see the advocates who are working on fair practices at school, reducing these resource disparities where we have under-qualified teachers teaching our young black males; but we lack college preparatory classes, and a curriculum that would even get them admitted to the most competitive universities. That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference. MARTIN: Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote a piece for TheRoot.com. That's an online publication that focuses on issues of particular interest to African-Americans. The title is \"More Black Men in Jail than in College: Wrong.\" And he was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D.C., studios. Professor Toldson, thank you for speaking with us. TOLDSON: All right. Thank you so much for inviting me. MARTIN: We'd like to mention that we did reach out to the Justice Policy Institute. Their representative said the organization stood by the findings in their 2002 report - which was titled \"Cell Blocks or Classrooms?\"  - and that more information about their methodology is available on their website.

If you look at the adult population of black males in the United States, we represent about 5.5 percent of the adult population. So contrary to popular belief, we aren't under-represented in higher education, but we are under-represented at competitive universities and over-represented at community colleges. The black males who...

That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference. MARTIN: Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote a piece for TheRoot.com. That's an online publication that focuses on issues of particular interest to African-Americans. The title is \"More Black Men in Jail than in College: Wrong.\" And he was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D.C., studios. Professor Toldson, thank you for speaking with us. TOLDSON: All right. Thank you so much for inviting me. MARTIN: We'd like to mention that we did reach out to the Justice Policy Institute. Their representative said the organization stood by the findings in their 2002 report - which was titled \"Cell Blocks or Classrooms?\"  - and that more information about their methodology is available on their website.

TOLDSON: The problem is that young, black males are not being advised to seek out the most competitive alternatives, and they're not being prepared in the way that we should be preparing them, I think, because we believe that just getting them into any college is a success. MARTIN: Or keeping them out of prison is its own success, where... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...therefore, the expectations are low. TOLDSON: Yes. MARTIN: You know, you teach at one of the premier historically black... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...universities in the country, Howard University. Have you talked about this with your students? And what do they say, when you raise this? TOLDSON: A lot of them are surprised. They all understand, though. And in fact, during our convocation speech, our keynote speaker mentioned that there are more black men in prison than in college, and during... MARTIN: Did you jump up and wave? TOLDSON: No. I... MARTIN: Did you wave, no? TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though. Do your numbers include the number of young, black men under criminal-justice supervision? If they're not in prison... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...they may be on probation. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different. We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college.

Their representative said the organization stood by the findings in their 2002 report - which was titled \"Cell Blocks or Classrooms?\"  - and that more information about their methodology is available on their website.

MARTIN: ...therefore, the expectations are low. TOLDSON: Yes. MARTIN: You know, you teach at one of the premier historically black... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...universities in the country, Howard University. Have you talked about this with your students? And what do they say, when you raise this? TOLDSON: A lot of them are surprised. They all understand, though. And in fact, during our convocation speech, our keynote speaker mentioned that there are more black men in prison than in college, and during... MARTIN: Did you jump up and wave? TOLDSON: No. I... MARTIN: Did you wave, no? TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though. Do your numbers include the number of young, black men under criminal-justice supervision? If they're not in prison... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...they may be on probation. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different. We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college. So I would like to see the advocates who are working on fair practices at school, reducing these resource disparities where we have under-qualified teachers teaching our young black males; but we lack college preparatory classes, and a curriculum that would even get them admitted to the most competitive universities. That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference.

MARTIN: ...universities in the country, Howard University. Have you talked about this with your students? And what do they say, when you raise this? TOLDSON: A lot of them are surprised. They all understand, though. And in fact, during our convocation speech, our keynote speaker mentioned that there are more black men in prison than in college, and during... MARTIN: Did you jump up and wave? TOLDSON: No. I... MARTIN: Did you wave, no? TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though. Do your numbers include the number of young, black men under criminal-justice supervision? If they're not in prison... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...they may be on probation. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different. We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college. So I would like to see the advocates who are working on fair practices at school, reducing these resource disparities where we have under-qualified teachers teaching our young black males; but we lack college preparatory classes, and a curriculum that would even get them admitted to the most competitive universities. That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference.

That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference. MARTIN: Ivory Toldson is an associate professor at Howard University School of Education. He wrote a piece for TheRoot.com. That's an online publication that focuses on issues of particular interest to African-Americans. The title is \"More Black Men in Jail than in College: Wrong.\" And he was kind enough to join us in our Washington, D.C., studios. Professor Toldson, thank you for speaking with us. TOLDSON: All right. Thank you so much for inviting me. MARTIN: We'd like to mention that we did reach out to the Justice Policy Institute. Their representative said the organization stood by the findings in their 2002 report - which was titled \"Cell Blocks or Classrooms?\"  - and that more information about their methodology is available on their website.

TOLDSON: I restrained myself. MARTIN: No, no. TOLDSON: I restrained myself. But I was very proud, though, because during the convocation luncheon, everyone from the president of the university - you know, down to students, came up to me and asked me - you know - did you hear the speaker? You know, we've got to correct that. They know the statistics and, you know, we're just trying to catch on. MARTIN: But, before we let you go, I do want to ask, though. Do your numbers include the number of young, black men under criminal-justice supervision? If they're not in prison... TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: ...they may be on probation. TOLDSON: Right. MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different. We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight.

MARTIN: They may be on parole. They are not free actors. TOLDSON: Right. I haven't done that, myself. I've seen someone else do that, and it came up a lot closer. But there are still more black men in college. MARTIN: So what should people say now? People who want to talk about this - what should they say? TOLDSON: I would like to see the issue of mass incarceration divorced from higher education. I think that the nature of those problems are completely different. We are grossly over-represented in the criminal-justice system, and everyone who is doing work related to sentencing disparities, the crack versus powder cocaine ratio, all the biases that go on in every stage of the criminal justice system - they should continue that fight, but they really don't need to discuss kids in college as a part of that fight. And there's a lot of things that young, black males are missing from education right now in their preparation to go to college. So I would like to see the advocates who are working on fair practices at school, reducing these resource disparities where we have under-qualified teachers teaching our young black males; but we lack college preparatory classes, and a curriculum that would even get them admitted to the most competitive universities. That needs to be worked on. So what I would tell people to say is, just stop saying that there's more black men in prison than in college. Work in your lane, and make a difference.

Here's why and what's being done\n\nBy\n\nJuana Summers\n\n,\n\nJason Fuller\n\n,\n\nPatrick Jarenwattananon\n\nMembers of the class of 2016 are presented with their degrees during the commencement ceremony at Howard University in May, 2016. Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption\n\nThe absolute number of Black men enrolled at Historically Black Colleges and Universities is the lowest it's been since 1976.\n\nThat's according to recent analysis from the American Institute for Boys and Men , which crunched data from the Department of Education.\n\nIn fact, Black men now currently account for only 26% of the students at HBCUs - back in 1976, that figure was 38%.\n\nAll Things Considered host Juana Summers spoke to Calvin Hadley - assistant provost for academic partnerships and student engagement at Howard University - about what's happening, what's lost when Black men don't attend HBCUs, and how he is trying to close this gap.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nJuana Summers: I want to start by talking about Howard, which, of course, is one of the foremost HBCUs in this country - a long, long list that I cannot recite of incredible alumni, including Vice President Kamala Harris. Let's start there. Are you seeing this decline among Black male students where you are?\n\nCalvin Hadley: I am. I'm a Howard alum, and so I remember as a student, the numbers were also pretty stark at that time. I think we were around 33-34% when I was a student, between 2004 and 2008. Now, as you announced in your introduction, Howard University is around 25% male total. And I think a recent statistics said around 19% Black male. And so that is felt on campus, that is felt, I think, in our social clubs, it's felt on the yard. And I think many of our male students have commented that in some of their classes, they're the only male in their class.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris greets supporters at a campaign rally at South Carolina State University in February. Brandon Bell/Getty Images hide caption\n\nSummers: So I will just say, I did not attend an HBCU. I attended a PWI - a predominantly white institution - but I have so many friends and family members who attended HBCUs. They talk to me about what that experience has meant to them, not just while they're on campus, but when they go out into their professional lives. They stay connected to the HBCU experience. They stay connected to communities like the Howard community that you represent. So I just want to ask you, when there are fewer Black men on campus, walk us through: what does that mean? What do we lose when those Black men are not as robust a presence on campuses like yours?\n\nHadley: By the time students actually come to college, we're dealing with the males that have actually transcended what we call the \"belief gap\" - this gap in between what students can actually achieve and what their professors, teachers, counselors believe they can achieve. For Black males, that gap is the largest. When they get into the campus, the campus experiences are significantly impacted by the imbalance, right?\n\nAt every educational institution, we want a diversity of experience. And so when you don't have as many males in the classroom, that diversity of experience is significantly impacted. It gets even more scary when we trace it forward, right? I think we're dealing with some really unique statistics right now. Black males are graduating at a much lower rate than Black females.\n\nSummers: And that's across all colleges.\n\nHadley: Across all colleges, not just HBCUs. And so this drop in the past decade has been seen more drastically. But the reality is, this is not a Howard problem. This is not an HBCU problem. This is not a PWI problem. This is an American education problem.\n\nSummers: I want to shift gears a bit and talk about what happens when these Black men are graduating from high school and they're deciding what comes next, what that next step is. The study that we've been talking about, it notes that since 2010, as you point out, Black male enrollment has gone down across all colleges. And it also points out that HBCU enrollment has also decreased on the whole, but the decline of Black male enrollment at HBCUs outpaces those trends, if only slightly. Can you just explain to me how you understand that gap?\n\nHadley: So I want to take a small step back. In 2013-14 we had 2990 male applicants for Howard University specifically. In 2022-23 we had 9705. A significant, significant increase.\n\nHoward University graduates arrive for the 2023 Commencement Ceremony in May, 2023. Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images/Getty Images North America hide caption\n\nSummers: And what does that say to you?\n\nHadley: That the Howard University education, and the HBCU education, is highly sought after, right? And there are a number of really important things that happened between 2012 and 2022 - one of those was the election of President Donald Trump, another was the murder of George Floyd. I think when those things happen in the United States of America, the HBCU experience, which had already been known to many of us, had now become a much more attractive proposition. You notice a significant increase in those male applications.\n\nWhat I didn't provide you was the number of female applications that accompany that. While we received 9700 male applications in 2022-23, we received upwards of 30,000 female applications. And I want to take a step aside and say Black women are ripping it up. All the statistics show, from high school to college to college graduation, that the Black women is successful today, and the trajectory is going straight up. Unfortunately, when you look at the Black male, the exact opposite is the case. And so for those Black males that are now being left out of the college equation, that also means they're being left out and stratified out of a certain portion of our society.\n\nWhat we now will have is an imbalance in the community that has a significant impact on our ability to create whole families, I think. On the ability for us to ensure that our generations after us have additional success, and really to have additional mobility.\n\nSummers: I want to end on this: You are a product of Howard University, as you point out. You now work for the university. And you're raising two young Black boys. What's your pitch for why a young Black man who might be hearing our conversation in 2024 should choose to attend an HBCU?\n\nHadley: Wow. Thank you for that. You attend an HBCU for an education and not a degree, and as an assistant provost, that's not a popular thing to say. The education that you receive in an HBCU transcends the classroom experience. It transcends the relationship that you have with your professor. The education exists in between the lines of the pages. HBCUs inundate you with the sense of belief. We talked about the importance of that belief on the front end, the belief gap that exists in K through 12.\n\nHBCUs are created to instill you with the belief that you can be even larger than you can dream. Howard University and the HBCU community has provided me - and many other people, like our vice president - with the sense that I am enough. I can be successful academically. But my world is not simply academics. I can be enough and I can contribute to this society, in this space, in a way that allows me to feel whole and allows me to contribute to something much larger than myself. The HBCU community needs you. And so when I'm talking to that young man in 2024: Come because we need you. Come because you're important. Come because without you, our community is hurt.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Opinion: How Policing Black Boys Leads To The Conditioning Of Black Men\n\nBy\n\nKristin Henning\n\n,\n\nAngela J. Davis\n\nTomiko Shine holds up a picture of Tamir Rice during a protest in Washington, D.C. Jose Luis Magana/AP hide caption\n\nTomiko Shine holds up a picture of Tamir Rice during a protest in Washington, D.C.\n\nMistrust and alienation between black men and the police have become so entrenched that we need radical, sweeping change. The collective experience of black men in the criminal justice system is sobering. African Americans are 2.5 times more likely to be arrested than whites, and numerous studies have shown that black men are disproportionately targeted , stopped, frisked, and searched through the practice of racial profiling. Black men end up in prison more often, receive longer sentences than similarly situated white men, and are more likely to be killed during police encounters than white men - 21 times more likely.\n\nBut, as criminal defense attorneys, we can attest to the fact that as harshly and as unfairly as black men have been treated in the criminal justice system, the fate of black boys has been worse.\n\nDecades of data show that the journey to racial disparity begins when black men are boys. Black boys are policed like no other demographic. They are policed on the street, in the mall, in school, in their homes, and on social media. Police stop black boys on the vaguest of descriptions - \"black boys running,\" \"two black males in jeans, one in a gray hoodie,\" \"black male in athletic gear.\" Young black males are treated as if they are \"out of place\" not only when they are in white, middle-class neighborhoods, but also when they are hanging out in public spaces or sitting on their own front porches.\n\nAdolescence is a critical time during which young people come to understand and respect or resent the law and legal institutions. Negative attitudes about the police acquired during childhood and adolescence have a \"lasting\" effect as youth transition to adulthood. The long history of aggressive and biased interactions with the police - perceived or real - has socialized a generation of black boys to avoid contact with the police whenever possible and if not, to be hostile - sometimes outright confrontational - with police.\n\nBlack boys who congregate on the \"corner\" attract the attention of the police day or night. Even when they \"dress nicely\" or \"drive nice cars\" young black males cannot avoid police surveillance since such signs of wealth among black youth are presumed to be associated with drug dealing. Black boys describe their neighborhoods as over-policed and say officers stop them multiple times a day to pat them down and ask questions like \"Where are you coming from?\" and \"Where are you going?\"\n\nThese stories are significant not only for the debilitating and conditioning impact they have on these youth, but also for the message they send to black boys.\n\nVideotaping, cursing, ignoring an officer's orders and running away provoke even greater hostility, disrespect and often physical force from the police. Not surprisingly, black youth are more likely to experience a use of force than white youth.\n\nBlack boys are angered not only by the frequency with which they are stopped, but also by the treatment they experience during these stops. They describe police as belligerent and antagonistic and are especially outraged by the officers' use of racial slurs, profanity and demeaning terms like \"punk\" and \"sissy.\" They complain about police stops that are too often initiated by physical contact such as grabbing, pushing, shoving, pulling or tackling the youth to the ground.\n\nOnce on the ground, black boys are sometimes held down by multiple officers who sit or lie on them while other officers kick, punch or mace them. More violent encounters include billy clubs or chokeholds like the one that killed Eric Garner in New York . Victims of police violence include black boys like LaQuan McDonald, Tyre King, and most recently Jordan Edwards. Fear of violence by police is now the norm for black boys.\n\nIn a recent study of police perceptions of childhood innocence, researchers showed police officers a series of photographs of young white, black and Latino males engaged in some purported criminal activity and asked them to estimate the age of each child. While the officers overestimated the age of adolescent black felony suspects by 4.59 years, they underestimated the age of adolescent white felony suspects by one year. Because of these types of distorted perceptions, black boys are more likely to be treated as adults much earlier than other youth, more likely to be arrested, harassed and assaulted for normal adolescent behavior, and more likely to be perceived as culpable and deserving of punishment or even death.\n\nConsider the police encounter with Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was killed by police on November 22, 2014, after a witness called 911, reporting \"a guy with a pistol\" that was \"probably fake.\" When police officers arrived, they described a much \"older\" person, weighing 170 pounds, standing 5 feet 7 inches tall and wearing size 36 pants and a man's extra-large jacket. The officers were doing what empirical research on implicit racial bias suggests that police do: routinely overestimate the age and the perceived threat of young black boys.\n\nIf we expect any meaningful change in the relationship between black men and the police, we have to start early. We have to help police resist the faulty perceptions of black youth as violent and aggressive and work to develop black boys' faith in law enforcement. To aid this reform, we should revisit our extensive reliance on police in schools, mandate officer training on adolescent development and implicit bias, and require deep shifts in police policy and procedure to facilitate new opportunities for genuine, positive interactions between black youth and the police. Without these reforms, the unfair policing of black boys - and black men - will continue.\n\nAngela J.

But Racism Sabotages Benefits For Black Men\n\nFrom\n\nBy\n\nVirginia Anderson\n\nGenerally, more education leads to longer and healthier lives - unless you are a Black man in America. Among the contributing factors is the isolation Black men often feel as they rise economically, says Thomas LaVeist, a sociologist and dean of the school of public health at Tulane University. Paula Burch-Celentano/Tulane University hide caption\n\nGenerally, more education leads to longer and healthier lives - unless you are a Black man in America. Among the contributing factors is the isolation Black men often feel as they rise economically, says Thomas LaVeist, a sociologist and dean of the school of public health at Tulane University.\n\nMore education typically leads to better health, yet Black men in the U.S. are not getting the same benefit as other groups, research suggests.\n\nThe reasons for the gap are vexing, experts say, but may provide an important window into unique challenges Black men face as they try to gain not only good health but also equal footing in the U.S.\n\nGenerally, higher education means better paying jobs and health insurance, healthier behaviors and longer lives. This is true across nearly all demographic groups. And studies show life expectancy is higher for Black men with a college degree or higher, compared with those who have not finished high school.\n\nBut the increase is not as big as it is for whites. This comes on top of the many health obstacles Black men already face. They are more likely to die from chronic illnesses like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer than white men, and their average life expectancy is lower. Experts point to a variety of factors that might play a role, but many say the most pervasive is racism.\n\nResearchers note that while Black men and women face many of the same challenges, Black women generally have a longer life expectancy than Black men . (They also point out that for now it is difficult to draw conclusions about Hispanic people because of a lack of studies on these issues.) As a result, many experts say that these health problems stem from a persistent devaluation of Black men in U.S. society.\n\nDavid Williams, a professor of public health at Harvard University, says the cumulative effect of discrimination takes a toll psychologically and physiologically ― and so does the anticipation of it Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health hide caption\n\nDavid Williams, a professor of public health at Harvard University, says the cumulative effect of discrimination takes a toll psychologically and physiologically ― and so does the anticipation of it\n\n\"At every level of income and education, there is still an effect of race,\" says David Williams , a professor of public health at Harvard University who decades ago developed a scale that quantified the connection between racism and health .\n\nThe precise difference in health gains between educated white men and educated Black men is hard to pinpoint because of differences in study designs. Some studies, for example, look at life expectancy, while others look at disease burden or depression.\n\nExperts say, however, that the evidence is strong and convincing that these gaps have persisted over many years. A 2012 study published in Health Affairs , for example, found that life expectancy for white men with the most education was 12.9 years longer than for white men with the least education. For Black men, the difference between the most and least educated was 9.7 years.\n\nIn addition, other research shows how that gap plays out. A 2019 study examined the difference in years of \"lost life\" - years cut off because of health challenges - between the groups. Educated Black men lost 12.09 years of life expectancy, while educated white men lost 8.34 years, according to the study, published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior .\n\nRacism affects Black men's health and it is persistent, experts say.\n\n\"No matter how far you go in school, no matter what you accomplish, you're still a Black man,\" says Derek Novacek , who has a doctorate in clinical psychology from Emory University and is now at UCLA researching Black-white health disparities.\n\nS. Jay Olshansky , a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Illinois in Chicago and lead author of the 2012 study, says possible risk factors for various diseases and environmental issues could also play a role.\n\n\"I'd be very surprised if this wasn't part of the equation,\" he says. \"The risk of diabetes and obesity is much higher among the Black population, even those that are highly educated.\"\n\nAmong other possible causes that researchers are probing are stress and depression.\n\n\"When you follow other groups with more education, depression declines,\" says Dr. Shervin Assari , who studies race, gender and health and is associate professor of medicine at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science outside Los Angeles. \"But when you look at Black men - guess what? Depression goes up .\"\n\nDepression is often an indicator of physical well-being as well as a contributing factor to many chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes.\n\nIsolated at Home and Work\n\nResearchers who study the health of various racial and ethnic groups, as well as the social factors that influence health outcomes, see cause for concern. The findings suggest that the power of discrimination to harm Black men's lives may be more persistent than previously understood. And they could mean that improving Black men's health may be more complicated than previously believed.\n\n\"What has surprised me is how powerfully and consistently discrimination predicts poor health,\" says Williams.\n\nCOVID-19 has underscored the issue. As early as last April researchers noticed higher death and hospitalization rates for Black people. The patterns have continued: Black patients are nearly two times as likely as whites to die of the virus, while Black men have the highest rates of COVID deaths .\n\nThe COVID outcomes, Williams and others suggest in interviews, helped point out that the health and well-being of middle-class, educated Black men may have been overlooked.\n\nHigher education hasn't brought about the health equity many experts had expected. While Black men have worse health than other groups if they are not educated, the data show they don't catch up to their white peers even when they are.\n\n\"What society has done to Black men is to corner them,\" Assari says.\n\nBlack men, even with an education, have less of a financial and social safety net than white men and that brings added stress, experts say. Also, as Black men climb corporate, academic or managerial ladders, many feel isolated. And social isolation is linked to poor health.\n\nThomas LaVeist , a sociologist and dean of the school of public health at Tulane University, says that in a white-dominated society, Black men are less likely to have accumulated social capital - for example, family members with high incomes or social and business connections - who can open doors for them.\n\nAnd once hired into the workplace, they are less likely to have mentors, LaVeist says, and that lack of connections is associated with stress, depression and other factors that can lead to poorer health.\n\n\"There needs to be a designated effort to provide an on-ramp\" for Black men, he says.\n\nNo matter what stage of life, or level of achievement, most have experienced an excess of cumulative adversity and continued racism.\n\n\"Your high socioeconomic status doesn't protect you from the impact or from the incidence\" of racism, says Dr. Adrian Tyndall , associate vice president for strategic and academic affairs at University of Florida Health.\n\n\"That is difficult,\" adds Tyndall, who is Black. \"If I were to walk out of this institution and into the community, where people don't know me, I could be called the N-word. And yeah, that's pretty depressing.\"\n\nThe Need to Prove Yourself\n\nThe cumulative effect of discrimination takes a toll psychologically and physiologically - but so does the anticipation of it.\n\n\"It's not just the actual exposure in dealing with these kinds of experiences, but it's 'What do you do before leaving home?' You're careful about your dress, your behavior, the way you look because of the threat of discrimination, and so you react,\" says Williams, the Harvard professor.\n\nFor example, when Williams, who is Black, first became a professor at Yale University, he wore a coat and tie every day. No one else in his department did that. And yet, he says, he kept up the practice for years.\n\nLaVeist remembers getting onto an elevator at an academic medical center around 1990, shortly after earning his Ph.D., and a passenger wearing a white coat - presumably a doctor - asked LaVeist, who was dressed in a suit, to clean up a spill on the sixth floor.\n\n\"When I told him that I was a professor, he didn't speak,\" says LaVeist. \"He simply didn't speak.\"\n\nGreg Pennington has a doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of North Carolina and an undergraduate degree from Harvard, owns a professional consulting firm in Atlanta, and has worked with hundreds of men individually as well as dozens of Fortune 500 companies.\n\n\"It's not so much that [Black men] experience discrimination and depression 'even after' they have advanced degrees,\" he says. \"It's more descriptive to say 'throughout the whole process.'\"\n\nDespite their academic credentials, Black men say, they often feel they need to prove themselves, which adds another layer of stress.\n\n\"It's almost like I can't fail; I'm representative of other Black males,\" says Woodrow W. Winchester III, director of professional engineering programs at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. \"Your value and your success are around advancing the collective.\"\n\nWhat Can Be Done To Change The Dynamic\n\nThe bottom line, experts agree, is that discrimination has a lingering effect on health.\n\nDana Goldman , director of the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, was co-author of the 2012 Health Affairs study on these chasms in health outcomes. Goldman says he agrees that the underlying cause is racism and adds that he thinks one solution is to improve education.\n\nHe and others suggested that schools, starting in the lower grades, need to provide Black students with more culturally appropriate curricula that bolster their self-image and help build social relationships between white and Black youngsters. Those efforts need to continue as students progress into higher education.\n\n\"The policy remedy is not just less racism but to improve the quality of our schools, occupational safety and public health,\" says Goldman.\n\nOthers agree that the findings suggest a need to reconsider broad policy changes - in education, housing and the justice system so that Black males feel confident and supported in pursuing better educations and jobs.\n\nIt will be a long-term project, says Williams, the Harvard professor.\n\n\"We need a Marshall Plan for all disenfranchised Americans,\" he says, but one that especially addresses implicit biases and how American society views and treats Black men.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent national newsroom funded by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

      "text": "When Boys Can't Be Boys\n\nGene Demby\n\nCivil rights activists are blocked by National Guardsmen brandishing bayonets while trying to stage a protest on Beale Street in Memphis, Tenn. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images hide caption\n\nCivil rights activists are blocked by National Guardsmen brandishing bayonets while trying to stage a protest on Beale Street in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nEditor's note: This column contains a racial epithet.\n\nOne day in the 1930s, a very young Martin Luther King Jr. was sitting in the passenger seat of his father's car when his dad accidentally ran a stop sign on a Georgia street.\n\n\"A policeman pulled up to the car and said: 'All right, boy, pull over and let me see your license,' \" King remembered in an essay years later. \"My father replied indignantly, 'I'm no boy.' Then, pointing to me, 'This is a boy. I am a man, and until you call me one, I will not listen to you.' \"\n\nThe officer was so flummoxed that he quickly wrote out the traffic ticket and hurried away.\n\nSome years later, when King was a civil rights activist writing from a Birmingham, Ala., jail cell , he would point to that word - boy - as one of Jim Crow's ritual humiliations, braided into the racial etiquette of the post-slavery South. It was yet another way - like withholding simple courtesies like honorifics - that white people weaponized language to remind black folks of their place.\n\nThe slight was unmistakable. If manhood was the precondition for the actualization of rights, \"boy\" denied that status even to other men who might lay claim to it. In a region steeped in manners and terms of deference, no black man was ever old enough to age out of \"boy\"; no white person was ever too young to toss it in his direction.\n\n\"Boy\" shows up again and again, if implicitly, in the language of black resistance to white oppression. \"Think about those video reels and the black-and-white photos of black men during the civil rights marches with sandwich boards or placards saying 'I Am A Man' ,\" the Bucknell linguist Hiram Smith said. There's an old urban legend, Smith added, in which black Jazz Age musicians began using \"man\" as a term of affection - as in, \"What's happening, man?\" - as a rebuke to \"boy.\"\n\nIf childhood is a time of innocence that warrants protection, then that stage of life ends much earlier and more abruptly for black boys.\n\nSo was \"boy\" a slur? That was a central question of a sprawling employment discrimination suit in Alabama, which began in 1996 and didn't end until 2016. In that case, a black plant worker argued that his white supervisor had called him \"boy\" as he barked orders at him. For two decades, a series of juries and judges - and eventually the Supreme Court of the United States - repeatedly disagreed over what the supervisor meant when he said it. At one point, some of Martin Luther King's contemporaries in the civil rights movement filed an amicus brief on the plaintiff's behalf, hoping to make the point clear: \"If not a proxy for 'nigger,' it is at the very least a close cousin.\" Unlike that close cousin, of course, \"boy\" has usages that are not irradiated by race, which provides a lot of plausible deniability for the times when it most certainly is. (The plaintiff eventually won.)\n\nBut the echoes of that more sinister denotation remain. Just this past spring, an organization of black journalists urged The Associated Press to adopt new guidelines on \"boy, saying that it felt the term was being used too cavalierly in news stories, especially ones about police violence against black males.\n\nSwirling around that legitimate concern about applying \"boy\" to describe fully grown black men is a growing body of evidence that lays out the ways that actual black boys have been gerrymandered out of the very notion of boyhood. If childhood is a time of innocence that warrants protection, then that stage of life ends much earlier and more abruptly for black boys.\n\nResearch backs this up. In a study from 2014 , psychologists asked police officers to look at photographs of boys between the ages of 10 and 17. The officers were told, at random, that the boys in the pictures were suspected of either a petty crime or a felony. Then the participants were asked to guess the ages of the boys in the photos. The officers consistently perceived black boys as older than they were - by an average of 4.5 years.\n\nThose black boys were seen as legal adults when they were a little over 13 years old. (In the same study, the officers saw white boys in the photographs as younger than they actually were.)\n\nThis aging up of black boys has serious consequences, the study's authors said, including making it more likely that black boys would have force used on them in police encounters.\n\n\"Our research found that black boys can be seen as responsible for their actions at an age when white boys still benefit from the assumption that children are essentially innocent,\" one of the researchers wrote.\n\nThose findings line up with other studies that have found that black boys are more likely to be tried by prosecutors as adults in criminal proceedings and more likely to be sent to adult prisons. Even in early childhood, black boys face tougher consequences for for their actions than do white boys of the same age. The Yale researcher Walter Gilliam wrote that being either \"big, black or boy\" was the biggest predictor of whether a child was suspended or expelled from preschool.\n\nWhite boys - particularly those who are better-off - enjoy that presumption of childhood innocence until much later in life, and it's a distinction that has apparently always been baked into the very notion of adolescence. Back in the 1890s, G. Stanley Hall, the first president of the American Psychological Association, championed the then-novel idea of a distinct developmental stage between childhood and adulthood, according to Ashwini Tambe, a professor of women's studies at the University of Maryland. \"He imagined it as a stage of storm and stress and turbulence and sexual experimentation,\" she said.\n\nBut Tambe noted that Hall and his contemporaries imagined this phase of necessary recklessness for those like themselves: male, white, educated and affluent. In his seminal 1904 book, Adolescence , Hall wrote that \"[a] period of semicriminality is normal for all healthy boys ... those whose surroundings are bad will continue it, but others will grow away from it as they approach maturity.\" Practically speaking, this period of constructive delinquency was not on the table for poor children of all races who couldn't put off adult responsibility because they needed to work or for white girls of similar privilege, as they were expected to be better-behaved.\n\nAnd so: \" Boys will be boys ;\" \" Saturdays are for the boys ;\" \" the old boys' club .\" Brock Turner . Ethan Couch . Cameron Terrell .\n\nAnd, of course, the recent debate over the newest Supreme Court justice. During Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, in which he faced accusations that he committed a sexual assault in high school, he leaned into the particulars of his prep school life - barbells, basketball, beer, bro'ing out - as if the mere fact of them was exculpatory.\n\n(Try to imagine a black man accused of sexual violence trying to convince people that his routine underage drinking should get him off the hook.)\n\nAnd in their defenses of him, many of Kavanaugh's supporters quite literally imagined their own male children as future Brett Kavanaughs - promising, upstanding men who might one day have their good names ruined by scheming women and too-credulous presumptions about their guilt .\n\nIt's a defense not readily available to everyone. Kavanaugh, after all, was nominated by a man who once took out newspaper ads that called for the death penalty for five boys of color accused of a brutal rape. The boys were 14, 15 or 16 years old at the time of their arrests and tried as adults; the newspapers covering the story broke from convention by naming the accused minors and prominently running their photos. When they were exonerated by DNA evidence decades later, Donald Trump continued to argue that the five now-grown men should never have been cleared. \"These young men do not exactly have the pasts of angels,\" Trump wrote. Their pre-prison pasts, though, were essentially their childhoods.\n\nWhether a black male is treated as a \"boy\" or a \"man\" has so often depended on which of those categories might invite the most consequence. White men of means, though, are seldom too old to have aged out of the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly said a 20-year employment discrimination suit began in 1995. The suit was filed in 1996.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Fear Of The Black Man: How Racial Bias Could Affect Crime, Labor Rates\n\nMichel Martin\n\nNPR's Michel Martin speaks with professors Phillip Atiba Goff of UCLA and Harry Holzer of Georgetown University about how fears of African-American men are manifested in the criminal justice system and the labor market, and what that means for the broader African-American community.\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Deadly confrontations between police officers and unarmed African-American men and boys have raised troubling questions in recent months. Among them is whether a fear of black men fuels racial disparities throughout society. NPR's Michel Martin has been taking a close look at that issue. MICHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: It's an open secret among African-American men and boys that people are often afraid of them. Ways to deal with this are discussed among family and friends. But today we're focusing on research about how that fear may influence law enforcement and potential employers. We called Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University who has studied the way race can affect hiring. UCLA social psychologist Phillip Atiba Goff also joined us. He's researched how police officers view even very young African-American boys, and I began our conversation by asking about his findings. PHILLIP ATIBA GOFF: What we found was consistent with the previous research that showed that there was an age overestimation of black children. And to some degree, we think it has to do with a lack of familiarity. To some degree, it has to do with these implicit associations we have between black and something sometimes less than human. But what it definitely has to do with is a lack of the full visibility of the humanity of black people from cradle to grave. MARTIN: You know, we invited our social media followers to tell us whether they ever felt afraid of the presence of African-American men, or - if they were black men themselves - if they felt that they had experienced this fear themselves. We heard from quite a few black men in this callout. We also heard from a number of white women who reported on their experiences. I just want to play one clip from a woman named Angela Dryden. And she says that years ago she was mugged by a group of young black men, and this is how she says this followed her years later into a new neighborhood. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANGELA DRYDEN: It was Valentine's Day, and I noticed three young black men were, you know, walking behind me. And it reminded me of the mugging scene. And I didn't want to cross the street because there were three young black men walking the same direction as I was, but it was having an effect on my physiology. I started to shake, and my heart was beating. But I kept walking, and they slowly kind of walked around me, and one of the young men turned round and said, hey, lady. And I said, yes? You know, and it croaks out of my mouth because I was totally desiccated from the terror. And he said happy Valentine's Day. MARTIN: Professor Goff, how do you respond to that? GOFF: I mean, you have to feel for this woman who's having a very human experience, and yet she's self-aware enough to understand that if she crosses the street, she's playing into a role that she finds anathema to her own values. I think that's a situation that many people in America find themselves in where they have these sort of bad facts about racial disparities. They know the rate of criminal activity is higher in black communities. They know educational achievement is lower, and yet they don't want to be a person who thinks that about an individual. And so that's kind of the conundrum we find ourselves in in trying to find better language to get ourselves out of. MARTIN: So Professor Holzer, you have long been interested in the question of how race plays out in the labor markets. From your research, do you think fear plays a role in hiring decisions - particularly race-based fears? HARRY HOLZER: I think it does, and I think it's fear of several different things. I think employers, first of all, worry about weaker performance of black males relative to black women, relative to other groups. And if their performance is weaker, then along with that they might fear more quits, more discharges, needs to discipline employees. Then a second fear, I think, comes in. There's the fear of conflict, which can be verbal. It can be physical. It could be anything. And then finally - and I think this is a bit of an irony - EEO law. EEO stands for equal employment opportunity law which forbids discrimination in the workplace. It hasn't eliminated it, but it's reduced it. I think EEO law plays a funny role in all of this because most suits for discrimination in the workplace are for wrongful termination and wrongful denial of promotion, which means many small, white employers fear that if they have to discipline a black male employee and maybe even discharge them, that there's a bigger chance that they'll be sued for that than if they turn them away at the gate. MARTIN: (Unintelligible) that we heard from quite a few black men in our callout, including Leo Cunningham. He's an ordained minister in Columbus, Ohio, and he told us that he has personally experienced potential employers becoming cold to him - in this case, that would be churches - when they found out that he's black. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LEO CUNNINGHAM: To have someone look at you and say, your two master's degrees, your undergraduate degree, your previous experience - it doesn't matter if we as Christians think that you are called and ordained by God to be a pastoral leader. The color of your skin prohibits us from wanting to hear anything you have to say about God or our community. That's a gut punch. MARTIN: What about that, Professor Holzer? HOLZER: That's bias. That's bias and fear and perhaps fear of the unknown. And there are, in the background of this whole story, a troubling set of statistics that people keep in their heads - lower achievement among black males than almost any other group even if they have the same educational attainment, more behavioral problems in school, lower employment activity, more crime. Now, it's unfair for those facts to be applied to any particular individual, especially an individual with strong credentials. MARTIN: Professor Goff, what about you? What do you think? GOFF: Well, I mean, in terms of the labor economy, I think that when you get past counting - so diversity for so long has been about just making sure the numbers are right. But when you get past counting, it's not a done deal. You have to set up a workplace so that people feel safe in their identity, and that's not just a touchy-feely Kumbaya thing. It actually affects people's capacity to do their best. MARTIN: I was going to ask you about that. Why do you have to set up an environment where people feel safe in their identity? Some people would say, no I don't. I just have to set up an environment where people will get the job done. They get paid and go home. GOFF: That - right. I don't care about your identity. MARTIN: Yeah. GOFF: You do that on your own. You take that home with you. It turns out that that's not a very successful strategy for employers, for educators or anybody else who's interested in having a diverse team do well. And the reason is because we all walk around with concerns about how we're going to be evaluated. That's a human thing. There's - you're not paranoid or neurotic because you're thinking it. But people who come from groups that have stigmas about them - and we all do - when that stigma is relevant, then it can consume your ability to do anything else. So what then happens is they're spending time having to deal - having to negotiate with it, right? And that's time they're not spending focusing on the task. They're not able to do nearly as well, and part of the reason is 'cause the work environment feels hostile through no direct animus. No one's using racial epithets or using sexual slurs, and yet the environment ends up making people sort of focus on concerns about their identity to the exclusion of doing their work in an excellent way. MARTIN: Given, though, Professor Holzer, that most hiring managers, I think it's fair to say, are still white males, the question that comes up for me is are the right people invested in asking themselves these questions? HOLZER: Well, I'd say two things. First of all, the number of managers who are not white males is certainly growing. A lot more white females are showing up in those jobs, a lot more minorities. And the ray of hope - the real ray of hope on all of this is that as the American customer base becomes more diverse, more and more owners of those businesses and more managers whose performance is judged, for instance, by sales to those groups are going to see that they have a real interest in trying to deal with this. And so hopefully they will have an incentive to overcome some of those negative stereotypes that they've walked into the room with. MARTIN: Harry Holzer is a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, currently a fellow at the Brookings Institution which is a research institute in Washington, D.C. Phillip Atiba Goff is the president of the Center for Policing Equity at UCLA and a visiting scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Thank you both so much for speaking with us.

And if their performance is weaker, then along with that they might fear more quits, more discharges, needs to discipline employees. Then a second fear, I think, comes in. There's the fear of conflict, which can be verbal. It can be physical. It could be anything. And then finally - and I think this is a bit of an irony - EEO law. EEO stands for equal employment opportunity law which forbids discrimination in the workplace. It hasn't eliminated it, but it's reduced it. I think EEO law plays a funny role in all of this because most suits for discrimination in the workplace are for wrongful termination and wrongful denial of promotion, which means many small, white employers fear that if they have to discipline a black male employee and maybe even discharge them, that there's a bigger chance that they'll be sued for that than if they turn them away at the gate. MARTIN: (Unintelligible) that we heard from quite a few black men in our callout, including Leo Cunningham. He's an ordained minister in Columbus, Ohio, and he told us that he has personally experienced potential employers becoming cold to him - in this case, that would be churches - when they found out that he's black. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LEO CUNNINGHAM: To have someone look at you and say, your two master's degrees, your undergraduate degree, your previous experience - it doesn't matter if we as Christians think that you are called and ordained by God to be a pastoral leader. The color of your skin prohibits us from wanting to hear anything you have to say about God or our community. That's a gut punch. MARTIN: What about that, Professor Holzer? HOLZER: That's bias. That's bias and fear and perhaps fear of the unknown. And there are, in the background of this whole story, a troubling set of statistics that people keep in their heads - lower achievement among black males than almost any other group even if they have the same educational attainment, more behavioral problems in school, lower employment activity, more crime. Now, it's unfair for those facts to be applied to any particular individual, especially an individual with strong credentials. MARTIN: Professor Goff, what about you? What do you think? GOFF: Well, I mean, in terms of the labor economy, I think that when you get past counting - so diversity for so long has been about just making sure the numbers are right. But when you get past counting, it's not a done deal. You have to set up a workplace so that people feel safe in their identity, and that's not just a touchy-feely Kumbaya thing. It actually affects people's capacity to do their best. MARTIN: I was going to ask you about that. Why do you have to set up an environment where people feel safe in their identity? Some people would say, no I don't. I just have to set up an environment where people will get the job done. They get paid and go home. GOFF: That - right. I don't care about your identity. MARTIN: Yeah. GOFF: You do that on your own. You take that home with you. It turns out that that's not a very successful strategy for employers, for educators or anybody else who's interested in having a diverse team do well. And the reason is because we all walk around with concerns about how we're going to be evaluated. That's a human thing. There's - you're not paranoid or neurotic because you're thinking it. But people who come from groups that have stigmas about them - and we all do - when that stigma is relevant, then it can consume your ability to do anything else. So what then happens is they're spending time having to deal - having to negotiate with it, right? And that's time they're not spending focusing on the task. They're not able to do nearly as well, and part of the reason is 'cause the work environment feels hostile through no direct animus. No one's using racial epithets or using sexual slurs, and yet the environment ends up making people sort of focus on concerns about their identity to the exclusion of doing their work in an excellent way. MARTIN: Given, though, Professor Holzer, that most hiring managers, I think it's fair to say, are still white males, the question that comes up for me is are the right people invested in asking themselves these questions? HOLZER: Well, I'd say two things. First of all, the number of managers who are not white males is certainly growing. A lot more white females are showing up in those jobs, a lot more minorities. And the ray of hope - the real ray of hope on all of this is that as the American customer base becomes more diverse, more and more owners of those businesses and more managers whose performance is judged, for instance, by sales to those groups are going to see that they have a real interest in trying to deal with this. And so hopefully they will have an incentive to overcome some of those negative stereotypes that they've walked into the room with. MARTIN: Harry Holzer is a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, currently a fellow at the Brookings Institution which is a research institute in Washington, D.C. Phillip Atiba Goff is the president of the Center for Policing Equity at UCLA and a visiting scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Thank you both so much for speaking with us.

Among them is whether a fear of black men fuels racial disparities throughout society. NPR's Michel Martin has been taking a close look at that issue. MICHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: It's an open secret among African-American men and boys that people are often afraid of them. Ways to deal with this are discussed among family and friends. But today we're focusing on research about how that fear may influence law enforcement and potential employers. We called Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University who has studied the way race can affect hiring. UCLA social psychologist Phillip Atiba Goff also joined us. He's researched how police officers view even very young African-American boys, and I began our conversation by asking about his findings. PHILLIP ATIBA GOFF: What we found was consistent with the previous research that showed that there was an age overestimation of black children. And to some degree, we think it has to do with a lack of familiarity. To some degree, it has to do with these implicit associations we have between black and something sometimes less than human. But what it definitely has to do with is a lack of the full visibility of the humanity of black people from cradle to grave. MARTIN: You know, we invited our social media followers to tell us whether they ever felt afraid of the presence of African-American men, or - if they were black men themselves - if they felt that they had experienced this fear themselves. We heard from quite a few black men in this callout. We also heard from a number of white women who reported on their experiences. I just want to play one clip from a woman named Angela Dryden. And she says that years ago she was mugged by a group of young black men, and this is how she says this followed her years later into a new neighborhood. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANGELA DRYDEN: It was Valentine's Day, and I noticed three young black men were, you know, walking behind me. And it reminded me of the mugging scene. And I didn't want to cross the street because there were three young black men walking the same direction as I was, but it was having an effect on my physiology. I started to shake, and my heart was beating. But I kept walking, and they slowly kind of walked around me, and one of the young men turned round and said, hey, lady. And I said, yes? You know, and it croaks out of my mouth because I was totally desiccated from the terror. And he said happy Valentine's Day. MARTIN: Professor Goff, how do you respond to that? GOFF: I mean, you have to feel for this woman who's having a very human experience, and yet she's self-aware enough to understand that if she crosses the street, she's playing into a role that she finds anathema to her own values. I think that's a situation that many people in America find themselves in where they have these sort of bad facts about racial disparities. They know the rate of criminal activity is higher in black communities. They know educational achievement is lower, and yet they don't want to be a person who thinks that about an individual. And so that's kind of the conundrum we find ourselves in in trying to find better language to get ourselves out of. MARTIN: So Professor Holzer, you have long been interested in the question of how race plays out in the labor markets. From your research, do you think fear plays a role in hiring decisions - particularly race-based fears? HARRY HOLZER: I think it does, and I think it's fear of several different things. I think employers, first of all, worry about weaker performance of black males relative to black women, relative to other groups. And if their performance is weaker, then along with that they might fear more quits, more discharges, needs to discipline employees. Then a second fear, I think, comes in. There's the fear of conflict, which can be verbal. It can be physical. It could be anything. And then finally - and I think this is a bit of an irony - EEO law. EEO stands for equal employment opportunity law which forbids discrimination in the workplace. It hasn't eliminated it, but it's reduced it. I think EEO law plays a funny role in all of this because most suits for discrimination in the workplace are for wrongful termination and wrongful denial of promotion, which means many small, white employers fear that if they have to discipline a black male employee and maybe even discharge them, that there's a bigger chance that they'll be sued for that than if they turn them away at the gate.

GOFF: I mean, you have to feel for this woman who's having a very human experience, and yet she's self-aware enough to understand that if she crosses the street, she's playing into a role that she finds anathema to her own values. I think that's a situation that many people in America find themselves in where they have these sort of bad facts about racial disparities. They know the rate of criminal activity is higher in black communities. They know educational achievement is lower, and yet they don't want to be a person who thinks that about an individual. And so that's kind of the conundrum we find ourselves in in trying to find better language to get ourselves out of. MARTIN: So Professor Holzer, you have long been interested in the question of how race plays out in the labor markets. From your research, do you think fear plays a role in hiring decisions - particularly race-based fears? HARRY HOLZER: I think it does, and I think it's fear of several different things. I think employers, first of all, worry about weaker performance of black males relative to black women, relative to other groups. And if their performance is weaker, then along with that they might fear more quits, more discharges, needs to discipline employees. Then a second fear, I think, comes in. There's the fear of conflict, which can be verbal. It can be physical. It could be anything. And then finally - and I think this is a bit of an irony - EEO law. EEO stands for equal employment opportunity law which forbids discrimination in the workplace. It hasn't eliminated it, but it's reduced it. I think EEO law plays a funny role in all of this because most suits for discrimination in the workplace are for wrongful termination and wrongful denial of promotion, which means many small, white employers fear that if they have to discipline a black male employee and maybe even discharge them, that there's a bigger chance that they'll be sued for that than if they turn them away at the gate. MARTIN: (Unintelligible) that we heard from quite a few black men in our callout, including Leo Cunningham. He's an ordained minister in Columbus, Ohio, and he told us that he has personally experienced potential employers becoming cold to him - in this case, that would be churches - when they found out that he's black. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LEO CUNNINGHAM: To have someone look at you and say, your two master's degrees, your undergraduate degree, your previous experience - it doesn't matter if we as Christians think that you are called and ordained by God to be a pastoral leader. The color of your skin prohibits us from wanting to hear anything you have to say about God or our community. That's a gut punch. MARTIN: What about that, Professor Holzer? HOLZER: That's bias. That's bias and fear and perhaps fear of the unknown. And there are, in the background of this whole story, a troubling set of statistics that people keep in their heads - lower achievement among black males than almost any other group even if they have the same educational attainment, more behavioral problems in school, lower employment activity, more crime. Now, it's unfair for those facts to be applied to any particular individual, especially an individual with strong credentials. MARTIN: Professor Goff, what about you? What do you think? GOFF: Well, I mean, in terms of the labor economy, I think that when you get past counting - so diversity for so long has been about just making sure the numbers are right. But when you get past counting, it's not a done deal. You have to set up a workplace so that people feel safe in their identity, and that's not just a touchy-feely Kumbaya thing. It actually affects people's capacity to do their best. MARTIN: I was going to ask you about that. Why do you have to set up an environment where people feel safe in their identity? Some people would say, no I don't. I just have to set up an environment where people will get the job done. They get paid and go home. GOFF: That - right. I don't care about your identity. MARTIN: Yeah. GOFF: You do that on your own. You take that home with you. It turns out that that's not a very successful strategy for employers, for educators or anybody else who's interested in having a diverse team do well. And the reason is because we all walk around with concerns about how we're going to be evaluated. That's a human thing. There's - you're not paranoid or neurotic because you're thinking it. But people who come from groups that have stigmas about them - and we all do - when that stigma is relevant, then it can consume your ability to do anything else. So what then happens is they're spending time having to deal - having to negotiate with it, right? And that's time they're not spending focusing on the task. They're not able to do nearly as well, and part of the reason is 'cause the work environment feels hostile through no direct animus. No one's using racial epithets or using sexual slurs, and yet the environment ends up making people sort of focus on concerns about their identity to the exclusion of doing their work in an excellent way. MARTIN: Given, though, Professor Holzer, that most hiring managers, I think it's fair to say, are still white males, the question that comes up for me is are the right people invested in asking themselves these questions? HOLZER: Well, I'd say two things. First of all, the number of managers who are not white males is certainly growing. A lot more white females are showing up in those jobs, a lot more minorities. And the ray of hope - the real ray of hope on all of this is that as the American customer base becomes more diverse, more and more owners of those businesses and more managers whose performance is judged, for instance, by sales to those groups are going to see that they have a real interest in trying to deal with this. And so hopefully they will have an incentive to overcome some of those negative stereotypes that they've walked into the room with. MARTIN: Harry Holzer is a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, currently a fellow at the Brookings Institution which is a research institute in Washington, D.C. Phillip Atiba Goff is the president of the Center for Policing Equity at UCLA and a visiting scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Thank you both so much for speaking with us.

And to some degree, we think it has to do with a lack of familiarity. To some degree, it has to do with these implicit associations we have between black and something sometimes less than human. But what it definitely has to do with is a lack of the full visibility of the humanity of black people from cradle to grave. MARTIN: You know, we invited our social media followers to tell us whether they ever felt afraid of the presence of African-American men, or - if they were black men themselves - if they felt that they had experienced this fear themselves. We heard from quite a few black men in this callout. We also heard from a number of white women who reported on their experiences. I just want to play one clip from a woman named Angela Dryden. And she says that years ago she was mugged by a group of young black men, and this is how she says this followed her years later into a new neighborhood. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANGELA DRYDEN: It was Valentine's Day, and I noticed three young black men were, you know, walking behind me. And it reminded me of the mugging scene. And I didn't want to cross the street because there were three young black men walking the same direction as I was, but it was having an effect on my physiology. I started to shake, and my heart was beating. But I kept walking, and they slowly kind of walked around me, and one of the young men turned round and said, hey, lady. And I said, yes? You know, and it croaks out of my mouth because I was totally desiccated from the terror. And he said happy Valentine's Day. MARTIN: Professor Goff, how do you respond to that?

The color of your skin prohibits us from wanting to hear anything you have to say about God or our community. That's a gut punch. MARTIN: What about that, Professor Holzer? HOLZER: That's bias. That's bias and fear and perhaps fear of the unknown. And there are, in the background of this whole story, a troubling set of statistics that people keep in their heads - lower achievement among black males than almost any other group even if they have the same educational attainment, more behavioral problems in school, lower employment activity, more crime. Now, it's unfair for those facts to be applied to any particular individual, especially an individual with strong credentials. MARTIN: Professor Goff, what about you? What do you think? GOFF: Well, I mean, in terms of the labor economy, I think that when you get past counting - so diversity for so long has been about just making sure the numbers are right. But when you get past counting, it's not a done deal. You have to set up a workplace so that people feel safe in their identity, and that's not just a touchy-feely Kumbaya thing. It actually affects people's capacity to do their best. MARTIN: I was going to ask you about that. Why do you have to set up an environment where people feel safe in their identity? Some people would say, no I don't. I just have to set up an environment where people will get the job done. They get paid and go home. GOFF: That - right. I don't care about your identity. MARTIN: Yeah. GOFF: You do that on your own. You take that home with you. It turns out that that's not a very successful strategy for employers, for educators or anybody else who's interested in having a diverse team do well. And the reason is because we all walk around with concerns about how we're going to be evaluated. That's a human thing. There's - you're not paranoid or neurotic because you're thinking it. But people who come from groups that have stigmas about them - and we all do - when that stigma is relevant, then it can consume your ability to do anything else. So what then happens is they're spending time having to deal - having to negotiate with it, right? And that's time they're not spending focusing on the task. They're not able to do nearly as well, and part of the reason is 'cause the work environment feels hostile through no direct animus. No one's using racial epithets or using sexual slurs, and yet the environment ends up making people sort of focus on concerns about their identity to the exclusion of doing their work in an excellent way. MARTIN: Given, though, Professor Holzer, that most hiring managers, I think it's fair to say, are still white males, the question that comes up for me is are the right people invested in asking themselves these questions? HOLZER: Well, I'd say two things. First of all, the number of managers who are not white males is certainly growing. A lot more white females are showing up in those jobs, a lot more minorities. And the ray of hope - the real ray of hope on all of this is that as the American customer base becomes more diverse, more and more owners of those businesses and more managers whose performance is judged, for instance, by sales to those groups are going to see that they have a real interest in trying to deal with this. And so hopefully they will have an incentive to overcome some of those negative stereotypes that they've walked into the room with. MARTIN: Harry Holzer is a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, currently a fellow at the Brookings Institution which is a research institute in Washington, D.C. Phillip Atiba Goff is the president of the Center for Policing Equity at UCLA and a visiting scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Thank you both so much for speaking with us. GOFF: Thank you. HOLZER: Thank you very much. Copyright © 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

And it reminded me of the mugging scene. And I didn't want to cross the street because there were three young black men walking the same direction as I was, but it was having an effect on my physiology. I started to shake, and my heart was beating. But I kept walking, and they slowly kind of walked around me, and one of the young men turned round and said, hey, lady. And I said, yes? You know, and it croaks out of my mouth because I was totally desiccated from the terror. And he said happy Valentine's Day. MARTIN: Professor Goff, how do you respond to that? GOFF: I mean, you have to feel for this woman who's having a very human experience, and yet she's self-aware enough to understand that if she crosses the street, she's playing into a role that she finds anathema to her own values. I think that's a situation that many people in America find themselves in where they have these sort of bad facts about racial disparities. They know the rate of criminal activity is higher in black communities. They know educational achievement is lower, and yet they don't want to be a person who thinks that about an individual. And so that's kind of the conundrum we find ourselves in in trying to find better language to get ourselves out of. MARTIN: So Professor Holzer, you have long been interested in the question of how race plays out in the labor markets. From your research, do you think fear plays a role in hiring decisions - particularly race-based fears? HARRY HOLZER: I think it does, and I think it's fear of several different things. I think employers, first of all, worry about weaker performance of black males relative to black women, relative to other groups. And if their performance is weaker, then along with that they might fear more quits, more discharges, needs to discipline employees. Then a second fear, I think, comes in. There's the fear of conflict, which can be verbal. It can be physical. It could be anything. And then finally - and I think this is a bit of an irony - EEO law. EEO stands for equal employment opportunity law which forbids discrimination in the workplace. It hasn't eliminated it, but it's reduced it. I think EEO law plays a funny role in all of this because most suits for discrimination in the workplace are for wrongful termination and wrongful denial of promotion, which means many small, white employers fear that if they have to discipline a black male employee and maybe even discharge them, that there's a bigger chance that they'll be sued for that than if they turn them away at the gate. MARTIN: (Unintelligible) that we heard from quite a few black men in our callout, including Leo Cunningham. He's an ordained minister in Columbus, Ohio, and he told us that he has personally experienced potential employers becoming cold to him - in this case, that would be churches - when they found out that he's black.

And if their performance is weaker, then along with that they might fear more quits, more discharges, needs to discipline employees. Then a second fear, I think, comes in. There's the fear of conflict, which can be verbal. It can be physical. It could be anything. And then finally - and I think this is a bit of an irony - EEO law. EEO stands for equal employment opportunity law which forbids discrimination in the workplace. It hasn't eliminated it, but it's reduced it. I think EEO law plays a funny role in all of this because most suits for discrimination in the workplace are for wrongful termination and wrongful denial of promotion, which means many small, white employers fear that if they have to discipline a black male employee and maybe even discharge them, that there's a bigger chance that they'll be sued for that than if they turn them away at the gate. MARTIN: (Unintelligible) that we heard from quite a few black men in our callout, including Leo Cunningham. He's an ordained minister in Columbus, Ohio, and he told us that he has personally experienced potential employers becoming cold to him - in this case, that would be churches - when they found out that he's black. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LEO CUNNINGHAM: To have someone look at you and say, your two master's degrees, your undergraduate degree, your previous experience - it doesn't matter if we as Christians think that you are called and ordained by God to be a pastoral leader. The color of your skin prohibits us from wanting to hear anything you have to say about God or our community. That's a gut punch. MARTIN: What about that, Professor Holzer? HOLZER: That's bias. That's bias and fear and perhaps fear of the unknown. And there are, in the background of this whole story, a troubling set of statistics that people keep in their heads - lower achievement among black males than almost any other group even if they have the same educational attainment, more behavioral problems in school, lower employment activity, more crime. Now, it's unfair for those facts to be applied to any particular individual, especially an individual with strong credentials. MARTIN: Professor Goff, what about you? What do you think? GOFF: Well, I mean, in terms of the labor economy, I think that when you get past counting - so diversity for so long has been about just making sure the numbers are right. But when you get past counting, it's not a done deal. You have to set up a workplace so that people feel safe in their identity, and that's not just a touchy-feely Kumbaya thing. It actually affects people's capacity to do their best. MARTIN: I was going to ask you about that. Why do you have to set up an environment where people feel safe in their identity? Some people would say, no I don't. I just have to set up an environment where people will get the job done. They get paid and go home. GOFF: That - right. I don't care about your identity. MARTIN: Yeah. GOFF: You do that on your own. You take that home with you. It turns out that that's not a very successful strategy for employers, for educators or anybody else who's interested in having a diverse team do well. And the reason is because we all walk around with concerns about how we're going to be evaluated. That's a human thing. There's - you're not paranoid or neurotic because you're thinking it. But people who come from groups that have stigmas about them - and we all do - when that stigma is relevant, then it can consume your ability to do anything else. So what then happens is they're spending time having to deal - having to negotiate with it, right? And that's time they're not spending focusing on the task. They're not able to do nearly as well, and part of the reason is 'cause the work environment feels hostile through no direct animus. No one's using racial epithets or using sexual slurs, and yet the environment ends up making people sort of focus on concerns about their identity to the exclusion of doing their work in an excellent way. MARTIN: Given, though, Professor Holzer, that most hiring managers, I think it's fair to say, are still white males, the question that comes up for me is are the right people invested in asking themselves these questions? HOLZER: Well, I'd say two things. First of all, the number of managers who are not white males is certainly growing. A lot more white females are showing up in those jobs, a lot more minorities. And the ray of hope - the real ray of hope on all of this is that as the American customer base becomes more diverse, more and more owners of those businesses and more managers whose performance is judged, for instance, by sales to those groups are going to see that they have a real interest in trying to deal with this. And so hopefully they will have an incentive to overcome some of those negative stereotypes that they've walked into the room with. MARTIN: Harry Holzer is a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, currently a fellow at the Brookings Institution which is a research institute in Washington, D.C. Phillip Atiba Goff is the president of the Center for Policing Equity at UCLA and a visiting scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Thank you both so much for speaking with us.

I think that's a situation that many people in America find themselves in where they have these sort of bad facts about racial disparities. They know the rate of criminal activity is higher in black communities. They know educational achievement is lower, and yet they don't want to be a person who thinks that about an individual.

But people who come from groups that have stigmas about them - and we all do - when that stigma is relevant, then it can consume your ability to do anything else. So what then happens is they're spending time having to deal - having to negotiate with it, right? And that's time they're not spending focusing on the task. They're not able to do nearly as well, and part of the reason is 'cause the work environment feels hostile through no direct animus. No one's using racial epithets or using sexual slurs, and yet the environment ends up making people sort of focus on concerns about their identity to the exclusion of doing their work in an excellent way. MARTIN: Given, though, Professor Holzer, that most hiring managers, I think it's fair to say, are still white males, the question that comes up for me is are the right people invested in asking themselves these questions? HOLZER: Well, I'd say two things. First of all, the number of managers who are not white males is certainly growing. A lot more white females are showing up in those jobs, a lot more minorities. And the ray of hope - the real ray of hope on all of this is that as the American customer base becomes more diverse, more and more owners of those businesses and more managers whose performance is judged, for instance, by sales to those groups are going to see that they have a real interest in trying to deal with this. And so hopefully they will have an incentive to overcome some of those negative stereotypes that they've walked into the room with. MARTIN: Harry Holzer is a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, currently a fellow at the Brookings Institution which is a research institute in Washington, D.C. Phillip Atiba Goff is the president of the Center for Policing Equity at UCLA and a visiting scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Thank you both so much for speaking with us.

I think employers, first of all, worry about weaker performance of black males relative to black women, relative to other groups. And if their performance is weaker, then along with that they might fear more quits, more discharges, needs to discipline employees. Then a second fear, I think, comes in. There's the fear of conflict, which can be verbal. It can be physical. It could be anything. And then finally - and I think this is a bit of an irony - EEO law. EEO stands for equal employment opportunity law which forbids discrimination in the workplace. It hasn't eliminated it, but it's reduced it. I think EEO law plays a funny role in all of this because most suits for discrimination in the workplace are for wrongful termination and wrongful denial of promotion, which means many small, white employers fear that if they have to discipline a black male employee and maybe even discharge them, that there's a bigger chance that they'll be sued for that than if they turn them away at the gate. MARTIN: (Unintelligible) that we heard from quite a few black men in our callout, including Leo Cunningham. He's an ordained minister in Columbus, Ohio, and he told us that he has personally experienced potential employers becoming cold to him - in this case, that would be churches - when they found out that he's black. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LEO CUNNINGHAM: To have someone look at you and say, your two master's degrees, your undergraduate degree, your previous experience - it doesn't matter if we as Christians think that you are called and ordained by God to be a pastoral leader. The color of your skin prohibits us from wanting to hear anything you have to say about God or our community. That's a gut punch. MARTIN: What about that, Professor Holzer? HOLZER: That's bias. That's bias and fear and perhaps fear of the unknown. And there are, in the background of this whole story, a troubling set of statistics that people keep in their heads - lower achievement among black males than almost any other group even if they have the same educational attainment, more behavioral problems in school, lower employment activity, more crime. Now, it's unfair for those facts to be applied to any particular individual, especially an individual with strong credentials. MARTIN: Professor Goff, what about you? What do you think? GOFF: Well, I mean, in terms of the labor economy, I think that when you get past counting - so diversity for so long has been about just making sure the numbers are right. But when you get past counting, it's not a done deal. You have to set up a workplace so that people feel safe in their identity, and that's not just a touchy-feely Kumbaya thing. It actually affects people's capacity to do their best. MARTIN: I was going to ask you about that. Why do you have to set up an environment where people feel safe in their identity? Some people would say, no I don't. I just have to set up an environment where people will get the job done. They get paid and go home. GOFF: That - right. I don't care about your identity. MARTIN: Yeah. GOFF: You do that on your own. You take that home with you.

It actually affects people's capacity to do their best. MARTIN: I was going to ask you about that. Why do you have to set up an environment where people feel safe in their identity? Some people would say, no I don't. I just have to set up an environment where people will get the job done. They get paid and go home. GOFF: That - right. I don't care about your identity. MARTIN: Yeah. GOFF: You do that on your own. You take that home with you. It turns out that that's not a very successful strategy for employers, for educators or anybody else who's interested in having a diverse team do well. And the reason is because we all walk around with concerns about how we're going to be evaluated. That's a human thing. There's - you're not paranoid or neurotic because you're thinking it. But people who come from groups that have stigmas about them - and we all do - when that stigma is relevant, then it can consume your ability to do anything else. So what then happens is they're spending time having to deal - having to negotiate with it, right? And that's time they're not spending focusing on the task. They're not able to do nearly as well, and part of the reason is 'cause the work environment feels hostile through no direct animus. No one's using racial epithets or using sexual slurs, and yet the environment ends up making people sort of focus on concerns about their identity to the exclusion of doing their work in an excellent way. MARTIN: Given, though, Professor Holzer, that most hiring managers, I think it's fair to say, are still white males, the question that comes up for me is are the right people invested in asking themselves these questions? HOLZER: Well, I'd say two things. First of all, the number of managers who are not white males is certainly growing. A lot more white females are showing up in those jobs, a lot more minorities. And the ray of hope - the real ray of hope on all of this is that as the American customer base becomes more diverse, more and more owners of those businesses and more managers whose performance is judged, for instance, by sales to those groups are going to see that they have a real interest in trying to deal with this. And so hopefully they will have an incentive to overcome some of those negative stereotypes that they've walked into the room with. MARTIN: Harry Holzer is a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, currently a fellow at the Brookings Institution which is a research institute in Washington, D.C. Phillip Atiba Goff is the president of the Center for Policing Equity at UCLA and a visiting scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Thank you both so much for speaking with us.

The color of your skin prohibits us from wanting to hear anything you have to say about God or our community. That's a gut punch. MARTIN: What about that, Professor Holzer? HOLZER: That's bias. That's bias and fear and perhaps fear of the unknown. And there are, in the background of this whole story, a troubling set of statistics that people keep in their heads - lower achievement among black males than almost any other group even if they have the same educational attainment, more behavioral problems in school, lower employment activity, more crime. Now, it's unfair for those facts to be applied to any particular individual, especially an individual with strong credentials. MARTIN: Professor Goff, what about you? What do you think?

MARTIN: Harry Holzer is a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, currently a fellow at the Brookings Institution which is a research institute in Washington, D.C. Phillip Atiba Goff is the president of the Center for Policing Equity at UCLA and a visiting scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Thank you both so much for speaking with us.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nGOFF: Well, I mean, in terms of the labor economy, I think that when you get past counting - so diversity for so long has been about just making sure the numbers are right. But when you get past counting, it's not a done deal. You have to set up a workplace so that people feel safe in their identity, and that's not just a touchy-feely Kumbaya thing. It actually affects people's capacity to do their best. MARTIN: I was going to ask you about that. Why do you have to set up an environment where people feel safe in their identity? Some people would say, no I don't. I just have to set up an environment where people will get the job done. They get paid and go home. GOFF: That - right. I don't care about your identity. MARTIN: Yeah. GOFF: You do that on your own. You take that home with you. It turns out that that's not a very successful strategy for employers, for educators or anybody else who's interested in having a diverse team do well. And the reason is because we all walk around with concerns about how we're going to be evaluated. That's a human thing. There's - you're not paranoid or neurotic because you're thinking it. But people who come from groups that have stigmas about them - and we all do - when that stigma is relevant, then it can consume your ability to do anything else. So what then happens is they're spending time having to deal - having to negotiate with it, right? And that's time they're not spending focusing on the task. They're not able to do nearly as well, and part of the reason is 'cause the work environment feels hostile through no direct animus. No one's using racial epithets or using sexual slurs, and yet the environment ends up making people sort of focus on concerns about their identity to the exclusion of doing their work in an excellent way. MARTIN: Given, though, Professor Holzer, that most hiring managers, I think it's fair to say, are still white males, the question that comes up for me is are the right people invested in asking themselves these questions? HOLZER: Well, I'd say two things. First of all, the number of managers who are not white males is certainly growing. A lot more white females are showing up in those jobs, a lot more minorities. And the ray of hope - the real ray of hope on all of this is that as the American customer base becomes more diverse, more and more owners of those businesses and more managers whose performance is judged, for instance, by sales to those groups are going to see that they have a real interest in trying to deal with this.

      "text": "Challenges Facing Young Black Men\n\nLeaders of this past weekend's Millions More Movement march urged action to tackle challenges facing young black men in America, including a rise in high school dropouts and incarceration. Two experts discuss the challenges and potential solutions: Nathan McCall, professor of journalism and African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, and Harry Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nED GORDON, host: From NPR News, this is NEWS & NOTES.  I'm Ed Gordon. The future for many young black males in America is not bright.  More      than any other group in this country, young black men face a greater rate      of imprisonment, a greater chance of being killed and a greater chance of      being unemployed.  For many young black men, life holds no opportunity      and the future holds no promise.  The fact is, they are living day to day      with very little expectation that life will get better and that the      limited conditions they know today are the conditions they will live with      for the rest of their lives. We're joined by two men who work with young black men and have done so      for years.  Nathan McCall, author of the best-selling book \"Makes Me      Wanna Holler.\"  He is a professor of journalism and African-American      studies at Emory University in Atlanta.  We're also joined by Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.      Mr. Edwards has written extensively on sports, family, race and ethnic      relations. Gentlemen, I thank you both for joining us.  Greatly appreciate it.  I      should note that I wanted to do this show after seeing a young black male      in Toledo during last week's riots.  And when being interviewed, he was      asked why he was out there accosting the police, helping to tear up his      own environment and neighborhood, and he said, `Look, for me, life's just      a game.  That's all it is, and then you die.' Nathan McCall, when you hear that--you've been dealing with young black      men for years.  Why are we at this point with so many black men in this      country? Professor NATHAN McCALL (Emory University):  Well, I think it's an      expression of the level of frustration that's out there and particularly      among young black men.  We're in a country where we constantly talk about      there being boundless opportunities if you play by the rules of the game,      and many young black men, in particular, just see that that's just not      true.  And, you know, so there's frustration out there because there is      the sense that there is a kind of hopelessness and a sense that we're      lost as a country.  And the ripple effect of the country being lost is      felt mostly, most profoundly, by young black men. GORDON:  Professor Edwards, how much of the problem can be laid at our      own doorstep?  Go ahead. Professor HARRY EDWARDS (University of California at Berkeley):  A great      deal of it can.  And the reality is that sometimes it occurs for the best      of intentions.  For example, we're not just talking about the decline in      institutions and so forth within the traditional black society, but we're      talking about the civil rights movement.  The civil rights movement was a      middle class-oriented, middle class-led movement and it was basically, in      the final analysis, about advancing beyond the traditional      African-American community.  So a lot of people were left behind.  Even      people who participated in the movement--they participated in it, they      saw in their newspapers, they saw on their TV sets, but they never saw it      in the streets of the African-American community.  These young men are      the children of the civil rights generation that was left behind.  So a      great deal of it can be laid at our doorstep, both in terms of      institutional deterioration as a result of the black middle-class creep,      if you will, onto and into the traditionally white institutions and as a      result of the civil rights movement really not targeting the masses in      the traditional black community and those communities for development. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, how did you make it out?  I mean, you wrote so      eloquently in your book, \"Makes Me Wanna Holler,\" and you talked about      all the conditions you had to deal with, what you had to overcome.  There      are many young men, for whatever reason, who are faltering and failing      and not overcoming. Prof. McCALL:  Well, you know, as you know, I ended up in prison.  And      again, I felt the same level, prior to then, of frustration and sense of      being lost that that young man expressed to you.  It was while in prison      that I began to read and think and try to figure out what had happened in      my life and in the lives of so many of the other guys that I saw around      me in prison that resulted in me being there.  And I became a serious      student of history to try to understand what had happened.  And after      reading and thinking very seriously about the country and the way that it      has evolved and the way that it has impacted my own life, I realized that      the best thing that I could do was nurture my mind and do--not cooperate      in my own destruction.  And so I came to the conclusion that if there was      a system out there working systematically toward destroying me, then the      worst thing that I could do was cooperate by being uneducated; cooperate      by not showing initiative.  And so it was still a sense of defiance that      led me to move in a different direction than I had moved in before. GORDON:  Harry Edwards, you come from a very interesting perspective, I      think, and it's that, for those that don't know, you deal with a lot of      professional athletes.  These are men of great means and great      opportunity, yet many of them still are plagued with the issues that      haunt so many of us.  What is it about being black and male in this      society that, even for those who have means and opportunity, have not      allowed us to step beyond some of the issues that, quite frankly, plague      many of us? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, the reality is that, individually, you can move up      and move through American society with some degree of fulfillment, but      unless those means of moving, unless that freedom of development is      broad-scale and institutionally established, not just within America more      generally but within African-American society with links and bridges to      the mainstream, then you're simply out there in the midst of a      tremendously developed, technologically sophisticated and literate white      mainstream with no supports.  And so a lot of these young men who come      out of the traditional black community, which has always developed the      overwhelming preponderance of black athletes--the black middle class does      not develop black athletes; they develop college professors, engineers      and so forth--they end up in the mainstream with no institutional      supports and very little functional knowledge about how to succeed,      develop, sustain themselves, protect themselves in the mainstream.  And      so many of them wind up taking the traditional black community mores,      folkways, understandings with them into the mainstream and they end up      having tremendous difficulties. A great deal of what I've done with professional athletes over the last      40 years has been to work with athletes in terms of making those kinds of      adjustments. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, let me ask you this.  We know individuals can      make it.  We have seen it happen, we've seen it in greater numbers over      the last decade in particular.  But what of the mass?  Do you believe      there's any way to make, if you will, a social intervention on black      males?  Because quite frankly, and we don't often like to say this in      public, but we drink too much, we smoke too much, we do drugs too often,      we kill each other too often. Can there be a social intervention en      masse? Prof. McCALL:  Well, I mean, I think there has to be.  And I think what      we're really talking about here is a leadership void that is becoming      more and more pronounced and apparent every day.  Young people typically      don't figure out for themselves how to proceed in life.  Young people      typically learn form leadership.  Leadership comes from our families,      they come from our social leaders, they come from the church.  And you      have to look at what has happened, particularly over the last 25 years in      our communities, to create a kind of leadership void. One of the things that has happened is that we've had administrations,      political administrations, who have promoted assimilationists, such as      Condoleezza Rice, Clarence Thomas, people who in some ways work against      the interests of black people and are put out there as leaders that black      people should emulate. The other thing is that much of our leadership historically has come from      the black church.  And the black church has been plagued recently by this      preponderance of prosperity preachers who lead congregations to focus      more on materialism than to focus on social activism. GORDON:  Harry, what's your thought on that, the idea of a mass      intervention, if you will?  I've been waiting for that leadership void to      be filled for a mighty long time.  Individually, I know we can do it, but      what about en masse? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, I think that's a very difficult challenge, for all      of the reasons just stated.  I think institutionally the traditional      black community has deteriorated to the point that there are those who      really wonder if we have the wherewithal to re-establish institutional      viability? Again, you look at these young black men--they don't belong to      the church. You go into black churches, what you essentially find are      older black people, mothers and their dependent children and a sprinkling      of black men.  And most of them, in many ways, are there for the very      reasons just stated.  It's an entrepreneurial bridge for them, how you      get rich. The important thing here is that without that institutional viability,      you have no hooks, you have no way organically of engaging the      African-American masses.  If you go back and look at even sport, that has      deteriorated.  And we have always had a tremendous emphasis on sports.      One of our major problems during the 1960s and '70s was an overemphasis.      But you go back and look, for example, at boxing. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  I remember in the 1960s, there was Ali, Joe Frazier,      Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Floyd Patterson, Ernie Terrell, Ernie      Chavez, Buster Mathias, Cleveland Williams, and there was a sparring      partner by the name of Larry Holmes who couldn't even get a shot. GORDON:  Right. Prof. EDWARDS:  He was just a sparring partner for all of them.  Who--I      defy anybody to name three or four top heavyweights today who could even      fit anywhere in that class. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  We've deteriorated to that point. GORDON:  All right... Prof. McCALL:  Well, but, more importantly... GORDON:  Nathan, unfortunately, I got to hold you there. Prof. McCALL:  OK. GORDON:  I'm up against the clock.  But, listen, I appreciate and admire      the work of both of you.  Nathan McCall, professor of journalism and      African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, and Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.      Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  I appreciate it, fellows. Prof. EDWARDS:  Thank you. Prof. McCALL:  All right.  You're welcome. GORDON:  This is NPR News. Copyright © 2005 NPR.

One of the things that has happened is that we've had administrations,      political administrations, who have promoted assimilationists, such as      Condoleezza Rice, Clarence Thomas, people who in some ways work against      the interests of black people and are put out there as leaders that black      people should emulate. The other thing is that much of our leadership historically has come from      the black church.  And the black church has been plagued recently by this      preponderance of prosperity preachers who lead congregations to focus      more on materialism than to focus on social activism. GORDON:  Harry, what's your thought on that, the idea of a mass      intervention, if you will?  I've been waiting for that leadership void to      be filled for a mighty long time.  Individually, I know we can do it, but      what about en masse? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, I think that's a very difficult challenge, for all      of the reasons just stated.  I think institutionally the traditional      black community has deteriorated to the point that there are those who      really wonder if we have the wherewithal to re-establish institutional      viability? Again, you look at these young black men--they don't belong to      the church. You go into black churches, what you essentially find are      older black people, mothers and their dependent children and a sprinkling      of black men.  And most of them, in many ways, are there for the very      reasons just stated.  It's an entrepreneurial bridge for them, how you      get rich. The important thing here is that without that institutional viability,      you have no hooks, you have no way organically of engaging the      African-American masses.  If you go back and look at even sport, that has      deteriorated.  And we have always had a tremendous emphasis on sports.      One of our major problems during the 1960s and '70s was an overemphasis.      But you go back and look, for example, at boxing. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  I remember in the 1960s, there was Ali, Joe Frazier,      Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Floyd Patterson, Ernie Terrell, Ernie      Chavez, Buster Mathias, Cleveland Williams, and there was a sparring      partner by the name of Larry Holmes who couldn't even get a shot. GORDON:  Right. Prof. EDWARDS:  He was just a sparring partner for all of them.  Who--I      defy anybody to name three or four top heavyweights today who could even      fit anywhere in that class. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  We've deteriorated to that point. GORDON:  All right... Prof. McCALL:  Well, but, more importantly... GORDON:  Nathan, unfortunately, I got to hold you there. Prof. McCALL:  OK. GORDON:  I'm up against the clock.  But, listen, I appreciate and admire      the work of both of you.  Nathan McCall, professor of journalism and      African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, and Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.

More      than any other group in this country, young black men face a greater rate      of imprisonment, a greater chance of being killed and a greater chance of      being unemployed.  For many young black men, life holds no opportunity      and the future holds no promise.  The fact is, they are living day to day      with very little expectation that life will get better and that the      limited conditions they know today are the conditions they will live with      for the rest of their lives. We're joined by two men who work with young black men and have done so      for years.  Nathan McCall, author of the best-selling book \"Makes Me      Wanna Holler.\"  He is a professor of journalism and African-American      studies at Emory University in Atlanta.  We're also joined by Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.      Mr. Edwards has written extensively on sports, family, race and ethnic      relations. Gentlemen, I thank you both for joining us.  Greatly appreciate it.  I      should note that I wanted to do this show after seeing a young black male      in Toledo during last week's riots.  And when being interviewed, he was      asked why he was out there accosting the police, helping to tear up his      own environment and neighborhood, and he said, `Look, for me, life's just      a game.  That's all it is, and then you die.' Nathan McCall, when you hear that--you've been dealing with young black      men for years.  Why are we at this point with so many black men in this      country? Professor NATHAN McCALL (Emory University):  Well, I think it's an      expression of the level of frustration that's out there and particularly      among young black men.  We're in a country where we constantly talk about      there being boundless opportunities if you play by the rules of the game,      and many young black men, in particular, just see that that's just not      true.  And, you know, so there's frustration out there because there is      the sense that there is a kind of hopelessness and a sense that we're      lost as a country.  And the ripple effect of the country being lost is      felt mostly, most profoundly, by young black men. GORDON:  Professor Edwards, how much of the problem can be laid at our      own doorstep?  Go ahead. Professor HARRY EDWARDS (University of California at Berkeley):  A great      deal of it can.  And the reality is that sometimes it occurs for the best      of intentions.  For example, we're not just talking about the decline in      institutions and so forth within the traditional black society, but we're      talking about the civil rights movement.  The civil rights movement was a      middle class-oriented, middle class-led movement and it was basically, in      the final analysis, about advancing beyond the traditional      African-American community.  So a lot of people were left behind.  Even      people who participated in the movement--they participated in it, they      saw in their newspapers, they saw on their TV sets, but they never saw it      in the streets of the African-American community.  These young men are      the children of the civil rights generation that was left behind.  So a      great deal of it can be laid at our doorstep, both in terms of      institutional deterioration as a result of the black middle-class creep,      if you will, onto and into the traditionally white institutions and as a      result of the civil rights movement really not targeting the masses in      the traditional black community and those communities for development. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, how did you make it out?  I mean, you wrote so      eloquently in your book, \"Makes Me Wanna Holler,\" and you talked about      all the conditions you had to deal with, what you had to overcome.  There      are many young men, for whatever reason, who are faltering and failing      and not overcoming. Prof. McCALL:  Well, you know, as you know, I ended up in prison.  And      again, I felt the same level, prior to then, of frustration and sense of      being lost that that young man expressed to you.  It was while in prison      that I began to read and think and try to figure out what had happened in      my life and in the lives of so many of the other guys that I saw around      me in prison that resulted in me being there.  And I became a serious      student of history to try to understand what had happened.  And after      reading and thinking very seriously about the country and the way that it      has evolved and the way that it has impacted my own life, I realized that      the best thing that I could do was nurture my mind and do--not cooperate      in my own destruction.  And so I came to the conclusion that if there was      a system out there working systematically toward destroying me, then the      worst thing that I could do was cooperate by being uneducated; cooperate      by not showing initiative.  And so it was still a sense of defiance that      led me to move in a different direction than I had moved in before. GORDON:  Harry Edwards, you come from a very interesting perspective, I      think, and it's that, for those that don't know, you deal with a lot of      professional athletes.  These are men of great means and great      opportunity, yet many of them still are plagued with the issues that      haunt so many of us.  What is it about being black and male in this      society that, even for those who have means and opportunity, have not      allowed us to step beyond some of the issues that, quite frankly, plague      many of us? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, the reality is that, individually, you can move up      and move through American society with some degree of fulfillment, but      unless those means of moving, unless that freedom of development is      broad-scale and institutionally established, not just within America more      generally but within African-American society with links and bridges to      the mainstream, then you're simply out there in the midst of a      tremendously developed, technologically sophisticated and literate white      mainstream with no supports.  And so a lot of these young men who come      out of the traditional black community, which has always developed the      overwhelming preponderance of black athletes--the black middle class does      not develop black athletes; they develop college professors, engineers      and so forth--they end up in the mainstream with no institutional      supports and very little functional knowledge about how to succeed,      develop, sustain themselves, protect themselves in the mainstream.  And      so many of them wind up taking the traditional black community mores,      folkways, understandings with them into the mainstream and they end up      having tremendous difficulties. A great deal of what I've done with professional athletes over the last      40 years has been to work with athletes in terms of making those kinds of      adjustments. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, let me ask you this.  We know individuals can      make it.  We have seen it happen, we've seen it in greater numbers over      the last decade in particular.  But what of the mass?  Do you believe      there's any way to make, if you will, a social intervention on black      males?  Because quite frankly, and we don't often like to say this in      public, but we drink too much, we smoke too much, we do drugs too often,      we kill each other too often. Can there be a social intervention en      masse? Prof. McCALL:  Well, I mean, I think there has to be.  And I think what      we're really talking about here is a leadership void that is becoming      more and more pronounced and apparent every day.  Young people typically      don't figure out for themselves how to proceed in life.  Young people      typically learn form leadership.  Leadership comes from our families,      they come from our social leaders, they come from the church.  And you      have to look at what has happened, particularly over the last 25 years in      our communities, to create a kind of leadership void. One of the things that has happened is that we've had administrations,      political administrations, who have promoted assimilationists, such as      Condoleezza Rice, Clarence Thomas, people who in some ways work against      the interests of black people and are put out there as leaders that black      people should emulate. The other thing is that much of our leadership historically has come from      the black church.  And the black church has been plagued recently by this      preponderance of prosperity preachers who lead congregations to focus      more on materialism than to focus on social activism. GORDON:  Harry, what's your thought on that, the idea of a mass      intervention, if you will?  I've been waiting for that leadership void to      be filled for a mighty long time.  Individually, I know we can do it, but      what about en masse? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, I think that's a very difficult challenge, for all      of the reasons just stated.  I think institutionally the traditional      black community has deteriorated to the point that there are those who      really wonder if we have the wherewithal to re-establish institutional      viability? Again, you look at these young black men--they don't belong to      the church. You go into black churches, what you essentially find are      older black people, mothers and their dependent children and a sprinkling      of black men.  And most of them, in many ways, are there for the very      reasons just stated.  It's an entrepreneurial bridge for them, how you      get rich. The important thing here is that without that institutional viability,      you have no hooks, you have no way organically of engaging the      African-American masses.  If you go back and look at even sport, that has      deteriorated.  And we have always had a tremendous emphasis on sports.

Prof. EDWARDS:  I remember in the 1960s, there was Ali, Joe Frazier,      Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Floyd Patterson, Ernie Terrell, Ernie      Chavez, Buster Mathias, Cleveland Williams, and there was a sparring      partner by the name of Larry Holmes who couldn't even get a shot. GORDON:  Right. Prof. EDWARDS:  He was just a sparring partner for all of them.  Who--I      defy anybody to name three or four top heavyweights today who could even      fit anywhere in that class. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  We've deteriorated to that point. GORDON:  All right... Prof. McCALL:  Well, but, more importantly... GORDON:  Nathan, unfortunately, I got to hold you there.

And the ripple effect of the country being lost is      felt mostly, most profoundly, by young black men. GORDON:  Professor Edwards, how much of the problem can be laid at our      own doorstep?  Go ahead. Professor HARRY EDWARDS (University of California at Berkeley):  A great      deal of it can.  And the reality is that sometimes it occurs for the best      of intentions.  For example, we're not just talking about the decline in      institutions and so forth within the traditional black society, but we're      talking about the civil rights movement.  The civil rights movement was a      middle class-oriented, middle class-led movement and it was basically, in      the final analysis, about advancing beyond the traditional      African-American community.  So a lot of people were left behind.  Even      people who participated in the movement--they participated in it, they      saw in their newspapers, they saw on their TV sets, but they never saw it      in the streets of the African-American community.  These young men are      the children of the civil rights generation that was left behind.  So a      great deal of it can be laid at our doorstep, both in terms of      institutional deterioration as a result of the black middle-class creep,      if you will, onto and into the traditionally white institutions and as a      result of the civil rights movement really not targeting the masses in      the traditional black community and those communities for development. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, how did you make it out?  I mean, you wrote so      eloquently in your book, \"Makes Me Wanna Holler,\" and you talked about      all the conditions you had to deal with, what you had to overcome.  There      are many young men, for whatever reason, who are faltering and failing      and not overcoming. Prof. McCALL:  Well, you know, as you know, I ended up in prison.  And      again, I felt the same level, prior to then, of frustration and sense of      being lost that that young man expressed to you.  It was while in prison      that I began to read and think and try to figure out what had happened in      my life and in the lives of so many of the other guys that I saw around      me in prison that resulted in me being there.  And I became a serious      student of history to try to understand what had happened.  And after      reading and thinking very seriously about the country and the way that it      has evolved and the way that it has impacted my own life, I realized that      the best thing that I could do was nurture my mind and do--not cooperate      in my own destruction.  And so I came to the conclusion that if there was      a system out there working systematically toward destroying me, then the      worst thing that I could do was cooperate by being uneducated; cooperate      by not showing initiative.  And so it was still a sense of defiance that      led me to move in a different direction than I had moved in before. GORDON:  Harry Edwards, you come from a very interesting perspective, I      think, and it's that, for those that don't know, you deal with a lot of      professional athletes.  These are men of great means and great      opportunity, yet many of them still are plagued with the issues that      haunt so many of us.  What is it about being black and male in this      society that, even for those who have means and opportunity, have not      allowed us to step beyond some of the issues that, quite frankly, plague      many of us? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, the reality is that, individually, you can move up      and move through American society with some degree of fulfillment, but      unless those means of moving, unless that freedom of development is      broad-scale and institutionally established, not just within America more      generally but within African-American society with links and bridges to      the mainstream, then you're simply out there in the midst of a      tremendously developed, technologically sophisticated and literate white      mainstream with no supports.  And so a lot of these young men who come      out of the traditional black community, which has always developed the      overwhelming preponderance of black athletes--the black middle class does      not develop black athletes; they develop college professors, engineers      and so forth--they end up in the mainstream with no institutional      supports and very little functional knowledge about how to succeed,      develop, sustain themselves, protect themselves in the mainstream.  And      so many of them wind up taking the traditional black community mores,      folkways, understandings with them into the mainstream and they end up      having tremendous difficulties. A great deal of what I've done with professional athletes over the last      40 years has been to work with athletes in terms of making those kinds of      adjustments. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, let me ask you this.  We know individuals can      make it.  We have seen it happen, we've seen it in greater numbers over      the last decade in particular.  But what of the mass?  Do you believe      there's any way to make, if you will, a social intervention on black      males?  Because quite frankly, and we don't often like to say this in      public, but we drink too much, we smoke too much, we do drugs too often,      we kill each other too often. Can there be a social intervention en      masse? Prof. McCALL:  Well, I mean, I think there has to be.  And I think what      we're really talking about here is a leadership void that is becoming      more and more pronounced and apparent every day.  Young people typically      don't figure out for themselves how to proceed in life.  Young people      typically learn form leadership.  Leadership comes from our families,      they come from our social leaders, they come from the church.  And you      have to look at what has happened, particularly over the last 25 years in      our communities, to create a kind of leadership void. One of the things that has happened is that we've had administrations,      political administrations, who have promoted assimilationists, such as      Condoleezza Rice, Clarence Thomas, people who in some ways work against      the interests of black people and are put out there as leaders that black      people should emulate. The other thing is that much of our leadership historically has come from      the black church.  And the black church has been plagued recently by this      preponderance of prosperity preachers who lead congregations to focus      more on materialism than to focus on social activism. GORDON:  Harry, what's your thought on that, the idea of a mass      intervention, if you will?  I've been waiting for that leadership void to      be filled for a mighty long time.  Individually, I know we can do it, but      what about en masse? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, I think that's a very difficult challenge, for all      of the reasons just stated.  I think institutionally the traditional      black community has deteriorated to the point that there are those who      really wonder if we have the wherewithal to re-establish institutional      viability? Again, you look at these young black men--they don't belong to      the church. You go into black churches, what you essentially find are      older black people, mothers and their dependent children and a sprinkling      of black men.  And most of them, in many ways, are there for the very      reasons just stated.  It's an entrepreneurial bridge for them, how you      get rich. The important thing here is that without that institutional viability,      you have no hooks, you have no way organically of engaging the      African-American masses.  If you go back and look at even sport, that has      deteriorated.  And we have always had a tremendous emphasis on sports.      One of our major problems during the 1960s and '70s was an overemphasis.      But you go back and look, for example, at boxing. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  I remember in the 1960s, there was Ali, Joe Frazier,      Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Floyd Patterson, Ernie Terrell, Ernie      Chavez, Buster Mathias, Cleveland Williams, and there was a sparring      partner by the name of Larry Holmes who couldn't even get a shot. GORDON:  Right. Prof. EDWARDS:  He was just a sparring partner for all of them.  Who--I      defy anybody to name three or four top heavyweights today who could even      fit anywhere in that class. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  We've deteriorated to that point. GORDON:  All right... Prof. McCALL:  Well, but, more importantly... GORDON:  Nathan, unfortunately, I got to hold you there. Prof. McCALL:  OK. GORDON:  I'm up against the clock.  But, listen, I appreciate and admire      the work of both of you.  Nathan McCall, professor of journalism and      African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, and Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.      Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  I appreciate it, fellows. Prof. EDWARDS:  Thank you. Prof. McCALL:  All right.  You're welcome. GORDON:  This is NPR News. Copyright © 2005 NPR.

More      than any other group in this country, young black men face a greater rate      of imprisonment, a greater chance of being killed and a greater chance of      being unemployed.  For many young black men, life holds no opportunity      and the future holds no promise.  The fact is, they are living day to day      with very little expectation that life will get better and that the      limited conditions they know today are the conditions they will live with      for the rest of their lives. We're joined by two men who work with young black men and have done so      for years.  Nathan McCall, author of the best-selling book \"Makes Me      Wanna Holler.\"  He is a professor of journalism and African-American      studies at Emory University in Atlanta.  We're also joined by Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.      Mr. Edwards has written extensively on sports, family, race and ethnic      relations. Gentlemen, I thank you both for joining us.  Greatly appreciate it.  I      should note that I wanted to do this show after seeing a young black male      in Toledo during last week's riots.  And when being interviewed, he was      asked why he was out there accosting the police, helping to tear up his      own environment and neighborhood, and he said, `Look, for me, life's just      a game.  That's all it is, and then you die.' Nathan McCall, when you hear that--you've been dealing with young black      men for years.  Why are we at this point with so many black men in this      country? Professor NATHAN McCALL (Emory University):  Well, I think it's an      expression of the level of frustration that's out there and particularly      among young black men.  We're in a country where we constantly talk about      there being boundless opportunities if you play by the rules of the game,      and many young black men, in particular, just see that that's just not      true.  And, you know, so there's frustration out there because there is      the sense that there is a kind of hopelessness and a sense that we're      lost as a country.  And the ripple effect of the country being lost is      felt mostly, most profoundly, by young black men. GORDON:  Professor Edwards, how much of the problem can be laid at our      own doorstep?

And      so many of them wind up taking the traditional black community mores,      folkways, understandings with them into the mainstream and they end up      having tremendous difficulties.

GORDON:  Harry, what's your thought on that, the idea of a mass      intervention, if you will?  I've been waiting for that leadership void to      be filled for a mighty long time.  Individually, I know we can do it, but      what about en masse? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, I think that's a very difficult challenge, for all      of the reasons just stated.  I think institutionally the traditional      black community has deteriorated to the point that there are those who      really wonder if we have the wherewithal to re-establish institutional      viability? Again, you look at these young black men--they don't belong to      the church. You go into black churches, what you essentially find are      older black people, mothers and their dependent children and a sprinkling      of black men.  And most of them, in many ways, are there for the very      reasons just stated.  It's an entrepreneurial bridge for them, how you      get rich. The important thing here is that without that institutional viability,      you have no hooks, you have no way organically of engaging the      African-American masses.  If you go back and look at even sport, that has      deteriorated.  And we have always had a tremendous emphasis on sports.      One of our major problems during the 1960s and '70s was an overemphasis.      But you go back and look, for example, at boxing. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  I remember in the 1960s, there was Ali, Joe Frazier,      Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Floyd Patterson, Ernie Terrell, Ernie      Chavez, Buster Mathias, Cleveland Williams, and there was a sparring      partner by the name of Larry Holmes who couldn't even get a shot. GORDON:  Right. Prof. EDWARDS:  He was just a sparring partner for all of them.  Who--I      defy anybody to name three or four top heavyweights today who could even      fit anywhere in that class. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  We've deteriorated to that point. GORDON:  All right... Prof. McCALL:  Well, but, more importantly... GORDON:  Nathan, unfortunately, I got to hold you there. Prof. McCALL:  OK. GORDON:  I'm up against the clock.  But, listen, I appreciate and admire      the work of both of you.  Nathan McCall, professor of journalism and      African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, and Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.      Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  I appreciate it, fellows. Prof. EDWARDS:  Thank you. Prof. McCALL:  All right.  You're welcome. GORDON:  This is NPR News. Copyright © 2005 NPR.

Nathan McCall, author of the best-selling book \"Makes Me      Wanna Holler.\"  He is a professor of journalism and African-American      studies at Emory University in Atlanta.  We're also joined by Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.      Mr. Edwards has written extensively on sports, family, race and ethnic      relations. Gentlemen, I thank you both for joining us.  Greatly appreciate it.  I      should note that I wanted to do this show after seeing a young black male      in Toledo during last week's riots.  And when being interviewed, he was      asked why he was out there accosting the police, helping to tear up his      own environment and neighborhood, and he said, `Look, for me, life's just      a game.  That's all it is, and then you die.' Nathan McCall, when you hear that--you've been dealing with young black      men for years.  Why are we at this point with so many black men in this      country? Professor NATHAN McCALL (Emory University):  Well, I think it's an      expression of the level of frustration that's out there and particularly      among young black men.  We're in a country where we constantly talk about      there being boundless opportunities if you play by the rules of the game,      and many young black men, in particular, just see that that's just not      true.  And, you know, so there's frustration out there because there is      the sense that there is a kind of hopelessness and a sense that we're      lost as a country.  And the ripple effect of the country being lost is      felt mostly, most profoundly, by young black men. GORDON:  Professor Edwards, how much of the problem can be laid at our      own doorstep?  Go ahead. Professor HARRY EDWARDS (University of California at Berkeley):  A great      deal of it can.  And the reality is that sometimes it occurs for the best      of intentions.  For example, we're not just talking about the decline in      institutions and so forth within the traditional black society, but we're      talking about the civil rights movement.  The civil rights movement was a      middle class-oriented, middle class-led movement and it was basically, in      the final analysis, about advancing beyond the traditional      African-American community.  So a lot of people were left behind.  Even      people who participated in the movement--they participated in it, they      saw in their newspapers, they saw on their TV sets, but they never saw it      in the streets of the African-American community.  These young men are      the children of the civil rights generation that was left behind.  So a      great deal of it can be laid at our doorstep, both in terms of      institutional deterioration as a result of the black middle-class creep,      if you will, onto and into the traditionally white institutions and as a      result of the civil rights movement really not targeting the masses in      the traditional black community and those communities for development. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, how did you make it out?  I mean, you wrote so      eloquently in your book, \"Makes Me Wanna Holler,\" and you talked about      all the conditions you had to deal with, what you had to overcome.  There      are many young men, for whatever reason, who are faltering and failing      and not overcoming. Prof. McCALL:  Well, you know, as you know, I ended up in prison.  And      again, I felt the same level, prior to then, of frustration and sense of      being lost that that young man expressed to you.  It was while in prison      that I began to read and think and try to figure out what had happened in      my life and in the lives of so many of the other guys that I saw around      me in prison that resulted in me being there.  And I became a serious      student of history to try to understand what had happened.  And after      reading and thinking very seriously about the country and the way that it      has evolved and the way that it has impacted my own life, I realized that      the best thing that I could do was nurture my mind and do--not cooperate      in my own destruction.  And so I came to the conclusion that if there was      a system out there working systematically toward destroying me, then the      worst thing that I could do was cooperate by being uneducated; cooperate      by not showing initiative.  And so it was still a sense of defiance that      led me to move in a different direction than I had moved in before. GORDON:  Harry Edwards, you come from a very interesting perspective, I      think, and it's that, for those that don't know, you deal with a lot of      professional athletes.  These are men of great means and great      opportunity, yet many of them still are plagued with the issues that      haunt so many of us.  What is it about being black and male in this      society that, even for those who have means and opportunity, have not      allowed us to step beyond some of the issues that, quite frankly, plague      many of us? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, the reality is that, individually, you can move up      and move through American society with some degree of fulfillment, but      unless those means of moving, unless that freedom of development is      broad-scale and institutionally established, not just within America more      generally but within African-American society with links and bridges to      the mainstream, then you're simply out there in the midst of a      tremendously developed, technologically sophisticated and literate white      mainstream with no supports.  And so a lot of these young men who come      out of the traditional black community, which has always developed the      overwhelming preponderance of black athletes--the black middle class does      not develop black athletes; they develop college professors, engineers      and so forth--they end up in the mainstream with no institutional      supports and very little functional knowledge about how to succeed,      develop, sustain themselves, protect themselves in the mainstream.  And      so many of them wind up taking the traditional black community mores,      folkways, understandings with them into the mainstream and they end up      having tremendous difficulties. A great deal of what I've done with professional athletes over the last      40 years has been to work with athletes in terms of making those kinds of      adjustments. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, let me ask you this.  We know individuals can      make it.  We have seen it happen, we've seen it in greater numbers over      the last decade in particular.  But what of the mass?  Do you believe      there's any way to make, if you will, a social intervention on black      males?  Because quite frankly, and we don't often like to say this in      public, but we drink too much, we smoke too much, we do drugs too often,      we kill each other too often. Can there be a social intervention en      masse? Prof. McCALL:  Well, I mean, I think there has to be.  And I think what      we're really talking about here is a leadership void that is becoming      more and more pronounced and apparent every day.  Young people typically      don't figure out for themselves how to proceed in life.  Young people      typically learn form leadership.  Leadership comes from our families,      they come from our social leaders, they come from the church.  And you      have to look at what has happened, particularly over the last 25 years in      our communities, to create a kind of leadership void. One of the things that has happened is that we've had administrations,      political administrations, who have promoted assimilationists, such as      Condoleezza Rice, Clarence Thomas, people who in some ways work against      the interests of black people and are put out there as leaders that black      people should emulate. The other thing is that much of our leadership historically has come from      the black church.  And the black church has been plagued recently by this      preponderance of prosperity preachers who lead congregations to focus      more on materialism than to focus on social activism. GORDON:  Harry, what's your thought on that, the idea of a mass      intervention, if you will?  I've been waiting for that leadership void to      be filled for a mighty long time.

I think institutionally the traditional      black community has deteriorated to the point that there are those who      really wonder if we have the wherewithal to re-establish institutional      viability? Again, you look at these young black men--they don't belong to      the church. You go into black churches, what you essentially find are      older black people, mothers and their dependent children and a sprinkling      of black men.  And most of them, in many ways, are there for the very      reasons just stated.  It's an entrepreneurial bridge for them, how you      get rich. The important thing here is that without that institutional viability,      you have no hooks, you have no way organically of engaging the      African-American masses.

What is it about being black and male in this      society that, even for those who have means and opportunity, have not      allowed us to step beyond some of the issues that, quite frankly, plague      many of us? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, the reality is that, individually, you can move up      and move through American society with some degree of fulfillment, but      unless those means of moving, unless that freedom of development is      broad-scale and institutionally established, not just within America more      generally but within African-American society with links and bridges to      the mainstream, then you're simply out there in the midst of a      tremendously developed, technologically sophisticated and literate white      mainstream with no supports.  And so a lot of these young men who come      out of the traditional black community, which has always developed the      overwhelming preponderance of black athletes--the black middle class does      not develop black athletes; they develop college professors, engineers      and so forth--they end up in the mainstream with no institutional      supports and very little functional knowledge about how to succeed,      develop, sustain themselves, protect themselves in the mainstream.  And      so many of them wind up taking the traditional black community mores,      folkways, understandings with them into the mainstream and they end up      having tremendous difficulties. A great deal of what I've done with professional athletes over the last      40 years has been to work with athletes in terms of making those kinds of      adjustments. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, let me ask you this.  We know individuals can      make it.  We have seen it happen, we've seen it in greater numbers over      the last decade in particular.  But what of the mass?  Do you believe      there's any way to make, if you will, a social intervention on black      males?  Because quite frankly, and we don't often like to say this in      public, but we drink too much, we smoke too much, we do drugs too often,      we kill each other too often. Can there be a social intervention en      masse? Prof. McCALL:  Well, I mean, I think there has to be.  And I think what      we're really talking about here is a leadership void that is becoming      more and more pronounced and apparent every day.  Young people typically      don't figure out for themselves how to proceed in life.  Young people      typically learn form leadership.  Leadership comes from our families,      they come from our social leaders, they come from the church.  And you      have to look at what has happened, particularly over the last 25 years in      our communities, to create a kind of leadership void. One of the things that has happened is that we've had administrations,      political administrations, who have promoted assimilationists, such as      Condoleezza Rice, Clarence Thomas, people who in some ways work against      the interests of black people and are put out there as leaders that black      people should emulate. The other thing is that much of our leadership historically has come from      the black church.  And the black church has been plagued recently by this      preponderance of prosperity preachers who lead congregations to focus      more on materialism than to focus on social activism. GORDON:  Harry, what's your thought on that, the idea of a mass      intervention, if you will?  I've been waiting for that leadership void to      be filled for a mighty long time.  Individually, I know we can do it, but      what about en masse? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, I think that's a very difficult challenge, for all      of the reasons just stated.  I think institutionally the traditional      black community has deteriorated to the point that there are those who      really wonder if we have the wherewithal to re-establish institutional      viability? Again, you look at these young black men--they don't belong to      the church. You go into black churches, what you essentially find are      older black people, mothers and their dependent children and a sprinkling      of black men.  And most of them, in many ways, are there for the very      reasons just stated.  It's an entrepreneurial bridge for them, how you      get rich. The important thing here is that without that institutional viability,      you have no hooks, you have no way organically of engaging the      African-American masses.  If you go back and look at even sport, that has      deteriorated.  And we have always had a tremendous emphasis on sports.      One of our major problems during the 1960s and '70s was an overemphasis.      But you go back and look, for example, at boxing. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  I remember in the 1960s, there was Ali, Joe Frazier,      Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Floyd Patterson, Ernie Terrell, Ernie      Chavez, Buster Mathias, Cleveland Williams, and there was a sparring      partner by the name of Larry Holmes who couldn't even get a shot. GORDON:  Right. Prof. EDWARDS:  He was just a sparring partner for all of them.  Who--I      defy anybody to name three or four top heavyweights today who could even      fit anywhere in that class. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  We've deteriorated to that point. GORDON:  All right... Prof. McCALL:  Well, but, more importantly... GORDON:  Nathan, unfortunately, I got to hold you there. Prof. McCALL:  OK. GORDON:  I'm up against the clock.  But, listen, I appreciate and admire      the work of both of you.  Nathan McCall, professor of journalism and      African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, and Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.      Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  I appreciate it, fellows. Prof. EDWARDS:  Thank you. Prof. McCALL:  All right.  You're welcome. GORDON:  This is NPR News. Copyright © 2005 NPR.

Why are we at this point with so many black men in this      country? Professor NATHAN McCALL (Emory University):  Well, I think it's an      expression of the level of frustration that's out there and particularly      among young black men.  We're in a country where we constantly talk about      there being boundless opportunities if you play by the rules of the game,      and many young black men, in particular, just see that that's just not      true.  And, you know, so there's frustration out there because there is      the sense that there is a kind of hopelessness and a sense that we're      lost as a country.  And the ripple effect of the country being lost is      felt mostly, most profoundly, by young black men. GORDON:  Professor Edwards, how much of the problem can be laid at our      own doorstep?  Go ahead. Professor HARRY EDWARDS (University of California at Berkeley):  A great      deal of it can.  And the reality is that sometimes it occurs for the best      of intentions.  For example, we're not just talking about the decline in      institutions and so forth within the traditional black society, but we're      talking about the civil rights movement.  The civil rights movement was a      middle class-oriented, middle class-led movement and it was basically, in      the final analysis, about advancing beyond the traditional      African-American community.  So a lot of people were left behind.  Even      people who participated in the movement--they participated in it, they      saw in their newspapers, they saw on their TV sets, but they never saw it      in the streets of the African-American community.  These young men are      the children of the civil rights generation that was left behind.  So a      great deal of it can be laid at our doorstep, both in terms of      institutional deterioration as a result of the black middle-class creep,      if you will, onto and into the traditionally white institutions and as a      result of the civil rights movement really not targeting the masses in      the traditional black community and those communities for development. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, how did you make it out?  I mean, you wrote so      eloquently in your book, \"Makes Me Wanna Holler,\" and you talked about      all the conditions you had to deal with, what you had to overcome.  There      are many young men, for whatever reason, who are faltering and failing      and not overcoming. Prof. McCALL:  Well, you know, as you know, I ended up in prison.  And      again, I felt the same level, prior to then, of frustration and sense of      being lost that that young man expressed to you.  It was while in prison      that I began to read and think and try to figure out what had happened in      my life and in the lives of so many of the other guys that I saw around      me in prison that resulted in me being there.  And I became a serious      student of history to try to understand what had happened.  And after      reading and thinking very seriously about the country and the way that it      has evolved and the way that it has impacted my own life, I realized that      the best thing that I could do was nurture my mind and do--not cooperate      in my own destruction.  And so I came to the conclusion that if there was      a system out there working systematically toward destroying me, then the      worst thing that I could do was cooperate by being uneducated; cooperate      by not showing initiative.  And so it was still a sense of defiance that      led me to move in a different direction than I had moved in before. GORDON:  Harry Edwards, you come from a very interesting perspective, I      think, and it's that, for those that don't know, you deal with a lot of      professional athletes.  These are men of great means and great      opportunity, yet many of them still are plagued with the issues that      haunt so many of us.

It was while in prison      that I began to read and think and try to figure out what had happened in      my life and in the lives of so many of the other guys that I saw around      me in prison that resulted in me being there.  And I became a serious      student of history to try to understand what had happened.  And after      reading and thinking very seriously about the country and the way that it      has evolved and the way that it has impacted my own life, I realized that      the best thing that I could do was nurture my mind and do--not cooperate      in my own destruction.  And so I came to the conclusion that if there was      a system out there working systematically toward destroying me, then the      worst thing that I could do was cooperate by being uneducated; cooperate      by not showing initiative.  And so it was still a sense of defiance that      led me to move in a different direction than I had moved in before. GORDON:  Harry Edwards, you come from a very interesting perspective, I      think, and it's that, for those that don't know, you deal with a lot of      professional athletes.  These are men of great means and great      opportunity, yet many of them still are plagued with the issues that      haunt so many of us.  What is it about being black and male in this      society that, even for those who have means and opportunity, have not      allowed us to step beyond some of the issues that, quite frankly, plague      many of us? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, the reality is that, individually, you can move up      and move through American society with some degree of fulfillment, but      unless those means of moving, unless that freedom of development is      broad-scale and institutionally established, not just within America more      generally but within African-American society with links and bridges to      the mainstream, then you're simply out there in the midst of a      tremendously developed, technologically sophisticated and literate white      mainstream with no supports.  And so a lot of these young men who come      out of the traditional black community, which has always developed the      overwhelming preponderance of black athletes--the black middle class does      not develop black athletes; they develop college professors, engineers      and so forth--they end up in the mainstream with no institutional      supports and very little functional knowledge about how to succeed,      develop, sustain themselves, protect themselves in the mainstream.  And      so many of them wind up taking the traditional black community mores,      folkways, understandings with them into the mainstream and they end up      having tremendous difficulties. A great deal of what I've done with professional athletes over the last      40 years has been to work with athletes in terms of making those kinds of      adjustments. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, let me ask you this.  We know individuals can      make it.  We have seen it happen, we've seen it in greater numbers over      the last decade in particular.  But what of the mass?  Do you believe      there's any way to make, if you will, a social intervention on black      males?  Because quite frankly, and we don't often like to say this in      public, but we drink too much, we smoke too much, we do drugs too often,      we kill each other too often. Can there be a social intervention en      masse? Prof. McCALL:  Well, I mean, I think there has to be.  And I think what      we're really talking about here is a leadership void that is becoming      more and more pronounced and apparent every day.  Young people typically      don't figure out for themselves how to proceed in life.  Young people      typically learn form leadership.  Leadership comes from our families,      they come from our social leaders, they come from the church.  And you      have to look at what has happened, particularly over the last 25 years in      our communities, to create a kind of leadership void. One of the things that has happened is that we've had administrations,      political administrations, who have promoted assimilationists, such as      Condoleezza Rice, Clarence Thomas, people who in some ways work against      the interests of black people and are put out there as leaders that black      people should emulate. The other thing is that much of our leadership historically has come from      the black church.  And the black church has been plagued recently by this      preponderance of prosperity preachers who lead congregations to focus      more on materialism than to focus on social activism. GORDON:  Harry, what's your thought on that, the idea of a mass      intervention, if you will?  I've been waiting for that leadership void to      be filled for a mighty long time.  Individually, I know we can do it, but      what about en masse? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, I think that's a very difficult challenge, for all      of the reasons just stated.  I think institutionally the traditional      black community has deteriorated to the point that there are those who      really wonder if we have the wherewithal to re-establish institutional      viability? Again, you look at these young black men--they don't belong to      the church. You go into black churches, what you essentially find are      older black people, mothers and their dependent children and a sprinkling      of black men.  And most of them, in many ways, are there for the very      reasons just stated.  It's an entrepreneurial bridge for them, how you      get rich. The important thing here is that without that institutional viability,      you have no hooks, you have no way organically of engaging the      African-American masses.  If you go back and look at even sport, that has      deteriorated.  And we have always had a tremendous emphasis on sports.      One of our major problems during the 1960s and '70s was an overemphasis.      But you go back and look, for example, at boxing. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  I remember in the 1960s, there was Ali, Joe Frazier,      Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Floyd Patterson, Ernie Terrell, Ernie      Chavez, Buster Mathias, Cleveland Williams, and there was a sparring      partner by the name of Larry Holmes who couldn't even get a shot. GORDON:  Right. Prof. EDWARDS:  He was just a sparring partner for all of them.  Who--I      defy anybody to name three or four top heavyweights today who could even      fit anywhere in that class. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  We've deteriorated to that point. GORDON:  All right... Prof. McCALL:  Well, but, more importantly... GORDON:  Nathan, unfortunately, I got to hold you there. Prof. McCALL:  OK. GORDON:  I'm up against the clock.  But, listen, I appreciate and admire      the work of both of you.  Nathan McCall, professor of journalism and      African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, and Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.      Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  I appreciate it, fellows. Prof. EDWARDS:  Thank you. Prof. McCALL:  All right.  You're welcome. GORDON:  This is NPR News. Copyright © 2005 NPR.

We're in a country where we constantly talk about      there being boundless opportunities if you play by the rules of the game,      and many young black men, in particular, just see that that's just not      true.  And, you know, so there's frustration out there because there is      the sense that there is a kind of hopelessness and a sense that we're      lost as a country.  And the ripple effect of the country being lost is      felt mostly, most profoundly, by young black men. GORDON:  Professor Edwards, how much of the problem can be laid at our      own doorstep?  Go ahead. Professor HARRY EDWARDS (University of California at Berkeley):  A great      deal of it can.  And the reality is that sometimes it occurs for the best      of intentions.  For example, we're not just talking about the decline in      institutions and so forth within the traditional black society, but we're      talking about the civil rights movement.  The civil rights movement was a      middle class-oriented, middle class-led movement and it was basically, in      the final analysis, about advancing beyond the traditional      African-American community.  So a lot of people were left behind.  Even      people who participated in the movement--they participated in it, they      saw in their newspapers, they saw on their TV sets, but they never saw it      in the streets of the African-American community.  These young men are      the children of the civil rights generation that was left behind.  So a      great deal of it can be laid at our doorstep, both in terms of      institutional deterioration as a result of the black middle-class creep,      if you will, onto and into the traditionally white institutions and as a      result of the civil rights movement really not targeting the masses in      the traditional black community and those communities for development. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, how did you make it out?  I mean, you wrote so      eloquently in your book, \"Makes Me Wanna Holler,\" and you talked about      all the conditions you had to deal with, what you had to overcome.  There      are many young men, for whatever reason, who are faltering and failing      and not overcoming. Prof. McCALL:  Well, you know, as you know, I ended up in prison.  And      again, I felt the same level, prior to then, of frustration and sense of      being lost that that young man expressed to you.

And so I came to the conclusion that if there was      a system out there working systematically toward destroying me, then the      worst thing that I could do was cooperate by being uneducated; cooperate      by not showing initiative.  And so it was still a sense of defiance that      led me to move in a different direction than I had moved in before. GORDON:  Harry Edwards, you come from a very interesting perspective, I      think, and it's that, for those that don't know, you deal with a lot of      professional athletes.  These are men of great means and great      opportunity, yet many of them still are plagued with the issues that      haunt so many of us.  What is it about being black and male in this      society that, even for those who have means and opportunity, have not      allowed us to step beyond some of the issues that, quite frankly, plague      many of us? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, the reality is that, individually, you can move up      and move through American society with some degree of fulfillment, but      unless those means of moving, unless that freedom of development is      broad-scale and institutionally established, not just within America more      generally but within African-American society with links and bridges to      the mainstream, then you're simply out there in the midst of a      tremendously developed, technologically sophisticated and literate white      mainstream with no supports.  And so a lot of these young men who come      out of the traditional black community, which has always developed the      overwhelming preponderance of black athletes--the black middle class does      not develop black athletes; they develop college professors, engineers      and so forth--they end up in the mainstream with no institutional      supports and very little functional knowledge about how to succeed,      develop, sustain themselves, protect themselves in the mainstream.  And      so many of them wind up taking the traditional black community mores,      folkways, understandings with them into the mainstream and they end up      having tremendous difficulties. A great deal of what I've done with professional athletes over the last      40 years has been to work with athletes in terms of making those kinds of      adjustments. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, let me ask you this.  We know individuals can      make it.  We have seen it happen, we've seen it in greater numbers over      the last decade in particular.  But what of the mass?  Do you believe      there's any way to make, if you will, a social intervention on black      males?  Because quite frankly, and we don't often like to say this in      public, but we drink too much, we smoke too much, we do drugs too often,      we kill each other too often. Can there be a social intervention en      masse? Prof. McCALL:  Well, I mean, I think there has to be.  And I think what      we're really talking about here is a leadership void that is becoming      more and more pronounced and apparent every day.  Young people typically      don't figure out for themselves how to proceed in life.  Young people      typically learn form leadership.  Leadership comes from our families,      they come from our social leaders, they come from the church.  And you      have to look at what has happened, particularly over the last 25 years in      our communities, to create a kind of leadership void. One of the things that has happened is that we've had administrations,      political administrations, who have promoted assimilationists, such as      Condoleezza Rice, Clarence Thomas, people who in some ways work against      the interests of black people and are put out there as leaders that black      people should emulate. The other thing is that much of our leadership historically has come from      the black church.  And the black church has been plagued recently by this      preponderance of prosperity preachers who lead congregations to focus      more on materialism than to focus on social activism. GORDON:  Harry, what's your thought on that, the idea of a mass      intervention, if you will?  I've been waiting for that leadership void to      be filled for a mighty long time.  Individually, I know we can do it, but      what about en masse? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, I think that's a very difficult challenge, for all      of the reasons just stated.  I think institutionally the traditional      black community has deteriorated to the point that there are those who      really wonder if we have the wherewithal to re-establish institutional      viability? Again, you look at these young black men--they don't belong to      the church. You go into black churches, what you essentially find are      older black people, mothers and their dependent children and a sprinkling      of black men.  And most of them, in many ways, are there for the very      reasons just stated.  It's an entrepreneurial bridge for them, how you      get rich. The important thing here is that without that institutional viability,      you have no hooks, you have no way organically of engaging the      African-American masses.  If you go back and look at even sport, that has      deteriorated.  And we have always had a tremendous emphasis on sports.      One of our major problems during the 1960s and '70s was an overemphasis.      But you go back and look, for example, at boxing. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  I remember in the 1960s, there was Ali, Joe Frazier,      Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Floyd Patterson, Ernie Terrell, Ernie      Chavez, Buster Mathias, Cleveland Williams, and there was a sparring      partner by the name of Larry Holmes who couldn't even get a shot. GORDON:  Right. Prof. EDWARDS:  He was just a sparring partner for all of them.  Who--I      defy anybody to name three or four top heavyweights today who could even      fit anywhere in that class. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  We've deteriorated to that point. GORDON:  All right... Prof. McCALL:  Well, but, more importantly... GORDON:  Nathan, unfortunately, I got to hold you there. Prof. McCALL:  OK. GORDON:  I'm up against the clock.  But, listen, I appreciate and admire      the work of both of you.  Nathan McCall, professor of journalism and      African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, and Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.      Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  I appreciate it, fellows. Prof. EDWARDS:  Thank you. Prof. McCALL:  All right.  You're welcome. GORDON:  This is NPR News. Copyright © 2005 NPR.

And the reality is that sometimes it occurs for the best      of intentions.  For example, we're not just talking about the decline in      institutions and so forth within the traditional black society, but we're      talking about the civil rights movement.  The civil rights movement was a      middle class-oriented, middle class-led movement and it was basically, in      the final analysis, about advancing beyond the traditional      African-American community.  So a lot of people were left behind.  Even      people who participated in the movement--they participated in it, they      saw in their newspapers, they saw on their TV sets, but they never saw it      in the streets of the African-American community.  These young men are      the children of the civil rights generation that was left behind.  So a      great deal of it can be laid at our doorstep, both in terms of      institutional deterioration as a result of the black middle-class creep,      if you will, onto and into the traditionally white institutions and as a      result of the civil rights movement really not targeting the masses in      the traditional black community and those communities for development. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, how did you make it out?  I mean, you wrote so      eloquently in your book, \"Makes Me Wanna Holler,\" and you talked about      all the conditions you had to deal with, what you had to overcome.  There      are many young men, for whatever reason, who are faltering and failing      and not overcoming. Prof. McCALL:  Well, you know, as you know, I ended up in prison.  And      again, I felt the same level, prior to then, of frustration and sense of      being lost that that young man expressed to you.  It was while in prison      that I began to read and think and try to figure out what had happened in      my life and in the lives of so many of the other guys that I saw around      me in prison that resulted in me being there.  And I became a serious      student of history to try to understand what had happened.  And after      reading and thinking very seriously about the country and the way that it      has evolved and the way that it has impacted my own life, I realized that      the best thing that I could do was nurture my mind and do--not cooperate      in my own destruction.

And I think what      we're really talking about here is a leadership void that is becoming      more and more pronounced and apparent every day.  Young people typically      don't figure out for themselves how to proceed in life.  Young people      typically learn form leadership.  Leadership comes from our families,      they come from our social leaders, they come from the church.  And you      have to look at what has happened, particularly over the last 25 years in      our communities, to create a kind of leadership void. One of the things that has happened is that we've had administrations,      political administrations, who have promoted assimilationists, such as      Condoleezza Rice, Clarence Thomas, people who in some ways work against      the interests of black people and are put out there as leaders that black      people should emulate. The other thing is that much of our leadership historically has come from      the black church.  And the black church has been plagued recently by this      preponderance of prosperity preachers who lead congregations to focus      more on materialism than to focus on social activism. GORDON:  Harry, what's your thought on that, the idea of a mass      intervention, if you will?  I've been waiting for that leadership void to      be filled for a mighty long time.  Individually, I know we can do it, but      what about en masse? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, I think that's a very difficult challenge, for all      of the reasons just stated.  I think institutionally the traditional      black community has deteriorated to the point that there are those who      really wonder if we have the wherewithal to re-establish institutional      viability? Again, you look at these young black men--they don't belong to      the church. You go into black churches, what you essentially find are      older black people, mothers and their dependent children and a sprinkling      of black men.  And most of them, in many ways, are there for the very      reasons just stated.  It's an entrepreneurial bridge for them, how you      get rich. The important thing here is that without that institutional viability,      you have no hooks, you have no way organically of engaging the      African-American masses.  If you go back and look at even sport, that has      deteriorated.  And we have always had a tremendous emphasis on sports.      One of our major problems during the 1960s and '70s was an overemphasis.      But you go back and look, for example, at boxing. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  I remember in the 1960s, there was Ali, Joe Frazier,      Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Floyd Patterson, Ernie Terrell, Ernie      Chavez, Buster Mathias, Cleveland Williams, and there was a sparring      partner by the name of Larry Holmes who couldn't even get a shot. GORDON:  Right. Prof. EDWARDS:  He was just a sparring partner for all of them.  Who--I      defy anybody to name three or four top heavyweights today who could even      fit anywhere in that class. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  We've deteriorated to that point. GORDON:  All right... Prof. McCALL:  Well, but, more importantly... GORDON:  Nathan, unfortunately, I got to hold you there. Prof. McCALL:  OK. GORDON:  I'm up against the clock.  But, listen, I appreciate and admire      the work of both of you.  Nathan McCall, professor of journalism and      African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, and Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.      Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  I appreciate it, fellows. Prof. EDWARDS:  Thank you. Prof. McCALL:  All right.  You're welcome. GORDON:  This is NPR News. Copyright © 2005 NPR.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nGORDON:  Nathan McCall, how did you make it out?  I mean, you wrote so      eloquently in your book, \"Makes Me Wanna Holler,\" and you talked about      all the conditions you had to deal with, what you had to overcome.  There      are many young men, for whatever reason, who are faltering and failing      and not overcoming. Prof. McCALL:  Well, you know, as you know, I ended up in prison.  And      again, I felt the same level, prior to then, of frustration and sense of      being lost that that young man expressed to you.  It was while in prison      that I began to read and think and try to figure out what had happened in      my life and in the lives of so many of the other guys that I saw around      me in prison that resulted in me being there.  And I became a serious      student of history to try to understand what had happened.  And after      reading and thinking very seriously about the country and the way that it      has evolved and the way that it has impacted my own life, I realized that      the best thing that I could do was nurture my mind and do--not cooperate      in my own destruction.  And so I came to the conclusion that if there was      a system out there working systematically toward destroying me, then the      worst thing that I could do was cooperate by being uneducated; cooperate      by not showing initiative.  And so it was still a sense of defiance that      led me to move in a different direction than I had moved in before. GORDON:  Harry Edwards, you come from a very interesting perspective, I      think, and it's that, for those that don't know, you deal with a lot of      professional athletes.  These are men of great means and great      opportunity, yet many of them still are plagued with the issues that      haunt so many of us.  What is it about being black and male in this      society that, even for those who have means and opportunity, have not      allowed us to step beyond some of the issues that, quite frankly, plague      many of us? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, the reality is that, individually, you can move up      and move through American society with some degree of fulfillment, but      unless those means of moving, unless that freedom of development is      broad-scale and institutionally established, not just within America more      generally but within African-American society with links and bridges to      the mainstream, then you're simply out there in the midst of a      tremendously developed, technologically sophisticated and literate white      mainstream with no supports.  And so a lot of these young men who come      out of the traditional black community, which has always developed the      overwhelming preponderance of black athletes--the black middle class does      not develop black athletes; they develop college professors, engineers      and so forth--they end up in the mainstream with no institutional      supports and very little functional knowledge about how to succeed,      develop, sustain themselves, protect themselves in the mainstream.  And      so many of them wind up taking the traditional black community mores,      folkways, understandings with them into the mainstream and they end up      having tremendous difficulties. A great deal of what I've done with professional athletes over the last      40 years has been to work with athletes in terms of making those kinds of      adjustments. GORDON:  Nathan McCall, let me ask you this.  We know individuals can      make it.  We have seen it happen, we've seen it in greater numbers over      the last decade in particular.  But what of the mass?  Do you believe      there's any way to make, if you will, a social intervention on black      males?  Because quite frankly, and we don't often like to say this in      public, but we drink too much, we smoke too much, we do drugs too often,      we kill each other too often. Can there be a social intervention en      masse? Prof. McCALL:  Well, I mean, I think there has to be.  And I think what      we're really talking about here is a leadership void that is becoming      more and more pronounced and apparent every day.

GORDON:  Nathan McCall, let me ask you this.  We know individuals can      make it.  We have seen it happen, we've seen it in greater numbers over      the last decade in particular.  But what of the mass?  Do you believe      there's any way to make, if you will, a social intervention on black      males?  Because quite frankly, and we don't often like to say this in      public, but we drink too much, we smoke too much, we do drugs too often,      we kill each other too often. Can there be a social intervention en      masse? Prof. McCALL:  Well, I mean, I think there has to be.  And I think what      we're really talking about here is a leadership void that is becoming      more and more pronounced and apparent every day.  Young people typically      don't figure out for themselves how to proceed in life.  Young people      typically learn form leadership.  Leadership comes from our families,      they come from our social leaders, they come from the church.  And you      have to look at what has happened, particularly over the last 25 years in      our communities, to create a kind of leadership void. One of the things that has happened is that we've had administrations,      political administrations, who have promoted assimilationists, such as      Condoleezza Rice, Clarence Thomas, people who in some ways work against      the interests of black people and are put out there as leaders that black      people should emulate. The other thing is that much of our leadership historically has come from      the black church.  And the black church has been plagued recently by this      preponderance of prosperity preachers who lead congregations to focus      more on materialism than to focus on social activism. GORDON:  Harry, what's your thought on that, the idea of a mass      intervention, if you will?  I've been waiting for that leadership void to      be filled for a mighty long time.  Individually, I know we can do it, but      what about en masse? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, I think that's a very difficult challenge, for all      of the reasons just stated.  I think institutionally the traditional      black community has deteriorated to the point that there are those who      really wonder if we have the wherewithal to re-establish institutional      viability? Again, you look at these young black men--they don't belong to      the church. You go into black churches, what you essentially find are      older black people, mothers and their dependent children and a sprinkling      of black men.  And most of them, in many ways, are there for the very      reasons just stated.  It's an entrepreneurial bridge for them, how you      get rich. The important thing here is that without that institutional viability,      you have no hooks, you have no way organically of engaging the      African-American masses.  If you go back and look at even sport, that has      deteriorated.  And we have always had a tremendous emphasis on sports.      One of our major problems during the 1960s and '70s was an overemphasis.      But you go back and look, for example, at boxing. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  I remember in the 1960s, there was Ali, Joe Frazier,      Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Floyd Patterson, Ernie Terrell, Ernie      Chavez, Buster Mathias, Cleveland Williams, and there was a sparring      partner by the name of Larry Holmes who couldn't even get a shot. GORDON:  Right. Prof. EDWARDS:  He was just a sparring partner for all of them.  Who--I      defy anybody to name three or four top heavyweights today who could even      fit anywhere in that class. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  We've deteriorated to that point. GORDON:  All right... Prof. McCALL:  Well, but, more importantly... GORDON:  Nathan, unfortunately, I got to hold you there. Prof. McCALL:  OK. GORDON:  I'm up against the clock.  But, listen, I appreciate and admire      the work of both of you.  Nathan McCall, professor of journalism and      African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, and Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.      Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  I appreciate it, fellows. Prof. EDWARDS:  Thank you. Prof. McCALL:  All right.  You're welcome. GORDON:  This is NPR News. Copyright © 2005 NPR.

These are men of great means and great      opportunity, yet many of them still are plagued with the issues that      haunt so many of us.  What is it about being black and male in this      society that, even for those who have means and opportunity, have not      allowed us to step beyond some of the issues that, quite frankly, plague      many of us? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, the reality is that, individually, you can move up      and move through American society with some degree of fulfillment, but      unless those means of moving, unless that freedom of development is      broad-scale and institutionally established, not just within America more      generally but within African-American society with links and bridges to      the mainstream, then you're simply out there in the midst of a      tremendously developed, technologically sophisticated and literate white      mainstream with no supports.  And so a lot of these young men who come      out of the traditional black community, which has always developed the      overwhelming preponderance of black athletes--the black middle class does      not develop black athletes; they develop college professors, engineers      and so forth--they end up in the mainstream with no institutional      supports and very little functional knowledge about how to succeed,      develop, sustain themselves, protect themselves in the mainstream.  And      so many of them wind up taking the traditional black community mores,      folkways, understandings with them into the mainstream and they end up      having tremendous difficulties. A great deal of what I've done with professional athletes over the last      40 years has been to work with athletes in terms of making those kinds of      adjustments.

And you      have to look at what has happened, particularly over the last 25 years in      our communities, to create a kind of leadership void. One of the things that has happened is that we've had administrations,      political administrations, who have promoted assimilationists, such as      Condoleezza Rice, Clarence Thomas, people who in some ways work against      the interests of black people and are put out there as leaders that black      people should emulate. The other thing is that much of our leadership historically has come from      the black church.  And the black church has been plagued recently by this      preponderance of prosperity preachers who lead congregations to focus      more on materialism than to focus on social activism. GORDON:  Harry, what's your thought on that, the idea of a mass      intervention, if you will?  I've been waiting for that leadership void to      be filled for a mighty long time.  Individually, I know we can do it, but      what about en masse? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, I think that's a very difficult challenge, for all      of the reasons just stated.  I think institutionally the traditional      black community has deteriorated to the point that there are those who      really wonder if we have the wherewithal to re-establish institutional      viability? Again, you look at these young black men--they don't belong to      the church. You go into black churches, what you essentially find are      older black people, mothers and their dependent children and a sprinkling      of black men.  And most of them, in many ways, are there for the very      reasons just stated.  It's an entrepreneurial bridge for them, how you      get rich. The important thing here is that without that institutional viability,      you have no hooks, you have no way organically of engaging the      African-American masses.  If you go back and look at even sport, that has      deteriorated.  And we have always had a tremendous emphasis on sports.      One of our major problems during the 1960s and '70s was an overemphasis.      But you go back and look, for example, at boxing. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  I remember in the 1960s, there was Ali, Joe Frazier,      Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Floyd Patterson, Ernie Terrell, Ernie      Chavez, Buster Mathias, Cleveland Williams, and there was a sparring      partner by the name of Larry Holmes who couldn't even get a shot. GORDON:  Right. Prof. EDWARDS:  He was just a sparring partner for all of them.  Who--I      defy anybody to name three or four top heavyweights today who could even      fit anywhere in that class. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  We've deteriorated to that point. GORDON:  All right... Prof. McCALL:  Well, but, more importantly... GORDON:  Nathan, unfortunately, I got to hold you there. Prof. McCALL:  OK. GORDON:  I'm up against the clock.  But, listen, I appreciate and admire      the work of both of you.  Nathan McCall, professor of journalism and      African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, and Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.

We have seen it happen, we've seen it in greater numbers over      the last decade in particular.  But what of the mass?  Do you believe      there's any way to make, if you will, a social intervention on black      males?  Because quite frankly, and we don't often like to say this in      public, but we drink too much, we smoke too much, we do drugs too often,      we kill each other too often. Can there be a social intervention en      masse? Prof. McCALL:  Well, I mean, I think there has to be.  And I think what      we're really talking about here is a leadership void that is becoming      more and more pronounced and apparent every day.

You go into black churches, what you essentially find are      older black people, mothers and their dependent children and a sprinkling      of black men.  And most of them, in many ways, are there for the very      reasons just stated.  It's an entrepreneurial bridge for them, how you      get rich. The important thing here is that without that institutional viability,      you have no hooks, you have no way organically of engaging the      African-American masses.  If you go back and look at even sport, that has      deteriorated.  And we have always had a tremendous emphasis on sports.      One of our major problems during the 1960s and '70s was an overemphasis.      But you go back and look, for example, at boxing. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  I remember in the 1960s, there was Ali, Joe Frazier,      Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Floyd Patterson, Ernie Terrell, Ernie      Chavez, Buster Mathias, Cleveland Williams, and there was a sparring      partner by the name of Larry Holmes who couldn't even get a shot. GORDON:  Right. Prof. EDWARDS:  He was just a sparring partner for all of them.  Who--I      defy anybody to name three or four top heavyweights today who could even      fit anywhere in that class. GORDON:  Yeah. Prof. EDWARDS:  We've deteriorated to that point. GORDON:  All right... Prof. McCALL:  Well, but, more importantly... GORDON:  Nathan, unfortunately, I got to hold you there. Prof. McCALL:  OK. GORDON:  I'm up against the clock.  But, listen, I appreciate and admire      the work of both of you.  Nathan McCall, professor of journalism and      African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, and Harry      Edwards, professor emeritus of sociology at UC Berkeley in California.      Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  I appreciate it, fellows. Prof. EDWARDS:  Thank you. Prof. McCALL:  All right.  You're welcome. GORDON:  This is NPR News. Copyright © 2005 NPR.

And the black church has been plagued recently by this      preponderance of prosperity preachers who lead congregations to focus      more on materialism than to focus on social activism. GORDON:  Harry, what's your thought on that, the idea of a mass      intervention, if you will?  I've been waiting for that leadership void to      be filled for a mighty long time.  Individually, I know we can do it, but      what about en masse? Prof. EDWARDS:  Well, I think that's a very difficult challenge, for all      of the reasons just stated.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nA ProPublica analysis of killings by police shows outsize risk for young black males.\n\nby Ryan Gabrielson , Eric Sagara and Ryann Grochowski Jones\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nYoung black males in recent years were at a far greater risk of being shot dead by police than their white counterparts - 21 times greater i , according to a ProPublica analysis of federally collected data on fatal police shootings.\n\nThe 1,217 deadly police shootings from 2010 to 2012 captured in the federal data show that blacks, age 15 to 19, were killed at a rate of 31.17 per million, while just 1.47 per million white males in that age range died at the hands of police.\n\nOne way of appreciating that stark disparity, ProPublica's analysis shows, is to calculate how many more whites over those three years would have had to have been killed for them to have been at equal risk. The number is jarring - 185, more than one per week.\n\nProPublica's risk analysis on young males killed by police certainly seems to support what has been an article of faith in the African American community for decades: Blacks are being killed at disturbing rates when set against the rest of the American population.\n\nOur examination involved detailed accounts of more than 12,000 police homicides stretching from 1980 to 2012 contained in the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Report. The data, annually self-reported by hundreds of police departments across the country, confirms some assumptions, runs counter to others, and adds nuance to a wide range of questions about the use of deadly police force.\n\nColin Loftin, University at Albany professor and co-director of the Violence Research Group, said the FBI data is a minimum count of homicides by police, and that it is impossible to precisely measure what puts people at risk of homicide by police without more and better records. Still, what the data shows about the race of victims and officers, and the circumstances of killings, are \"certainly relevant,\" Loftin said.\n\n\"No question, there are all kinds of racial disparities across our criminal justice system,\" he said. \"This is one example.\"\n\nThe FBI's data has appeared in news accounts over the years, and surfaced again with the August killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. To a great degree, observers and experts lamented the limited nature of the FBI's reports. Their shortcomings are inarguable.\n\nThe data, for instance, is terribly incomplete. Vast numbers of the country's 17,000 police departments don't file fatal police shooting reports at all, and many have filed reports for some years but not others. Florida departments haven't filed reports since 1997 and New York City last reported in 2007. Information contained in the individual reports can also be flawed. Still, lots of the reporting police departments are in larger cities, and at least 1000 police departments filed a report or reports over the 33 years.\n\nThere is, then, value in what the data can show while accepting, and accounting for, its limitations. Indeed, while the absolute numbers are problematic, a comparison between white and black victims shows important trends. Our analysis included dividing the number of people of each race killed by police by the number of people of that race living in the country at the time, to produce two different rates: the risk of getting killed by police if you are white and if you are black.\n\nDavid Klinger, a University of Missouri-St. Louis professor and expert on police use of deadly force, said racial disparities in the data could result from \"measurement error,\" meaning that the unreported killings could alter ProPublica's findings.\n\nHowever, he said the disparity between black and white teenage boys is so wide, \"I doubt the measurement error would account for that.\"\n\nProPublica spent weeks digging into the many rich categories of information the reports hold: the race of the officers involved; the circumstances cited for the use of deadly force; the age of those killed.\n\nWho Gets Killed?\n\nThe finding that young black men are 21 times as likely as their white peers to be killed by police is drawn from reports filed for the years 2010 to 2012, the three most recent years for which FBI numbers are available.\n\nThe black boys killed can be disturbingly young. There were 41 teens 14 years or younger reported killed by police from 1980 to 2012 ii . 27 of them were black iii ; 8 were white iv ; 4 were Hispanic v and 1 was Asian vi .\n\nThat's not to say officers weren't killing white people. Indeed, some 44 percent of all those killed by police across the 33 years were white.\n\nWhite or black, though, those slain by police tended to be roughly the same age. The average age of blacks killed by police was 30 . The average age of whites was 35 .\n\nWho is killing all those black men and boys?\n\nMostly white officers. But in hundreds of instances, black officers, too. Black officers account for a little more than 10 percent of all fatal police shootings. Of those they kill, though, 78 percent were black.\n\nWhite officers, given their great numbers in so many of the country's police departments, are well represented in all categories of police killings. White officers killed 91 percent of the whites who died at the hands of police. And they were responsible for 68 percent of the people of color killed. Those people of color represented 46 percent of all those killed by white officers.\n\nWhat were the circumstances surrounding all these fatal encounters?\n\nThere were 151 instances in which police noted that teens they had shot dead had been fleeing or resisting arrest at the time of the encounter. 67 percent of those killed in such circumstances were black. That disparity was even starker in the last couple of years: of the 15 teens shot fleeing arrest from 2010 to 2012, 14 were black.\n\nDid police always list the circumstances of the killings? No, actually, there were many deadly shooting where the circumstances were listed as \"undetermined.\" 77 percent of those killed in such instances were black.\n\nCertainly, there were instances where police truly feared for their lives.\n\nOf course, although the data show that police reported that as the cause of their actions in far greater numbers after the 1985 Supreme Court decision that said police could only justify using deadly force if the suspects posed a threat to the officer or others. From 1980 to 1984, \"officer under attack\" was listed as the cause for 33 percent of the deadly shootings. Twenty years later, looking at data from 2005 to 2009, \"officer under attack\" was cited in 62 percent xxxvii of police killings.\n\nDoes the data include cases where police killed people with something other than a standard service handgun?\n\nYes, and the Los Angeles Police Department stood out in its use of shotguns. Most police killings involve officers firing handguns xl . But from 1980 to 2012 , 714 involved the use of a shotgun xli . The Los Angeles Police Department has a special claim on that category. It accounted for 47 cases xlii in which an officer used a shotgun. The next highest total came from the Dallas Police Department: 14 xliii .\n\nFor more civil rights coverage, read Segregation Now, the resegregation of America's schools , and Living Apart, how the government beytrayed a landmark civil rights law .\n\nUpdate (Dec. 23, 2014) : ProPublica shared its findings and methodology with Prof. David Klinger before this story appeared. In two interviews with reporters, he noted that the FBI data has serious shortcomings . But he also said the disparity ProPublica had found between black and white victims was so large, it was unlikely to have resulted solely from omissions in the FBI statistics.  After the story appeared, Klinger said flaws in the FBI data made it unusable . ProPublica contacted Klinger and asked him to elaborate, but he declined to comment further.  We stand by the analysis. A full response to the arguments Klinger and another critic have raised is here .\n\ni ProPublica calculated a statistical figure called a risk ratio by dividing the rate of black homicide victims by the rate of white victims. This ratio, commonly used in epidemiology, gives an estimate for how much more at risk black teenagers were to be killed by police officers.Risk ratios can have varying levels of precision, depending on a variety of mathematical factors. In this case, because such shootings are rare from a statistical perspective, a 95 percent confidence interval indicates that black teenagers are at between 10 and 40 times greater risk of being killed by a police officer. The calculation used 2010-2012 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey.\n\nii https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/1307015-victims-14under-byraceanddecade-spssoutput.html#document/p1/a179431\n\niii https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/1307015-victims-14under-byraceanddecade-spssoutput.html#document/p1/a179432\n\niv https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/1307015-victims-14under-byraceanddecade-spssoutput.html#document/p1/a179433\n\nv https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/1307015-victims-14under-byraceanddecade-spssoutput.html#document/p1/a179434\n\nvi https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/1307015-victims-14under-byraceanddecade-spssoutput.html#document/p1/a179435\n\nxxxvii https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/1307298-circumstances-yearcats-spssoutput.html#document/p1/a179463\n\nxl Calculated from the \"Weapon Used by Offender\" variable.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nSeries: Law & Disorder\n\nA former New Orleans resident was charged with federal hate crimes for his alleged role in a racially motivated shooting of three black men in the days after Hurricane Katrina.\n\nby A.C. Thompson\n\nAfter Katrina, New Orleans Police Under Scrutiny\n\nThis was co-published with The Times-Picayune.\n\nA former New Orleans resident was charged Thursday with federal hate crimes for his alleged role in a racially motivated shooting of three black men in the days after Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe man, Roland J. Bourgeois Jr., 47, is accused of plotting to defend his Algiers Point neighborhood \"from outsiders\" including African-Americans, constructing barricades on public streets and using racial epithets to describe black people, according to the five-count indictment.\n\nAt one point, the charges claim, Bourgeois said, \"Anything coming up this street darker than a paper bag is getting shot.\"\n\nThe indictment charges Bourgeois with doing just that when three black males walked through the neighborhood toward a makeshift Coast Guard evacuation center on Sept. 1, 2005. Bourgeois fired a shotgun at the trio, felling Donnell Herrington and wounding Herrington's two companions near the corner of Pelican Avenue and Vallette Street, according to the indictment.\n\nLater, Bourgeois plucked Herrington's bloodied baseball cap from the ground and proudly displayed it to others, boasting that he \"got one\" and had shot a \"looter,\" according to a witness.\n\nBourgeois, who denied any knowledge of the incident to federal agents, is also accused of coercing an eyewitness to the shooting to lie to investigators.\n\nBourgeois left Algiers Point after the hurricane and now lives in Columbia, Miss., according to the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, which is prosecuting the case along with U.S. Attorney Jim Letten's office.\n\nThe indictment , filed Thursday, charges Bourgeois with conspiracy to commit a hate crime, committing a hate crime with a deadly weapon and with intent to kill, making false statements and obstruction of justice. He faces a possible sentence of life in prison if convicted.\n\nThe Herrington shooting was the subject of a lengthy Justice Department investigation into claims that white residents of Algiers Point attacked African-Americans in a spate of racially motivated violence in the wake of Katrina. Algiers Point did not flood, though it did sustain wind and storm damage.\n\nThe hurricane prompted more than a dozen residents in the neighborhood, most of whom are white, to take up arms, barricade streets with downed trees and debris, and coordinate vigilante patrols of the area.\n\nA joint reporting project by The Times-Picayune, ProPublica and PBS' \"Frontline\" interviewed people this year who implicated Bourgeois in the shooting.\n\nBourgeois' mother, Pam Pitre, acknowledged in April that her son fired his shotgun at a black man that day and kept the man's hat. Pitre insisted her son \"is not a racist\" and said another man also fired. She said the shooting had nothing to do with skin color.\n\nOne witness, Terri Benjamin, recalled hearing gunfire and seeing Bourgeois among a group of armed white men. Bourgeois was gripping a shotgun and celebrating.\n\n\"My neighbor was jumping up and down, hooting and hollering like he was big-game hunting and he got the big one,\" she said earlier this year. \"All of his friends were rallying him on, and they were cheering.\"\n\nAnother armed man approached soon afterward and told the group that the wounded man was still alive a few blocks away.\n\nAccording to Benjamin, Bourgeois said, \"I'm gonna kill that nigger,\" and ran, barefoot and shirtless, down the street before turning and jogging out of view.\n\nBenjamin then heard another gunshot. And Bourgeois ran back to the group with a bloody baseball cap.\n\n\"And he brandished the cap for all of his friends,\" Benjamin recalled. \"Everybody cheered. They were happy for him.\"\n\nHerrington called news of the indictment on Thursday a \"huge relief.\"\n\n\"It feels good to know that steps are being taken toward bringing that guy -- or those guys -- toward justice. It's been a long time coming,\" he said.\n\nHerrington and his companions have said they were trying to get to an evacuation center set up at the ferry terminal in Algiers Point.\n\nHerrington, who lives in Algiers, said his group was walking when a white man pointed his shotgun and, without saying a word, fired.\n\nShotgun pellets peppered his throat, torso and arms. He recalls scrambling to his feet and running. Herrington also remembers two more armed men joining the first gunman. As he ran, a second shotgun blast tore through his back.\n\nHerrington eventually found his way to the home of an African-American couple who drove him to West Jefferson Medical Center, where he underwent emergency surgery to repair his internal jugular, which was shredded by buckshot.\n\nHis companions, cousin Marcel Alexander and friend Chris Collins, suffered minor gunshot wounds. Alexander said he and Collins were briefly taken hostage by a group of about five armed white men, one of whom threatened to set them on fire. Eventually the group allowed Alexander and Collins to flee.\n\nBourgeois is the only person charged to date in the shooting incident.\n\nHerrington said no police officers interviewed him while he was at the hospital, though officers were present during his stay. He was later shuttled to a Baton Rouge medical facility.\n\nWhen Herrington returned to New Orleans he said he visited the 4th District police station, but officers there didn't file a report on the shooting.\n\nAfter the police failed to investigate, Herrington said he felt \"nobody cared.\"\n\nFederal investigators canvassed the neighborhood at various points last year. Several residents acknowledged testifying earlier this year before a federal grand jury.\n\nBourgeois was living months ago with his mother in Mississippi. She defended him in an interview in April, saying her son was terrified by the lawlessness in the city following the storm.\n\nShe said he had been threatened by a group of African-Americans and \"pelted with bottles\" in the days before the shooting occurred. Pitre, who heard a narrative of the events from her son, said he had encountered three dangerous and \"arrogant\" African-American men that day.\n\nThe men, who were trying to break into parked cars, \"looked like gang members\" to her son, she said.\n\nAfter the trio of black men tried to move one of the barricades blocking the street, Bourgeois and another man began shooting at them, Pitre said. \"Both men had guns. Both fired,\" she said, adding that she didn't know the name of the other shooter.\n\nPitre said the shots were meant to \"scare,\" not to kill.\n\nThe only reason the matter came to the attention of federal authorities, she noted, is that \"this man Roland shot survived and is telling his tale.\"\n\nHerrington has long maintained that he and his companions had nothing to do with any criminal activity and were simply trying to make their way out of the stricken city.\n\nA court date for Bourgeois had not been set as of Thursday evening, according to court records. The investigation is ongoing, according to a new release issued by the Justice Department.\n\nA.C. Thompson\n\nReporter A.C.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nSeries: Walking While Black\n\nC.J. Brown wrote four times as many pedestrian tickets as any other officer in Jacksonville over the last five years. Most of them went to blacks. His boss says he's just \"good at his job.\"\n\nby Topher Sanders , ProPublica, and Benjamin Conarck , The Florida Times-Union [Jacksonville]\n\nPedestrian Enforcement and Racial Profiling\n\nIt was just before 9 a.m. one day last July, and Noemi Martinez was on her way from one job interview to the next, running to catch a bus on Atlantic Boulevard in Jacksonville, Fla. Sprinklers from a nearby nursery were showering water onto the broken sidewalk in front of her, so Martinez walked out into the shoulder of Lee Road and pressed on.\n\nThings were fairly urgent for Martinez, 52. An eviction notice had been pasted on her apartment door on Jacksonville's West Side. A job was vital, and she'd just interviewed for work as a bus driver. Now, she was off to interview for a position as a customer service representative at Florida Blue, the health insurance giant.\n\nJust then, Officer C.J. Brown of the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office cruised by on his motorcycle. Martinez's luck could hardly have been worse.\n\nBrown wrote more pedestrian tickets than any other member of the sheriff's force over the last five years. And so at 8:58 a.m. on July 19, 2017, he issued a $62.50 citation to Martinez: \"Pedestrian failed to use sidewalk. Walking in roadway where sidewalks provided.\"\n\n\"I've never been stopped for anything and you're going to stop me for walking, when I was doing everything right,\" Martinez recalled saying to Brown. \"He stopped me as if I was a criminal.\"\n\nProPublica and the Times-Union examined more than 2,200 pedestrian tickets issued to people in Jacksonville from 2012 to 2017, and found that 55 percent of them were issued to blacks despite the fact that the city's population is just 29 percent African American. The sheriff's office says the tickets are issued in an effort to limit pedestrian fatalities and combat crime.\n\nBrown has fully embraced the ticket enforcement effort. Records show Brown issued 198 pedestrian tickets over five years, four times the total of the next most prolific officer. Slightly more than 60 percent of his tickets went to blacks, meaning one of every 10 blacks to receive a pedestrian ticket in Jacksonville from 2012 to 2017 was cited by Brown.\n\nTop officials with the sheriff's office said they had no issue with Brown's performance, or whom he ticketed. The sheriff's office said Brown wrote a large volume of tickets because he'd been assigned to special enforcement shifts as part of a state-funded effort to make Jacksonville safer for pedestrians.\n\nHowever, the Times-Union and ProPublica discovered Brown's work on those shifts could not have accounted for his number of tickets. Those special enforcement shifts were aimed at issuing warnings, not tickets. Officers working those shifts actually wrote modest numbers of tickets.\n\nPresented with the findings, the sheriff's office amended its explanation for Brown's productivity, saying Brown was simply a traffic officer who was \"good at his job.\"\n\nBrown would not agree to an interview.\n\nBrown is one of 19 \"motor officers\" on the Jacksonville sheriff's force. They operate on motorcycle and primarily perform traffic-related duties, such as traffic enforcement, traffic direction, and traffic crash investigations. There are also 29 other officers throughout the department that perform some similar traffic-related functions.\n\nBrown joined the sheriff's force in 1995, and worked first as a patrol officer in downtown Jacksonville. Even as a patrol officer, he received praise for his traffic enforcement. His personnel file indicates he joined the motorcycle traffic unit around 2005, and again he won praise from his superiors.\n\n\"He has shown advanced skills in traffic control, traffic enforcement, motorist safety and motorcycle operation,\" reads one performance evaluation. \"Officer Brown has shown the ability to determine the correct Traffic Statute or Criminal Statute to enforce an offense properly,\" the evaluation continued.\n\n\"Officer Brown makes safety a primary focus. Officer Brown wears safety glasses, reflective jacket, bullet proof body armor, motorcycle boots, gloves and attends monthly motorcycle training classes. Officer Brown participates in numerous Police Motorcycle Rodeo, which have exercises stressing safe operation of the motorcycle. Officer Brown places with awards each rodeo.\"\n\nBrown has also been commended for his \"commitment to the Broken Windows theory of policing.\" The approach emphasizes enforcement of low-level \"quality of life\" ordinances as a way to limit public disorder and, as a consequence, deter the kinds of more serious crimes that can flourish in neglected communities.\n\nOver the years, the execution of this philosophy of policing has come under considerable fire. Critics say the police sometimes have cracked down too hard on minor crimes in distressed neighborhoods, generating ill will and driving some poor residents into a cycle of debt and needless incarceration.\n\nBrown's personnel file suggests his approach has not always played well with residents. The brief summaries in the file include nine reports of citizen complaints - \"improper action,\" in one case, \"traffic violation\" in another, \"unbecoming conduct\" in another. The documents underlying the complaints were not available because they are purged after one year. The sheriff's office declined to open an internal affairs investigation in all but two cases. In those two cases, the allegations were not sustained.\n\nThe Times-Union and ProPublica asked the sheriff's office for comment on Brown's record of complaints, but got no response.\n\nThe 18 other motor officers accounted for a combined 144 pedestrian tickets, well short of Brown's total. The officers who wrote the second-most and third-most tickets gave out 50 and 39, respectively. They, too, issued them disproportionately to blacks (60 percent and 74 percent, respectively.)\n\nRace can affect the enforcement of laws on a wide range of ordinary conduct, from driving to bicycling. Read more from our look at whether that kind of profiling is taking place with Jacksonville's pedestrian statutes.\n\nJacksonville's enforcement of pedestrian violations raises concerns that it's another example of racial profiling.\n\nThe city's population is 29 percent black, but black pedestrians received 55 percent of the pedestrian tickets issued from 2012 to July 2017. Looking at each type of ticket issued reveals even bigger disparities.\n\nA number of experts said the ProPublica/Times-Union analysis of pedestrian tickets in Jacksonville raised worries about selective enforcement, and noted that the cost of the tickets can hit poor residents especially hard. Sheriff Mike Williams has said there is no targeting of black residents, and that he and his office could not comment further until they had more fully reviewed the ProPublica/Times-Union findings.\n\nBrown issued 121 of his 198 tickets to blacks. Nearly 80 percent of those went to black males. The violations included crossing against a red light, walking \"upon a limited access facility\" and, of course, walking in roadway where sidewalks are provided, the citation he issued Noemi Martinez, who was listed on the ticket as black, but who describes herself as black and Dominican.\n\nBut Brown's most frequently given ticket was for failing to cross the street in a crosswalk. The ProPublica/Times-Union analysis showed that more than half of all such tickets given in Jacksonville are given in error. The mistakes appear to result from sheriff's officers' confusion about how to interpret the statute. Williams told ProPublica and the Times-Union he had asked the State Attorney's Office to look at the department's enforcement of the statute for guidance.\n\nBrown wrote 101 tickets for failing to cross in a crosswalk, and our analysis shows 50 of them were issued in error. Thirty of those went to blacks.\n\nMartinez, the recipient of ticket #A8MO4TE, has struggled to find housing and job stability in recent years. By the time she got her apartment in the West Side, she had already been through all three of Jacksonville's homeless shelters. The one-bedroom apartment was nearly without furniture when a reporter visited to interview Martinez. She had only a bed and two chairs, one of which she used as a nightstand.\n\nThe $62.50 ticket written by Brown, then, was no small thing. Any penalties she might accrue on her driver's license could damage her chances at something like the bus driver's job she had interviewed for that morning last July.\n\nProPublica and the Times-Union discussed Martinez's ticket with Undersheriff Patrick Ivey, the sheriff's office's second in command. Ivey subsequently spoke with Martinez and opened an internal affairs investigation into Brown's handling of the incident.\n\nMartinez had multiple interviews with police, after which Ivey told her the office supported Brown's actions. The investigators concluded she had failed to heed Brown's instructions to move to the sidewalk on the other side of the road.\n\nMartinez conceded she was told to get on the sidewalk by Brown, but she thought he was talking about the flooded one she was trying to avoid.\n\n\"What sidewalk?\" she remembers asking Brown in exasperation. Martinez said she never felt unsafe, and wasn't straying into traffic.\n\n\"I was just trying to walk from point A to point B,\" she said.\n\nIvey acknowledged the discretionary nature of the whole episode. He said that Brown would not have ticketed Martinez if she had heeded his instruction to get on a sidewalk, rather than responding with a question.\n\nMartinez is headed to court over the ticket. She is being represented pro bono by defense attorney Whitney Lonker.\n\nAs she was when she first met Martinez, Lonker remains dumbstruck by the effort to ticket poor people for pedestrian violations.\n\nLonker, who is white, said her own encounter over a jaywalking infraction went a lot differently, something she chalked up to her race and seeming greater affluence.\n\nLonker said she was crossing the street outside the Duval County Courthouse when a Jacksonville sheriff's officer notified her she technically committed an infraction by not using the crosswalk.\n\nIt was a flirty exchange, Lonker said.\n\n\"I was crossing the street, and he laughed and looked at me and said, 'I could write you a jaywalking ticket,' and I laughed and said, 'I know, right!'\"\n\nThere was no ticket.\n\nThe sheriff's office did not respond to a request for comment on Lonker's account.\n\nFiled under:\n\nTopher Sanders\n\nI report on injustice of any kind, but particularly in race, inequality and the legal system.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "They Held Down a Black Teen Who Had Tried to Shoplift. He Died From Asphyxia. Why Was No One Ever Charged?\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nWhen the clerk at VJ's Food Mart confronted Corey Stingley, the 16-year-old handed over his backpack. Inside were six hidden bottles of Smirnoff Ice, worth $12, and the clerk began pulling them out one by one.\n\nStingley watched, then pivoted and quickly moved toward the door, empty-handed. But there would be no escape for the unarmed teen in the light blue hoodie.\n\nThree customers, together weighing 550 pounds, wrestled the 135-pound teen to the floor of the West Allis, Wisconsin, store. They pinned him in a seated position, \"his body compressed downward,\" according to a police account. One of the men put Stingley in a chokehold, witnesses would later tell investigators.\n\n\"Get up, you punk!\" that man, a former Marine, reportedly told Stingley when an officer from the police department finally arrived. But the teen didn't move. He was foaming at the mouth, and his pants and shoes were soaked in urine.\n\nHe'd suffered a traumatic brain injury from a loss of oxygen and never regained consciousness. His parents took him off life support two weeks later. The medical examiner ruled Stingley's death a homicide following his restraint in \"a violent struggle with multiple individuals.\"\n\nThat was more than 10 years ago.\n\nNone of the men, all of whom were white, were criminally charged in the incident that killed Stingley, a Black youth. Police arrested Mario Laumann, the man seen holding Stingley in an apparent chokehold, shortly after the incident in December 2012. But the local district attorney declined to prosecute him or the other two men, arguing they were unaware of the harm they were causing.\n\nWhen a second police review led to a reexamination of the case in 2017, another prosecutor sat on it for more than three years, until a judge demanded a decision. Again, there were no charges.\n\nProsecutors move on, but fathers don't. Refusing to accept that the case had been handled justly, Corey Stingley's dad, Craig, last year convinced a judge to assign a third district attorney to look at what had happened to his son.\n\nThat prosecutor, Ismael Ozanne of Dane County, is scheduled to report back to the court on Friday. He could announce whether charges are warranted.\n\nThe case has parallels to a recent deadly subway incident in New York City. Both involve chokeholds administered by former Marines on Black males who had not initiated any violence. But unlike in Wisconsin, New York authorities acted within two weeks to file a second-degree manslaughter charge in the case.\n\nWhile the New York subway incident grabbed national headlines, Corey Stingley's death - which happened the same day as the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut - did not gain much notice outside of southeast Wisconsin.\n\nYears later, Craig Stingley tapped an obscure statute dating back to Wisconsin's frontier days to convince the system to take a fresh look at his son's death. The law states that if a district attorney refuses to issue a criminal complaint or is unavailable to do so, a private citizen can petition a judge to take up the matter. Today, it's loosely referred to as a \"John Doe\" petition, though in this instance there was no doubt who restrained Stingley's son: Laumann, who has since died, along with two other store patrons named Jesse R. Cole and Robert W. Beringer.\n\nNo one is alleging that the men set out to kill Corey Stingley. His father is asking the prosecutor to consider a charge of reckless homicide or even a lesser offense for using extreme force to detain his son.\n\n\"He wasn't trying to harm anyone. He was trying to leave that store,\" said Craig Stingley, who thought his son made a youthful mistake. \"I believe he was scared.\"\n\nVJ's Food Mart is a typical small convenience store, packed with chips, candy, soda, beer, cigarettes and liquor. On Sunday mornings it offers a special deal on hot ham and rolls, a local tradition for an after-church meal. To combat theft, the store is equipped with security cameras.\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2012, Thomas Ripley and Anthony Orcholski stopped by the store for beer and snacks. Only a few steps in, they saw that three men had someone firmly pinned on the ground.\n\nSecurity video shows Ripley and Orcholski pausing next to the pile of people and watching intently. In statements to police they both said they saw Laumann lying on the ground with his arms around Stingley's neck in a \"chokehold.\" Beringer had grabbed Stingley's hair, they said; the third man, Cole, had his hands on Stingley's back.\n\nRipley told police the teen was not moving and appeared to be limp.\n\n\"I don't think he could breathe,\" Ripley would later testify during a special review of the case to determine if there should be charges.\n\nOrcholski told a detective that he was concerned about the teen on the ground and may even have instructed the men to let Stingley go.\n\nA decade later, Orcholski is still bothered by what he saw. \"I'm upset,\" he told ProPublica. \"Three men thought they were going to be heroes that day because a 16-year-old boy was shoplifting. There could have been numerous different ways to restrain him other than choking him to death.\"\n\nHe added, \"It's common sense: When you squeeze somebody that hard for that long, they're not going to be alive after it.\"\n\nThe security video is grainy, and much of the confrontation took place out of view of the cameras.\n\nAuthorities had a third witness, though. Troubled by what he'd seen, store customer Michael Farrell felt compelled to go to the West Allis police station that evening and give a statement.\n\n\"I felt bad. I'm a dad,\" he explained, court records show.\n\nFarrell told police he could see through the store's glass door that a man with a \"crazed look on his face\" had someone in a chokehold, very near the entrance. The guy was \"squeezing the hell out of this kid and never let up,\" he said. Farrell picked Laumann out of a photo lineup. (Farrell and another witness, Ripley, couldn't be reached for comment for this story.)\n\nCorey Stingley and his dad lived just a couple of blocks from the store, making them one of the few Black families in a predominantly white neighborhood and city on the border of Milwaukee. Comments from the three men who held Stingley down imply that they saw him as an outsider.\n\nRipley told police that Beringer, 54, held Stingley by the hair and shook the teen's head a couple of times. \"You don't do that,\" he said Beringer scolded Stingley. \"We're all friends and neighbors around here.\"\n\nWith Stingley subdued, the store clerk held a phone to Beringer's head so he could talk to a police dispatcher. \"We have the perp, three of us have the perp on the ground holding him for you,\" Beringer said, according to a transcript of the 911 call.\n\nPolice estimated that the men held Stingley down for six to 10 minutes. When Stingley stopped struggling, Cole later told police, \"I thought he was faking it.\"\n\nHe added: \"I didn't know if he was just, you know, playing limp to try and get real strong and pull a quick one, you know.\"\n\nWhen an officer arrived, she handcuffed Stingley with Beringer's assistance but then realized that he wasn't breathing and called for help.\n\nBeringer walked outside the market, according to Farrell, only to be confronted by another bystander who said, \"You guys killed that kid.\"\n\n\"We didn't kill anyone,\" Beringer responded.\n\nAt nearby Froedtert Hospital, doctors concluded Stingley's airway had been blocked while he was restrained.\n\nHe had petechial hemorrhages - tiny red dots that appear as the result of broken blood vessels - to his eyes, cheeks and mouth. A deputy medical examiner attributed this pattern to \"pressure applied to the neck.\" There also was a bruise at the front of Stingley's neck, she testified.\n\nShe noted that his asphyxia also could be linked to compression of the chest.\n\nDoctors put Stingley in a medically induced coma, attached him to a ventilator and inserted a feeding tube. As the situation became increasingly hopeless, his family spent Christmas at his bedside. Four days later, his parents made the agonizing decision to take him off life support.\n\nIn the New York subway case earlier this month, it took less than two weeks for the Manhattan district attorney to charge Daniel Penny, a former Marine, with second-degree manslaughter for the choking death of Jordan Neely, a homeless man who had yelled at other subway passengers. A prosecutor emphasized that Penny continued to choke Neely even after he stopped moving.\n\nPenny's lawyers have defended his actions by saying he was protecting himself and other passengers. Laumann, in contrast, never claimed Corey Stingley was a danger. But he did dispute that he put his arm around the teen's throat.\n\nInterviewed by police that night, Laumann, then 56, recalled \"just leaning on him.\"\n\nPressed by a detective, Laumann appeared less confident, saying, \"A headlock is when you got your arms locked, right? And I didn't have him locked.\" He added: \"I had my arm around like this, yeah, but I didn't have him in a headlock. Unless maybe I did, maybe I - I don't, no, I, I don't remember that, no.\"\n\nHis account conflicted with that of witnesses. And Laumann's older sibling Michael, also a former Marine, isn't so sure, either. Chokeholds are a part of basic combat skills, he said, used to restrain a person and take them down.\n\n\"That's the first thing they teach you, not only in boot camp but also in subsequent infantry training. It becomes an automatic restraint, to save your own life,\" Michael said. \"I'm not saying that Mario did that. Because I don't know the situation. But all I'm saying is that when you're in the Marine Corps you're taught how to save your own life. And to save the lives of your brotherhood. Sometimes it becomes, say, an automatic response.\"\n\nMichael Laumann said he and Mario - who died last year at age 65 - seldom talked, and when they did, the store incident never came up.\n\nMario Laumann, who worked in construction after leaving the Marines, lived about two miles from the store. His family had been dealing with a variety of crises. His wife was battling cancer. She had been arrested four years earlier for driving under influence of prescription medications. She died in 2013.\n\nAnd, by the time of the encounter with Stingley, Laumann's youngest son, Nickolas, was serving time in prison for sexual assault of a 15-year-old girl, intimidation of a victim and theft.\n\nWriting online while in prison, Nickolas said his father would \"scream at me\" for drug use and \"whoop my ass.\" The police report about Stingley's death notes that Laumann had been arrested twice for battery, but charges in both cases had been dismissed.\n\n\"Mario did have a temper,\" another brother, Mennas Laumann, said recently.\n\nThe three men who held Stingley down didn't know each other. Beringer, who lived next door to the food mart, told police he only recognized Laumann as \"a neighborhood guy.\"\n\nLike Laumann, Beringer had had previous encounters with police. In 1996, Beringer pulled a gun on a Pakistani-born man and told him he hated \"fucking Iranians,\" according to a police sergeant's sworn criminal complaint. Beringer pleaded guilty to misdemeanor gun charges and was jailed briefly then put on probation. A judge ordered him to complete a course in violence counseling or anger management and continue with mental health treatment, court records show.\n\nBeringer, who no longer lives in West Allis, declined to talk to ProPublica. He came to the door of his apartment building and when asked to discuss Stingley's death said, \"No, no, see you later,\" and closed the door.\n\nThe third man to wrestle Stingley to the ground, Cole, was a 25-year-old electrician who lived about a mile from the store. He'd gone there to get cigarettes. The prior year he had pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, for carrying a Glock handgun in the center console of his car and a magazine with 11 hollow-point bullets in the glove box. Cole didn't respond to ProPublica's attempts for comment.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the incident, all three men cooperated with police.\n\nCole said that as he and the others tried to halt Stingley's attempt to flee, the teen took a swing at him and landed a punch. He ended up with a black eye.\n\nAsked by police why he restrained the teen, Laumann replied: \"Because he's a thief.\"\n\nSeveral days after the struggle, West Allis police arrested Laumann and processed him for second-degree reckless injury. It was up to Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm to decide whether to prosecute him and the other men.\n\nChisholm eventually arranged for a judicial proceeding where sworn testimony could be heard. There, the three men invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in declining to answer questions. The original witnesses recounted seeing Stingley grabbed around the throat.\n\nThough Farrell said he couldn't recall telling police that Laumann was \"squeezing the hell out of\" Stingley, he didn't back away from his original description of a chokehold.\n\nMonths went by with no word on charges. But Craig Stingley, a facilities engineer, couldn't just sit and wait. He rallied support from politicians in the community and tried to keep the pressure on Chisholm.\n\nStingley brought state Sen. Lena Taylor to meetings with the prosecutor to discuss the case. They came away discouraged. Taylor got the impression that the case was challenging for prosecutors on many levels. The video was not sharp, for one thing. Taylor also believed that race relations in Milwaukee County fed Chisholm's concern that a jury might not convict anyone in the case.\n\nAt one meeting, Taylor said, she questioned what would have happened if the people involved had been of different races. \"They wouldn't let a group of Black guys do that to a young white guy, without any consequences,\" she said.\n\nMore than a year after the incident, in January 2014, Chisholm announced he would not bring charges, on the grounds that the men did not intend to injure or kill Stingley and didn't realize there was a risk to his life or health. \"It is clear that the purpose of restraining Corey Stingley was to hold him for police,\" Chisholm wrote in a five-page summary of his investigation.\n\n\"None of the actors were trained in the proper application of restraint,\" he added\n\nCorey's mother, Alicia Stingley, was stunned. \"It's just mind-boggling to me, just the decision that was made that it was more so because he didn't think he could win a case or didn't think what they did was on purpose,\" she said. \"There were no repercussions for a grown man taking a young child's life - by choking him.\"\n\nFor Craig Stingley, it's inconceivable the men did not know his son was in distress during the prolonged time they held him down. Applied properly, a chokehold \"can render an aggressor unconscious in as little as eight to thirteen seconds,\" according to a 2015 Marine Corps instructor guide.\n\nChisholm is still the district attorney. Through an assistant, he declined comment, citing the new review. Among the questions sent by ProPublica to Chisholm was whether he investigated Laumann's training in restraints as a Marine.\n\nChisholm's decision sparked media coverage and community protests. To Craig Stingley, Corey was more than a symbol, he was a cherished son.\n\n\"He was my buddy,\" Stingley said, describing how he and Corey would watch sports together. A skilled athlete, Corey Stingley was a running back on his high school football team and a member of the diving team. He took advanced placement classes in school and made the National Honor Society at school, his father said. He also worked part-time at an Arby's.\n\nHis social media accounts include references to girls and partying. It also catalogs his love of Batman, the Green Bay Packers and Christmas and shows him gently mocking his friends and family.\n\n\"My dad just got texting and he's experimenting with winky faces,\" he wrote in 2012, ending with \"#ohlord.\"\n\nCraig Stingley and his ex-wife filed a wrongful death suit in 2015 against the three men and the convenience store, which led to a settlement. Records show that Laumann's homeowners insurance paid $300,000, as did Cole's. (Beringer didn't have homeowner's insurance.) There was no admission of wrongdoing by the defendants. In court filings the three men said their actions were legal and justified, citing self-defense and their need to respond to \"an emergency.\"\n\nA good portion of the proceeds from the suit went to pay for hospital and funeral costs and lawyer fees, Stingley said.\n\nIn the civil suit, an expert forensic pathologist hired by the Stingley family's lawyer concluded the teen died because his chest was compressed and he was strangled.\n\n\"Once his airway became completely obstructed,\" Dr. Jeffrey Jentzen of the University of Michigan wrote, \"Corey would have experienced severe air hunger, conscious fear, suffering and panic with an impending sense of his own death for a period of 30 seconds to approximately one minute until he was rendered into a fully unconscious state.\"\n\nCraig Stingley still obsessed about what had happened and how to revive a criminal case. He relived his son's death over and over, watching the surveillance video of his last moments frame by frame, looking for something new.\n\nUsing a movie maker app on his computer, he slowed the video down and grabbed individual frames. He concluded that Cole initially had his son in a headlock, but that Laumann too had an arm around his neck before bringing him to the ground. That conflicted with Laumann's statement to police.\n\nStingley took his findings to the West Allis police, where a detective agreed they'd missed this detail. The department wrote a supplemental report for Chisholm, who asked a judge to appoint a special prosecutor for another look.\n\nRacine District Attorney Patricia Hanson got the case in October 2017. But what followed was more waiting.\n\nStingley said he called Hanson's office routinely in the years that followed, but she never met with him. Reached via email recently, Hanson declined to comment.\n\nThe case \"has not even been assigned a referral or case number after three years in that office,\" state Rep. Evan Goyke complained in a December 2020 letter to Milwaukee County Circuit Court Chief Judge Mary Triggiano. \"This is unacceptable,\" he wrote.\n\nIn later correspondence, Triggiano noted Hanson had refused to say when her decision would be forthcoming because in the midst of the pandemic, she had a lot of cases needing attention.\n\nIn March 2021, Hanson told the court in a one-page memo that she had reviewed Chisholm's file and agreed with his earlier decision: \"I do not find that criminal charges are appropriate at this time.\"\n\nJohn Doe proceedings allowing citizens to directly ask a court to consider criminal charges date back to 1839, when Wisconsin was still a territory, according to an account in state supreme court records. The law is used infrequently, legal experts said, and rarely successfully.\n\nPetitions have been filed by prisoners, by activists alleging animal cruelty in research experiments and by citizens claiming police misconduct. The efforts typically fail, ProPublica found in reviewing court dockets, news accounts and appellate rulings. In Milwaukee County, Wisconsin's most populous, there were only 19 such cases in 2020, dockets show, including Stingley's. None succeeded.\n\nOther states have similar methods of giving citizens a voice, but none are exactly like Wisconsin's. According to the National Crime Victim Law Institute, six states - Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Oklahoma - allow private citizens to gather signatures to petition a judge to convene a grand jury to investigate an alleged crime. In Pennsylvania, individuals can file a criminal complaint with the district attorney; if rejected, they can appeal to the court to ask it to order the district attorney to prosecute.\n\nMilwaukee attorney Scott W. Hansen, who has served as special prosecutor in a John Doe case, is critical of the Wisconsin process. He said it allows citizens to present a one-sided, skewed version of facts to a judge, \"without benefit of cross-examination or adverse witnesses.\"\n\nThe law, however, does state that the citizen's petition must present facts \"that raise a reasonable belief\" a crime was committed.\n\nFormer state Supreme Court Justice Janine Geske described the John Doe petition as a check and balance on prosecutors by citizens. \"If people believe a crime has been committed, and you've got prosecutors not living up to their responsibilities, and you think somebody ought to be held accountable, it's a way to have some judicial review,\" she said.\n\nStingley has known all along that the odds were against him, so turning to a longshot petition didn't daunt him. Writing to Chief Judge Triggiano in late 2020, he alleged \"dereliction and breach of legal duty\" by the Milwaukee and Racine county district attorneys to conduct thorough criminal investigations into his son's death.\n\nRead More\n\nTriggiano assigned the case to Judge Milton Childs. He formally appointed Ozanne, the first Black district attorney in Wisconsin, as special prosecutor last July. Ozanne's inquiry has included reviews of court transcripts and interviews with West Allis police and others.\n\nCraig Stingley was pleased that Ozanne and his staff met with him for several hours to listen to his concerns and to hear about his son.\n\n\"When I left that meeting,\" Stingley said, \"my son got his humanity back.\"\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nOn the twentieth anniversary of the assault weapons ban, a look at why politicians and the public support a policy that showed no evidence of saving lives.\n\nby Lois Beckett\n\nThis story was co-published with the New York Times .\n\nOver the past two decades, the majority of Americans in a country deeply divided over gun control have coalesced behind a single proposition: The sale of assault weapons should be banned.\n\nThat idea was one of the pillars of the Obama administration's plan to curb gun violence, and it remains popular with the public. In a poll last December, 59 percent of likely voters said they favor a ban.\n\nBut in the 10 years since the previous ban lapsed, even gun control advocates acknowledge a larger truth: The law that barred the sale of assault weapons from 1994 to 2004 made little difference.\n\nIt turns out that big, scary military rifles don't kill the vast majority of the 11,000 Americans murdered with guns each year. Little handguns do.\n\nIn 2012, only 322 people were murdered with any kind of rifle, F.B.I. data shows.\n\nThe continuing focus on assault weapons stems from the media's obsessive focus on mass shootings, which disproportionately involve weapons like the AR-15, a civilian version of the military M16 rifle. This, in turn, obscures some grim truths about who is really dying from gunshots.\n\nAnnually, 5,000 to 6,000 black men are murdered with guns. Black men amount to only 6 percent of the population. Yet of the 30 Americans on average shot to death each day, half are black males.\n\nIt was much the same in the early 1990s when Democrats successfully pushed for a ban on \"assault weapons,\" a name derived from language the gun industry had used to market civilian versions of military guns. America was then suffering from a spike in gun crime and it seemed like a problem threatening everyone. Gun murders each year had been climbing: 11,000, then 13,000, then 17,000.\n\nDemocrats decided to push for a ban of what seemed like the most dangerous guns in America: assault weapons, which were presented by the media as the gun of choice for drug dealers and criminals, and which many in law enforcement wanted to get off the streets.\n\nThis politically defined category of guns - a selection of rifles, shotguns and handguns with \"military-style\" features - only figured in about 2 percent of gun crimes nationwide before the ban.\n\nHandguns were used in more than 80 percent of gun murders each year, but gun control advocates had failed to interest enough of the public in a handgun ban. Handguns were the weapons most likely to kill you, but they were associated by the public with self-defense. (In 2008, the Supreme Court said there was a constitutional right to keep a loaded handgun at home for self-defense.)\n\nBanning sales of military-style weapons resonated with both legislators and the public: Civilians did not need to own guns designed for use in war zones.\n\nOn Sept. 13, 1994, President Bill Clinton signed an assault weapons ban into law. It barred the manufacture and sale of new guns with military features and magazines holding more than 10 rounds. But the law allowed those who already owned these guns - an estimated 1.5 million of them - to keep their weapons.\n\nThe policy proved costly. Mr. Clinton blamed the ban for Democratic losses in 1994. Crime fell, but when the ban expired, a detailed study found no proof that it had contributed to the decline.\n\nThe ban did reduce the number of assault weapons recovered by local police, to 1 percent from roughly 2 percent.\n\n\"Should it be renewed, the ban's effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement,\" a Department of Justice-funded evaluation concluded.\n\nStill, the majority of Americans continued to support a ban on assault weapons.\n\nOne reason: The use of these weapons may be rare over all, but they're used frequently in the gun violence that gets the most media coverage, mass shootings.\n\nThe criminologist James Alan Fox at Northeastern University estimates that there have been an average of 100 victims killed each year in mass shootings over the past three decades. That's less than 1 percent of gun homicide victims.\n\nBut these acts of violence in schools and movie theaters have come to define the problem of gun violence in America.\n\nMost Americans do not know that gun homicides have decreased by 49 percent since 1993 as violent crime also fell, though rates of gun homicide in the United States are still much higher than those in other developed nations. A Pew survey conducted after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., found that 56 percent of Americans believed wrongly that the rate of gun crime was higher than it was 20 years ago.\n\nEven as homicide rates have held steady or declined for most Americans over the last decade, for black men the rate has sometimes risen. But it took a handful of mass shootings in 2012 to put gun control back on Congress's agenda.\n\nAfter Sandy Hook, President Obama introduced an initiative to reduce gun violence. He laid out a litany of tragedies: the children of Newtown, the moviegoers of Aurora, Colo. But he did not mention gun violence among black men.\n\nTo be fair, the president's first legislative priority after Sandy Hook was universal background checks, a measure that might have shrunk the market for illegal guns used in many urban shootings. But Republicans in Congress killed that effort. The next proposal on his list was reinstating and \"strengthening\" bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. It also went nowhere.\n\n\"We spent a whole bunch of time and a whole bunch of political capital yelling and screaming about assault weapons,\" Mayor Mitchell J. Landrieu of New Orleans said. He called it a \"zero sum political fight about a symbolic weapon.\"\n\nMr. Landrieu and Mayor Michael A. Nutter of Philadelphia are founders of Cities United, a network of mayors trying to prevent the deaths of young black men. \"This is not just a gun issue, this is an unemployment issue, it's a poverty issue, it's a family issue, it's a culture of violence issue,\" Mr. Landrieu said.\n\nMore than 20 years of research funded by the Justice Department has found that programs to target high-risk people or places, rather than targeting certain kinds of guns, can reduce gun violence.\n\nDavid M. Kennedy, the director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, argues that the issue of gun violence can seem enormous and intractable without first addressing poverty or drugs. A closer look at the social networks of neighborhoods most afflicted, he says, often shows that only a small number of men drive most of the violence. Identify them and change their behavior, and it's possible to have an immediate impact.\n\nWorking with Professor Kennedy, and building on successes in other cities, New Orleans is now identifying the young men most at risk and intervening to help them get jobs. How well this strategy will work in the long term remains to be seen.\n\nBut it's an approach based on an honest assessment of the real numbers.\n\nRead our previous coverage: Why Gun Control Groups Have Moved Away from an Assault Weapons Ban\n\nMore on guns and data: Why Don't We Know How Many People Are Shot Each Year in America and Myth vs. Fact: Violence and Mental Health\n\nAnd our recent collaboration with Essence magazine: The Hidden Cost of Gun Violence: Meet a Mother and Her Seven-Year-Old with PTSD\n\nCorrection, Sept. 12, 2014: An earlier version of this article incorrectly cited a statistic on the use of handguns in killings in the United States in the early 1990s. They were used in more than 80 percent of gun murders - not all murders. Also, this article has been clarified to note that before Democrats succeeded in banning a category of guns called \"assault weapons,\" the firearms industry had used similar language to market civilian semiautomatic versions of military guns.\n\nLois Beckett\n\nLois Beckett is a ProPublica reporter covering politics, big data and information privacy issues.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "The Question Bridge Project: Redefining Black Male Identity\n\nQuestion Bridge: Black Males is an innovative transmedia art project that aims to facilitate a dialog between black men from diverse and contending backgrounds and create a platform for representing and redefining black male identity. Conceptual artist Hank Willis Thomas writes for LightBox about the ideas and motivations behind the project.\n\nLiving in mainstream society in the 21st century - a critical period in American history - requires us to constantly challenge and modify our behaviors, values and ideas about long-standing norms. In recent years, many people from traditionally marginalized communities have been able to transcend gender, cultural, racial, and economic boundaries, while others - African American men, in particular - have found themselves increasingly burdened with institutional constraints. Even with Barack Obama in the White House, many black men are still racially profiled; they are severely overrepresented in prisons; they suffer disproportionately from various preventable health risks and violent crimes. Even more disheartening is the level to which they are over-disciplined in the criminal justice system for the same offenses compared to \"whites\" convicted of similar crimes.\n\nQuestion Bridge was conceived by my collaborator, Chris Johnson, in 1996. Chris felt that art is \"too often considered to be something that can be valuable without being useful.\" The purpose of a Question Bridge is to use art to create a safe setting for honest expression, healing dialog and understanding within a community.\n\nOver the past five years, Chris and I, along with Bayeté Ross Smith, Kamal Sinclair, Jesse Williams and a growing team of artists have traveled the country and video-recorded nearly 1500 questions-and answer-exchanges from 160 self-identifying black men. We have created a video art installation that is traveling the country, a youth development curriculum and specialized community engagement events. We are currently developing an interactive website, a book and accompanying documentary. The project aims to spark a paradigm shift in consciousness around black identity that removes two critical obstacles facing the modern black male: exclusion from \"the other\" and estrangement from each other.\n\nA sample question from the project.\n\nThere is as much diversity within any demographic as there is outside of it. Why should anyone be confined to another's definition of who they are? The craziest thing about \"blackness\" is that \"black people\" didn't create it. Europeans, with a commercial interest in creating a sub- or nonhuman order of being that could be traded as a commodity, fabricated the concept of a \"black race.\" Nearly every virtue or characteristic ordinarily ascribed to human beings was stripped away as justification for the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The residue of this ancient mythology continues to corrode our discourse. Africa is a huge continent with hundreds of millions of souls, thousands of religions, histories, languages and cultures. Could such a galaxy of existences be reduced to a single, simple word? The persistent struggle for generations of Americans of African descent has been to turn a concept designed to relegate and regulate us into something beautiful and laudable. Millions have succeeded, but even more still fight the battle against implicit bias .\n\nThe depiction of black males through popular culture has long been governed by prevailing stereotypes about race and sexuality. Far too little is known about the range of internal values and dynamics of this group. Thousands of scientists, social scientists, theorists, historians, politicians and activists have investigated the \"plight\" of the African American male on various levels and from diverse perspectives, yet not enough has been done to create and find a multifaceted and, critically, a self-determined representation of this demographic. In some ways, the black male's greatest challenges reside within himself, and between other black men. The question is, \"why?\"\n\nQuestion Bridge: Black Males opens a window onto the complex and often invisible dialogs among African American men. \"Blackness\" ceases to be a simple, monochromatic concept, while the project urges the participants themselves to be at once the researchers and the subjects. Thus, not only the participants but the project's witnesses are freed to recognize each black man as an individual with limitless potential, released from the constraints of low-expectation stereotypes\n\nUltimately, however, in a very real sense, the project is not about black men at all. It's about what happens when people are put into groups, how they relate to the idea of the group and to others within it. This is a human experience. We live in a moment where we are outgrowing authoritative, grand narratives written by our \"leaders.\" Nearly every boundary has become permeable. We have a greater understanding of the value of each of our voices and the importance of listening to a variety of perspectives before forming our own conclusion about a given issue. Our greatest hope for this project is to complicate any simple definition of a group to the point where people no longer feel comfortable saying \"black men are...\" If we are successful in this broad endeavor, then we believe the Question Bridge methodology can be replicated and applied to address a broad range of human issues. This is only the beginning.\n\nQuestion Bridge: Black Males will be on view at Jack Shainman Gallery in New York from  July 11 - August 17, 2013, at the Milwaukee Art Museum in Milwaukee, Wis. from June 12 - September 5, 2013 and at the Exploratorium Museum in San Francisco from May 1, 2013 - May 1, 2014.\n\nHank Willis Thomas is an artist whose work frequently deals with perception, identity and popular culture.

      "text": "These 5 Facts Explain America's Enduring Racial Divide\n\nB altimore was two months ago. Ferguson was eight months before that. And now Charleston. For many black Americans, there really are two Americas. As a thought experiment, we looked at the health, wealth and other stats on black America, and compared it internationally. The results show that America-all of America-needs to do much, much better.\n\n1. Education\n\nEducation is supposed to be the great equalizer. The world may not be fair, but it's supposed to be a lot fairer within the four walls of a classroom. But the numbers tell a different story. African Americans are twice as likely as whites not to finish high school. If white America were a country, its high school graduation rates would rank with the likes of the U.K. and Finland; black America would be on par with Chile and Poland. Black students are suspended and expelled at roughly three times the rate of their white counterparts. Of students who receive multiple suspensions, 42 percent are black; and 34 percent of students expelled are black. And the world they are sent out to isn't much kinder.\n\n( US News , OECD , US News )\n\n2. Wealth\n\nWhat happens after high school? 21% of whites end up successfully completing a college degree, compared to only 13% of blacks. But even if they achieve that milestone, the payoff is nowhere near the same. A white family at the median sees a return of approximately $56,000 after completing a four-year degree; a black family sees a return of around $4,900. In fact, \"black household wealth is just over the median wealth of an adult\" in the Palestinian territories, which is not a comparison you want to see made about any group living in America in 2015. Looking at GDP per capita, blacks make $23,000 compared to the U.S. national average of $53,000. If black America really were its own country, it would be ranked 44th globally on that figure-between crisis-hit Portugal and post-Communist Lithuania. The most damning statistic? The median black household has just 6 percent of the total wealth ($7,113) that the median white household has ($111,146).\n\n( US News , Forbes , Atlantic , Politifact , Forbes , Washington Post )\n\n3. Health\n\nNo surprise, a less wealthy lifetime means a less healthy lifetime-and it starts from the beginning. Infant mortality for blacks in America is 11.5 for every 1,000 births; the figure for whites is 5.2. Black Americans' rates put them with the likes of Mexico (12.58) and Thailand (9.86), whereas white Americans are much closer to Switzerland (3.73) and Japan (2.13). That's how the racial disparity starts, but how does it end? Black Americans can expect to live a full four years less on average than whites, who on average make it to 79. A life expectancy of 75 years places black Americans below Tunisia, Panama, Costa Rica and Cuba.\n\n( US News , Economist )\n\n4. Incarceration\n\nFrom bad to worse: 1 in 3 black males will go to prison at some point in their life if current trends continue, compared to 1 in 17 white males. Women fare better, but not much-black women are incarcerated at (only) twice the rate that white women are across the country. Overall, blacks only make up some 14 percent of the national population, but are 38 percent of the total prison population. If black America were its own country, it would rank No. 3 on the world list of absolute prison incarceration, ahead of Russia, Brazil, India and Thailand. And once in prison, it gets worse; 60 percent of all prisoners sent to solitary confinement are black.\n\n( Huffington Post , US Department of Justice , Salon , International Center for Prison Studies , Salon )\n\n5. Violence\n\nAmerica's homicide rate is a national tragedy-but it's much worse if you're black. White America's rate of 2.5 deaths per 100,000 is just somewhat higher than Finland (2.0), Belgium (1.7) and Greece (1.7). But at 19.4 deaths per 100,000 people, black America's homicide rate puts it above Burma (15.2) and just below Nigeria (20.0). But it's fatal police shootings where the figures become truly tragic. If you are a young black male in America today, you are 21 times more likely to be shot and killed by a police officer than if you are a young white male. If you're black, you're also more than twice as likely to be shot and killed by a police officer while unarmed. Over the past year, 41 percent of all unarmed people killed by police were black.\n\nAmerica is better than this. It's about time we show it.\n\n( FiveThirtyEight , ProPublica , Guardian , Salon )\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Education: Fighting The Failure Syndrome\n\nT he signs of crisis are everywhere. Nearly 1 in 4 black men, ages 20 to 29, is in jail, on probation or on parole. Black men are less likely to attend college than black females or whites of either gender, and when they do go, they often drop out. Homicide, including fatalities resulting from clashes with police, is the leading cause of death among black males, ages 15 through 34. Says Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan: \"When you look at a long list of social pathologies, you find black men No. 1.\"\n\nTo reverse this downward spiral, a vocal minority of black educators are pushing a radical idea: putting elementary-school-age black boys in separate classrooms, without girls or whites, under the tutelage of black male teachers. Critics of the proposal say segregating classrooms by race and gender flies in the face of more than 25 years of civil rights gains. But supporters argue that such concerns are less important than the urgent need to rescue African-American males from a future of despair and self-destruction. \"The boys need more attention,\" says Spencer Holland, a Washington educational psychologist and champion of the black-male classroom concept. \"The girls are not killing each other.\"\n\nAdvocates of this approach believe low expectations and low self-esteem are largely responsible for the poor academic performance of African-American boys. A recent study of the New Orleans public schools, for example, showed that black males accounted for 80% of the expulsions, 65% of the suspensions and 58% of the nonpromotions, even though they made up just 43% of the students. \"Black boys are viewed by their teachers as hyperactive and aggressive,\" says Jewelle Taylor Gibbs, a clinical psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Very early on, they get labeled.\"\n\nThe absence of positive male role models may also cripple black boys' development. Nationally, 55.3% of black families with children under 18 are maintained by the mother, many of them living in inner cities. Moreover, most elementary-school teachers are female, leading black boys to view academic success as \"feminine.\"\n\nBill Cosby, Jesse Jackson and other black celebrities are too remote to offer realistic models of responsible manhood. The adult males whom many black boys try to emulate come from their own neighborhoods, and in tough urban areas, these \"models\" are all too often involved in drugs and crime. One , lesson boys learn from such men is that doing well in school is for sissies or, worse yet, for blacks who are trying to \"act white.\"\n\nThree years ago, in an attempt to overcome these problems, a school in Florida's Dade County opened two classrooms for black boys with no fathers at home, one in kindergarten and one in first grade. The results were encouraging. Daily attendance rates increased 6%, test scores jumped 6% to 9%, and there was a noticeable decrease in hostility. But after only a year, the U.S. Education Department brought an abrupt halt to the experiment because it violated civil rights laws.\n\nSince then, the closest thing to a black-males-only class is an effort in Washington, run by a group called Concerned Black Men. Launched two years ago at Stanton Elementary School, in the city's drug-infested southeast section, the program brings some three dozen black male lawyers, architects and other professionals into second-grade classrooms each week as teachers and mentors.\n\nAlthough the classes include both genders, the main goal is to lift the sights and spirits of black boys, most of whom live only with their mothers or grandmothers. \"The whole concept is to get the kids to look at themselves,\" says Albert Pearsall III, a computer security-programs manager at the U.S. Department of Justice who teaches black history, along with a traditional second-grade curriculum. \"If I can work effectively in a professional career, why can't these kids?\"\n\nSome critics of the all-black, all-male classroom idea are concerned that separating students by sex and race could intensify black boys' feelings of anger and inferiority. Others argue that the notion's underlying assumptions do not hold up. If poor, female-headed families are bad for black boys, they say, then they must be equally disastrous for black girls and whites of both sexes.\n\nDetractors also contend that there is no clear link between self-esteem and academic performance and that a variety of people - not just black men - can effectively teach African-American boys. \"It's helpful to have role models from one's own group,\" says child psychiatrist James Comer, director of the Child Study Center at Yale. \"But there's probably no need to have role models exclusively from that group.\"\n\nSupporters counter that black males are more frequently tracked into special-education classes than black girls or their white peers and would be no worse off segregated for normal instruction. \"Black boys are already in classes by themselves,\" points out Jawanza Kunjufu, author of Countering the Conspiracy to Destroy Black Boys.\n\nSuch passionate debate makes it unlikely that primary-grade classrooms for black boys will become the norm anytime soon. Still, unless something else is done to make single-parent black homes more supportive of these children, or to help reduce their soaring dropout and suspension rates, the idea could attract more disciples - ironically hastening the day when \"separate but equal\" may actually help black youths rather than hurt them.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "YES, BLACKS CAN MAKE IT ON THEIR OWN\n\nT hose of us old enough to remember the civil rights revolution of the '60s and the profound social transformations that preceded it may find it hard to realize that most Americans today were not yet born when all this happened.\n\nThis lack of personal knowledge is, for the unscrupulous, a golden opportunity to create a history that serves their own purposes. One of the key self-serving myths to emerge is that blacks owe their economic and social advancement to the civil rights victories of the '60s.\n\nIncessant repetition of myths does not, of course, make them true. Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom demonstrate in their newly published book that the economic rise of blacks was in fact more rapid in the '40s and '50s than in later decades.\n\nThat does not mean that the civil rights revolution was unnecessary. There were injustices that needed to be redressed and resistance to doing so, as the book acknowledges. But it also paints a vision of racial progress in America that we have seldom seen. Blacks have not advanced by being passive recipients of government largesse or by high-decibel rhetoric. Most have made money the old-fashioned way: they have earned it.\n\nAs of 1940, the average black adult had only a grossly inferior elementary school education. But as more blacks became better educated and left the South, incomes of black males rose faster than incomes of white males-all well before the civil rights revolution. More blacks rose into professional ranks in the years immediately before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than in the years immediately afterward.\n\nToo many black \"leaders\" today have a vested interest in the application of old myths. They are like Moses in reverse-leading their people back into the welfare state, to a self-imposed isolation from the growing opportunities all around them.\n\nTHOMAS SOWELL, a fellow at the Hoover Institution, is the author of several books on race.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Viewpoint: How We're All Victims of Racial Profiling\n\nI f Im walking down the sidewalk alone and notice a couple of young black guys heading in my direction, I intentionally do not cross the street. I dont clutch my bag a little tighter, or keep a hand on the rape whistle on my keychain. I want them to know that Im not afraid of them. Or, more to the point, that theyre not universally feared.\n\nI dont expect the young men to notice that I dont stiffen up. But I know they would notice if I did, because I have two younger brothers, aged 19 and 25. Their honey-colored skin, a few shades lighter than mine, and Asian eyes dont prevent random strangers from viewing them simply as Young Black Men - which they are by about half - and, therefore, potentially dangerous, which they definitely are not. And surely their non-physical traits, like being highly educated and classically trained musicians, get lost amidst the ski jackets and low-riding pants my youngest brother in particular favors. The same is true of countless black men and boys, whose fashion choices, large headphones and, yes, skin color might seem to some to belie the true nature of their personalities.\n\nIt may seem foolish, or patronizing, of me. But people conduct this kind of internal dialogue all the time; its practically unavoidable in our multi-ethnic, politically correct society, where stereotypes and reality collide more often than people would like to think, or admit. While I want to believe that my motivation is benevolent, I recognize the irony of trying to offset racial profiling by engaging in what amounts to just another form of it.\n\nTheres a fine line between trying to counteract the blanket suspicion of others and trying to assuage your own prejudiced tendencies. Sandra Bullock put it worst in the movie Crash: I just had a gun pointed in my face and it was my fault because I knew it was gonna happen, her character says after getting carjacked by two young black guys. But if a white person sees two black men walking towards her and she turns and walks away, she's a racist, right? Well I got scared and I didn't do anything and ten seconds later I had a gun in my face.\n\nThats the kind of sentiment that makes black people outwardly enraged - while inwardly we cringe about the very real harm it has on our community. Members of every minority group, after all, are fully aware of how the greater society views them. But it's not just that they are personally offended by such bigotry - it's also pragmatism. The way you are perceived-by parents, teachers and, yes, random strangers-affects the person you become and how far you go in life.\n\nAccording to a front-page article in last week's New York Times, young black men aren't only worse off than whites, Latinos and black women, but they're also worse off than they were just a few years ago. More than a fifth of black males in their 20s who did not go to college were incarcerated in 2004, up from 16 percent in 1995. Black males without a high school diploma-and they account for more than half of all black men -were in 2004 more than twice as likely as white males without a high school diploma to be jobless (72 and 34 percent, respectively).\n\nThese numbers tread depressingly familiar territory, though it is a surprise that the bad news seems to be getting worse. Just as troubling is the fact that profiling of young black men isnt merely detrimental to the black community, but to the economy as a whole. As these disturbing statistics get worse, they act as more and more of a drain on precious government resources-from welfare and Medicaid to unemployment payments.\n\nThough it may not be all that shocking to hear that employers are reluctant to hire people whove served time, there's a lesser-known side of the tragedy: it turns out that the mere existence of those black men whove gone to prison can also ruin the job prospects of black men without criminal records, according to several studies conducted by Georgetown University economist Harry Holzer and several colleagues.\n\nHolzer asked employers of low-skilled jobs whether they would hire someone whod been to prison and whether they conduct background checks on applicants to find out. The answers were a bit surprising-especially for prisoner advocates who have come out against background checks. Employers who said they conducted such checks were, in fact, more likely to hire black males overall than those who didnt bother.\n\nWithout these checks, Holzer told me, \"employers might still be wondering whether black guys that didn't say they have criminal records might simply not be reporting it.\" Translation: Employers without the time or inclination to discern whether job applicants are criminals err on the safe side and assume that all young black applicants are criminals-or at least incompetent. No wonder unemployment is sky-high in urban areas.\n\nThis statistical discrimination is the same instinct that leads women to clutch their purses at the glimpse of a dark young man down the block. And its understandable, to a degree. But I can only imagine the emotional-and yes, economic-toll it takes on this entire swath of young men.\n\nAn Asian friend of mine recently commented, delicately, on a chip-on-the-shoulder attitude he often senses from black men. This could be construed as a racist remark; surely, tons of white guys have chips on their shoulders. But that doesnt necessarily make my friends observation untrue. Among the many reasons an individual may have to be defensive, a cloud of suspicion constantly hanging over you must be among the most psychologically persuasive.\n\nThis country has come a long way since the Civil Rights Act was passed, but most black men would surely tell you that racial profiling-in all its many, insidious forms-remains a frustrating, demoralizing and all-too-common experience. As Dave Chappelle noted to Oprah when explaining the racism he felt he encountered in show business, What is a black man without his paranoia intact?

Last week a report issued by the Sentencing Project, a Washington-based organization that promotes research on criminal justice, found that approximately 609,000 African-American males between the ages of 20 and 29 - almost 1 of every 4 - are either in prison, on probation or on parole. Comparable figures for whites are 1 in 16 and for Hispanics 1 in 10.\n\nOnly 436,000 black males in the same age group are enrolled in college or any other form of higher education.

      "text": "Endangered Species\n\nN o matter what the courts eventually decide about the police shooting in New York City of Amadou Diallo, the mild-mannered African immigrant who was laid to rest in his native Guinea last week, many African Americans will agree with Johnnie Cochran that Diallo's death was yet another summary execution of an innocent black man by white racist cops. How else would you describe four members of an elite anticrime squad with a reputation for aggressiveness firing 41 shots at a skinny 22-year-old street merchant armed with nothing but a pager?\n\nWell, you could call it business as usual. The sad truth is that in far too many places in America, black life is cheap. As outrageous as the police conduct in the Diallo case seems to have been, it is only a highly publicized example of the slaughter that has made black men an endangered species. Despite overall declines in the homicide rate, murder at the hands of another black man remained the leading cause of death for black males ages 15 to 24 through much of the '90s.\n\nThe underlying causes of the carnage-drugs, poor schooling, high unemployment and the breakdown of the family-are no secret. But there's another factor that gets less attention: the conduct of the police. The Black Panthers may be defunct, but many inner-city residents agree with them that the cops are an occupation army more concerned with keeping minorities in check than with fighting crime. Special squads like the N.Y.P.D.'s street-crime unit, whose members killed Diallo, stop and frisk tens of thousands of people whose only crime is being black. Despite lawsuits by the A.C.L.U., African-American motorists are routinely pulled over by police in many states for DWB-driving while black. Such tactics make it clear that to some cops, every black male is a suspect.\n\nDecades of police abuse have completely destroyed inner-city residents' confidence in the criminal-justice system, argues Elijah Anderson, a social scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, in his forthcoming book, Code of the Streets: Decency, Violence and the Moral Life of the Inner City. The result is an every-man-a-vigilante mentality that makes violence inevitable. \"Even decent people in inner-city neighborhoods are so distrustful of the police that they feel they have no choice but to take matters of personal defense into their own hands,\" says Anderson. \"Instead of relying on the police to protect them, they let other people know that they can defend themselves with overwhelming force, which these days means having a gun and being willing to use it.\" The inflated sense of confidence that packing a gun engenders, especially in young men, can easily escalate a petty argument into a fatal confrontation. Step on somebody's shoes, and you could wind up dead.\n\nAnderson says the heavy-handed tactics police employ to control the violence only make things worse, because they convince the vast majority of law-abiding inner-city residents that cops are the enemy. Unfortunately, too many people-and too many politicians, such as New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani-have not made the connection. As Hugh Price of the National Urban League puts it, even poor people have \"a right to be protected by the police, not be preyed on by them.\" Until the cops figure that out, it will be open season on black men.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Racial Tensions in the U.S. Are Helping to Fuel a Rise in Black Gun Ownership\n\nL uther Thompson never thought he'd be a gun owner. But in April, the 41-year-old obtained a concealed carry license and bought his first firearm-a $400 Smith & Wesson pistol-after feeling, for the first time, that he was not safe raising a family in the South as a Black man.\n\n\"Down here, it's totally different,\" he says. \"They're bold with their racism.\"\n\nThe purchase came two months after a white father and son fatally shot Ahmaud Arbery while the 25-year-old Black man was jogging. The killing stunned Thompson, a father of five, who lives in Cartersville, Ga., about 300 miles away from where Arbery was gunned down. \"I never visualized that it would be this way,\" he says.\n\nThompson's concerns have only grown since the election, as President Donald Trump refuses to concede and as his supporters grow angrier over what they falsely believe was a stolen election. On Saturday, thousands of Trump voters protested the election results at a rally in Washington, D.C., where violent clashes with counter-protesters erupted into the night. On Monday, the FBI reported the highest number hate crimes in the U.S. in a decade in 2019, with Black people the most numerous targets of racially-motivated bias crimes.\n\n\"It makes you feel on higher alert,\" Thompson says. \"I have to be able to protect my family.\"\n\nHow many white men are going to have guns pulled on them while they're jogging?\n\nAmid a record-breaking number of firearm sales, Thompson is among the nearly 6.9 million people in the U.S. who became first-time gun owners this year, according to estimates by the National Shooting Sports Foundation. The gun trade group said gun buyers were nearly 56% white males during the first six months of 2020, citing an industry survey of 104 retailers, which tracks with other national demographic surveys done on gun ownership trends. But there was a 58% jump in firearm purchases-the highest overall sales increase-among Black men and women, compared with the same period last year. The survey said 9% of new gun buyers were Black males and 5% were Black females.\n\n\"People are becoming very concerned for their personal safety,\" says Foundation spokesman Mark Oliva. \"That's not a concern of just white guys. That's a universal concern.\"\n\nSo far in 2020, the FBI has conducted more firearm background checks than any year on record-about 16.5 million as of October, according to the agency's latest figures . In October alone, there were an estimated 1.9 million firearm sales, a 65% jump from October 2019, according to Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting . Record sales have sparked ammunition shortages across the country.\n\nFear of the unknown has been a huge motivating factor. Retailers saw a growth in gun sales in March when the pandemic forced cities to shut down. Civil unrest and calls to defund the police following George Floyd's death in May-coupled with tensions surrounding the presidential election-sustained the uptick.\n\n\"It's been chaos outside,\" says Maj Toure, who created the advocacy group Black Guns Matter in 2016 to encourage more Black people to educate themselves about guns and arm themselves for self-defense. \"Black people are at the epicenter of all that.\"\n\nGun ownership is most common among white men, particularly those who live in rural areas and those who describe themselves as conservative, according to the Pew Research Center and other surveys . According to a 2015 report by the non-partisan research group NORC at the University of Chicago, 39% of white adults said they lived in a household with a firearm while 18% of Black adults did. But Thompson says Black Americans in 2020 are being driven to gun shops for different reasons than white Americans-most of whom buy guns for more than one purpose, including for protection but also for hunting and sport shooting, according to the Pew survey. \"How many white men are going to have guns pulled on them while they're jogging?\" Thompson says. \"It's a world of difference.\"\n\nAlthough the election is over, there's still a lot of tension out there.\n\nPhilip Smith, president of the National African American Gun Association, agrees. Shortly after Floyd's death, about 3,800 new members joined the group, which already has about 35,000 active members, Smith says. His association has seen a 15% increase in membership since the same time last year, with an average of 1,000 new members joining each month. Smith says about 80% of its new members this year are first-time gun owners. \"We've never had enrollment like that,\" he says, adding that social unrest pushed people to the tipping point and is likely to continue doing so.\n\n\"Although the election is over, there's still a lot of tension out there,\" Smith says. \"You can almost taste it out there, the friction.\"\n\nLike many of these new gun-owners, he worries about possible backlash from white supremacy groups who have been emboldened by Trump, who refused to directly disavow white supremacists and militia groups during the first presidential debate on Sept. 29. Instead, Trump told them to \"stand back and stand by,\" before shifting the conversation to issues surrounding far-left groups.\n\n\"One of the people that they use as a representative of their hopes and their aspirations is going to be taken down politically, and they're angry about that,\" Smith says. \"We're keeping our head on a swivel.\"\n\nApart from election-related reasons, the booming gun business may grow even more in November and December, which are generally the biggest months for gun sales due to the holidays and hunting season. \"We could see very well north of 20 million background checks before 2020 closes,\" Oliva says.\n\nGun-control advocates hope that's not true, saying firearms largely cause more harm than good, despite so many people purchasing them for self-protection. \"The irony of the whole thing is that the second you buy a gun, you are less safe,\" says Robyn Thomas, executive director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nThere have been more than 36,800 gun deaths and about 33,500 gun injuries in the U.S. so far in 2020, compared to about 33,500 deaths and roughly 25,300 injuries during the same time last year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which uses police and news reports and other government sources to tally daily gun-violence incidents.\n\nAccording to Thomas, people are three times more likely to die by suicide and twice as likely to die by homicide when there's a firearm in the home. She worries the gun industry is stoking public fear to sell more guns. \"They're saying you should be afraid of the world and buying this is going to make you safer, which is actually proven statistically untrue,\" she says. \"But people are not acting rationally right now. They're acting emotionally.\"\n\nMeanwhile, gun violence is surging in major cities, even as overall violent crime falls. In New York City, shootings have spiked about 94% year-to-date, according to the city's latest crime data , while rapes, robberies and felony assaults decreased. In Los Angeles, the number of shooting victims climbed 30% so far this year compared to the same time period last year, as total violent crimes went down. More than 750 guns have been stolen out of vehicles this year in Hillsborough County, Fla. and in Nashville , authorities said.\n\n\"It's just city after city,\" says Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. \"Homicides and shootings are what police chiefs are talking about.\"\n\nWhen it comes to self-defense, Thompson believes his firearm serves as \"more of a statement,\" deterring attackers to a degree and making himself less of a target. He carries his first firearm with him everywhere, leaves two at home and has one in each of his three cars. He's also become a collector, keeping some firearms more for hobby purposes than to carry as self-protection. Even with all these guns, he never feels fully comforted.\n\n\"You're never going to feel relief, but you feel a small sense of security,\" he says. \"I know I at least attempted to protect myself.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Are there more US black men in prison or college?\n\nAre there more black men in prison than in college in the United States?\n\nIt's an oft-repeated claim that there are more black men in prison in the US than in college. It's a good statistic that apparently gets to the heart of the problem of inequality in the US, but is it having a negative effect on young black men? And, more importantly, is it true?\n\nIn 2007, before he became a presidential candidate, Barack Obama took to the stage to address The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)\n\n\"I know what you know,\" he said. \"Despite all the progress that has been made, we still have more work to do. We have more work to do when more young black men languish in prison than attend universities and colleges across America.\"\n\nThe statement was greeted with cheering and applause. It was a rallying cry for the activists in the room to continue their fight against inequality.\n\nThe claim about African-Americans and college attendance was first published in 2002\n\nOne man who saw the power of the statement was Ivory Toldson - associate professor of psychology at Howard University in Washington DC and editor-in-chief of The Journal of Negro Education.\n\nHe has used the statistic himself in one of his own publications, but became aware that the continuing repetition was having a negative effect on young black men.\n\n\"These are young black males who are trying to figure it out. They know that they could do better and I started to feel that a lot of the statistics that we were using were more of a burden to them,\" he says.\n\nDespite this, the original claim can still be heard today.\n\n\"My last time hearing it was last Friday (7 March) at the Howard University Charter Day programme - it was the keynote speaker,\" Toldson says.\n\nHis reaction? \"Here we go again.\"\n\nLong before this, Toldson had noticed an interesting trend.\n\n\"I found that year after year we were gaining lots of black males in college,\" he says. But the prison population was remaining relatively static.\n\nA close look at the figures for 2009 showed that there were 600,000 more black male college and university students than black male prisoners. The story so often repeated was not true.\n\nBut had it been true before?\n\nThe statistic was first published by the campaign group The Justice Policy Institute , external in 2002, using figures from 2000.\n\nToldson compared those figures with the latest data, and noticed a suspicious jump in the number of black students attending college and university.\n\n\"How did we get a 108% jump in the black male college population?\" he says. \"It didn't seem feasible for us to achieve that in only 10 years,\" he says.\n\nHe found that a number of colleges reporting a lot of black students today, had reported none, or very few, back in 2000 - results he wrote up in a recent article for The Root , external .\n\n\"The first thing that jumped out was that right now there are 4,700 colleges that report black students. Ten years ago there were about 3,000,\" he says.\n\nThere are more than 100 historically black colleges and universities in the US\n\nHe found a number of historically black colleges and universities hadn't reported any black students in the first survey, including his own alma-mater Temple University in Philadelphia, where he was a student at the time.\n\nComparing the reported figures with census data from the time, he thinks that the original figures underestimated the number of black students by about 100,000 - and that there were more black men in college and university than in prison, even in 2000.\n\nThe Justice Policy Institute does not agree the original comparison was necessarily wrong.\n\n\"I cannot verify if it was wrong,\" says senior researcher Melissa Neal. \"Perhaps if all colleges were reporting, the statistic would still have been true. There's no way we can go back 13 years from now and pull that up.\"\n\nBut she does acknowledge that the report was based on limited data.\n\n\"At that time I'm not sure our researchers were really thinking about the number of colleges reporting. That was not a limitation we clearly expressed in our write up. I recognise we probably should have done a better job of that.\"\n\nShe says that while she's pleased that the gap between the number of black men in college and the number in prison is widening, there are still problems that need addressing.\n\n\"The reality is that African-American males are still disproportionately channelled into the criminal justice system and they are still not achieving, or able to have the same educational success as their peers of other races and other ethnicities,\" she says.\n\nBlack people account for 40% of the prison population in the US, but only 12% of the population overall.\n\nAnd, according to Toldson, black men still lag behind their white counterparts in terms of attendance at top-rated universities. The proportion of black male students who drop out before graduation is also higher than average.\n\nSo, he and the Justice Policy Institute agree on one thing - there is still work to be done.\n\nTrump questions Putin's desire for peace after meeting Zelensky at the Vatican\n\nThousands line streets of Rome as Pope Francis laid to rest after Vatican funeral\n\nWatch: How the Vatican said goodbye to Pope Francis\n\nYouTubers on how they made site work for them as it turns 20\n\n'I'm voting for the first time after fleeing a dictatorship'\n\nFrom prized artworks to bullet shells: how war devastated Sudan's museums\n\nSpring's hot weather to be treat for nature lovers\n\nHow much has Elon Musk's Doge cut from US government spending?\n\nCan India really stop river water from flowing into Pakistan?\n\nHairdresser fears she could lose home over tax hikes\n\nYungblud on keeping fans safe, and his 'shirt off era'\n\nRoyal Watch: Get the latest royal stories and analysis with Sean Coughlanâs weekly newsletter\n\nHollywood star, Andrew Garfield, uncovers his family history\n\nPanorama reveals how Lloyds Bank treated its customers\n\nOn the frontline with the London Ambulance Service\n\nYour first look at the final series of Man Like Mobeen\n\nCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.

The goal is to show how hard it is to define any group of people.\n\nQuestion Bridge originated in 1996, when artist Chris Johnson started an exchange of video-mediated conversations among the San Diego's African-American community.\n\nA decade later, Hank Willis Thomas approached Johnson about collaborating to establish a similar project focused on black men nationwide.\n\nOver the past four years, Johnson, along with Willis Thomas, Bayete Ross Smith and Kamal Sinclair, has travelled the US collecting questions and answers from more than 150 black men. The resulting video project contains over 1,500 exchanges. The executive producers are Jesse Williams, Dr. Deborah Willis, and Delroy Lindo.\n\nBy taking the project online, the same team aims now to collect the thoughts and questions of 200,000 black males and enable everyone else to join the debate.\n\nProduced by the BBC's Anna Bressanin\n\nLiving Online is a series of video features published every Tuesday on the BBC News website which takes a look at how technology converges with culture, and all aspects of our daily lives.\n\nBlack men on being black in America.

These responses help to reclaim a healthy sense of identity, inspiring and informing others.\"\n\nHe explained how his name was often changed by people who tried to call him \"Ollie\" or \"Oliver\".\n\nMr Osinoiki included women in his project \"Identity Matters\" because \"black British identity encompasses everyone\".\n\n\"At Mandem, the voice of women is incredibly important to us because part of our mission is to end the sexist oppression of women.\n\n\"As men, it is largely our responsibility to change our historically sexist ways of thinking,\" Mr Williams said.\n\nThe photographer said: \"'I am not a failure' represents the pride that many young black Brits are reclaiming, despite not following in the footsteps of their parents or other members of the older black generation - young black Brits are not judging themselves on the standards set by the older generation.\"\n\nMr Williams said the quote \"You don't have to cross the street\" came from his brother.\n\nHe said: \"It represents the insecure feeling that some young black men feel when walking down the street. There's a sense that white people have tended to cross the street when they see a young black male approaching.\n\n\"This is largely due to the negative gang-related/thug portrayal media coverage that surrounds young black males.\"\n\nMandem is hosting a debate at the Arnolfini arts centre in Bristol later asking has identity politics gone too far?\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Home schooling: Why more black US families are trying it\n\nUntil recently, home schooling in the US was mostly practised by white families, but a growing number in the black community are now also turning their back on the public school system and educating their children at home. Why?\n\n\"There were lots of fights and people getting shot,\" says Sonya Barbee.\n\n\"It was just too much. To me, it's not a good environment for a kid and even though I work full time, so it's really hard for me, I still feel like it's the right decision.\"\n\nSonya has not made life easy for herself. A single mother, who works for the US government, she now has the added burden of being a teacher to her 11-year-old son, Copeland.\n\nIt was not the violence, or even the fact that he was being bullied, that finally led to the decision to remove Copeland from his public school in what she describes as a \"really bad area\" of Washington DC, but the fact that he was \"losing his love of learning\".\n\nNow, with the help of her mother, who looks after Copeland two days a week while he works online, and a home schooling co-operative, she is hoping to \"rekindle the fire\". She herself teaches him after work and in the holidays.\n\nHer only regret so far is that Copeland is not more enthusiastic, saying he misses the \"madness\" of the classroom - although, she stresses, it is early days.\n\nUntil recently, Sonya's story would have been highly unusual in the United States.\n\nAbout two million, or 4%, of American children are home-schooled, according to the National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) - a rough estimate, as families do not have to register with the authorities in some states.\n\nBut home-schooling has traditionally been dominated by white Christian families in the rural south, who object to what they see as the public schools' liberal agenda on sex education and Darwinism.\n\nThe number of inner-city parents choosing to educate their children at home, for educational rather than religious reasons, has been growing for a while, but until recently few black families were thought to be among them, according to NHERI director Dr Brian Ray.\n\n\"For the African-American community there was a huge amount of pressure against it, because in America, the grandparents of today's home-schooled children fought for desegregation of schools. They thought, 'The public schools are going to save us,'\" he says.\n\nBut Dr Ray, who regularly interviews black home-schoolers as part of his research, says attitudes are changing fast - and it's also a lot easier today for black families to try it than it was 20 years ago, he points out.\n\nJoyce Burges, co-founder of National Black Home Educators, who home-schooled all five of her children, aged 16 to 35, says the practice is growing \"exponentially\" in the African American community.\n\n\"The failings of public schools have caused all of us, whether we are white or black, to come up with creative ideas about how we can educate children.\n\nMuseum trips are a big part of the home schooling experience\n\n\"That explains the rise of the co-ops and African Americans seeing that this is not just a white thing any more.\"\n\nDespite the desegregation of schools, the attainment gap between African-American and white students in American schools has barely changed since the 1960s. The problem is particularly acute among black boys.\n\nAccording to a 2008 study by the Schott Foundation: \"Over the last 25 years, the social, educational and economic outcomes for black males have been more systematically devastating than the outcomes for any other racial or ethnic group or gender.\"\n\nMonica Utsey, who runs a home schooling co-operative for African American children in Washington DC, says: \"African-American mothers, especially those who have boys, have a lot of trouble in the school system. The way the classroom is designed is more conducive for girls.\"\n\nFor her, though, the main motivation was cultural - she wanted her sons to learn about their African roots and not \"to believe that their history begins with slavery\".\n\nHome-schooled children, like Sia Li Wright, are given more freedom to grow, parents claim\n\nHome-schoolers are scathing about the way public schools teach to the test, at the expense of providing what they see as a rounded education.\n\nAnother common complaint is that teachers are too ready to blame behavioural problems on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and encourage them to medicate their children with drugs such as Ritalin or Adderall.\n\n\"The teachers are always telling the parents they have to drug their kids, like they have some kind of problem. It's just crazy.\" says Sonya Barbee. \"You don't want your kid to be a zombie.\"\n\nHome-schooling co-operatives, where lessons are held in mixed age groups by parents, have sprung up in cities across America in recent years, helping to break the social isolation critics of home schooling often warn about.\n\nBut even its most ardent advocates concede that home schooling is not for everyone.\n\nOnly the most committed parents, who want to be involved in every aspect of their child's development and enjoy spending time with them, can make it work.\n\nNot all parents can keep up with the demands of the curriculum, particularly if they want their offspring to go to college. Many children who are home-schooled in their early years return to the class room when they reach secondary school age.\n\nIt is also does nothing to address standards in public schools which, some experts say, will fall still further if highly-motivated and engaged parents start taking their children out of them, harming the African-American community as a whole.\n\nJoyce Burges believes the day could soon be approaching when the local home-schooling co-operative, run by a group of committed parents, could be a real alternative to the public school, for children of all ages and ethnicities.\n\nThe demand certainly appears to be there.\n\n\"I get emails and phone calls from people all the time who want to know if there is someone that can home-school their child,\" says Monica Utsey. \"I tell them that it doesn't work like that. It's really the parents' responsibility.\"\n\nThe Schott Foundation - 50 State Black Boys Report\n\nStanford University\n\nNational Black Home Educators\n\nNational Home Education Research Institute\n\nTrump questions Putin's desire for peace after meeting Zelensky at the Vatican\n\nThousands line streets of Rome as Pope Francis laid to rest after Vatican funeral\n\nWatch: How the Vatican said goodbye to Pope Francis\n\nYouTubers on how they made site work for them as it turns 20\n\n'I'm voting for the first time after fleeing a dictatorship'\n\nFrom prized artworks to bullet shells: how war devastated Sudan's museums\n\nSpring's hot weather to be treat for nature lovers\n\nHow much has Elon Musk's Doge cut from US government spending?\n\nCan India really stop river water from flowing into Pakistan?\n\nHairdresser fears she could lose home over tax hikes\n\nYungblud on keeping fans safe, and his 'shirt off era'\n\nRoyal Watch: Get the latest royal stories and analysis with Sean Coughlanâs weekly newsletter\n\nHollywood star, Andrew Garfield, uncovers his family history\n\nPanorama reveals how Lloyds Bank treated its customers\n\nOn the frontline with the London Ambulance Service\n\nYour first look at the final series of Man Like Mobeen\n\nCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.

      "text": "The black cop who has a problem with 'Black Lives Matter'\n\n\"Black Lives do not matter to most black people...Only the lives that are taken at the hands of cops or white people, matter.\"\n\nThat is the conclusion of a strongly-worded post , external that has been shared more than 130,000 times on Facebook and has racked up hundreds of thousands of views on other media platforms such as Imgur , external .\n\nWhile the sentiment is provocative, it is the identity of the author that triggered particular interest. Jay Stalien's profile indicates he is an active police officer in Florida and previously Baltimore. And he is black.\n\nThe post was published last weekend, amid mounting racial tensions across America following the murder of five Dallas officers at a protest held over the police killings of two African-American men in Minnesota and Louisiana. Stalien, who says he is a Brooklyn native, was particularly scathing about Black Lives Matter , questioning whether the lives of police officers (including ones who are African-American) were as important to the movement, as black civilians killed by white police officers.\n\n\"I couldn't help but wonder if it had been me, a black man, a black cop, on TV, assassinated, laying on the ground dead...would my friends and family still think black lives mattered? Would my life have mattered?\" Stalien wrote.\n\nWhile the official Black Lives Matter Twitter account published a post , external shortly after the Dallas killings, saying that it did not condone violence towards anybody, Stalien's post certainly resonated with a large portion of social media users - many of them supporters of the Blue Lives Matter movement.\n\nIn his lengthy digital essay Stalien challenged assertions that black people are unfairly penalised by law enforcement. It was his arguments about black-on-black violence that seemed to get the most attention. Drawing on his own experience, Stalien said he chose a career in law enforcement because:\n\n\"I watched and lived through the crime that took place in the hood. My own black people killing others over nothing. Crack heads and heroin addicts lined the lobby of my building as I shuffled around them to make my way to our 1 bedroom apartment with 6 of us living inside. I wanted to help my community and stop watching the blood of African Americans spilled on the street at the hands of a fellow black man.\"\n\nBut Stalien expressed his frustration that his efforts to investigate black-on-black violence and bring the culprits to justice had met with outright hostility from the very community he sought to protect.\n\n\"They called me 'Uncle Tom', and 'wanna be white boy', and I couldn't understand why,\" he wrote.\n\n\"My own fellow black men and women attacking me, wishing for my death, wishing for the death of my family. I was so confused, so torn, I couldn't understand why my own black people would turn against me, when every time they called â¦I was there. Every time someone diedâ¦.I was there. Every time they were going through one of the worst moments in their livesâ¦I was there. So why was I the enemy?\"\n\nStalien, said that in an attempt to answer that question he looked into some of the most common complaints levelled at police by activists, to see if there was a statistical basis for these grievances.  Much of his article is taken up by a point-by point presentation of the results of that research, which Stalien uses to assert that many of the gripes of the Black Lives Matter movement are unfounded.\n\nAs this is an area where the use of statistics is particularly contentious, Trending sought a second opinion on some of the Stalien's statistical claims. We spoke with Philip Stinson , external , associate professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. So here are a couple of the common complaints which Stalien sets up in his article and then knocks down, followed by Stinson's take on that rebuttal.\n\nOfficer Stalien's view:\n\n\"A city where the majority of citizens are black (Baltimore for example) â¦will ALWAYS have a higher rate of black people getting arrested, it will ALWAYS have a higher rate of blacks getting stopped, and will ALWAYS have a higher rate of blacks getting killed, and the reason why is because a city with those characteristics will ALWAYS have a higher rate of blacks committing crime. The statistics will follow the same trend for Asians if you go to China, for Hispanics if you go to Puerto Rico, for whites if you go to Russia, and the list goes on. It's called Demographics\"\n\nDr Stinson's response:\n\n\"I don't agree with his logic.  There certainly is implicit bias in many police street encounters with black males.  Many police officers in the United States view blacks in these encounters as a threat.  Similarly, many of the blacks in these street encounters with police officers are afraid of the police.  There are good points to be made on all sides of this issue.\"\n\nOfficer Stalien's view:\n\n\"Fact: As of July 2016, the breakdown of the number of US Citizens killed by Police this year is, 238 White people killed, 123 Black people killed, 79 Hispanics, 69 other/or unknown race.\"\n\nDr Stinson's response:\n\n\"Blacks are shot and killed by on-duty police officers at a HIGHER RATE than are white persons.  In other words, it is misleading to look at the raw numbers without adjusting for population differences.\"\n\nThis view was echoed by analysis published by Quartz , external magazine which concluded that while raw data from 2015 showed that \"police have indeed killed nearly twice as many white as black Americans\", when you \"look at those killings as a share of each ethnic group's population, it's a very different story: black people are at three times as high a risk of dying at the hands of police as white people.\"\n\nOfficer Stalien's view:\n\n\"Fact: Black people kill more other blacks than Police do, and there are only protest and outrage when a cop kills a black man. University of Toledo criminologist Dr. Richard R. Johnson examined the latest crime data from the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports and Centers for Disease Control and found that an average of 4,472 black men were killed by other black men annually between Jan. 1, 2009, and Dec. 31, 2012. Professor Johnson's research further concluded that 112 black men died from both justified and unjustified police-involved killings annually during this same period.\n\nDr Stinson's response:\n\n\"These numbers are wrong to the extent that the data relied upon are incomplete and inaccurate.  Both the Supplemental Homicide Reports and the CDC data sets underreported.  We know that, in part, from the Washington Post numbers for 2015 and 2016.  But, we do not know if the error and bias in the underreported data in the FBI and/or CDC is systematic or random.  As such, I would not use either data set to draw statistically significant conclusions,\" adds Stinson.\n\nWhatever your take on the data, many found Stalien's post to be a powerful testimony about the complexities of life as a black police officer in the US.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Obama addressed both the nation's police and its protestors , external about working together and acknowledging that bridges needed to be built.\n\nAt a memorial service for the slain five police officers at Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas, he said \"When anyone paints all police as biased or bigoted, we undermine those officers we depend on for our safety.\"\n\nThen he added, \"America, we know the bias remains. We simply cannot turn away and dismiss those in peaceful protest as troublemakers and paranoid. To have your experience denied like that, dismissed by those in authority, it hurts.\"\n\nBlog by Megha Mohan , external\n\nNext story: CoiffeurGate: The high cost of French President Francois Hollande's haircut\n\nYou can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending , external , and find us on Facebook , external .

      "text": "The unemployment rate of Black men rose in January, underscoring continued inequality in labor market\n\nBlack men lost ground in the workforce last month, marking a continuation of the disparities that have permeated the U.S. labor market.\n\nBlack males who were at least 20 years old saw an unemployment rate of 5.3% in January, up from 4.6% in December, according to seasonally adjusted data released Friday from the U.S. Department of Labor. These workers had the highest unemployment rate when breaking down Black, Hispanic and white workers by gender.\n\nBy comparison, white men saw a jobless rate of just 3.3% in January, holding steady from December. The overall unemployment rate was unchanged from December at 3.7%.\n\nMeanwhile, the Black community as a whole was the only tracked racial group to see unemployment increase from December. This underscores the effect of job losses among Black men, especially considering the fact that the rate for Black women was unchanged between December and January at 4.8%.\n\nThough the uptick in the unemployment rate for Black men is something to monitor, it can be more indicative of an anomaly in December's low data, said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. January's 5.3% rate comes basically in line with the average 2023 month, while December's 4.6% was the lowest level seen in the year.\n\nThe tight labor market experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic helped close the gap in work-related opportunities among Black and white men, she said. Indeed, the difference in unemployment rates between Black and white men shrunk to 2 percentage points in January from 4.1 percentage points in the same month in 2019.\n\nGrowth in the total number of employed Black men and the ratio of those with jobs to the total population compared with the start of 2023 also paints a picture of improvement, she added.\n\nBut Gould said the continued inequity in employment and pay highlights the need for further social progress, while bolstering the argument that a strong labor market alone won't bring equality.\n\nThe average white worker age 16 or older had a median weekly pay that was nearly 20% higher than their Black counterparts, according to federal data as of the last quarter of 2023. That disparity grew to almost 25% when looking at male workers alone.\n\n\"A better economy absolutely can help historically disadvantaged groups more because they're the ones that are often left out and are slow to recover in weaker times,\" Gould said. \"Full employment is definitely sort of a requirement for many historically marginalized groups to be able to see positive impact in the labor market, but it's not the only thing.\"\n\nShe pointed to unions as one example of a positive force for Black workers, noting that the wage transparency among members can help close any racial pay gaps.\n\nWhen combining genders, the unemployment rates of white and Asian workers ticked lower in January to levels last seen in late fall. The rate of unemployed Hispanics held steady from December at 5%, while the share of jobless Black workers inched higher to 5.3% from 5.2%.\n\nGould warned that month-to-month variations like what was seen in the unemployment rate of Black men can be fickle. Due to this, she said it's important to evaluate longer-term trends before drawing conclusions.\n\nStill, Gould said following employment patterns among Black workers and other marginalized groups can be important for spotting major economic trends. That's true even when broader employment data like what was released on Friday signals a \"hot\" labor market, she added.\n\n\"It's a canary in the coal mine,\" she said. \"When you're thinking about where you're going to see the signs of a recession, you're not seeing it in the data today, but it's always something to keep an eye on.\"\n\n- CNBC's Gabriel Cortes contributed reporting.

      "text": "Sneakers generated $70B last year. Black retailers saw little of that.\n\nThe guest bedroom in Earl West's home in suburban Atlanta looks more like a sneaker warehouse.\n\nFrom floor to ceiling, covering the entire space, shoe boxes filled with some of the most exclusive sneakers, in various colors and designs, are stacked on top of shoe boxes. Inside them are nearly 900 pairs of sneakers valued in West's estimation at more than $100,000.\n\n\"My friend who got me into this jokes with me, saying he was the one who put the needle in my arm. And I can't seem to shake it,\" said West, 55, a self-described \"sneaker head\" who is a manager at a data center and started collecting in 1982. \"At the same time, it's been messed up that there aren't nearly enough Black stores to spend Black dollars on sneakers.\"\n\nMore from NBC News: Biden on the sidelines of 'Striketober,' with economy in the balance Sneaker resellers are making a living off of coveted models Baldwin was 'practicing' with gun when it went off, warrant says\n\nWest is among the thousands of people in America, especially Black males, who are fixated on sneakers, so much so that they are the drivers of a market that pulled in $70 billion in 2020, according to the market research company Statista.\n\nAt the same time, there is a harsh reality: While Black culture has made sneakers an invaluable element to any wardrobe and Black consumers are at the heart of that financial tide, Black retailers of the coveted items are hard to find.\n\nNike released a sustainability report in March that opened with a word from its president and chief executive officer, John Donahoe, saying, \"Our brand would not be what it is today without the powerful contributions of Black athletes and Black culture.\"\n\nAnd yet, while some retailers are working on changing the disparity, those \"contributions\" generate little in the way of Black wealth.\n\n\"Any sort of cultural force is always absent of any power, and it's done often in a misleading way to suggest that Black people have an economic strength that doesn't actually exist,\" said Jared Ball, a pop culture authority who is a professor of African American/African Diaspora Studies at Morgan State University. \"Saying that this is a consumer-based economy does not mean that consumers actually have power.\"\n\nMany in the industry - from retail store owners, consumers, franchisees and executives - have expressed concern that only 5 percent of sneaker retailers in America are Black.\n\n\"It's a white boys' club, like most things,\" said James Whitner, a Black man who has carved out a successful niche with boutique apparel and sneakers stores in several cities. \"There are people aware of it, but their privilege doesn't force them to have to change it.\"\n\nWhitner's business has evolved from an apparel and sneaker shop in Charlotte, North Carolina, to several boutiques throughout the East Coast for his company, The Whitney Group.\n\nWhitner has been so successful that Vice President Kamala Harris visited his store while on the campaign trail last year. He also collaborated with Nike to create a sneaker, the A Ma Manerie x Air Jordan 3, named for his shop in Atlanta.\n\nBut Whitner is an anomaly in the industry, even with help from his community.\n\n\"My saving grace was I had a good ecosystem of a few Black people who taught me the ropes,\" he said. \"But on the other side are white gatekeepers who are keeping us out. Changing it is an individual choice, especially for white Americans because they're part of a system that has been created to keep us out.\"\n\nThere is no identifiable data that tracks the number of Black-owned independent sneaker retail stores, but Whitner said he knew them all and counted 18 - including three in Europe. \"That's it,\" he said.\n\nWhitner maintained his first store for five years, but he made a change in 2011 that took his business into the stratosphere, he said. \"My first store was called Flava Factory. That name was very Black, very urban,\" he said. So he changed it to Social Status. \"And all of a sudden, the opportunities started to change. From that point on, the business has just exploded.\"\n\nFor Ball, significant change could only come through political power. \"What has to happen is public policy developed by law or through policy mandates that the wealth being created by all of this consumption and exchange, as in the $70 billion sneaker industry, has to be redistributed back to the people doing the consuming,\" he said. \"That's not telling Black people to start a sneaker distribution program or a sneaker company, because there is no catching up to Adidas and Nike and whoever else. So, the only thing that can be done is consumers' having not only the right to withhold their money, but the right to have what we consume benefit all of us. And it's not easily done, obviously, but I think the only real solution.\"\n\nIsom Lowman, who is Black, owned 22 Athlete's Foot stores, but has since bought and sold several of them, bringing his total to nine.\n\n\"You can count us on one hand in the whole sneaker industry,\" Lowman said. \"Considering we are the main consumers, the ones who built this industry, that's sad.\"\n\nThe barrier to entering the retail market is high for a prospective store owner, between corporate control over which stores can even sell their sneakers, and required startup costs that begin at around $60,000.\n\n\"Resources are required to be successful,\" Whitner said. \"And not many of us have the resources or the business savvy, or the understanding of what it takes to actually win in this industry. Starting when you're disadvantaged is hard.\"\n\nBall traced the emergence of sneakers in pop culture to the 1986 rap song, \"My Adidas,\" by Run DMC.\n\n\"Sneakers have a history with hip-hop, Russell Simmons and Run DMC and the influence of their relationship with Adidas and popularizing sneakers and sneaker culture,\" Ball said. \"Hip-hop, broadly speaking, as a fashion force, in and of itself, relates also in general to Black people's overall influence on American culture and popular culture. It's been pointed out: There is no American pop culture without Black people.\"\n\nBlack influence ignited the sneaker phenomenon, erupting when Michael Jordan emerged as a global sensation in the early 1980s. Between Nike's creative marketing and Jordan's soaring popularity, Air Jordan sneakers became a must-have for young people everywhere.\n\nAs West, the sneaker head put it, the right pair of kicks \"tell a lot about who you are.\"\n\nLowman, 45, said it bothers him that an industry driven by Black dollars and Black culture is not inclusive to Black business. He got started when he was 22, in 1998. He graduated a semester early from Morehouse College, and scrambled for resources to secure his first store. He used some leftover scholarship money, a loan from his parents (who took out a second mortgage on their home), earnings from investing in Yahoo and a small business loan to purchase his first store.\n\n\"It wasn't easy, but I had a lot of support and was able to pay back my parents and buy other stores,\" he said. \"I'm grateful the Athlete's Foot had a relationship with a bank that was financing franchises, because we know how much racism there is in banking.\"\n\nLowman said acquiring a retail space now, however, is more difficult for Black people than it was two decades ago.\n\nNike, the behemoth athletic brand, plays a huge role because of its universal popularity, he said. It alone can determine a store's profitability and existence. The shoe brand has implemented a direct-to-customer element that cuts out many retailers. It has also become more selective over which stores sell its products, often focusing on its own retail stores instead. On top of that, Nike is producing fewer shoes in recent years to drive demand even further.\n\n\"Back in the day, if you had a Nike account, you could open up a store pretty much anywhere,\" Lowman said. \"But now, it's hard to get a Nike account. So that makes it a whole lot harder for people in the business to expand, and it definitely has made it a whole lot harder for people to get into the business.\"\n\nNike did not respond to NBC News' requests for comment.\n\nDarius Billings, who has worked in the athletic apparel/sneakers industry since graduating from Howard University in 1988, is a senior director of product and marketing for the Athletes' Foot. Billings said he was inspired by a conversation with a group of family and friends during the Black Lives Matter-led social justice movement last year to consider how his company could be a factor in bridging racial inequities.\n\nThis past spring, he launched the Strategic African American Retail Track or StAART program, which is designed to address Lowman's and Whitner's points about helping create pathways for Black entrepreneurs to become retail store owners.\n\n\"The program is about fostering change within an industry that was really built on Black culture, Black influence and Black community,\" Billings said. \"And from a holistic standpoint, I looked at ownership and questioned myself: How many Black retail owners are out there in the sneaker space? Not many and not nearly enough.\"\n\nStAART recruits, encourages and supports Black entrepreneurs in the sneaker industry by educating, exposing and helping them clear the traditional barriers Black potential business owners face.\n\n\"I wish StAART was around when I got into the business,\" said Jennifer Ford, owner of the sneaker boutique Premium Goods in the Rice Village section of Houston. Seventeen years ago, she became the only Black female proprietor of a sneaker store in the country that sold all the major brands like Nike, Nike's Jordan Brand, Adidas and New Balance.\n\nA friend in the business encouraged Ford, a buyer for a department store in New York at the time, to join in, and she used \"every penny I had\" to create her business.\n\n\"But if there was StAART around, it would have helped me so much,\" she said. \"It would have been amazing to have someone tell me to 'Watch this' and 'Don't do that.' 'Make sure you get a really good accountant.' Also, I would have had more confidence to expand and have other stores. It has been hard for me to potentially risk losing everything I have built to get another store.\"\n\nWhitner said he has for years shared information with potential Black retail store owners through annual summits.\n\n\"Half our business is profit, the other part is nonprofit, and our whole goal was to bring people in our industry,\" he said. \"I'm working with business partners like Nike and from other industries like Bank of America, and we're strategically working on summits, classes - anything that we can do to help bring Black people along to really help try to close the gap for our industry. Change isn't going to happen overnight. But the work is being done every day.\"\n\nHe added that Black potential business owners have to do their part, too. \"When there are resources out there,\" Whitner said, \"we have to step into them and hold ourselves personally accountable to get to a place where we can break the system. We don't break the system by just saying that system is against us. We break a system by succeeding in the system, then letting that system know what's wrong with it.\"\n\nWest said he would solely support Black-owned retail stores if he had more options. So ingrained is West in the sneaker-head underworld that he once spent four days in line outside of Whitner's Social Status to be among the first to purchase a pair of Air Max 97s, a 2018 Nike collaboration with the esteemed shoe designer Sean Wotherspoon that was made partially of corduroy. Pairs can sell online today for as much as $2,000. They retail for $160.\n\nWest would not be alone spending dark nights to secure a pair of sneakers.\n\n\"When we were camping out, after two days, one of us would say, 'I'm about to run home and take a shower and get something to eat,'\" said West, who slept in his SUV overnight to hold his spot. \"I'd ask if the guys would want something to eat and eventually get back to my spot.\"\n\nWest acknowledged that his obsession with sneakers is not practical. But he pointed out that he donates dozens of pairs of shoes a year to homeless shelters or organizations that serve the needy. Still, before the pandemic, he wore a different pair of sneakers every day for two years.\n\nWest said he has spent about $30,000 on shoes that are now worth more than three times that because some have increased in value over time. He knows he has also overpaid for many by going through resellers, who have added another element to the sneaker world.\n\n\"Yeah, I know it might not make sense to most people, but it is what it is to us, to real sneaker heads,\" West said. \"We love it. We sacrifice for it. And there's no shame about it.\"\n\nIn fact, his life is playing out as he had told his mother it would. \"When I was growing up in Seattle, we couldn't afford a lot of things,\" he said. \"My dad worked for Safeway, and we would have to go buy Safeway shoes. One day, I told my mom, 'When I'm old enough, I'm going to buy all the shoes that I want.' And sure enough, that's what I've been doing.\"\n\nUltimately, sneakers' dominance in mainstream society speaks to the power and influence of Black culture. The lack of Black sneaker retailers speaks to something different.\n\n\"This is an opportunity for us to own our ideas,\" Billings said. \"Black culture created this phenomenon, and that's why I hope this Black Lives Matter movement doesn't become a point in time, but instead an ongoing thing, and that we push for equality and equity ... and support and create Black business.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "New Research on Philanthropy Directed to Black Males in U.S. Reveals Important Trends\n\nNEW YORK, Oct. 1, 2012 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Nearly every major indicator of economic, social, and physical well-being shows that black men and boys in the U.S. do not have access to the structural supports and opportunities needed to thrive. It is within this context that the Foundation Center and the Open Society Foundations jointly release a new report of groundbreaking research entitled Where Do We Go From Here? Philanthropic Support for Black Men and Boys .\n\n\"It is my hope that this report will motivate other philanthropists and foundations to invest in efforts to improve achievement by African American boys and men,\" said George Soros, founder of the Open Society Foundations. \"This is a generational problem that demands a long-term commitment.\"\n\nThis report is the first of its kind to document the wide variety of philanthropic activity in support of black men and boys, raising the visibility of critical issues facing communities across the nation. The research reveals that annual funding designated for black men and boys has been rising steadily, from $10 million in 2003 to $29 million in 2010.  Education is a top funding priority for this group: between 2008 and 2010, education garnered 40 percent of these grant dollars.\n\nIn addition to providing crucial baseline numbers against which future giving can be compared, the report also describes several foundation initiatives across the U.S. that address structural barriers and improve the lives of black men and boys. For example, in 2011 George Soros and Michael Bloomberg each contributed $30 million to a New York City program designed to improve the life outcomes of black and Latino males. The effort is a leading example of public-private partnerships taking shape across the country. And in Los Angeles, the California Community Foundation recently launched the only major philanthropic initiative focused on black male youth involved in the delinquency system.\n\nThe Open Society Foundations' Campaign for Black Male Achievement commissioned the report from the Foundation Center, which used available data to examine U.S. foundation giving explicitly in support of black males by issue area, type of support, and geographic area served. The report also explores \"implicit\" funding in which black males are likely to represent a majority of clients or beneficiaries served, but are not part of an explicitly named program.\n\n\"This report vividly portrays a stark reality that has haunted this country for far too long,\" said Bradford Smith, president of the Foundation Center. \"But it also provides solid data and compelling stories that illustrate what America's foundations are doing to turn the tide.\"\n\nWhere Do We Go From Here?

      "text": "How representation of Black artists in galleries, museums is changing\n\nWhen George Floyd was murdered by police in 2020, the event brought a \"scary\" time for the Minneapolis neighborhood where it occurred.\n\n\"Everything was on fire,\" said Lamar Peterson, a contemporary art painter who lives less than a mile from the scene.\n\n\"You couldn't have your windows open because of the smoke,\" Peterson said. \"It just felt like it was Armageddon, the end of times.\"\n\nThe streets were filled both with protesters and also looters, Peterson remembers.\n\nMore from Personal Finance: 'Baby bond' proposal would give every child $1,000 at birth Demise of student loan forgiveness would be 'disastrous' for Black Americans IRS about 3 to 5 times more likely to audit Black Americans' tax returns\n\nFor Peterson, it was a personally difficult for another reason: Due to the lockdown at the time, he lost access to his studio based in the University of Minnesota building where he teaches.\n\nPeterson, 49, an oil painter, was unable to do his work at home in a closed space.\n\n\"That was really hard for me,\" Peterson said. \"My outlet is my artwork.\"\n\nToday, Peterson has recently wrapped up his latest show at the Fredericks & Freiser art gallery in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York.\n\nThe works are the opposite of the dark time he lived through in 2020, with bright garden landscapes and Black figures that draw inspiration from the 1970s and 80s cartoons that Peterson grew up on.\n\nThe paintings are about appreciating the fleeting beauty in life, he said, inspired by his own love of gardening and his father's recent death.\n\n\"Flowers can be a metaphor for human life, too,\" Peterson said. \"There's a beginning and an end.\"\n\nThe show, titled \"Proud Gardener,\" sold \"very well\" and is one of Peterson's most successful shows to date, according to Andrew Freiser, a co-owner of the gallery. Prices for the works ranged from $15,000 to $60,000, depending on size.\n\nPeterson, who started showing his work in the early 2000s, has noticed a shift in the art market.\n\n\"There's a lot more support for Black artists that kind of came out of George Floyd's murder and institutions realizing that they need to do more,\" Peterson said.\n\nThe market for work by Black American artists grew by nearly 400% between 2008 and 2021, according to a recent report from art market website ArtNet.\n\nHowever, art in that category represented just 1.9%, or $3.6 billion, of global auction sales between 2008 and mid-2022, the report found.\n\nThe growth has not been consistent, according to ArtNet. Acquisitions of work by Black American artists peaked in 2015, two years after the start of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nStill, there continues to be a higher interest in African American artists that is \"absolutely genuine,\" according to Sophie Neuendorf, vice president at ArtNet.\n\n\"Museums face a lot of criticism for showing primarily male white artists,\" Neuendorf said.\n\n\"There's been a real effort to consciously show more exhibitions of female, as well as African American artists,\" she said.\n\nThat \"sea change\" in recent years has prompted museum shows of artists including Kerry James Marshall , Michael Armitage , Lynette Yiadom-Boakye and Jennifer Packer , noted Lucius Elliott, head of The Now Evening Auction at Sotheby's, which focuses on contemporary works.\n\n\"My impression is there are vastly increased number of solo shows and group shows dedicated to Black artists in London, in Paris, in New York, across the United States,\" Elliott said.\n\n\"Something fundamental has shifted here, and that's driven I think more than anything by a desire to correct or redress a historical oversight, both in the market, but also for institutional representation,\" Elliott said.\n\nOther Black artists have gained importance, including Kehinde Wiley, who painted a portrait of former President Barack Obama, and Hank Willis Thomas, who sculpted the statue \"The Embrace,\" of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Coretta Scott King that was recently unveiled in Boston.\n\n\"There are a lot of artists that I think have risen to a level of prominence that have really placed them at the center of the contemporary art narrative,\" said Drew Watson, head of art services at Bank of America.\n\nWorks from established artists like Kerry James Marshall that depict Black figures are influencing the work of new artists and creating a lineage, Elliott noted.\n\n\"These are not images of degradation, but they're images of dignity,\" Elliott said.\n\nPainter Xavier Daniels' most recent show titled \"Cry Like a Man\" features portraits of Black men with vivid colors like purple, blue and white, meant to convey royalty, freedom and purity.\n\nPrices for the works at the Black-owned Richard Beavers gallery in New York's SoHo neighborhood ranged from between $30,000 to $42,000.\n\nThe male portraits are inspired by other Black men with whom Daniels, 42, had either worked during his 13-year career as a firefighter or been a student at an all-male predominantly Black college, he said.\n\nThe works in the recent show also touch on the mental health struggle Black men go through, with portions of some of the faces missing to reflect how negative stereotypes may lead them to not feel whole.\n\nAt the same time, the figures are empowered and free to be themselves, Daniels said.\n\n\"I'm just taking our experiences and creating art and a language I feel would help other Black males feel great about who they are,\" he said.\n\nIf you think you may want to invest in art, experts have some tips for getting started.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "U.S. gun homicides reached highest level in 25 years during Covid pandemic, CDC says\n\nGun homicides in the U.S. reached their highest level in more than 25 years during the Covid-19 pandemic , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHomicides from guns rose 35% during the first year of the pandemic to the highest level since 1994, according to a CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly report published Tuesday. The homicide rate from firearms increased to 6.1 per 100,000 people in 2020 compared with 4.6 per 100,000 in 2019.\n\nExcluding suicides, more than 19,000 people were killed by guns in 2020 compared with more than 14,000 the year prior, according to the CDC report, which is based on death certificates. The study did not include accidental gun deaths or deaths where intent could not be determined.\n\nHomicides from gun violence increased among people of every age, in most racial groups, for men and women, in cities and in rural areas, and in every region of the nation.\n\nBlack Americans suffered the most with the homicide rate from gun violence increasing nearly 40% to 26.6 per 100,000 people or nearly 12,000 total, about 12 times higher than the rate among white Americans. The disparity was even larger among boys, with the firearm homicide rate 21.6 times higher among Black males ages 10 to 24 compared with white males of the same age.\n\nGun homicides rose 27% to 8.1 per 100,000 people among Native Americans, nearly 26% among Hispanics to 4.5 per 100,000, and about 28% among whites to 2.2 per 100,000. The firearm homicide rate decreased 4.2% among Asian Americans to 1 per 100,000 individuals.\n\nSeparately, suicides involving a firearm increased 1.5% to 8.1 per 100,000 people during the first year of the pandemic. The suicide rate with guns was the highest among Native Americans at 10.9 per 100,000 and whites at 10.4 per 100,000 people.\n\nThe homicide rate from guns was more than five times higher among men than women, and in terms of age gun killings were highest among those 25 to 44-years-old.\n\nIn the U.S., 79% of homicides and 53% of suicides involved guns in 2020, according to the CDC. More than 24,000 suicides involved firearms in 2020.\n\nKillings and suicides with guns were closely associated with poverty, according to the study. The counties in the U.S. with the highest poverty rates suffered firearm killing and suicide rates that were 4.5 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, than counties with the lowest poverty levels. Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans were more likely to live in counties with higher poverty rates, according to the CDC.\n\nWhile the study did not investigate the reasons for the dramatic increase in firearm homicides, the CDC said the pandemic may have played a role by disrupting social services, schools, work and housing as well as the increase in social isolation.\n\nThe pandemic resulted in millions of people losing their jobs, with the unemployment rate hitting 14.7% at the height of the crisis in April 2020. The economic downturn hit minority communities, particularly Black Americans, especially hard. It was also a year of historic social unrest, with the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer leading to nationwide protests.\n\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Twitter investigating racial bias after users noticed the platform sometimes prefers White faces\n\nIn this article\n\nLONDON - Twitter says it's investigating why its picture-cropping algorithm sometimes prefers White faces to Black ones.\n\nThe investigation comes after Twitter users noticed Black faces were less likely to be shown than White ones in image previews on mobile when the image contains a Black face and a White face.\n\nThe micro-blogging platform said it didn't find any evidence of racial and gender bias when it tested the algorithm but conceded it had more analysis to do.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's chief technology officer, said Twitter analyzed the model when it shipped it, but said that it needs continuous improvement.\n\n\"Love this public, open, and rigorous test - and eager to learn from this,\" he said on the platform.\n\nThe issue came to light after Colin Madland, a university manager in Vancouver, noticed that his Black colleague's head kept disappearing when using the video conferencing app Zoom. It appeared as though Zoom's software thought the Black man's head was part of the background and removed it as a result. Zoom did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\nAfter tweeting about the issue to see if anyone knew what was going on, Madland then realized that Twitter was also guilty of hiding Black faces. Specifically, he noticed Twitter was choosing to preview his own White face over his colleague's Black face on mobile.\n\nDantley Davis, Twitter's chief design officer, realized that the problem could be corrected by removing Madland's facial hair and glasses.\n\nTwitter has received a fair amount of criticism but Davis said the problem will be fixed.\n\n\"I know you think it's fun to dunk on me - but I'm as irritated about this as everyone else. However, I'm in a position to fix it and I will,\" Davis said.\n\nHe added: \"It's 100% our fault. No-one should say otherwise.\"\n\nFollowing the discovery, Twitter users carried out several other experiments. One experiment suggested that white U.S. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell's face was preferred to former U.S. President Barack Obama.\n\nAnother suggested that a stock photo of a White man in a suit was preferred to one in which the man was Black.\n\nArtificial intelligence has a track record of picking up on biases engrained in society and researchers have found concerning error rates in facial recognition products developed by IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon.\n\nIn 2018, Microsoft Research scientist Timnit Gebru and MIT computer scientist Joy Buolamwini co-authored a paper showing IBM and Microsoft's facial recognition systems were significantly worse when it came to identifying darker-skinned individuals.\n\nMicrosoft said it had taken steps to improve the accuracy of its facial-recognition technology, and was investing in improving the datasets that it trains systems on, while IBM said it was planning to launch a new version of its service.\n\nThe following year, Buolamwini and Deborah Raji co-authored a paper that found that Amazon's Rekognition system struggled to identify the gender of darker-skinned individuals. It would sometimes classify Black women as Black males, but it had no problems when analyzing images of lighter-skinned people.\n\nIBM said in June that it would stop selling its facial-recognition software for racial profiling and mass surveillance.\n\nSarah Myers West, a postdoctoral researcher at New York University's AI Now Institute, told CNBC: \"Algorithmic discrimination is a reflection of larger patterns of social inequality ... it's about much more than just bias on the part of engineers or even bias in datasets, and will require more than a shallow understanding or set of fixes.\"\n\n- CNBC intern Michelle Gao contributed to this article.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

Anchor Becky Quick asked him specifically about a piece he wrote for National Review in which he worried about a society where women earned more than men.\n\n\"The biggest problem I see in the economy over the last 25 years is what has happened to male earnings, for black males and white males as well,\" Moore said. \"They've been declining. That is, I think, a big problem.\"\n\n\"I want everybody's wages to rise, of course. People are talking about women's earnings. They've risen,\" he added.\n\nSince 2010, real median weekly earnings for men have risen about 2.1 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Women's real earnings have gone up 3.9 percent during the period.\n\n\"The problem actually has been the steady decline in male earnings, and I think we should pay attention to that, because I think that has very negative consequences for the economy and for society,\" he said.\n\nMoore has not yet been officially nominated for Fed governor, a post that carries a 14-year term. White House officials have said they are continuing to vet his background, and it's not clear whether he has the requisite votes in the Senate to be confirmed.\n\nWhite House economic advisor Larry Kudlow has said Trump decided to pursue the possible nomination after Moore wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed criticizing the Fed for raising its benchmark interest rate in December, the fourth increase in 2018. Trump has blasted the Fed for continuing to tighten policy and has said economic growth, which has hovered around 3 percent, would be even stronger without the increases.\n\nIf he gets confirmed, Moore said he would take a cooperative approach in helping the Fed guide the economy.\n\n\"I want to make Chairman [Jerome] Powell the most successful Fed chairman in history, where we go get 4 percent growth with zero inflation. I really think we can get there,\" he said.\n\nHowever, to get to that place, Moore will have to overcome intensifying criticism over his past writings, which have included assertions that women shouldn't be around men sports.\n\n\"Is there no area in life where men can take a vacation from women?\" he wrote in one piece.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC, he said he hopes he's judged on the economic advice has has provided for Kudlow and Trump, which he said has led to the best economy in 20 years.\n\n\"If it comes down to things I wrote 18 years ago that were impolitic, that I've apologized for, that were, you know, insulting, then I'm in trouble,\" he said. \"If it comes to economic ideas, then I'll be fine.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

You mayneed a lot more for retirement\n\nThat was an increase of 0.1 year from 2011 when it was 78.7  years, according to a new report on mortality in the USA from the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for  Health Statistics.\n\nThe news is a little better for women, a little worse for men.  Life expectancy for females is 81.2 years; for males, it's 76.4  years. That difference of 4.8 years is the same as in 2011.\n\nMore from USA Today : Doctor: Strong lasers at NFL games are 'weapons' Study: Why Apple Pay won't work Geithner: Bailout needed to avert disaster\n\nThose life expectancy estimates are for people born in 2012  and represent \"the average number of years that a group of  infants would live if the group was to experience throughout life  the age-specific death rates present in the year of birth,\" the  report says.\n\nThe average life expectancy for a person who was 65 years  old in 2012 is 19.3 years - 20.5 years for women and 17.9  years for men. The difference in life expectancy at 65 years  between males and females increased 0.1 year from 2.5 years in  2011 to 2.6 years in 2012.\n\nRead More The Alzheimer'sepidemic: Where we stand\n\nIt's not that a person born in 2012 is expected to have a  shorter life span than a person who was 65 in 2012, says Jiaquan  Xu, a medical doctor and lead author of the report. But the  averages for people born in 2012 includes those who will be  subject to infant mortality and teen mortality, which are higher  than for a group of older people.\n\nAs far as the life expectancy difference between the sexes,  Xu says it's not clear whether genetics plays a role, but  behavior probably does. \"Men usually take more risks, and they  participate in risky outdoor activities like climbing and scuba  diving,\" he says. \"Also, teenage boys do more high-risk  activities, and they get in more car wrecks, than  girls.\"\n\nAmong other findings of the 2012 mortality  report:\n\n•The age-adjusted death rate for the USA decreased  1.1% from 2011 to 2012 to a record low of 732.8 per 100,000  population. The report attributes much of the recent improvement  in both death rates and life expectancy to reductions in deaths  from such major illnesses as heart disease, cancer and  stroke.\n\n\"I think the health of the U.S. population is improving,\"  Xu says. \"The death rates for heart disease and cancer, the two  leading causes of death that account for 46.5% of all deaths,  have been falling since 1999.\"\n\nRead More Seniorsseek roomies to survive\n\n•The 10 leading causes of death in 2012 were the same  as in 2011: heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory  diseases, stroke, unintentional injuries, Alzheimer's disease,  diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, kidney disease and suicide.  Those 10 causes accounted for 73.8% of all deaths in the  USA.\n\nHowever, from 2011 to 2012, age-adjusted death rates  declined significantly for 8 of the 10 leading causes of death.  The rate for suicide rose and the rate for unintentional injuries  was unchanged.\n\n•The infant mortality rate decreased 1.5% from 2011 to 2012  to a historic low of 597.8 infant deaths per 100,000 live births.  The 10 leading causes of infant death, which accounted for 69.8%  of all infant deaths, remained unchanged. They are: congenital  malformations, low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome  (SIDS), maternal complications, unintentional injuries, cord and  placental complications, bacterial sepsis of newborn, respiratory  distress of newborn, diseases of the circulatory system and  neonatal hemorrhage.\n\nThe infant mortality rate for SIDS decreased 12% from 48.3 infant  deaths per 100,000 live births in 2011 to 42.5 in 2012; mortality  rates for the other leading causes of death showed no significant  change.\n\n•Black males have the highest death rates, and black females  have higher death rates than white females. Xu says African  Americans have higher rates of heart disease than other races and  have double the rate of hypertension as non-Hispanic whites; the  rate of homicide, considered an unintentional injury, for blacks  is 5.2 per 100,000 population, compared to 2.5 for non-Hispanic  whites, he says.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

The commission will then be required to produce an annual report which will be made public.\n\nThe legislation calls for the commission to include a 19-person panel consisting of lawmakers, federal departments, and non-governmental experts to investigate and create guidelines on how to reverse \"potential civil rights violations affecting black males and study the disparities they experience in education, criminal justice, health, employment, fatherhood, mentorship, and violence.\"\n\n\"These federal policies left a devastating impact on black men and boys in America,\" said Wilson. \"The commission's underlying goal is to interrupt the school-to-prison pipeline and to better understand and eventually eliminate the educational and social chasms that have made it extraordinarily difficult for black males to become upwardly mobile.\"\n\n\"As a defense attorney, I saw how sentence disparities on drug crimes, minimum mandatory sentencing, school board sentencing, pretrial release policies often had racial impacts,\" he said during the debate. \"By creating a bipartisan commission to study inequality in government programs, we take the necessary steps to identify and address disparities for black American men and boys,\" Armstrong said.\n\nCompanion legislation introduced by Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) passed in the Senate on June 25.\n\n\"Racial inequality for black men in our country has caused significant economic and social disparities and contribute to a racial wealth gap that ultimately harms all Americans. This commission will address the long-standing societal gaps that have harmed black men in America and lowered the prospect of upward mobility,\" Booker said."

      "text": "Black Male Teachers Critical, but a Rare Find in Classrooms\n\nDonovan Livingston, 29, can count on one hand the number of black male teachers he has had in his 24 years of formal schooling-four in total.\n\nLivingston, who has an M.Ed. in teaching and learning from Harvard University, is a product of educators-his father is a principal and his mother a speech pathologist. Livingston credits his aspiration to lead a classroom of hungry-to-learn students to his parents.\n\n\"Had I not grown up in a home with two educators, I doubt I would understand the power of my presence in a school,\" Livingston said. \"If young black men are not exposed to teachers, counselors, advisers, or administrators that look like them, we-as a system of schools and educators-perpetuate the myth that black men are anomalies in school.\"\n\nHowever, statistics show black men are anomalies in school.\n\nBlack males represent less than 2 percent of the nation's teachers, according to data released by the U.S. Department of Education . Creating a vicious cycle, black males are also less likely to take on teaching as a career, likely due in part to never encountering a teacher who looks like them.\n\n\"The lack of male role models of color in teaching, and the potential for feeling disconnected from colleagues and the larger school culture, can often serve as deterrents to considering education as a career,\" said Jerrica Thurman of American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE).\n\n\"Many teachers of color feel unheard and unable to effect changes in their schools.\"\n\nAnother factor that has steered black men away from becoming teachers is low salaries.\n\n\"Low pay and long hours aren't attractive,\" said educator Will Deyamport III, who works in Mississippi. \"Most of the brothers I went to college with are doctors or lawyers. A few of them went into education, most didn't-when men think of the life they want to have and the possibility of having a family, making money weighs heavily in their decisions.\"\n\nAmerica's teachers are overwhelmingly white (83 percent) and female (75 percent)-demographics that are stereotyped by media portrayals, according to the Consortium for Policy Research in Education .\n\n\"When we think about movies, or television shows that depict educators, we often consider Michelle Pfeiffer ('Dangerous Minds') and Hilary Swank ('Freedom Writers')-the white saviors who risked it all by working in an inner-city school,\" said Livingston.\n\n\"Hollywood is not solely to blame for this underrepresentation of black educators. The music industry, corporate advertisements, and news media are all complicit in limiting our exposure to black excellence in all facets of American life, especially in school.\"\n\nEvidence shows that teacher diversity has a positive impact on black students, particularly male. Teachers who share the same race and ethnicity with their students had higher expectations for their students and fostered a community of belonging, according to research by the Albert Shanker Institute , which advocates for education and workers' rights.\n\nThurman said having more black male teachers will make a huge difference in the lives of students.\n\n\"Increasing the representation of male teachers of color in the classroom will provide students of color, and more specifically, males students of color, with role models for academic success, as well as teachers who can draw upon their shared experiences to best support and advance the success of their students,\" said Thurman.\n\n\"Having a teacher who shares common experiences and cultural identity in turn provides a connection for students that helps them to see their own potential.\"\n\nDeyamport III said that aside from teaching, it is equally important for students to see males in other leadership positions.\n\n\"We need black men in every part of the chain,\" he said. \"The field of education is broad.\n\n\"A black man who works for Pearson, who sells their products to school districts, can be instrumental in developing culturally responsive programs for schools-students must see themselves reflected within the school.\"\n\nFor Livingston, successful teaching is about forming good relationships with students.\n\n\"An educator is only as good as their ability to relate to the students they serve,\" he said. \"Therefore, it is important for me to form meaningful relationships with all of my students. Those relationships are contingent upon how well I listen, and discover what it is that motivates them to succeed.\n\nHe says working with black male students and helping them define their own success is especially meaningful to him. \"I interact with my students in a way that makes them feel like their voice, their values, and their identities matter,\" Livingston said.\n\nRetention is an issue across the whole teaching profession, but it is particularly critical for black male teachers, who often work under difficult conditions, said Travis Bristol, former NYC public school teacher and current assistant professor of education at Boston University.\n\n\"The issue is less about recruitment and more about retention,\" said Bristol. \"I find the conditions in schools that push black men out are very similar to [what pushes] out black and brown children. Black and Latino male teachers work in the most challenging schools and they have the least resources to their jobs-they leave out of frustration.\"\n\n\"More resources, more support to improve their teaching, smaller class sizes, more professional development, more social workers so they can focus on content and teaching. It has to be a systemic support structure.\"\n\nBristol said he only had one black male teacher during his schooling, a high school teacher called Mr. Gaddy.\n\nCan white teachers-who make up 80 percent of the profession-make a difference?\n\nBeing white doesn't mean you can't relate, said Livingston, but it does take self-awareness.\n\n\"Education programs in universities can better prepare white teachers to fully understand black students by supporting research that deconstructs black students' experiences in schools,\" said Livingston. \"In addition to being underrepresented in the classroom and in school leadership, black students (especially black men) are virtually nonexistent in education literature.\n\n\"Until universities make an attempt to support, fund, and celebrate faculty that address topics on race, inequality, and gender in education, many educators (from all backgrounds) will continue to lack the cultural competence to meaningfully connect with their black students,\" he said.\n\nThere are several programs established throughout the nation to encourage more black males to enter the classroom.\n\nIn a city as diversified as New York City, 43 percent male students of color (including, black, Latino, Asian) make up the city's public schools, but only 8 percent of male teachers are of color. The city hopes to hire 1,000 male teachers of color by 2018 with a new initiative, NYC Men Teach.\n\nLaunched in January 2015, NYC Men Teach is a collaborative effort between the Department of Education, City University of New York, Center for Economic Opportunity, and Teach for America.\n\nNationwide since 1991, the AACTE's Holmes Scholars Program has been focused on supporting the recruitment, retention, and induction of educators from underrepresented populations. The program provides mentorship, peer support, and professional development opportunities to support aspiring educators.\n\nThe AACTE also established a program to boost black and Hispanic males into the teaching workforce through mentoring, establishing connections to alumni, and academic bridge programs.\n\nBoston University, the University of Connecticut, Western Kentucky University, and William Paterson University of New Jersey are among the institutes participating in the program, called Black and Hispanic/Latino Male Initiative Networked Improvement Community."

      "text": "For Young Black Men in Chicago, a Charter School Helps Them Defy the Odds\n\nMention the South Side of Chicago and images of a crime-infested ghetto leap to mind for many people.\n\nFor black teenagers, life becomes a vicious cycle that most can't shake.\n\nClose to 60 percent of young black men in Chicago do not graduate from high school. Only 6 percent of black males in the ninth grade will earn a bachelor's degree by the time they are 25. And nearly half of black males between the ages of 20 and 24 are both unemployed and out of school, according to a 2016 report by the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\nMurders are up about 72 percent year-over-year for the first quarter of 2016, according to Chicago Police Department data. Shootings have risen more than 88 percent.\n\nKevin A. McKee, 18, said he has lived on the south, the east, and the west sides of Chicago, and \"the violence is similar. People get beat, shot, and jumped.\"\n\nMcKee said he avoided trouble because, \"I was taught to go from point A to point B.\"\n\nHe lived with his father and brother for a long time.\n\n\"Growing up, I dealt with a lot,\" McKee said. \"My dad would go to work and I was stuck with my younger brother. At 11 or 12 years old, being responsible for another kid, that was stressful.\"\n\nHe said he and his family didn't have a stable home. \"We shared with different people, we were always moving ... I never really had nice things.\"\n\nThe responsibilities he had to shoulder, and the sheer lack of money, took a toll on McKee's academics. \"I was not an A or B student. I was a C and F student,\" he said.\n\nMcKee was heading down the same road as 60 percent of the young black men in his city. He was afraid for his future and could barely imagine finishing high school, let alone the prospect of college.\n\nHis life took an unexpected turn when a speaker came to his elementary school, Wells Preparatory. The speaker was dressed professionally, wearing a shirt, tie, and blazer-it was Urban Prep Academy's school uniform. McKee was infatuated and knew immediately that he wanted to go to Urban Prep.\n\nAnd he did.\n\nIt was a \"dream come true\" for him. McKee was accepted to the Bronzeville Campus and ended his freshman year with a 3.8 GPA.\n\n\"I felt accomplished,\" he said. \"I felt part of a community. I was around my brothers, people who looked like me.\"\n\nUrban Prep is a nonprofit organization that operates a network of all-boys, all-black public schools-including the country's first charter public high school for boys, said founder, president, and CEO Tim King.\n\nKing launched the first school in 2006 and now operates three campuses in Chicago.\n\nHe said the students come from economically disadvantaged households and are usually behind in many subjects.\n\nUrban Prep's most stunning statistic is not that 95 percent of the students apply for college-but that, since the school opened its doors in 2006, 100 percent have been accepted.\n\nThe teens are surrounded by positive role models and people that push them to achieve their highest potential. \"It's tough to be what you don't see. So it's important that young people seek out positive role models and examples of excellence,\" King said.\n\n\"Students wear a uniform shirt, tie, and blazer each school day, and we use surnames when referring to our young men. In our buildings, students are Mr. Smith, Mr. Jones, or Mr. Davis, not Paul, Rob, or Chris,\" King said.\n\nEvery morning the students recite the Urban Prep Creed, a powerful reminder of the school's motto: \"We Believe.\"\n\n\"It is a statement of what we want our students to believe-an articulation of our core values or resilience, relentlessness, integrity, solidarity, exceptionality, selflessness, accountability, and faith,\" King said. \"Words have power. By saying the creed daily, our students embody the ideals it represents.\"\n\nMcKee said reciting the creed every day helped keep the Urban Prep values at the forefront and carry him through.\n\n\"It makes me feel we can make a difference at this school, turn our dreams into reality,\" he said.\n\nHis dreams are now definitely reality-McKee will attend Seattle Pacific University in the fall.\n\n\"We are more than killers, guys who stand on the corner with their pants sagging, we are more,\" McKee said. \"I am the first in my family going to college.\"\n\nSaid King, \"The cycle is broken one person at a time.\""

      "text": "Disproportionality in UK Police 'Stop and Search' Not Racist Says Former Senior Detective\n\nThe disproportionate number of young black males being stopped by UK police under its stop and search power is not due to officers being racist, a former senior detective said on Monday.\n\nInstead, he said, they are being stopped in higher numbers than other ethnicities because they are more frequently involved in street robberies, \"county lines\" drug dealing, gang violence, and knife crime, including murder, where the victims are themselves usually black people.\n\n\"It's a sad fact, unfortunately, that young black men are involved in gang-related activity-so if we look at the gang matrix in London, 89 percent of people on that matrix are black and ethnic minorities,\" ex-detective chief inspector of the Metropolitan Police Mike Neville told The Epoch Times.\n\n\"The police can't help that-the police can try and be fair, but if a certain group or race or religion ... commits a certain type of crime, then they [the police] have got to deal with it,\" he said.\n\nThe HMICFRS report states that ethnic minorities were over four times more likely to be stopped under stop and search than white people, rising to almost nine times more likely in the case of black people.\n\nIt called for the police to explain why.\n\nHe said the factors underlying this ethnic disparity in offending, including housing and education, are largely beyond the control of the police who \"simply have to deal with the murder\" in front of them, regardless of the race of victim or perpetrator.\n\n\"We can't keep putting our head in the sand about this,\" he said.\n\nHe called for a fairer, more realistic examination of how the police stop and search power is being used.\n\n\"Let's see both sides of the argument, let's be fair,\" he said. \"Yes, if people are being stopped and searched unfairly, that's not right, but let's look at the crime patterns.\"\n\n\"It's a scandal really that people virtue signal-try and score political points,\" he said.\n\n\"And we see the results-literally that is more dead young black men. It's awful, it's a waste of life, and it's shameful.\"\n\n\"What do people prefer, particularly young black men?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do they prefer the police's hands occasionally in their pockets or do they prefer a knife in their belly?\"\n\nAmanda Pearson, stop and search lead and deputy assistant commissioner of the National Police Chiefs' Council, told The Epoch Times in a statement that \"stop and search is a valuable policing tool.\"\n\nShe said the power had enabled the removal of weapons from the streets as well as the disruption of drug markets.\n\nIt has also helped \"identify young people in need of safeguarding and diversion away from crime,\" she said.\n\n\"We hold the power of stop and search on behalf of the public, so it is vital our communities have confidence in the way it is used and that officers have the confidence to use it effectively and appropriately.\"\n\nThe HMICFRS did not respond to a request for comment."

      "text": "Mass Incarceration: The New Eugenics?\n\nThe United States currently has over 2.3 million prisoners incarcerated in federal, state, and local jails around the country. According to an April report by the Sentencing Project, that number presents a 500 percent increase in incarcerations over the past 40 years. This increase produces \"prison overcrowding and fiscal burdens on states to accommodate a rapidly expanding penal system\" despite the evidence that incarceration is not working. How did this happen? The culprit is usually identified as the failed policies associated with the War on Drugs. Because blacks are disproportionately swept up in the campaign against drugs, some scholars refer to the results of mass incarceration as the new \"The New Jim Crow.\" While the original intentions may have been well-meaning the long-term consequences may be worse: The War on Drugs may actually be class-based eugenics by another name.\n\nIn her groundbreaking book, The New Jim Crow , Michelle Alexander hypothesized that given the similarity between the \"law and order\" appeals between the creation of Jim Crow Laws and similar appeals in the War on Drugs, and the resultant economic marginalization of felons after release from prison, today's mass incarceration is \"The New Jim Crow.\" The drug war is simply a new way to control the futures of African Americans. As hip hop artist Sho Baraka says, \"The war on drugs is the war on us.\" Does the racialized narrative work?\n\nBased on the most recent government data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, it is true that drug offenses comprise 51 percent of prison inmate presence and that black males comprise a higher percentage, per capita, of drug prosecutions than any other group. What is even more important, however, is that overall 37 percent of the federal prison population is black, 32 percent is Hispanic, and 28 percent is white. If mass incarceration was simply the New Jim Crow we would expect a greater racial disparity between whites and blacks in prison overall. Moreover, in 1964, at the height of the Jim Crow era, only 34 percent of US prisoners were black while 65 percent were white. Alexander's race narrative is misguided and misses the fact that mass incarceration might be just another historic example of elites using government power to control the country's \"degenerates\" - namely, the lower classes - and to create and control social outcomes that benefit the interests of those in power.\n\nIn 1877, a prison reformer by the name of Richard Dugdale noticed that prisons were increasingly populated by a particular group of people - poor whites - and that the offspring of the same group were likely to be criminals as well. After the Civil War, social progressives, relying on scientific inquiry into human nature, raised a class of social science intellectuals who concluded that America needed to deal with her degenerate populations. Matt Wray, in Not Quite White , explains that Dugdale's research and findings launched the eugenics movement in America. The backward citizens who were impeding America's progress were \"lazy, lustful, and cunning\" and were particularly sexually immoral. The reference was to lower class whites exclusively. Progressive eugenicists, taking action to control \"white trash\" and the like, launched a campaign to use government coercion to forcibly sterilize lower class whites (and later blacks). Eugenics was considered good for America's social welfare and economic progress. According to Wray, progressives sought \"legislative reform campaigns aimed at restricting foreign immigration, mandating state institutionalization of the biologically unfit, and legalizing eugenical involuntary sterilzation.\" Eugenics was a way protect society from social traits like \"pauperism, laziness, promiscuity and licentiousness, inbreeding, nomadism[idleness], and delinquency.\" Does this sound familiar?\n\nToday's prison population is largely comprised of \"lazy, lustful, and cunning\" lower class whites, blacks, and Hispanics, whom elites and progressives institutionalize in \"correctional\" facilities and then nearly permanently control them and their families in a closed ecosystem of government programs, including \"reproductive services,\" while never addressing the core moral issues that sabotage freedom and success. Sentencing someone to prison for one year on a marijuana possession charge, or in the 2011 case of Patrick Carney in Louisiana, sentencing someone to 30 years for selling $25 worth of marijuana is wasting both financial and human capital. Represented by public defenders and often unaware of their legal rights, many of these offenders are manipulated into pleading guilty to charges that high-powered attorneys would get dismissed altogether. To make matters worse, the state of California is under federal investigation for deceptively sterilizing female inmates from 2006 to 2010.\n\nThe scandal of today's mass incarceration associated with the War on Drugs is the failed attempt to use the police, lawyers, judges, corrections officers, and social workers to address issues that are profoundly moral in nature. People should be sent to prison because they are dangerous to society not because we are mad at them and want to reform them. Prisons are not churches. Without this preventative moral formation, we set the lower classes up for a lifetime - sometimes, generations - of government control. This softer form of eugenics is worse than Jim Crow.\n\nDr. Anthony Bradley, associate professor of theology at The King's College in New York City and a research fellow at the Acton Institute.

      "text": "Biden Eyes Big Win in South Carolina\n\nBiden is projected to win the South Carolina Democratic primary this weekend, which will likely cement his candidacy and silence his rivals and critics who question his age and competence.\n\nFollowing the New Hampshire primary, the Biden campaign has indicated that the president is preparing for a potential rematch with Trump.\n\nMoving ahead, Biden aims to win back the hearts of key voter demographics that helped him clinch victory in 2020. Recent polls indicate that key pillars of the Democratic base, including black, Hispanic, and young voters, are drifting away from Biden.\n\nThe president is facing a decline in support, particularly among black males, similar to trends observed among working-class white voters, says Karen Hult, a political science professor at Virginia Tech.\n\nSome African American voters, along with Hispanics and Asian Americans, are also influenced by the perception that national Democrats are overly \"woke,\" she adds.\n\nThe winner of the South Carolina Democratic primary will receive the state's 65 delegates. In addition to Biden, major Democrat candidates include Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and author Marianne Williamson. The Minnesota congressman came in second in New Hampshire, gaining nearly 20 percent of the vote.\n\nSome Democrats believe Phillips's campaign has failed to generate significant momentum or enthusiasm. As a result, they expect him to withdraw from the race soon.\n\nAnother challenge for Biden is that the border crisis has risen to the forefront in recent months, with record numbers of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. According to a recent Harvard CAPS-Harris poll, immigration has surpassed inflation as the top issue facing the nation.\n\nPundits believe this could be a defining moment for the Trump campaign. During a speech in Las Vegas on Jan. 27, Trump dedicated a significant portion of his 80-minute speech to the issue of illegal immigration.\n\n\"Our border has become a weapon of mass destruction. ... It's our destruction,\" he told his supporters.\n\nRecent polls indicate that Biden has the lowest approval rating on the issue of immigration. If the problem remains unaddressed, it could pose a significant challenge for the incumbent president in the upcoming November election, according to experts.\n\nThe president has blamed opposition from House Republicans on a potential deal with the Senate that would grant him more emergency authority to close the border. He claims he has exhausted all available options.\n\nPollster Mark Penn believes Biden has waited too long to address the issue and may not be able to take immigration off the table.\n\nRon Klink, a former Democrat congressman from Pennsylvania, however, holds a different view. He criticizes the GOP's divide and failure to back a deal on the border issue. He says American voters are smart and will realize the substantial difference between Republicans and Democrats before they cast their votes in November.\n\nRecently, young protesters have disrupted Biden's rallies on multiple occasions, creating another challenge for the president.\n\nMany young voters have expressed concern about the situation in Gaza, causing some Democrats to worry about the party's appeal in that demographic.\n\nYoung voters turned out in record numbers in 2020 and overwhelmingly supported then-candidate Biden. However, recent polls show a significant fall in the president's popularity among the youth.\n\nKaivan Shroff, a Democrat commentator and press secretary for Dream for America, a Gen Z-led nonprofit, is skeptical of these polls. He is confident that Biden will remain popular among young voters because he's prioritizing a range of issues that matter most to this demographic, such as climate change, abortion, and forgiving student loan debt.\n\n\"Democrats way outperformed expectations in November 2023,\" he said, referring to races in several states across the country, including Virginia's legislative elections, Kentucky's gubernatorial race, as well as Ohio's ballot initiatives on pro-abortion rights and marijuana legalization.\n\n\"Young voters care about the issues-particularly abortion-and showed up in 2023 to make their voices heard.\"\n\nSome Democratic strategists believe that if the 2024 national election comes down to a choice between Trump and Biden, the incumbent will be the preferred candidate among younger voters."

      "text": "Enough of the despairing conversations. Here are realistic policies to ameliorate America's epidemic of gun violence.\n\n\"As of 2020, the leading cause of death among children is guns.\" Without a source citation, a statement like this is mere hyperbole. The problem is not guns, the problem is evil. The United Kingdom has, mostly successfully, banned guns, and yet people are still being violently killed. So now they ban pocket knives. What's next? Banning sticks? Banning or licensing wrenches or screwdrivers.\n\n\"As of 2020, the leading cause of death among children is guns.\"\n\nThat statement is only true if you define children as under age 21.\n\nAmerica's murder rate places it 96th in the world.  Not exactly the problem they would have you believe, is it?\n\nBari, nice job in staying right up the middle on this one\n\nBob S.\n\nHere's a variety of thoughts on guns, arranged into some order over the last few weeks, as I've tried to find time to write them down. I've trained with guns over the years, once upon a time owned a legal firearm (but no longer), and have known gun enthusiasts, policemen/women, and military types. I've lived in laxer states and stricter ones.\n\nThe mass murders carried out with military-grade weapons could be made less likely by federal restrictions on the sale and ownership of such weapons. Congress is within its legitimate powers to do this, as the Supremes have said multiple times. While a semi-automatic rifle like the AR-15 is not a machine gun (you have to pull the trigger to fire each round), with a large magazine, you can kill a lot of people quickly with such a weapon. These weapons have become common in private ownership only recently, since the end of the Cold War. In private hands, they were rare before the 1990s. When Governor Abbott of Texas talks about the \"long\" rifles of his youth, he's thinking of a hunting rifle for shooting snakes and rabbits with one or a few rounds, not an assault rifle.\n\nAlthough they're shocking and horrifying, making parents anxious about their kids in school, the mass murders we've seen recently are not the main form of death by firearms in the US. That would be the resurgent gun violence in a couple of handful of major cities (half in only five cities, almost all in only nine). In almost all of it, the perpetrators are young black males, and the victims are almost all black, mostly also young males, although not all. Death rates having fallen for more than two decades, the new breakdown in law enforcement, supported largely by well-to-do white liberals insulated from the consequences of their own bad ideas, has meant resurgent gun violence rates.\n\nWhat few people outside law enforcement realize is that these gun crimes are largely committed with illegal weapons, usually imported illegally or assembled from illegally imported parts, sometimes stolen. *Further restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners will do nothing to stop this.* That's one aspect of the \"fantasy\" nature of so much American politics these days.\n\nWhere do these weapons come from? They are increasingly a result of the growing illicit flow of cross-border smuggling that involves the smuggling of drugs, guns, and people. The main problem is the southern border. Most of the gun crimes in major cities are committed with illegal weapons. This why prosecuting people in these cities for illegal possession of firearms is so important. Yet this is one crime of a number that the so-called \"progressive\" prosecutors have decided to not prosecute. (Why are these people still in office?) Yet it's an effective way to stop gun crime, so what gives? Here's one piece of \"progressive\" incoherence.\n\nContrary to recently published articles, there's no clear historical relationship between gun violence and gun ownership. (I leave aside suicides by gun, where there is at least a roughly clear relationship.) Gun ownership slowed in the 1980s, but started rising again in the late 1990s and 2000s, while violent crime rates and numbers fell from the early 1990s till about 2015, when the current campaign against law enforcement really got traction (largely built on lies).\n\nThe relationship of gun violence and death to demographics and the strength/weakness of law enforcement OTOH is quite clear. By far the largest crime wave in US history began at the end of the 1950s and peaked in the early 80s or early 90s (depending on what part of the country). This was an era of a large population bulge of young men, the age and sex by the most prone to violence, but also a widespread breakdown in respect for the law and law enforcement. The demographic tide turned in the late 1980s and law enforcement started to improve in the early 1990s. Presto, gun violence declined, quite markedly, in some cases down to levels not seen since the early 1960s.\n\nCan something be done at the national level? Yes, and recent Supreme Court decisions have reaffirmed this, were Congress ready and willing to do something. The flow of *guns* (not the behavior of gun *owners*) has a legitimate aspect of federal regulation, last revised in 1995. By securing the borders, especially the southern border, and especially targeting the smuggling of firearms, a great dent could be made in this flow. No other developed country puts up with the anarchy at its borders the way we do. Even many poorer countries manage a better job. This control of the *things* (not just the *people*) is a key difference between us and everyone else.\n\nIn the main I found discussion to be serious and the points well-considered.  However, a few things did stand out to me.\n\nFirst, \"...As of 2020, the leading cause of death among children is guns...\".  There's a language problem here, given that anybody under 18 would count as a \"child\" in that stat.  Most people who hear that don't think about who this is usually - a teenager with a gun robbing a store, or a gang member, that is shot dead.  Also, to make this statement suggests that abortions don't count as a cause of child death.  Defining babies as not human seems curious in a discussion that quite reasonably laments the evil of children dying in school shootings.\n\nSecond, school shootings, while evil, don't represent the majority of firearm deaths in the country.  It's not even close.\n\nThird, to the majority of firearm deaths, a variety of challenges emerge when one understands that a wide range of extant laws are simply not enforced, to wit:\n\nStraw purchasing is already against federal law, and is punishable by a fine of $250K or 10 years in prison, because to do so would involve lying on a BAFTE form 4473, which asks, \"Are you the actual transferee/buyer fo the firearm(s) listed...\".  However, this isn't aggressively enforced.  For example, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago) currently doesn't prosecute these per its publicly stated policy. This may have something to do with the high rate of crimes committed using firearms in Chicago.\n\nBy the way, minors (under 18) can't buy any firearms legally, no matter how many background checks are done.  Personally, I'd like to move the age for firearms, driving, voting, being required to get your own healthcare insurance and age at which one can consent to gender reassignment treatments to age 21, but that's me, and I digress.\n\n80% of murders in New York City (as an example) are committed by individuals having previous arrest records, including convictions.  In Philadelphia, something like 60% of cases involving firearms are dismissed or withdrawn.  Felons by law can't possess firearms, but if that law isn't enforced, it's meaningless.\n\nAs noted above, lying on a 4473 is a federal offense.  Yet, the so-called \"lie & try\", wherein people w/ every reason to believe they're prohibited from purchasing firearms gamble that the NICS won't flag them, is common.  For example, Hunter Biden apparently did this, given that he purchased a firearm and answered no to being an unlawful user of drugs.\n\nThere's a problem with the NICS background check.  On this, the response will be Approve, Deny or Delay.  Delay means they can't find a reason to Deny but can't Approve, but this turns to Approve after 3 days.  As a result, some firearms are indeed transferred to people who should have received a Deny.  Since those who completed a 4473 gave a name and address, it seems reasonable to suggest these should be confiscated, with requisite prosecution to follow, though this doesn't often happen either.\n\nFinally, every firearm transferred across a state line to a new owner has to go through a background check at a Federally-licensed firearms dealer.  Obviously if somebody moves to another state they can take their firearms with them so long as these comply with the new state's laws. Tighter enforcement of interstate transfer laws wouldn't hurt legal owners, but it has to be done by the federal government as it crosses state lines.\n\nThanks for your work on this publication, Ms. Weiss.  I'm a fan.\n\nI haven't read though all the comments below so there may have been discussions to this already. Here's my take. I'm 75 years old and pretty much have lived in the country ( other than bouts in NYC, SF, Dallas and FL). I think your missing the point. We don't have a gun problem, we have a crime problem. The reason I own guns is mainly because of the crime. I have a concealed carry permit. If you think it's easy to get one, try and get one. I live in Texas. I carry outside my property more than I carry on my place even though there's the chance I'll run into rattlesnakes or Ferrell hogs. You mentioned cars as an example. Do some research. How many folks don't have insurance? There is a lot. Everyday there are accidents caused by people with out insurance. Guns- start listing the race of the people who commit crimes. You will see it's mostly black or Latino. Drugs- most crime has to do with drugs. IT'S a crime problem not a gun problem.\n\nAlong with this solid interview, I encourage those interested to listen to Joe Rogan's long form conversation with Colion Noir (Episode #1831).  Mr. Noir is a 2A advocate and a lawyer and is, IMO, very clear-headed about this subject.\n\nFor example, the most pragmatic solution to these school shootings, after considering most of the essential facts and context, is harden the schools.  Mr. Noir outlines the essential points, unfortunately the interview 2-hour interview spends a lot of time on unrelated topics -- the relevant focus in the first and last 30 minutes.  Anyway, Mr. Noir points out there is no other nation in the world as populous as the US (320+ million), as diverse, and as grounded in a constitutional respect of human nature (power corrupts) and distrust of government authority.  The 2A has everything to do with self-defense and nothing to do with hunting and recreation, and to deny a citizen the ability to defend themselves with the same essential technology (individual firearms) government soldiers possess is reasonable -- noting fully automatic weapons are a reasonable restriction.  The topic of what background checks are, and the types of checks is eye-opening.  No one can buy a firearm from a dealer without a background check today.  Private transactions are another matter, and enforcing background checks on private non-strawman sales is a non-starter; it would require the registry of all firearms -- knowledge the government cannot be trusted with.  Practically all of these school shooters either stole their firearms or purchased them legally (meaning the background check flagged nothing -- right or wrong.)  There are 400 million firearms in the US.  They are not going to be turned in and no one in their right mind would do so leaving only criminals with firearms.  It is profoundly subjective to red flag an individual who has no criminal record -- it takes proof of demonstrated premeditated steps towards violence; something very rare and nearly impossible to catch.   So harden the schools -- that's pragmatically and rationally possible.\n\nChanging the culture that monetizes gun violence, like Hollywood films and video games is a 1A conundrum -- but it might be something to consider (me speaking).\n\nIn today's world, families take no responsibility for crazy members, mostly because they can't. The Uvalde shooter was thrown out of his mother's house, and shot his grandmother. Under current law, involuntary commitment is not an option. Even though the shooter's family probably knew he was dangerous, they realistically couldn't do much.\n\nMy brother was bipolar. He refused to take his meds, or see psychiatrists. While she was alive, my mother wired him money weekly. When she died, I set him up with a cash station card that had money transferred into it every week. He lived in Sacramento. Whenever we tried to visit him, he would avoid us, often by getting arrested. He lived on the street. A drunk driver hit and killed him in a cross walk last year.\n\nMy brother wasn't violent. He didn't do any drugs. However, there was nothing our family could do for him against his will. He would only accept money for food. He refused our help, end of story.\n\nFamilies with violent crazy people can't do much either. If the family notifies authorities, the violent crazy person may retaliate, while the authorities will most likely do nothing. That situation is what has to change.\n\nBari, as a canadian who agrees American gun laws are too lax, still i struggle with this issue. I used to own guns for hunting, gave them up when i decided to quit hunting so i have no ideological issue against guns, i think they are a useful tool when used right. And shooting is fun.\n\nBut i'm a conservative who reads your stuff, i watch Bill Maher weekly etc to get away from any bubbles and what i see constantly is the true insanity of the left, you just posted an item on another big city DA (LA this time) that is completely off the rails, and when i see this stuff i think to myself its no wonder that gun enthusiasts are the way they are. When i read this stuff i also think i should go buy some guns just in case.\n\nI think this is a self sustaining loop. The most rabidly anti-gun types are probably clinically insane in so many ways.\n\nI wish I could know ahead of time when David French is going to be in an article so I can avoid it. I would not have subscribed to this had I known I'd get a regular dose of that dumb SOB, so at least give me the chance to avoid ruining my morning by reading  his dumbassery. Also, people kill people. Guns help them in their killing of people. We don't have a gun violence problem. We have a violence problem humans generally have a violence problem. It existed before guns and will exist after them.\n\nThis was an exceptionally thoughtful and informative discussion regarding crime and our collective efforts to reduce it. My concerns, living in Chicago, is the lack of enforcement of existing gun laws. It's discouraging to see suspects arrested with guns, being released with ankle monitors. The recidivism rate is very high amongst this cohort. I would suggest, gun control for bad guys first. Then we can address the less lower hanging fruit.\n\nSame problem here in Canada, our posturing pony Justin Trudeau just made a big deal about some new gun rules, capitalizing on the latest shooting down there, rules which make things tougher for law abiding owners but do absolutely nothing about criminals and their illegal smuggled guns which is 99.9% of our gun \"problem\".\n\nAll virtue signaling, no solutions. So its not as though we have anything figured out up here.\n\nEven if we were to accept the Left's ludicrous demand that we treat school shootings exclusively as a \"gun\" issue and not as a culture rot issue (the reverse is far more justified), proper policy would be to enforce scandalously-unenforced current laws, not to impose new laws that will also be selectively enforced and abused.\n\nA good summary is here:\n\nhttps://www.nationalreview.com/corner/mcconnell-is-going-the-wrong-way-on-guns/\n\nYou said \"Enough of the despairing conversations\" and You just had another one of those. Nothing will ever change if the true elephant in the room is not addressed: Americans have way too many guns and a gun culture, that encourages gun violence including that awkward second amendment, that some violent slave owners enshrined in the American Constitution.\n\nHow can You turn things around?\n\n1. Get rid of that stupid second amendment! People elsewhere don't have this kind of BS in their constitution and they aren't missing anything.\n\n2. Reduce the number of firearms in private hands drastically. The more there are out there the more will eventually end up in the wrong hands and cause tragedy. The less guns out there the safer your country will be.\n\n3. Get rid of Your silly gun culture that tells people You can fix everything with a gun and if a gun doesn't fix it they just need more guns.\n\nBut You know what? I don't think Americans will ever get it. So nothing will change, no matter how much useless blabla is uttered, including the most stupid reaction to gun violence imaginable, all those utterly useless \"thoughts and prayers\", which always replace effective action when \"it\" has happened again.\n\nIt's a fact: Americans love their guns more than they love their children. That's why they'll keep on burying their children instead of their guns. Your \"despairing conversation\" You had here will not change a damn thing about that attitude since You are not even considering radical change like getting rid of any of those 3 things I mentioned above. I hope You will never have to bury a child of You're own, not because I wanna spare You from that, but I hate to see innocent children die because of the inaction of their parents. And no.....Your blabla is not the kind of action needed here. It won't prevent the next very predictable carnage.\n\nNinety-sixth-highest murder rate in the world causes you to write so hysterically?  Wow.\n\nThe Sheriff of my county encourages everyone to get trained, permitted, and own guns.  Why?  Because it's a big county and it would take 20 min for a deputy to get to you in an emergency.  We have the right to defend our lives.  And we have very little crime here.  You never know who has a concealed weapon.  If someone breaks into your home and you shoot him, a jury is not going to convict you.  According to your ideas, the good citizens are to be defenseless while the criminals keep their guns.  No, we won't accept that.\n\nThen keep burying Your children if it's that what You want.\n\nWhere I grew up nobody had guns, even the criminals had to use knives as weapons. Because guns were hard to get. You couldn't just break into places of good citizens like Yourself to steal them. And guess what? Nobody needed guns for self protection. There were zero mass shootings. Crime was extremely low. And there was no need for special exercises how to protect against armed intruders in school, because there never was even a single one coming after students at school.\n\nDo You know that most guns used by criminals started their \"career\" as a gun legally owned by a gun store owner or by a citizen like Yourself for self protection? Once they are there it's close to impossible to keep them out of the wrong hands.\n\nHere's another problem: Lot's of Americans will develop some form of dementia when they get old. Including a large number of legal gun owners, who have never harmed anybody in their lives and are perfectly good citizens. Also including legal gun owners who are already paranoid about the government wanting to take their guns away from them, which may sound crazy to some, but at least is not illegal. People suffering from dementia are not save with guns. They tend to get confused and unable to judge situations. Often they feel threatened for no reason at all. That doesn't make them evil persons. It's just the nature of the medical condition they have developed.\n\nYou know You have to take away guns from those at some point? Anything else will result in countless tragedies. Good luck with that, especially with those with this paranoia that their government is after their guns and they have to defend themselves and their right to have them.\n\nI've even heard of people with dementia shooting their own son or daughter in their home, because they didn't recognize their own kid and felt they had to defend themselves against an intruder!\n\nClearly you are not American.  Read the link describing the process to repeal an Amendment.  It is not a snap your fingers and it is done thing. https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/what-does-it-take-to-repeal-a-constitutional-amendment\n\nAll it takes is enough political will. But without kicking this garbage out of Your constitution You will have to live with gun violence forever and keep burying Your children.\n\nAnd yes, thanks god I'm no American. I lived in the US for 2 years though, in Washington DC of all places and I remember all to well the fear when I walked through certain parks at night or took certain lines of public transportation. I still remember that I took the advice of a friend to always carry a 20-$-note with me, in case a get mugged and look into the barrel of a gun, so that I have something to give to the thief, because a happy thief is less likely to shoot You. How can people live like that?\n\nUS gun culture is constantly changing, and David French represents an older version of it-one that is afraid of embarassing itself in front of the anti-gun establishment and seemingly disdainful of the rights or needs of people outside of its good-old-boy members. For somebody with a much more thorough, honest understanding of the gun culture than French has, look to sociologist David Yamane, who has spent a decade studying it from the inside. If you want to \"understand the maximalist position\", as Rajiv rightly suggests you should, you probably couldn't do much better than Matt Larosiere, the passionate, articulate, well-versed Director of Legal Policy for the Firearms Policy Coalition.\n\nSchool shooters (including Uvalde) are young father deprived males. Black on black murder is most often committed by young father deprived males. The divorce industry and its ever expanding feminist driven gynocentric anti-male destruction of fathers parental rights and access to drama free child visitation ensures the production of dissociated violent youth. The goal is total banishment of the father from his child's life. It isn't an accident and THE PROBLEM ISN'T GUNS. Intentional or not, the planned destruction of family, kinship and fatherhood now comes full circle to include use of the word \"mother\".  The war is won. The love and holy union shared between a man and woman is now criminal. The woman is married too, and the child belongs to the State. Leonard Cohen was correct: \"...the naked man and woman are just a shining artifact of the past..\"\n\nPretending that guns and senseless violence is anything other than the in-your-face cultural and social disintegration of the American Republic is as pathological as the perpetrators making it happen. It isn't rocket science. The gutting of a nations industry and the looting of its economy creates HUMAN DAMAGE.  Poverty creates crime. The forced imposition of a lie on either an individual or a nation wounds the psyche. Living in a manufactured feudalism in perpetual debt servitude robs individuals of their dignity, creativity and their future.  The subjugation and dismantling of the greatest educational system in the world by mercenary ideologues creates crazies. Depression, anxiety, addiction, poverty and violence are the hallmarks of economic and political repression. It's not something else.\n\nHow many Jews died in WWII  because of their rationalization of the belief that their own position of financial comfort, reasonableness and social respectability would save them from the machinations of monsters. Many believed right up until the knock on the door. Have you not seen the dressed as Star Wars characters, let me put a chip in your head, trans-humanist, men are really women, financial totalitarians of the WEF? The cyber prison ascends.\n\nWe live in a weaponized Tower of Babel. Truth, the discussion of legitimate human experience, concern and reason are criminal. CAN THE TRUTH SPEAKERS SET US FREE and save us from  ourselves? The ideological is now pathological. We need an entirely new national dialogue and an honoring and return to the inner world human language whose words spring directly from the human heart and Soul.  Are we not human beings first?\n\nExpect more of the same.\n\nGot Constitution?\n\nBari,\n\nI remember hearing you discuss (on a podcast with Jordan Peterson?) the problem of audience capture, and that you wanted to challenge your readers instead of just publishing things that they would agree with.\n\nPlease keep up the good work, with pieces just like this.\n\nThe Common Sense commentariat is overwhelmingly boomer-conservative* in its make-up, and it's rare to see much in the way of dissent or disagreement relative to that perspective here in the comment section.  Which makes me think that audience capture is in fact happening, and adds to the importance of hosting the perspective of a Rajiv Sethi alongside the profile of your typical guests.\n\nHonestly continues to be the best podcast I listen to, in terms of the topics, guests, and your interview style.\n\n[*No disrespect to my dear Boomer-Cons.  I'm blessed to have many of you as friends, coworkers, and family]\n\nFirst, there is no \"gun violence epidemic\". The FBI Uniform Crime Report tells the real story. Since 1992 crimes of violence - specifically those involving firearms - have been in steady decline, with a minor uptick in 2014 (I think) and beginning in 2020 (coinciding with the COVID lockdowns).\n\nLittle-known takeaway fact: in any given year, four to five times as many murders are committed with knives - the Report says \"knives or other cutting instruments\" - than with rifles of any description. So, let's have the conversation about \"assault weapons\", but only after we have the conversation about knives.\n\nSecond, the \"commonsense gun control legislation\" is anything but. Quick question: would any of the measures, had they already been in place, have prevented the Uvalde shooting? Uhm, no. Buffalo, NY? No again. Any other mass shooting? Again, no. These are just feel-good measures whose only purpose is to give dishonest politicians an opportunity to tell us that they had made the hard choices and taken responsible action.\n\nThird - and this is surprising - multiple studies have revealed that armed, law-abiding citizens intervene in the commission of a crime more often than firearms are used to commit crimes. Think about that for a moment. Except for the armed citizen, every one of those incidents would be moved to the \"crime committed\" column.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/paulhsieh/2018/04/30/that-time-the-cdc-asked-about-defensive-gun-uses/#2f9c2ce0299a\n\nFourth, these folks did the heavy lifting in a good-faith attempt to show that \"commonsense gun control laws\" would really make a difference. I applaud Ms Libresco's honesty in writing this article.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/i-used-to-think-gun-control-was-the-answer-my-research-told-me-otherwise/2017/10/03/d33edca6-a851-11e7-92d1-58c702d2d975_story.html?utm_term=.460dc1a3ddf3\n\nFinally, for real commonsense, vetted and validated information on this subject, go here:\n\nhttps://www.justfacts.com/guncontrol\n\n2014 was the lowest murder rate in the US in a long time. Around 4/100,000 I believe. Then it went up in 15 and 16 due to the \"Ferguson Effect\" as the Obama DOJ suppressed law enforcement along with the beginnings of the BLM / defund the police movement. With Obama out, the murder rate went down in 17, 18 and 19.  The. BLM big time and Democrat mayors suppressed their own police. The US murder rate in 2021 (final stats not out yet) and 2022 are going to be the highest in decades.\n\nSpot on."

      "text": "Our nation is stained by cowardice. It is sustained by selflessness.\n\nWell said.\n\nSo many problems with the viewpoint presented here. First, we simply don't yet know enough to render a verdict. Was it reasonable to assume that a storming of the classroom and the expected barrage of bullets flying in both directions was likely to lessen the child's body count, or increase it? Second, the writer inexplicably assumes that the officers' holding was driven by cowardice, ignoring the obvious fact that they were following orders. And third, keeping panicked parents from running into the building was the right call. Finally, the writer aims to focus our anger at the officers, rather than at the shooter, the culture that formed him or the government that armed him.\n\nPolice will go through protestors like paper though. Chickens and pigs on this animal farm. This isn't a defense of the protestors, they're the horse going to the glue factory.\n\nI agree with your assessment on the actions by the officers at the scene.  Please write / talk about the issue of gun control. We need an honest assessment of the subject.\n\nAt the heart of this tragedy lie some basic questions we politicize ad infinitum. How does a mentally challenged kid buy guns legally?. Why are the police not held accountable for bad behavior. How can a governor call for promoting a relaxed gun culture at a time when the same culture is producing more shootings and violence. And finally is my right under the second amendment greater than your right to live?.\n\nThere is no way to completely lock down schools. If you limit schools to a single entry point, then you're going to have kids die in fires. You need to keep fire doors and then keep people from ever using them (except in a fire). Then you put a guard at the entry point. But, in Texas, anyone can open carry from my understanding so the guard at the entry point is going to have to make a split second decision--is this person just a parent open carrying or are they a shooter? The shooter is always going to have the advantage because, until they fire the first shot, no one knows they're a shooter.\n\nAnd, for argument's sake, say you CAN completely harden a school. Then a shooter will just go on a school bus rampage instead. Can you also completely harden every school bus? It would be crazy expensive and almost impossible.\n\nThat's why, as this article says, trust that the police will quickly respond is the only thing that can bring any peace of mind. I live in a small town and EVERYONE here--Rs and Ds--supports the police with money, attending events, etc. Demoralization of the police--as has happened in big cities--isn't an issue here and likely isn't one in Uvalde where it seems people also have (had?) a high opinion of cops.\n\nUvalde is a truly tragic and heartbreaking event rendered more painful by police ineptitude. But how could an article be written without focusing on the core problem.\n\nAn 18 year old, not old enough to legally buy a beer, was able to legally buy an AR 15 assault rifle. This is the problem. The solution is not putting the police in jail, adding locks and security guards to schools etc. 75-85% of Americans want some form of gun law to solve this problem, and yet our elected officials stand by and bicker and the President says his hands are tied. Who will you blame the next time when only 10 kids are killed because the police do their job? Please focus on the core problem and blame our inept elected officials who take the NRA's money in the name of the constitution and our poor wise founding fathers who never knew what assault rifles were when they drafted it.\n\nThis 18 year old did not possess an 'assault rifle'. He had a semi automatic long gun, which aside from the passing similarity to it's military cousin, could have been any one of a hundred long guns or pistols that do not look like military rifles. An 'assault rifle' is commonly understood to mean a rifle that can fire on full automatic. That type of long gun requires a very special license to own, and is illegal to sell without said license.\n\nWhile you are correct, most people want something done about gun violence, none of the current prescriptions being debated protect both the right to bear arms and the means to lower the prevalence of gun violence.\n\nFinally, and this may not be the case with you in particular, but the selective outrage by the country when a mass shooting incident involving white people and/or children is quite the sight. In 2020, the homicide rate by guns among blacks was 26.6 per 100k, while among whites it was 2.2 per 100k. In Canada, for example, the rate of gun homicides is 2.1 per 100k. Among black males, the homicide rate by gun is north of 50 per 100k. 11.5k blacks were killed in 2020 by guns, and unless that gun was held by a cop, almost no body except the immediate family cared.\n\nBy all means, go through the grieving process over this tragedy in Uvalde, however once done, try to focus on policies that will actually lower the death toll in this country, and not on policies that make YOU less afraid.\n\nDavid French makes a good point about the selfishness of power.  We live in time of me, me, me and what I want, need, must have:  incredible self-centeredness.  I have often mused that most Americans have never had to struggle to survive.  Well, we do now:  for our jobs; gasoline; food; health and everything else we have taken for granted.  All of this thanks to our power-hungry politicians who have betrayed our trust.  I am sadly not convinced it will ever get better.\n\nThank you David for softening some of my cynicism about how \"me, me, me\" I find our present culture to be.\n\nAs a long ago vet, your final words reminded me of how growing up in the 40's I was constantly told \"we\" can do this or that. Later on I needed to examine my young self and learn to add \"love\" to \"we,\" thus forming a most important concept.\n\nMost Vets, and the men and women in civilian life who strap on a gun each day know what you mean. So do most parents.\n\nYour work is often filled with grace, which is why I read your missives.\n\nThe moral center and  leadership of the nation has been captured by the pay-to-play, big tech, corporatist, political/bureaucratic surveillance state and the communist Marxist plunderers it employs. Family and religious community, small business, industry and legitimate education are seen as direct threats to its power. In short: the functioning healthy adult human being must be criminalized for its survival. The constant reports we receive here of the criminal destruction of worthy lives, both inside and outside academia by the D.E.I. commissariat, the open censorship and willful crippling of truth speakers by big tech, and the continued lies and open grift of line my pockets political operatives touting the latest \"citizens are terrorists we need thought control\" is our daily bread.\n\nThis has everything to do with Uvalde. The stand down chain of command individuality murdered wait for the bureaucracy can't take action police, handcuffed parents (as in school board meetings) listening to the massacre and victimization of their children, the technicolor horror of yet another parentless child fallen through the cracks of a disintegrating culture. A country and a generation left looted and futureless.  The exploitation of guns as the problem. The entire nation has a been crippled by a cabal of elitist thugs. Uvalde is just blowback.\n\nThe D.C./financial cabal has abandoned America. It has looted and gutted American industry and economy.  It has made the decision that America is no longer a sound investment. Its money (your looted tax dollars and labor) and future is elsewhere. American citizenship is the problem. It sees a  system of feudalistic perpetual debt and big tech bureaucratic police state surveillance as the solution to YOU.\n\nThis is grimly poetic and painfully accurate.  It feels too late for correction.  A start might be 2 years of civilian or military service following high school, no exceptions. A nation without shared values cannot hold.\n\nIt strains credulity to believe that 50-100 officers from local, state, and federal agencies stood down for 78 minutes listening to gunfire as children were slaughtered, based on the order of the police chief of the schools squad. And for 12 minutes the gunman was shooting outside. And a door was left open for 3 minutes while a teacher called 911. And nobody went to the windows to evaluate and stop the shooter. And it happened 3 days before the Texas NRA convention. 78 minutes without a door key, a master key, a brave outlier, a superior taking command. Cops who went in and got their own kids. Parents who went in. Parents handcuffed to prevent their entry into the school. We are left with one conclusion by the media:  50-100 officers allowed a classroom to become an abbatoir due to being outgunned by an AR-15 in an 18-year-old shooter's hands.  And then an off-duty Border Patrolman takes him out, no details provided.\n\nWe are tortured trying to explain the inexplicable, poisoned forever by a multitude of conflicting stories, while we dissect every angle and probe the what-ifs and the why's. Could you fault me for suspecting that the stand-down order came from a place much higher in the chain of command?\n\nI highly doubt the primary reason the cops didn't rush the room was because they were scared, that seems like quite a reach and there's no evidence of that so far.  Besides, it doesn't really make sense.\n\nMuch more likely is they 1) thought there's a chance the shooter was alone and wanted to take the time for a solid breach, 2) didn't want to accidentally shoot a kid.  That second one is probably what they really might have been scared about, and not getting shot themselves.  Not only would that be a career ender, they would basically be eternally branded as a kid-killer for the rest of their short life (short, because of suicide).\n\nIn an earlier time, one could probably wait it out and manage some sort of life after that.  But these times we're in now magnify everything to the Nth degree.  Right now, being a cop is a damn hard job.\n\nFor several years now, we've been told that we need to hire police officers with a \"guardian\" mindset -- a desire to prevent crime by developing good communication with their community -- instead of a \"warrior\" mindset -- a willingness to use violence to prevent crime. https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/police-training-programs-fostering-warrior-mindset-face-increasing-scrutiny . https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190226155011.htm\n\nUvalde needed some warriors.  They got what they THOUGHT they needed and what they probably voted for -- guardians.\n\nyes. The training given to the police there is that they are indeed to \"stop the killing\" as the first priority. They are NOT to wait for back up. And, furthermore, they've been told if they are unwilling to put their safety at risk in such a situation, they should look for a new line of work. Apparently, these guys never thought that their oath to serve and protect would ever be put to the test.\n\nSo You have found some convenient scapegoats to blame for this latest carnage. Two police officers who might not have done all they could to stop it.\n\nThat might be the case, but what You really need to talk about is the true elephant in the room: All kinds of guns are way too easy to obtain in the US for everybody, including guns that where especially designed to enable any shooter to kill as many people in as short a time as possible. Why is that? Is it a god given right that everybody should be enabled to go out and obtain the tools he needs to massacre as many people as he likes when he feels like it? I can see the need of hunting rifles being accessible to those who wanna use this food source. I'm also fine with small calibre firearms for sport, but I think it's insane to allow people the possession of war style weaponry like sniper rifles and automatic or semiautomatic killer guns. Only trained professionals should be able to access those kind of weaponry.\n\nAnd that's Your main problem in your country. Nobody wants or dares to address this elephant in the room, exspecially no politicians in positions of power because the gun violence lobby NRA is way to powerful and can stop any political career in its tracks when a politician is actually trying to do something against the carnage instead of just talking the usual bullshit like those ridiculous \"thoughts and prayers to the loved ones\" and other stuff that fails to address the root causes of all this senseless killing and dying.\n\nEverybody everywhere in the world knows what needs to happen in the US to keep American children safe, everywhere except in some backward states in the US, with Texas being one of the worst. (I watched a news conference the other day with some Texan officials and immediately realized that they were as useless to fix the problem as their cowboy hats were large. Who could ever vote such pathetic relics of centuries long gone into positions of power?)\n\nI grew up in Germany, where quite tough and efficient gun control laws have always been in place. In our school there was no need for drills what to do when some nut with an big gun shows up. No one ever got any funny ideas about arming teachers. What for? I was never afraid to go to school (except when I had skipped homework and my math teacher was a tough one). Nothing ever happened that exceeded the occasional black eye when we students had our disagreements. No need for armed cops in the vicinity. School shootings were unheard of, at least in our country, we only heard about that weird place half way around the world where they cultivate their gun problem and end up having to bury some of their kids from time to time.\n\nSo, American politicians.....just quit talking bullshit and start acting. If You still don't know what to do, look around in places where they don't have that habit of shooting dead their own children and see what they do different there. If You still don't get it. It's called GUN CONTROL, the stricter the better. And if You're no politician, than do not donate any money to the NRA, those rotten promoters of gun violence and do not vote for any official who takes even a single cent of bribe money from those morons.\n\nThat's how You fix Your problem. By now You should have noticed that anything else, like arming teachers, have armed security in all schools etc, does not work and is only suggested all the time to distract You from seeing the true elephant in the room.\n\nWhat is everybody waiting for? Don't say anything more, just get to work. You've got it cut out for You!\n\n\"Sustained by selflessness.\" Yes. Selflessness is the problem, but not the solution.\n\nNo self-respecting adult more than 40 years old would take a job as a cop today. Only someone who has no intention of getting killed on the job would take a job where people are encouraged by the elites to hate the police.  A person with no self-esteem, self-respect, or self-reliance is genuinely selfless. Yep, the only good cops are dead cops. We've all heard that.  If it's self-sacrifice, they might be praise-worthy, unless they shot a hostage child in the process of dying themselves.\n\nYou can call it cowardice, but after 20 years of school shootings, I consider the shooters and the people in charge of stopping them all selfless - no self-esteem, self-respect, or self-reliance-just a lot of ineptitude and anger.\n\nIf selflessness is the problem, self-esteem, self-respect, and self-reliance are the solution. We need a self-empowered culture to end the culture of selflessness.  Sacrifice is death.  A culture valuing death more than life is on borrowed time."

      "text": "A reader who is a senior physician writes in response to the \"Hour Of Wolves And Shattered Shields\" post. I have blurred some of this to protect her privacy):\n\nLike the person who wrote to you, I too am having problems with the idea of white privilege. The house I grew up in was all that my parents could afford. It had no heating system and because the house was more than 120 years old, in poor repair, my mother refused to burn anything in the one fireplace. My room was so cold in the winter time that ice would form, several inches thick. My great grandmothers made quilts. Yet I slept with socks, long johns, a long night gown and a wool hat and buried myself beneath the quilts. My clothes for school came from the Salvation Army or Heart and Hand. More than once I was humiliated by classmates who recognized an older sister's dress. I took a job with my local newspaper writing copy and taking photos of events in my county. I was 11. When I discovered I could also pitch stories to several other newspapers in neighboring counties, it was a red letter day. 10 cents per copy inch and 3 dollars per published photo. Processing my own B&W photos was cheaper than having it done professionally, so I kept more of my profit.\n\nOn that last point, the reader makes me think about the most famous performer to come from Baton Rouge, my city: the rapper Boosie Badazz. Here he is from a video earlier in his career, shot in his north Baton Rouge neighborhood:\n\nCan't imagine why those gentlemen remain economically marginalized. Must be racism.\n\nFor its size, Baton Rouge is one of the most murder-ridden cities in the country. Last year, 75 percent of the victims were black males. If you know Baton Rouge, then you can read this map of 2019 homicides , and realize that they overwhelmingly took place in predominantly black neighborhoods.\n\nBut the real problem is police violence? Right.\n\nUPDATE: Comment from Wyoming Doc:\n\nI can absolutely see much of my own life in your correspondent above.\n\nI too have been in academic medicine for decades. I have done everything I know to do to foster careers of physicians that are not only African-American, but also Hispanic, American Indian (real ones - not Elizabeth Warren types), and Asians. I did this because they are the ones who can go back to their communities with credibility - and be physicians.\n\nI have had the privilege of mentoring dozens and dozens of these individuals that are now in practice all over this country. I am in touch with them constantly - I love to hear their stories. I feel that I am truly blessed to have had such influence on their lives. I know from my old students and residents that there is a struggle now for the soul of the African American community. Many of my old students understand the struggle - but also find the whole current approach just incomprehensible. They, like me, working in inner city hospitals, in the heart of the crisis, can easily see that there is so much more going wrong with our minority communities than \"white privilege\" or police problems. We physicians have known this for years - but no one listened. Your video above is absolutely representative of one of the big problems in young black men - the adulation of drug abuse, misogyny, thuggish behavior, and antisocial attitudes that our entire society now worships in their music and culture. Instead of the young men learning how to support families and be fathers, they emulate this behavior. It is truly a vicious cycle. And here is the core of the issue - I was in our inner city culture as a physician for 30 years, I have not a clue how to fix this problem.\n\nYour readers may assume that I have white privilege. I came from a very very humble background in a very rural part of this country. Dirt poor. But my parents loved me - and gave me all the skills I needed to succeed in this life. Hard hard work was my life as a kid and young man. It has served me well as an adult.\n\nAnd my wife? She is a Chinese immigrant. She grew up in an area of China that is still steeped in their traditional ways. She is a graduate of their version of MIT. She is 1000 times smarter than I am. The second that children came into our lives - she quit her job and her career. There was no question in her mind that would be done - there was no talking her out of it either. There has been very little TV watching or other screen time in our house. When it is on - it is PBS documentaries - Nature and Nova and American Experience. Certainly no video games. She has been teaching the kids Mandarin and English spelling, diction and vocabulary and writing since age 2. She began teaching math and science at age 4. They are outside running and playing 4-5 hours daily. They are doing Tai Chi and martial arts taught by her at home daily. We have gardens and plants - and it is now their job to manage them. The children beam when we eat their food. The Chinese way is intense mental stimulation and physical stimulation all at the same time every day of a child's life.\n\nThis is going on all over this country in Asian households. Their children are considered their most important treasure - absolutely nothing else matters. Is it any wonder that their ACT and SAT scores in general are much higher than any other ethnic groups? I personally have been amazed at my wife's tenacity. Her \"teaching\" simply is levels beyond anything I have experienced as a Caucasian growing up in this country.\n\nAnd now - last night on her WeChat came a petition from her Chinese university's alumni association. This issue has not received much media coverage in the last few weeks - but there is now a major push in universities all over America to quit using ACT and SAT scores as admission criteria. You see - many of our best universities admissions are loaded to the gills with Asian and Indian kids - the other races simply cannot compete on the basis of these scores. Therefore, we dump the scores. This development has been viewed as a hard slap in the face to the Asian community. Indeed, the title of the petition was \"Do Asian Lives Matter?\"\n\nRod - I am truly in a quandary. It is obvious to me that our society has a big problem with the development of young minority kids. If I was growing up with a father (probably not my mother's husband) like the guy in your video - I can only imagine what would have become of my life. This has nothing to do with white privilege. This has nothing to do with police brutality. After being in the big middle of it for 30 years - I have ZERO solutions on how we break this vicious cycle. I know for sure it is going to take a lot more than defunding police and \"throwing money\" at the problem.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "\"You need to move to New Orleans,\" said my friend, who lives Uptown.\n\nI told him that that's a good idea in theory -- New Orleans fits my sensibility like a velvet glove, and I could finally achieve my destiny of becoming Ignatius Reilly. But the fact is, I don't want to live in a place so ridden with crime. It's a great place, but not worth it to me, not at my age, anyway. Look:\n\nNew Orleans' murder rate is on pace to be one of the highest in the world in 2022 after already sharp increases in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe city has recorded 145 murders as of June 30, putting it on pace for nearly 300 murders this year and a rate of 74.12 per 100,000 population. That rate would dwarf Chicago's 18.26 murders per 100,000 population and would rank 9th among major cities in the world that are not at war, according to 2018 data compiled by the Citizen Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice, a Mexico City-based advocacy group.\n\nThe surging murder rate continues to b a troubling trend for the city, which saw murders rise from 119 in 2019 to 201 in 2020. That number continued to climb in 2021, reaching 218, an 83% increase over 2019 numbers.\n\nIt's not quite Jackson, Miss., levels of violence -- that's 97 murders per 100,000 residents -- but it's far higher than the murder rate of the world's most violent country, El Salvador, which has 52 killings per 100,000 residents. There's a lot to recommend New Orleans, but not enough to overcome the risk of falling victim to violent crime or property crime. Your mileage may vary.\n\nToday on his Substack (subscriber-only), Ed West writes about how the police in his native Britain have all but given up on solving crimes -- and on the wider cost to society caused by crime. For example, West has had six bikes stolen since he started riding around London twenty years ago. None were ever recovered, as almost no stolen bikes are ever recovered in Britain. This makes bicycle theft basically legal there.\n\nAt the Baldwin Substack, Works in Progress editor Ben Southwood recently looked at the cost of crime in the US, citing one paper estimating it to be $2.6 trillion annually - about 12% of GDP, an immense drain on society. But, as he points out, the actual total is probably larger, because this figure doesn't cover the cost of crime-prevention.\n\n'People try their damnedest to avoid being the victims of crime,' Southwood writes: 'This leads to many extremely socially costly behaviours. Some of these have really obvious \"macro\" effects. People who fear new neighbours have a substantial risk of committing crimes tend to oppose new development nearby, and to live in extremely spread out \"sprawl\" suburbs, where sheer walking distance between places makes crime more difficult. What's more, people in high-crime areas prefer to travel with metal shields around them at all times - that is by car - causing dramatically higher carbon emissions. By contrast ultra-low-crime Japan is tolerant of high-density development throughout its cities, and rates of cycling, walking, and transit use are all extremely high, while carbon emissions are much lower.'\n\nThe issue of NIMBYism is more existential in the US because, with its huge supply of land and more extreme violence, neighbourhoods and even whole cities can quickly fall apart as law-abiding taxpayers flee crime. It makes complete sense for people to oppose housing projects which might lead to disorder and a spiral of secondary migration.\n\nI'm in Baton Rouge this month, settling my affairs before moving to Budapest -- a city whose safety shocked a visiting friend from Birmingham, Alabama, earlier this year. The other day, I was talking to someone older and more knowledgeable about the future of Baton Rouge. He said that over the coming decades, he expects the middle class to accelerate its abandonment of the Louisiana capital, pressured by crime and the realization that there's nothing really to be done about the failed state that is the northern half of the city, which is overwhelmingly poor, black, and violent. There are no government programs that can compensate for generations of collapsed family structures and family networks, he said. We have not figured out how to replace fathers as agents of socialization for males. Until and unless we do, we are going to see rampant crime from young impoverished black males.\n\nIt cannot be said often enough that according to FBI statistics, though black males are disproportionately the committers of crime, their victims are usually other black people. Black people are the greatest victims of black crime. Don't forget that.\n\nI have never understood the case against the so-called \"carceral state\". Of course it's not good to have a large proportion of one's population locked up in prison. But have people forgotten why criminals get sent to prison in the first place? For committing violent crimes! Ed West writes:\n\nWhat does reduce offending, though, is incapacitation, with 'multiple studies find[ing] strong evidence that [it] works to prevent crime' - in other works, prison works.\n\nNot only would expanding the prison population be a worthwhile investment in terms of the savings made from lower crime, but it would also be worth spending on more comfortable and pleasant jails, such as those of the Norwegians, 'marked by their civilised treatment of prisoners.' Give them comfortable rooms, televisions, free subscriptions to their favourite Substack writers - but keep them away from the people they will inevitably hurt.\n\nThe Tory-led governments of the past 12 years have largely forgotten the Victorian wisdom that a section of the population are not capable of caring for themselves, some because they are bad but most because they lack impulse control or are enslaved to addiction: they will bring misery to themselves and those around them, and so even from a straight-up cost-benefit analysis, let alone deeper moral considerations, it is worth spending money on their care and incapacitation. This is also seen with psychiatric care, which was partly dismantled in the later 20th century due to a combination of radical ideological reasons and small-state callousness. Since 2010 there has been a 25% drop in NHS psychiatric beds, and reduced psychiatric beds lead to an increase in prison numbers.\n\nSubscribe to West's Substack to read the whole thing -- you'll be glad you did.\n\nLouisiana, where I live, is one of the most violent American states. Here, from the Louisiana Department of Corrections, is a demographic breakdown of who is in our prisons:\n\nThe state's black population is 31.4 percent, according to the 2020 census. Because half of those are males, then roughly 15 percent of the Louisiana population produces two-thirds of those incarcerated in the state's prisons. What's more, according to the demographic breakdown provided by the state, almost half of the state's inmates come from its big cities (New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Shreveport).\n\nAn aside: when liberals mock so-called \"Red States\" like Louisiana for having high crime rates, despite voting conservative, they overlook the fact that many Southern red states have large black populations -- and that those populations, who are not Republican voters, produce the high crime rates.\n\nI focus on the racial angle because activists condemn the \"carceral state\" as racist, because of the disproportionate number of black men in prison. My argument is that the number of black men in prison is so high because the number of black men who commit violent crimes is so high. Again, let's take Louisiana. According to the FBI's most recent statistics , here is a breakdown of who is committing violent crimes here:\n\nFifty-seven percent of the violent crimes in Louisiana that can be attributed to a member of a racial demographic are committed by black people, at least in the most recent year in which we have reliable statistics. Though 66 percent of Louisiana's prison inmates are black, this could have something to do with much higher crime rates in past years, when inmates still in jail were sentenced. Louisiana is arguably the most violent, crime-ridden state in the country. But if there were no black people in Louisiana, and assuming that the \"unknown\" category above is 100 percent non-black (which cannot be true, but let's just assume it), the violent crime rate here would not be 639.4 violent crimes per 100,000 people (as it is today), but 364.8 per 100,000 -- that is, about in the midrange of American states:\n\nMy point is this: prison populations are disproportionately black because violent criminals are disproportionately black. As Ed West points out, the cost to society at large from crime is immense. No places bear those costs more heavily than black neighborhoods, and majority black cities. The objectively pro-black thing to do is to get more of those criminals off the streets and behind bars, so decent people can get on with their lives. But we refuse to see this.\n\nI wonder what it's going to take to cause society at large to turn on the Black Lives Matter activists who racialized the crime issue and put society at large on the defense for wanting to protect itself against the small population of violent black men who prey on decent people -- again, first of all decent black people? I recently posted an item here (though I can't find it now) highlighting a woke video a Colorado high school showed to its students, urging them not to report it to the police if they are victimized by a BIPOC criminal, because they would subject that BIPOC person to the racism of the police. This is morally insane. These activists, and their collaborators within institutions like that high school, are training people to acquiesce to their own rape and robbery for the sake of a twisted idea of racial virtue.\n\nIt will be a good day when society, both in Britain and America, rediscovers the truth that people who threaten the safety of law-abiding citizens, and who threaten the civil order, deserve prison, without remorse or apology. Middle-class people of whatever race have the wherewithal to pick up and move (indeed, as reporting from Jackson has shown, the white flight out of Mississippi's capital was followed by the flight of the black middle class, which sensibly wants to live in safe neighborhoods away from violent poor people). But the poor and working class, they have no choice but to live in cities where they and their families suffer from endemic violence, and where the social fabric is so tattered that their male children are socialized into a culture of violence and criminality.\n\nSome people -- almost always young men -- have shown by their behavior that they have no place in society. Prisons are ugly places, but necessary ones. The only people who can afford to be sentimental about this are those whose money and privilege buys them distance from criminals and criminal culture. I have no problem with spending tax money to improve prison conditions, but I also have no problem with spending tax money to build more prisons. What is the alternative? In Britain, we're seeing it -- and in New Orleans too, with its woke DA.\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "Sometimes big political developments arrive in the country like Sandburg's fog, on little cat feet, silent and unnoticed until they envelop the nation. The emergence of Donald Trump four years ago is an example. Though a loud and clamorous candidate, he seemed to many like a kind of political clown destined for defeat. Establishment politicians believed almost to a person that the \"blue wall\" of Democratic electoral dominance would hold against this guy. The Midwest would stay solid, and Hillary Clinton would win the presidency.\n\nBut a silent fog was moving in. It was a growing sense among middle-class voters in heartland America that something was seriously wrong with the country, that the nation's leaders were transforming America in bad ways and unraveling their future in the process. But there was no street protest or fiery rhetoric, no coalescence of civic activism or public demands. Certainly the mainstream media, so aligned with the country's elites, didn't detect anything of consequence bubbling up from within the polity. Why would they? Everything seemed fine to them.\n\nMeanwhile, the disaffected merely bided their time, silently waiting for their opportunity to express themselves in the quiet sanctity of the voting booth. After they did, Donald Trump was the next president. Hardly anyone saw it coming.\n\nSomething similar is likely to happen in the wake of the widespread street demonstrations-with attendant riots, looting, destruction, and violence-that followed the awful death of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of a brutal police officer who pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. That a black man could have his life snuffed out by a white cop in such a manner is just cause for a national outpouring of grief and soul-searching. Not surprisingly, public-opinion surveys showed widespread popular support for the peaceful demonstrations that were organized to honor the life and condemn the senseless death of George Floyd.\n\nBut the polls also demonstrated widespread indignation toward the rioting and looting. Thus, the civic drama that followed Floyd's death, including the sprees of destruction and increasingly aggressive rhetoric from the left, intensified some ongoing political tensions that lie at the heart of the country's current distemper. It accentuated the extent to which America is becoming two nations with two narratives about the times we live in and the problems we face.\n\nOne narrative, call it the liberal one, has been projected with increasing force in recent years and particularly since George Floyd's death. It is that America is an inherently racist country, infected with something called \"systemic racism.\" You can't always see it; often it is hidden behind a facade of phony white benignity. But it lurks in the hearts of whites nonetheless and is activated in subtle ways to keep down minorities, particularly blacks, and make them feel inferior.\n\nThis systemic civic virus, according to the narrative, is particularly problematic in police departments throughout the land, in which rampant racism poses serious dangers to blacks, particularly young black males. Much of the rhetoric that emanates from this narrative would have us believe that innocent blacks are killed in accumulating numbers across the country in a surge of uncontrolled law enforcement bigotry and brutality.\n\nThere's a corollary to this narrative of systemic racism and ongoing violence against black Americans. It is that whites, based on the sins of their forebears and today's lingering bigotry, need to be put in their place. In this regard, a certain abasement and humiliation is prescribed. This part of the narrative has become increasingly brazen in recent years.\n\nThe other narrative, the conservative one, is largely defensive. In this view, there is no doubt that racism lingers in the body politic and must be addressed when it can be seen. Racial profiling by police also must be dealt with whenever and wherever it appears. But the country has made tremendous progress since the Civil Rights era of the 1960s in addressing overt racism, eliminating barriers to equal opportunity, and recognizing the racial sensibilities of minorities. The problem with the allegation of systemic racism is that it is too vague to be discerned clearly and hence can't really be  effectively addressed even if it exists, which many dispute.\n\nAs for police racism leading to the killing of blacks in telling numbers, the statistics simply don't bear that out. Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute notes that, based on a Washington Post database, police fatally shot nine unarmed blacks in 2019 (and 19 unarmed whites). Based on the numbers of black homicide victims generally (7,407 in 2018), Mac Donald calculates that the fatal shooting of unarmed blacks represents about 0.1 percent of all African-Americans killed in 2019. She bolsters her position by citing studies by the National Academy of Sciences, a Justice Department survey of Philadelphia police practices, and research by a Harvard economist. The Academy of Sciences study found \"no significant evidence of antiblack disparity in the likelihood of being fatally shot by police.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Floyd killing, the liberal narrative soon dominated the country's political discourse. It is seen everywhere-in most of the mainstream media, in stark expressions from agitated civic groups, in the ravings of the celebrity culture, in mass street demonstrations, and, yes, even in the rioting and looting that destroyed businesses, livelihoods, and neighborhoods.\n\nThe rhetoric of the liberal narrative these days is delivered vociferously, with defiance and a forcefulness that brooks no dissent or even passivity. Consider the experience of Drew Brees, the heralded quarterback for the New Orleans Saints, who responded to a question about whether the George Floyd fallout would include a revival of NFL players protesting racial injustice by taking a knee during the playing of the National Anthem before games. He would not participate in such a protest, said Brees, because \"I will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States of America or our country.\" He followed that with a plainly heartfelt and eloquent expression of  patriotism, harking back to the memory of his war-veteran grandfathers and the courage of Civil Rights activists who struggled to improve the nation.\n\nThe result: an explosion of opprobrium, vicious attacks, and mean-spirited vitriol. An telling example was a Washington Post piece by a black sports columnist for the paper named Jerry Brewer. First he praised Brees as \"among the most exceptional human beings in sports,\" a man who \"epitomizes the character, benevolence and grace that people seek in a sports role model.\" But just because he's a good guy and exemplary human being, snarled Brewer, that doesn't mean he should get away with distancing himself from the Colin Kaepernick brand of protest.\n\nBrees, wrote Brewer, showed himself to be a \"misguided, insensitive dolt....a sometimes ignorant, lazy thinker in desperate need of a broadened perspective.\"  It was journalistic thought control in action, and it worked. Brees abjectly apologized-twice-for his transgression against humanity.\n\nJerry Brewer was serving as enforcer for the proposition that the liberal narrative is sacrosanct, and you can't say or do anything that calls it into question in any way. You see the same motivation behind the recent fate of the University of Washington women's basketball coach, Jody Wynn. In response to George Floyd's death, she issued a sincere statement of concern that read in part that \"we must stand with our Black Amerians & seek justice! Black, brown, yellow...ALL lives matter.\"\n\nOops. You can't say that ! Systemic racism in action. We're talking about black lives here, and to confuse that with expressions of concern about other racial groups is absolutely unacceptable. Her Twitter account was deactivated, according to the Seattle Times , and Wynn quickly issued a replacement statement saying she was talking only about black lives. \"I would like to sincerely apologize,\" she wrote in a gesture of self-abasement, adding that she understood that her words were \"hurtful to people of color....I've learned a hard and important lesson in this moment and am committed to educating myself...on how we can best create change.\" She vowed to be part of change that is aimed at ending racism.\n\nBut it isn't enough for those of the liberal narrative to bully and humiliate genuine heroic figures like Drew Brees into recanting their expressions of genuine patriotism. They also refuse to condemn the riots and looting that unfolded on the nation's television screens, as local police officials hovered out of the way. Why? Because, it seems clear, they want to preserve the narrative that animates the left and gives it propulsion in the fiery discourse of American politics.\n\nThe underlying essence of the narrative is an increasingly brutal and incendiary polemical assault on a demographic segment of the nation-white people. They are guilty, it is said with increasing aggressiveness, for the sins of their forebears, for the racism of the past. And they must confess their guilt and seek absolution through self-abasement.\n\nThis was captured in stark reality in a video segment aired on Tucker Carlson's Fox News program the other day. A young white woman on the street during the New York protests is approached by a man who identifies himself as working for Black Lives Matter. \"Since I work for that company,\" says the man (who is white), \"my CEO has told me to come out today and bring you on your knees because you have white privilege. So if they see that a white person is getting on their knees, that shows solidarity for the situation.\"\n\nShe slowly, without saying anything, gets down on her knees on the sidewalk.\n\n\"And could you just please apologize,\" says the guy, \"for, you know, your white privilege?\"\n\nShe doesn't seem to know what to say.\n\n\"Just apologize?\" he persists, ever so politely.\n\n\"I am,\" she says. \"I'm trying to think of the words to thank you.\"\n\nNo doubt many within the nation's elites would view that scene as touching, perhaps even inspiring-a young white woman getting to her knees and apologizing for....what exactly? Certainly not anything she did, as far as we know. No, she was placed into humiliation because of her race, and she accepted it, apparently, as a normal consequence of her heritage.\n\nBut a lot of Americans aren't going to view it that way. They will see it as a racial assault and a huge power grab. The cry of \"systemic racism\" constitutes a threat to white people. We all know that racism is the country's most potent social taboo. Even innocent slips of the tongue or benign observations can bring severe opprobrium, societal and professional sanctions, ostracism. Thus does the allegation constitute a serious threat to millions of Americans. And it constitutes also great political leverage for those tossing around the allegation.\n\nBut, if America is infected with systemic racism, who are the systemic racists? Certainly not, in the view of those pushing the liberal narrative, themselves. Not the cable news liberals who toss out the allegation with abandon. Not the mandarins of Hollywood who spout out about it constantly. Not the think tank mavens with their phony studies and charts. Not the Democratic establishment persistently leveraging identity politics. Not the professional celebs whose household recognition qualify them, in their view, as authority figures. Not those in the top level of the meritocratic elite living their pristine lives in gated communities. And certainly not the nation's minorities, spoon-fed the liberal narrative day by day.\n\nWho's left? Middle-class and working-class whites, already beleaguered economically by the hollowing out of the nation's industrial base and struggling to survive in the new service and high-tech environment. And now they have to worry about becoming the next Exhibit A in the elites' persistent search for evidence of systemic racism. Deplorables again.\n\nThis is scary stuff to people who just want to live their lives without feeling vulnerable to being singled out as specimens of systemic racism and called to account for slipping into some hazardous lapse such as thinking that all lives matter or any other innocuous racial observation that never would have raised eyebrows among whites or blacks just a few years ago.\n\nWhen the political reaction comes, as it inevitably will, it will come on little cat feet. And the nation's elites, secure in the thought that the systemic racism charge has worked brilliantly in intimidating any lingering dissenters into submission, won't see it coming.\n\nIt's an open question whether this can help Donald Trump in November. His is a failed presidency, and the collective electorate seldom rewards failed presidencies with retention in office. But down the road, as the issue intensifies and as white Americans feel increasingly beleaguered by the left's identity politics and disdain for Middle America, as more demonstrations and riots ensue with more destructive force, a counter-movement will emerge. It likely will approach the body politic as quietly as Sandberg's fog. But, once it arrives, it won't stay quiet for long.\n\nRobert W.

      "text": "From an editorial in the new issue of the New England Journal of Medicine (no link available):\n\nBy looking through a racially impervious lens, clinicians neglect the life experiences and historical inequities that shape patients and disease processes. They may inadvertently feed the robust structural racism that influences access to care, quality of care, and resultant health disparities. At times, we fail to make even the simplest efforts: for instance, even though Covid-19 disproportionately affects black Americans, when physicians describing its manifestations have presented images of dermatologic effects, black skin has not been included. The \"Covid toes\" have all been pink and white.\n\nRacist photos of Covid toes? Who knew? More:\n\nIn the review of systems, we query patients about exposure to toxicants, but we never ask about one of the most dangerous toxicants: racism. The work of David Williams details the morbidity and risk of death related to perceived discrimination. Discrimination and racism as social determinants of health act through biologic transduction pathways to promote subclinical cerebrovascular disease, accelerate aging, and impede vascular and renal function, producing disproportionate burdens of disease on black Americans and other minority populations.\n\nMore:\n\nAs the vulnerability and inadequacy of our health care system are once again exposed, it is also time to reconceive that system, including the development of its workforce. Our actions must be driven by the data highlighting inequity in medical school admission and graduation rates, the dearth of black medical faculty, and the low grant-funding success rates for black biomedical researchers. We must also acknowledge past injustices and the persistent pain experienced by minority trainees and faculty, by listening and openly discussing racism and its health effects on rounds and at conferences and by broadening medical school curricula to include cultural sensitivity, cultural humility, and upstander training to equip students with advocacy tools to assist their patients and colleagues. Direct action to eliminate persistent health disparities obliges us to redouble our demands for a system that recognizes health care as a human right, providing an avenue to health equity for all.\n\nAlthough effecting such fundamental transformation may feel impossible, the energy, idealism, and visions of young people have long fueled movements for change. Martin Luther King, Jr., was 26 when he led the Montgomery bus boycott and 34 when he delivered his powerful \"I have a dream\" oration. If we blend our voices with those of the newest members of our profession to advocate for the most vulnerable and to reinvigorate every aspect of their care, perhaps we can use our current public health crisis as a catalyst to, as Reverend Al Sharpton put it, \"turn this moment into a movement.\"\n\nIt quotes Rev. Al, so you know it must be Science.\n\nSeriously, though, this makes me skeptical. Nobody can doubt that the stress that people who live in a society in which they have been historically discriminated against is bound to have physiological effects. Note, though, that David Williams talks about \"perceived discrimination.\" That is, the subjective impression of discrimination that a black patient has. Notice how the authors of the editorial (all physicians) elide from the perception of discrimination to describing the medical system as deformed by \"robust structural racism.\" That's a terrible indictment. Is it true?\n\nHere's a detailed piece from NBC News about why there are so few black men in medicine. Turns out that there are fewer black men training to be doctors today than in 1978. Why are there so few? Excerpt:\n\nDr. Louis Sullivan, president emeritus and founding dean of the Morehouse School of Medicine and the secretary of health under President George H.W. Bush, believes that history plays a big role in the current shortage of male African-American physicians.\n\n\"Blacks, and especially black males, have always been underrepresented in medicine,\" Sullivan told NBC News. \"This stems from slavery and legally enforced segregation.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"cost is as much an issue as anything. Given that many black men come from low-income families,\" the cost of attending medical school \"is too high a burden to put on their families.\"\n\nMakes sense, but how many males from low-income white families go to medical school, or even think that it's possible for them to become a doctor? Does the New England Journal of Medicine consider this to be a problem within the medical profession that stems from prejudice, such that the profession should engage in programs to repair the disparity? I'm not asking rhetorically; I really would like to know. Or are black kids the only  impoverished youth who merit the concern of medical reformers?\n\nThere's no doubt that slavery and segregation put black men historically behind in the professions, but in what sense can you blame \"robust structural racism\" in medicine today for this? Again, I'm asking straightforwardly. This is such a broad claim. It seems to me likely that ideologues within the medical profession are using the George Floyd moment to medicalize issues that are social and political, and to justify it as merely a medical intervention.\n\nI am sensitized to this because of a long conversation I had with a physician in reporting Live Not By Lies . Here's what I write in the book about it:\n\nA Soviet-born US physician told me-after I agreed not to use his name-that he never posts anything remotely controversial on social media, because he knows that the human resources department at his hospital monitors employee accounts for evidence of disloyalty to the progressive \"diversity and inclusion\" creed.\n\nThat same doctor disclosed that social justice ideology is forcing physicians like him to ignore their medical training and judgment when it comes to transgender health. He said it is not permissible within his institution to advise gender dysphoric patients against treatments they desire, even when a physician believes it is not in that particular patient's health interest.\n\nWhat I didn't include in the final manuscript is this quote from our interview:\n\nOne of the most important questions in medicine now is what is the definition of normal. What is the definition of health - as opposed to wellness , which is about your subjective feeling of how you're doing. Bad things die. No matter how much wellness you can report, if you are incapable of functioning, you're going to die.\n\nHe elaborated on that point, explaining to me that the activist left within the medical profession are wrongly imposing radical subjectivity into medicine, for the sake of achieving political goals. This is bound to affect the quality of care, he said. As a physician, you cannot be heard to oppose any of this, or you risk being denounced as a bigot. The doctor only spoke with me after multiple assurances that I would not identify him, or give any hint of where he works. His Soviet background prepared him well for the kind of mind games one has to play to stay employed within a highly politicized profession.\n\nLet me be clear: I don't doubt that the experience of discrimination, perceived and actual, can have and does have a deleterious physiological impact on black people in this society. And I don't doubt either that black people can exhibit particular physiological phenomena due to their genetic make-up, just like any other people. We should not be surprised by this, given what we know about human evolution.\n\nThat said, this editorial seems to be an example of activists using a crisis to advance a political agenda within the profession, in the same sense that Harvard Medical School last year removed portraits of distinguished faculty and alumni from its history , on the grounds that there were too many white men among them. One neurobiologist told NPR last year:\n\nAs she travels around the country to give lectures and attend conferences at scientific institutions, she constantly encounters lobbies, conference rooms, passageways, and lecture halls that are decorated with portraits of white men.\n\n\"It just sends the message, every day when you walk by it, that science consists of old white men,\" says Vosshall. \"I think every institution needs to go out into the hallway and ask, 'What kind of message are we sending with these oil portraits and dusty old photographs?'\"\n\nSexism! Racism! Those photographs are a threat to the health of non-whites and women!\n\nMore from that story:\n\nAt Yale School of Medicine, for example, one main building's hallways feature 55 portraits: three women and 52 men. They're all white.\n\n\"I don't necessarily always have a reaction. But then there are times when you're having a really bad day - someone says something racist to you, or you're struggling with feeling like you belong in the space - and then you see all those photos and it kind of reinforces whatever you might have been feeling at the time,\" says Max Jordan Nguemeni Tiako , a medical student at Yale.\n\nHe grew up reading Harry Potter books, and in that fictional world, portraits can talk to the characters. \"If this was Harry Potter,\" he muses, \"if they could speak, what would they even say to me? Everywhere you study, there's a big portrait somewhere of someone kind of staring you down.\"\n\nI'm sorry, but what ? You feel oppressed by pictures that might talk to you and say something that hurts your feelings? So the portraits have to go so you can feel calmer? This is bizarre. But you see where I'm going with this, right? How can we tell the difference between unjust discrimination that can and should be fought, and left-wing activists within the profession medicalize their political views as a strategy of asserting and exercising power.\n\nIf you're in the medical field, let me know what you think in the comments.\n\nUPDATE: From a physician with whom I've corresponded in the past:\n\nThe NEJM opinion piece you refer to in \"Medicalizing Racism\" is absurd.  There is no \"robust structural racism\" in medicine-at least not directed at people of color.  As you know, I am a physician and have been heavily involved in medical education within both a major medical school and as the director of a residency training program.  We've previously corresponded on the zealous efforts, eager compromises, and generous accommodations that medical schools and training programs are making in order to pursue the dubious goal of statistical racial parity, even if it requires that more qualified applicants are passed over because of their race or sex in order to assist those historically underrepresented relative to their constituency within the population.  After benefitting from targeted recruitment programs, minimally qualified candidates from preferred groups (URiM-Underrepresented Minorities in Medicine) are explicitly privileged relative to applicants from non-preferred groups in interview invitations and admissions.  Even after admission, additional resources such as assigned tutors provided by the institution, broad assistance through the Offices of Diversity and Inclusion, and a kid-gloves approach from evaluators (professors, supervising physicians, and upper-level residents) provide them with every opportunity for success.  But such success, even on their own terms, has proven elusive.\n\nNotwithstanding, the proudly woke medical educational establishment has been unsuccessful in achieving their goals regarding proportionate representation of Underrepresented Minorities in Medicine (URim), defined by the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) as \"those racial and ethnic populations that are underrepresented in the medical profession relative to their numbers in the general population.\"  (Interestingly, foreign applicants of color, such as African immigrants, are not included within this veil.)  This recalcitrant disproportion is certainly multifactorial.  One problem is that there are insufficient promising applicants, particularly of Black men, at the medical school or residency training level.  Those that are truly qualified are fiercely fought over by medical schools and training programs and are essentially able to write their own ticket-but this can't actually change the overall statistics within medicine.  Increasingly, the more prestigious medical programs improve their racial statistics at the expense of less eminent institutions in a situation akin to the brain drain problem.  If you're Harvard or Johns Hopkins you can have a graduating class that \"looks like America\" in which everyone has an IQ over 130, but only at the expense of all the state schools.  It's a pipeline issue-there simply won't be enough Black men going into medicine until there are more Black boys beginning to work towards this long-term goal through success in high school and college.  Fixing that supply problem is beyond my abilities and frankly, it's presumptuous of me to tell anyone else how to raise their children or to what they should be encouraged to aspire.\n\nMeanwhile, qualified White and Asian applicants know they're being passed over because of their ancestry.  Increasingly, applicants from non-preferred groups (Whites and Asians) who previously would have been shoo-ins are attending the less prestigious osteopathic medical schools.  Apart from a D.O. after one's name rather than an M.D., there is no substantial difference in training or in one's ability to obtain a medical license, specialty training in residency, or a successful practice.  I suspect that the for-profit medical schools in the Caribbean will become increasingly meritocratic in that they are willing to admit anyone-even White men of privilege-who can pay the tuition and pass the exams.\n\nDifferential medical outcomes with COVID-19 and other diseases are to be expected given the genetic diversity between recognizable ethnic populations compounded by environmental and cultural factors.  Certainly, racism does not account for the disproportionate suffering of Blacks from genetic hemoglobin abnormalities (sickle cell anemia and thalassemia), Whites from auto-immune neurodegeneration (multiple sclerosis and ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease)), Asians from nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and Ashkenazi Jews from a multitude of inherited errors of metabolism (Tay-Sachs, Gaucher, Niemann-Pick).\n\nYour suggestion that \"people who live in a society in which they have been historically discriminated against is bound to have physiological effects\" is true, but does little to explain the current statistical inequities among groups in the U.S. population.  Did you know that Black women have a greater life expectancy than do White men (78.1 vs. 76.5 years in 2014? https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db244.htm ) And what's to be made of the profound disproportion in White male suicides?  The conventional medical wisdom well into the twentieth century was that Blacks were far less vulnerable to cardiovascular disease (heart attacks and strokes) than were Whites.  That was true-but only because Whites began suffering the medical consequences of prosperity (obesity, sedentary lifestyles, hypertension, atherosclerotic plaques) sooner while the Black population remained largely agrarian and engaged in manual labor prior to World War II.  As it turns out, Blacks are even more vulnerable to these lifestyle diseases (affluenza) than are Whites when matched for income, obesity, diet, and physical activity, but even more profound disproportions have been seen in other populations such as American Indians and Australian Aborigines (both of whom were treated deplorably) but whose medical problems also date to the material prosperity of the late 20 th century that their ancestors never could have imagined.  Can you think of an instance in which material prosperity has not been a Faustian exchange of one's spiritual and cultural patrimony?  I can't.\n\nThe funny thing about historical racial injustice in the United States is that we're to believe that its effects increase in severity and prevalence with the passage of time and through subsequent generations.  It's as if one were to toss a rock in a pond and the waves were to grow in height as they radiated outward.  The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in 1865 (Now why didn't the U.S. pass that amendment four years earlier in 1861 after all the Confederate States removed any opposition in Congress?  Hmm.) and the Civil Rights Act was promulgated in 1964.  Yet racial rancor is the worst it's been in decades.  As you pointed out, there are currently fewer Black men in medical training than in 1978.  Clearly, the reflexive explanations (structural racism, lack of opportunity, no role models, etc.) are insufficient to account for the multitude of choices, individual and collective, that bring us to this pass.\n\nLet me confess my privilege.  Since residency, my practice has focused on diseases that disproportionately affect women, minorities, and the poor.  I'm at work at 6:00 AM every day and my practice assists minorities at a rate far in excess to their proportion of the population.  I've been working through the pandemic at 50% of my salary so as to protect the staff from lay-offs.  I have no confidence that my children would be able to earn a fair shake in medical school admissions, but I doubt that I would support their entering the medical field in any event.  I love medicine and my job, but the outcomes-based approach to proportionate representation in American medicine will destroy the quality of medical education and practice just a few years before it undermines the public's confidence in its integrity and efficacy.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "Reniqua Allen, in the Washington Post:\n\nA few weeks ago, I was standing outside a posh bar on the Lower East Side of Manhattan with my friends of almost two decades. I made an offhanded comment about the ratio of blonde-haired-blue-eyed chicks to brown girls like me. It seemed like a zillion to one.\n\nMy pals, who are white, didn't get why I was bringing this up. \"No one cares about race except you,\" one said.\n\nI tried to explain my frustration with having to always choose between an all-black experience or being the \"only one,\" whether at work, in grad school or even out for a night in New York. I waited for a nod of sympathy; instead, my best friend threw her hands up and said: \"How can we all be racist? Look at who is president!\"\n\nI didn't have a response.\n\nRight now the nation has embarked on a massive conversation about race surrounding the tragic death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida. On Friday, President Obama weighed in. \"I think all of us have to do some soul searching to figure out: How does something like this happen?\" he said.\n\nIt's an important conversation to have - but I fear it won't lead anywhere. After all, we've seen plenty of these debates in recent years, invariably prompted by some tragedy or controversy. Think Troy Davis . Or Shirley Sherrod. Or Jeremiah Wright. Or Henry Louis Gates Jr. Or even Rodney King. We have big debates over racial prejudice and disparities in this country, and then nothing happens.\n\nI thought things would be different by now. The Trayvon Martin story flared up exactly four years after Obama's famous campaign speech on race in Philadelphia , a speech that made so many of us believe that Obama would launch a serious, enduring dialogue. But the election of the first black president hasn't made it easier to talk about race in America. It's made it harder.\n\nRead the whole thing.\n\nWhy harder? Because, according to the writer, whites believe that having a black president means that America has been to the mountaintop, and we don't have to worry so much about race.\n\nThat may be it for some white people. I think that the reason few white people want to have this \"important conversation\" about race is because they know, or at least they fear, this conversation can only go one way: minorities telling white people how racist they are, and white people nodding in agreement. My guess is that very few white people would be willing to say what they really thought in such an Important Conversation, because they are afraid of being labeled a racist, and - if the Important Conversation - happened in a workplace setting, being tarred with the scarlet letter of R for Racist, and suffering professionally for it.\n\nIn my experience, it's not that white people don't think about race. It's that they don't think out loud around people who don't already agree with them, or who at least won't put them in the uncomfortable position of being denounced as a racist over something they've said. And so maybe they really do have racist beliefs that could be overcome through such an Important Conversation, but these conversations never happen because there is far too much riding on it to take that risk. Besides, they are not fools to believe that this would almost certainly be not a conversation, but a monologue, in which they are invited to consider all the ways they are racist, but their black interlocutors are not expected to show the same degree of introspection about the complexities of race in America.\n\nI don't know what the solution is. What would such an Important Conversation about Trayvon Martin's murder look like? (And by the way, let me repeat again that I can't believe George Zimmerman wasn't arrested for what he did, because based on what we know, it looks to me like he's guilty of murder in some degree.) Such an Important Conversation would have to include a discussion about the fear and suspicion whites and others have of young black males, a suspicion that leads them to expect the worst - and, in this case, to misjudge Trayvon Martin in a way that led to his killing. We would have to talk about the reality of what it's like to raise a black son in America today, knowing that he will likely be feared in this way, and open himself up to extra scrutiny and suspicion, just because he is black and male.\n\nBut if this were a true conversation, we would also have to talk about why so many non-black people are so scared of young black males. According to FBI statistics, in 2010 , 28 percent of those arrested were black - almost three times the black population. Of all those arrested (white, black, etc.),  t hree out of four were male . Of all those arrested, 42 percent were 25 or under. (The FBI does not keep statistics on convictions, only arrests). While I don't have the time to crunch the numbers to see which exact portion of those arrested are young black males, the general perception that young black males are disproportionately involved in crime is an accurate one. (That, for example, 9 out of 10 murders of black people are committed by other black people doesn't negate this.) Moreover, young black men are  identified with a hip-hop culture that valorizes thuggery and antisocial behavior. These facts, and the conclusions non-blacks draw from them - fair or not - ought to be part of an honest Important Conversation.\n\nBut they won't be. That's just the way it is. In the early 1990s, I lived in Washington, DC, which was undergoing an epidemic of murders and violent crime. A friend of mine, Kevin, a white guy who lived in my neighborhood, and his girlfriend were held down at gunpoint in his driveway and robbed by young black men. They moved out of the city the next week. No matter what your race, if you were going to be the victim of violent crime in DC, your assailant was all but guaranteed to be a young black man. If you didn't realize that, and take common-sense, street-smart precautions at night, you were a fool who might lose his life. Did this require you to be suspicious of young black men dressed like thugs? You bet. Did that put you in the position of making a race-based judgment? Absolutely. Was this unfair to young black men who dressed a certain way, and who meant nobody harm? Sure it was. But there was way too much at stake simply walking home from the metro at night to think otherwise. Kevin and his girlfriend were not shot to death in a robbery that night, but they easily could have been. Nobody would have written stories about dead Kevin, just another victim of predatory black males in Washington, DC, no doubt because Kevin was probably not targeted because of his race, any more than black victims of predatory black males were targeted for their race. But for people who knew Kevin and what happened to him, it was impossible not to conclude that a good way to improve your chances of that happening to you was, when you saw young black men dressed like thugs coming down the street, to get the hell away from them. Better to be prejudiced than dead.\n\nNone of this, to my mind, justifies the way George Zimmerman reacted to Trayvon Martin. The problem is, if we're going to have a broader Important Conversation about this stuff, it's going to have to involve a discussion of social and cultural contexts in which people make these judgments about young black men, and race, more generally. Trayvon Martin was almost certainly a victim of irrational prejudice - and he paid for it with his life. If what appears to be the case turns out to be so, then I hope and expect Zimmerman to go to jail, and I would hope and expect the local police department, if they did a sloppy, racially prejudiced investigation, to pay some price too.\n\nThat said, we don't see in our media discussions of victims of crimes committed disproportionately by young black males, nor do we hear much about the valorization of thuggery in hip-hop culture, and how these things affect perceptions of young black men in the non-black community. How can we know which prejudices are rational (that is, based on sound judgment of the facts) and which ones are irrational? Why does it matter, if it matters? These things are important to explore, but also pretty much impossible to.\n\nI think it's unfair to blame the president's election for making it more difficult to have an Important Conversation about race in America. That conversation is not going to happen no matter who's president. There's nothing in it for white people. Don't misunderstand me: I think a genuine conversation, in which both sides (all sides?) aired their grievances and their fears, in an atmosphere of mutual acceptance and even reconciliation, would be hugely important and beneficial. Black-Hispanic tension and prejudice is a big deal too, though one that doesn't often get discussed in the media. I doubt there's a single soul - white, black, brown or whatever - who doesn't have some prejudice that he or she could stand to confront and dispel. But like I said at the beginning, non-liberal white people accurately sense that the Important Conversation is almost always going to involve them being told how racist they are, and being expected to agree and promise to do better. You can have these Conversations if you want, but they won't be Important, because they're not going to be honest. Think about it: a culture in which many media outlets won't give the race of at-large violent crime suspects - this, even as they report sex, height, clothing description - because they don't want to encourage stereotyping, is not a culture that is prepared to speak forthrightly about race and crime.\n\nWe have big debates over racial prejudice and disparities in this country, and then nothing happens.\n\nSo says Reniqua Allen, and she's right. But she's naive to expect otherwise. She should ask herself who, exactly, is having this \"big debate,\" and what it is they're really debating.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "It is an altogether remarkable passage from an altogether remarkable book:\n\nIn committee hearing after committee hearing, Negroes have been singled out as statistically responsible for crime in Washington. It is a matter of record that Negroes do commit the greatest number of serious crimes, and they commit them far out of proportion to their percentage of the population. The figures of homicide, rape, robbery, assault, housebreaking, and larceny tell the same story: most of the crimes are committed by Negroes.\n\nIn our contemporary political and social climate, when political correctness has corrupted much of journalism and prevents many writers from offering such statistics, this blunt language must come across like belching during Mass. To mention disparate crime rates between races is to invite accusations of racism and to be both drummed out of polite society and dropped from the aerie of mainstream journalism. Yet most remarkable is how the above quotation illustrates the corruption of not only a generation of reporters but of a single reporter within his generation.\n\nThe quote comes from a book called Dusk at the Mountain: The Negro, the Nation, and the Capital -A Report on Problems and Progress. It was published in 1963 and was written by Haynes Johnson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and former Washington Post reporter. Johnson writes thick bestsellers with portentous titles like Sleeping Through History: America in the Reagan Years and, most recently, The Best of Times: America in the Clinton Years.\n\nJohnson's later books are dull dilations on American society: he goes around the country interviewing folks, then reports what he finds. His conclusions are always the same: America needs to make progress, always in a liberal direction. Yet in comparing these books to Dusk at the Mountain , it is obvious that something odd has happened to Johnson and perhaps the entire journalism industry. Either there are no more conservatives or traditionalists in the United States, or Johnson has simply stopped interviewing them.\n\nI found Dusk at the Mountain while researching an article on Shaw, a predominantly black neighborhood in Washington. Shaw is to the District what Harlem is to New York, a place with a long and proud African-American history. In the 1920s, it was the home to over 300 black-owned businesses as well as Howard University, one of the oldest and proudest black colleges.\n\nAll of this began to change in the early 1960s, when crime and illegitimacy began to rise in correlation with the breakdown of the black family. My article set out to prove that the 1968 riots in Washington following the murder of Martin Luther King had nothing to do with the assassination, but that black revolutionaries combined with broken homes and juvenile delinquency to cause the fires and looting.\n\nIn the beginning of his book, Johnson flatly declares himself \"a moderate liberal.\" I had to remind myself that in 1963, journalists were more honest, the dogma of \"objectivity\" had not taken hold, and being a liberal was not cause for embarrassment. But even more shocking, Johnson then, as opposed to Johnson now, was not afraid to make moral judgments and to print a quote even when it indicated serious pathology-or strong approval of traditional values or whites-on the part of blacks. Dusk at the Mountain was written when American liberalism was at its best, capable of taking on racism and economic inequality while challenging the excuses of the criminal underclass. How the world, and Johnson's journalism, has changed.\n\nDusk is a book of remarkable honesty and power. It offers a compelling snapshot of Shaw in the years between the urban renewal fiasco of the 1950s that displaced thousands of blacks, moving the poor and criminal underclass into middle- and upper-class enclaves like Shaw, and the riots that were to come. It also offers some quotes that I doubt would make it into any reporter's notebook today-Johnson's included. (In a wonderful review of Johnson's last book in the Washington Post, Weekly Standard editor Christopher Caldwell pointed out that these days Johnson just does not interview anyone with whom he does not agree.)\n\nIn a chapter entitled \"The World of Welfare,\" Johnson visits Bates Street in the heart of Shaw. There he meets \"a prominent Negro businessman\" who tells the reporter how a typical welfare case works. A black laborer loses his job. On the way home he gets drunk, then loses what little money he has left in a crap game. Unable to support his wife and kids, he decides, against his will, to leave home so he can collect $260 a month on welfare. He still lives at home, however, returning at night to see his family. He soon fathers another child with his wife, but the child is now illegitimate. The welfare agency expects fraud and investigates, really causing the father to leave this time. The mother then finds another man and has another illegitimate child. As the black businessman told Johnson, \"Their father didn't want to go away, but the white man made him.\"\n\nIt is unlikely that such a story would make it into the New York Times or Washington Post today. The reporter simply would not report it. Johnson does, and even goes further. He offers a passage that would make jaws drop if it came up on any contemporary editor's computer screen:\n\nFor the present, welfare continues to place an increasing economic burden on all taxpayers. But the economic load is only one of the problems. More important is what happens to the people affected. Too often, those who write about welfare seem to be governed by their hearts instead of their heads. In some of these accounts, one gets the impression that people on relief are all noble, long-suffering characters. This attitude seems to be held even by some who are professional social workers.\n\nIn my experience, many welfare recipients do not wish to get off the rolls. They have found they can live better on relief than off. To such people, subsidies are placing a premium on laziness. And relief is not helping the children who have no values, who have heard the word \"Jesus Christ\" only as a form of profanity.\n\nI am not advocating [a moral test for welfare recipients]. Nothing good can come of taking men off relief unless they are given opportunities for improvement... [but] welfare deadens incentive. Long before the latest furor about welfare chiselers, Negroes in Washington were critical of these in their race who clung to relief.\n\nThese days such reporting would bounce Johnson from the Post-long before he wrote, \"Many people [on welfare] have become accustomed to an animal existence where sexual appetites are gratified with little thought of what will happen to children born out of such circumstances.\" Johnson and his brethren have since exchanged certain truths about human nature-i.e., that handouts can sometimes make people dependent-for the warmer and more abstract perceptions of the modern Left that we should all \"just get along,\" as he notes in the chapter on race in his book on the 1990s, Divided We Fall. Indeed, those liberal bromides are more important than facts to most reporters today. In the passage just quoted, Johnson notes that in 1963 welfare had tripled as the population of Washington had dropped. Who would report the same basic, telling fact today?\n\nHe also offers an observation that would now be banished to the nether reaches of the conservative press. He introduces a man who took a lower salary so he could remain on welfare:\n\nHe had been defeated long ago; now he only wanted to sit back, watch the television, and let the rest of the world go on its way. His children will probably grow up without placing much value on initiative.... There are children living on [Bates] street today who are learning not only to lie, but to hate. Spawned by a moment of passion, born unwanted into poverty, and branded by society as bastards, they never will escape the stigma implied in the word \"illegitimate.\" They are being raised in an environment where there is little respect for marriage and the family.\n\nJohnson or, rather, a man he interviews, offers another trenchant take on juvenile crime of the ghetto. What is so fascinating is that the theory is offered by a black policeman, yet when, thirty years later, the identical idea appeared in the New Republic, it ignited a firestorm. The man Johnson interviews is described as an older black policeman, and his theory is that juvenile crime was up in Washington not because of poverty, but affluence. He tells Johnson:\n\nYou must remember that the youth today we have trouble with-say from sixteen to twenty years old-are products of World War II. During the war there was plenty of work here and many people had a lot of children. The parents were able to show them some of the luxuries. They had radio and TV and good clothes. They were sent to school. They never faced the problem that we had, as kids of eleven and twelve, of being forced to try and earn a living. So you have groups of young children improperly advised by their parents. Sometimes the blame's on the parents, other times it isn't.\n\nThen, as the economy slackened, the kids still had the desire. They wanted the best. They never were taught that the best isn't for everyone. We were taught as children that certain things were only for the rich. You wouldn't desire more than your income allows you. The kids today desire the best. But their activities at school and their hours before the TV slow them down. Soon they're getting poor marks; and then they're ready to drop out of school ... . Still they want to go to parties and have a big time. At home their parents find their bills are piling up and they can't make it. The next thing you know the kids are snatching pocket books and rifling a cash register. Then two or three of them talk it over and decide to go together and steal. And you'd be surprised what they do with the money. They want to dress nicely.\n\nSimple greed as a motivation for robbery is not often cited. This must be obvious to journalist Joe Klein as, in 1996, Klein penned a scathing review of a book by the black scholar William Julius Wilson. Wilson had, per usual, blamed inner-city crime on poverty, drawing a correlation between the rising crime of the 1960s and fleeing industrial jobs. Klein simply pointed out that perhaps other factors were at work. He noted that Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's report on the devastation caused by the breakup of the black family came out in 1965, when most urban jobs \"had not yet fled.\" Klein then added another thought, directly echoing the black policeman in Dusk at the Mountain: \"Isn't it possible that this new poverty-the chronic anarchy and dependency that began to manifest itself in the 1960s-is primarily a disease of affluence?\" To the inner city poor, Klein wrote, the \"voluptuous festival of American excess [that] materialized in the living rooms of slums each night\" caused jobs that once provided stability-jobs as janitors and bus drivers-to be 'suddenly derided as 'dead end' [by those] who found it profitable to cultivate the alienation of others.\" Klein was roundly savaged for offering such an observation-despite the fact that a careful examination of the 1968 riot reveals that he was right.\n\nSuch things are simply not said anymore, no matter how much truth they contain-and for those of us who have honestly researched the 1968 riots that devastated Shaw, they do indeed contain the truth. Every careful blow-by-blow reveals not a group of adults blind with rage over the death of their leader, Dr. King, but packs of roving kids looking to steal and being encouraged by left-wing black radicals. (One black militant told a reporter that they had been planning something since the February before King was killed and that they often instigated rioting in parts of the city where there had been none.) Such reporting did not appear during the Los Angeles riots of 1992, even in editorials.\n\nA few years ago, I wrote a Washington Post op-ed arguing that Americans should marshal resources to save the Howard Theatre, an historically black theatre in Shaw that has been shuttered for years. In the piece I noted that the Howard collapsed around the time of \"the cultural and moral collapse of the 1960s.\" After the final edit was done I was casually informed that the line had been changed-from \"cultural and moral collapse\" to \"the social upheavals of the 1960s.\" More sad than its bald corruption is the ironic possibility that this revisionism hurts the black people liberal journalists are trying to help-or maybe the journalists are simply interested in helping themselves.\n\nThe black scholar John McWhorter has rebuked the liberal penchant for obsessing on the horrific aspects of black American history. In an article in City Journal, McWhorter notes that many black thinkers today downplay the remarkable progress that has been made since the 1960s, instead \"depicting modern black America as a variation on slavery and dismissing the progress we've made since the 1960s by condemning successful blacks as 'house niggers.' The result: for most of us, black history summons images of endless degradation-slavery, the quick promise of Reconstruction, Plessy vs. Ferguson, the Klan, Lynchings, the beatings of civil rights activists, Dred Scott, Emmett Till.... Not to attend to such things would be folly; but a history only of horrors cannot inspire.\"\n\nThe problem is, in order to inspire, one has to report that there was once a time when, in black communities like Shaw, crime and illegitimacy were low and achievement and pride were high. Yet revealing this truth leads to uncomfortable questions about how this was possible in the high noon of Jim Crow America. This leads to more uncomfortable questions about the liberal premise that poverty, oppression, and crime are coefficients. And most journalists today are just not prepared to ask such questions, which would dramatically challenge their orthodoxies formed in the crucibles of the civil rights movement and Vietnam. Baby boomer journalists tend to see every story through the same self-inflating lens of their 1960s glory days.\n\nIn 1994, almost thirty years after the publication of Dusk at the Mountain , Johnson published Divided We Fall: Gambling with History in the Nineties. The premise of the book was that America is becoming a fragmented country, especially when it comes to race. Yet there is none of the moral toughness of the book Johnson had written as a younger man. There is not even an honest account of crime statistics, which point to a disproportionate rate of crime among black males. \"Crime-black on black\" in the index leads to a conversation with Hank Sanders, a black man running for Congress. \"I was strongly opposed to Clarence Thomas,\" Sanders tells Johnson. \"I feel that it is imperative for those of us who get a break, who get a lift, who get affirmative action either from an institution or from our grandparents or our community, to reach back and to pull up folks.... I went on radio and television in strong opposition to Thomas because I was convinced that he wasn't trying to pull a nobody else in, that he was prepared to close the same door that he had walked through.\" No statistics, no combing the streets for observations from the people, no interview with Clarence Thomas or anyone who may support him. There is, however, this observation by Johnson:\n\nBlacks like Sanders believe they are still treated unfairly by the American judicial system. Not just in the courts, but by the police, the prosecutors, the all-white juries.... They feel that African-Americans bear a special burden. They suffer most at the hands of criminals-from drug dealers to murderers-yet they are lumped in with the criminal class, are branded as dangerous by the white majority merely because of their color. When they do find themselves involved in the justice system, they believe they receive punishment disproportionate to their crimes when compared with whites. In fact, they are right in all these assumptions; being treated fairly has not been the lot of blacks in America, and every thoughtful person knows it.\n\nHere we have a grim example of the sad degeneracy of Johnson's career and of American journalism. Johnson delivers this aria of injustice without citing a single report or quoting a single person who could back it up-never mind anyone who cared to refute it. America and her courts are racists, and Clarence Thomas is a traitor, and that's all there is to it. It's reminiscent of the way my Jesuit-educated Catholic buddies and I used to ridicule fundamentalists-the Bible says it, they believe it, and that settles it.\n\nGone is the Johnson of Dusk at the Mountain , the man who rued the tragedy of illegitimacy and called black Muslims \"racists\" and \"the black counterpart of the Ku Klux Klan.\" Gone is the man who would cite Congressional hearings, government reports, statistics, and voices from the neighborhood supporting the facts about black males and crime. In Divided We Fall , Al Sharpton is a \"provocateur\"; in Dusk at the Mountain he would have been dismissed as a demagogue. In Dusk , Johnson meets a black man who is not impressed with the nascent black Muslim movement. \"I've got a white man's name and a white man's culture,\" the man tells Johnson. \"You might even say the white man's attitude. And I'm perfectly satisfied.\" Would such a man have made it into Divided We Fall?\n\nAt this point Johnson is probably not honest enough with himself to answer that. It falls to other journalists to recapture the history that is being denied and obscured, and to tell the truth today. As Roger Kimball noted, \"Given the spiritual malaise brought on by the long march of America's cultural revolution, we may conclude that the way forward lies not in any sort of new revolution but, on the contrary, in the patient recovery of lost virtues.\" For journalists, primary among these virtues was the ability to tell the truth even when that truth dismantled sacred orthodoxies. Those orthodoxies, formed during Vietnam and Watergate and now shored up with identity politcs, moral relativism, and therapeutic cultural hegemony of the last thirty years have resulted in a profession that is dishonest and corrupt. It has managed, like Haynes Johnson, to grow older yet less wise.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nMark Gauvreau Judge is the author of If It Ain't Got That Swing and Damn Senators: My Grandfather and Washington's Championship Season, which will be published next year.\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "To understand the critical acclaim of Ta-Nehisi Coates's extended essay on race in America and my review of it, recall the combative exchange that took place in 1963 between the black writer Ralph Ellison and Irving Howe, editor of the magazine Dissent . Ellison takes Howe, and white liberals in general, to task for believing that black Americans' racial predicament is so forlorn that the only path for the authentically black intellectual is to protest and agitate constantly. Commenting on the effects of such myopic beliefs, Ellison suggests that there is not much difference between a white liberal and a segregationist:\n\nIrving Howe would designate the role which Negro writers are to play more rigidly than any Southern politician-and for the best of reasons. We must express 'black' anger and 'clenched militancy'; most of all we should not become too interested in the problems of the art of literature, even though it is through these that we seek our individual identities. And between writing well and being ideologically militant, we must choose militancy.\n\nCoates's argument is an updated version of Irving Howe's, so much so that it seems to argue for segregation. As for the choice between writing well and ideological militancy, Coates and his liberal supporters prefer militancy.\n\nBetween the World and Me falls within the exhortative tradition of black American letter-writing, and Coates consciously modeled his essay on James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time . Whereas Baldwin's letter is addressed to his nephew, Coates's letter is addressed to his 15-year-old son. The assumption behind Coates's message is the debilitating belief that the racial circumstances he was born into nearly four decades ago are mostly the same today and have been inherited by his son. His introductory remarks capture the sentiment:\n\nThe destroyers [white people] are merely men enforcing the whims of our country, correctly interpreting its heritage and legacy. It is hard to face this. But all our phrasing-race relations, racial chasm, racial justice, racial profiling, white privilege, even white supremacy-serves to obscure that racism is a visceral experience, that it dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth. You must never look away from this. You must always remember that the sociology, the history, the economics, the graphs, the charts, the regressions all land, with great violence, upon the body.\n\nHere we see Coates' tendency to exaggerate for literary effect, which characterizes his entire essay.\n\nThe son of a Black Panther father and schoolteacher mother, Coates explains that when he was 15, he and all the other black people he knew in Baltimore \"were powerfully, adamantly, dangerously afraid.\" The fear manifested itself in the surly bravado that is often associated with ghetto culture-\"rings and medallions,\" playing the dozens, \"puffy coats,\" oversized T-shirts, rap music, and ritualized but violent street fighting. In the beatings he got from his father and the beatings his grandmother got from her father and the beatings administered by black mothers to save their girls from drugs and drug dealers-\"guns, fists, knives, crack, rape, and disease\"-fear was the culprit. Even in Philadelphia, where Coates's extended family lived, fear was pervasive among his relatives. He accounts for the fear by explaining to his son that it stems from a \"nakedness,\" a vulnerability before the elements of the world: \"The nakedness is not an error, nor pathology. The nakedness is the correct and intended result of policy, the predictable upshot of people forced for centuries to live under fear. The law did not protect us. And now, in your time, the law has become an excuse for stopping and frisking you, which is to say, for furthering the assault on your body.\"\n\nCoates's emphasis on the black body and its vulnerability to the vestiges of white supremacy is disproportionate. There is no denying, as Orlando Patterson argues in Slavery and Social Death , that the bodily characteristics of slaves and their freed descendants, from ancient Athens to Jim Crow era America, were used as one of the justifications for their marginalization. Often their physical characteristics were associated with a threatening prowess-sexual, physical, or otherwise. Today, however, even beyond the success of the civil rights movement in demanding that blacks be treated equally before the law, the status of blacks and their cultural products has risen so much that even the most dysfunctional aspects of black culture have been embraced by various segments of the white community.\n\nCoates exerts much effort to depict blacks as passive, innocent, and helpless, while he portrays whites as naïve but diabolical perpetrators. He glibly sets up a racial straw man for the sake of excusing the very real fear and physical threat he experienced while trying to survive in his black Baltimore neighborhood. The demands of survival, according to Coates, took the form of learning another \"language consisting of a basic complement of head nods and handshakes.\" Something as mundane as smiling, and whom one smiled at, carried symbolic significance in Coates's neighborhood. A soft and unselfconscious demeanor was a sign of weakness in a black man, an invitation to physical altercations. Coates had to memorize certain blocks to be avoided, and developed a \"smell and feel of fighting weather.\" He refers to learning these survival skills as learning specific laws: \"I recall learning these laws clearer than I recall learning my colors and shapes, because these laws were essential to the security of my body.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the time spent learning the laws of survival was time not spent on, as Coates says, \"the beautiful things.\" His street knowledge came at the expense of book knowledge.\n\nCoates's honesty about the mental cost of trying to survive black ghetto culture is admirable, especially for someone as sensitive and intellectually inclined as he is. But in this part of the letter, his son would have benefited from an extended discussion of the emotional damage young black men do to themselves by adopting ghetto rules of behavior. Richard Majors, professor of psychology at University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire, called ghetto rules a \"cool pose,\" a type of speech and behavior that exaggerates masculinity. The studied indifference and aloof swagger of the pose stunts the emotional vocabulary of black males and makes it almost impossible for them to show vulnerability or a willingness to compromise in challenging situations.\n\nThe streets of Baltimore were not the only problem that conspired to limit Coates's development; his primary and secondary schooling also did so: \"If the streets shackled my right leg, the schools shackled my left leg. Fail to comprehend the streets and you give up your body now. But fail to comprehend the schools and you give up your body later. I suffered at the hands of both, but I resent the schools more.\"\n\nWhy he resents the schools more is not exactly clear. It has something to do with the false morality in the \"rote discipline\" of the black body. The routines of his school days, such as walking in a single file, standardized testing, memorizing theorems, copying directions, were one big subterfuge. The real intent of our schools, according to Coates, is to lull Americans into forgetting that the American Dream rests on black bodies that are bloodied and broken.\n\nCoates's consciousness was awakened by the writings and speeches of Malcolm X and the provocative lyrics of the hip-hop artists who often quoted the slain black militant. The inspiration that Malcolm X offered to him in the early '90s is palpable in his letter to his son. Malcolm X and others' sayings and phrases, such as, \"Don't give up your life, preserve your life,\" \"If you're black, you were born in jail,\" and \"black is beautiful,\" were music to Coates's ears. Spurred by the courage of Malcolm X and other black militants, he embarked on a journey of racial reclamation through his own study and exploration: \"That was what I heard in the call to 'keep it real.' Perhaps we should return to ourselves, to our own primordial streets, to our own ruggedness, to our own rude hair. Perhaps we should return to Mecca.\"\n\nCoates refers to Howard University in particular as Mecca; several members of his family attended the school. He was admitted to the historically black college-although he eventually dropped out without getting a degree-and there he was introduced to a wide range of black people and black experiences. But whereas the perspective of the more nuanced writer would have been enlarged by Howard University's cosmopolitan student body and faculty, Coates's preoccupation with the black body and its discontents was made all the more provincial by his interest in mediocre, racist and fringy black writers. As for the non-fringy black writers he was introduced to at Howard-Zora Neale Hurston, Frederick Douglass, Stanley Crouch-he seems to have learned very little from them. Basically, the Coates that we get during his Howard University days is the Coates that we hear from today.\n\nBetween the World and Me is a disappointing read. It attempts to speak truth to power but instead speaks defeatism and a warped view of America to a son. One can only hope that Ta-Nehisi Coates's son will outgrow his father's shackles.\n\nAndre Archie, professor of philosophy at Colorado State University, is the author of Politics in Socrates' Alcibiades .\n\nAndre Archie is an associate professor of ancient Greek philosophy at Colorado State University.

      "text": "Not long ago, in the Mall Killers thread , we had an intense discussion of race, crime, and culture. It started with a reflection on the fact that a rampaging flashmob of black teenagers terrorized customers at the Mall Of Louisiana, and required it to be locked down and evacuated. Some of the mob continued down the street and caused mayhem at another mall. One of the questions we discusses was whether or not the statistics on violent crime in Baton Rouge justify being afraid of and avoiding young black males.\n\nYesterday the Baton Rouge Advocate published a lengthy analysis of the 2012 murder stats in the city. Take a look at this PDF of one of the inside pages. Last year, 83 people died by homicide in Baton Rouge. Of that number, 87 percent were black, and 87 percent were male. Two-thirds had been in trouble with the law before, and one-third had been in trouble with the law for drugs. The median age of victims: 26.\n\nOf the perpetrators, the median age was 22. Get this: 96 percent of them were black, and 90 percent were male. Almost two-thirds had previous arrests. One out of four had a drug record.\n\nMost of the murders took place in the poorest parts of the city.\n\nWhat can we learn from these statistics? That murder in Baton Rouge is almost entirely about young black men from the poor part of town killing other young black men from the poor part of town. It's mostly a matter of thugs killing thugs.\n\nIf you are an ordinary Baton Rouge citizen with common sense, you want to get away from poor black people - especially if you are black , and have children you hope to save. That's what these statistics say. If I'm wrong, show me how I'm wrong. Hey, you could move out here to the country if you like. Half the people around here are black, the other half are white. There's no small amount of poverty, but we don't have much violent crime to speak of.\n\nAfter that thread, I received an e-mail from a friend in Baton Rouge. She is white, Republican, and active in community affairs. She wrote (below the jump):\n\nThe flash mob incidents upset me, not only as a parent, and as someone whose family goes to those malls all the time, but as a native-born Baton Rougean who hates what is happening to my city. I live near those malls. After a shooting five blocks from my house off Highland Rd. two years ago, I seriously considered buying a gun. I'm scared to drive around sometimes.\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about the racial aspect of this incident this past weekend. The mobs were black. I was on the road, actually, when the Mall of Louisiana mob moved down to Perkins Rowe. The kids I saw walking onto Perkins Rowe property were not thugs. One of them was a wannabe thug with pants down to his knees, but I guarantee you his parents aren't raising him to be a thug. Many of these kids are acting like this in school, but they don't really have that at home.\n\nI think one thing that contributes to this is mainstream media tells us that the only value in life for blacks is to be an athlete, a rap star or a gangsta. The mainstream media doesn't talk about the complete nerd, Dennis Blunt, who is an attorney at Phelps Dunbar downtown or Jared Llorens who has a PhD and teaches statistics at LSU in the School of Business or the Decuir family, Winston, Jr., Jason, or Brandon, all of whom are black lawyers of notable reputation in Baton Rouge. The mainstream media only talks about L'il Boosie, who was tried for murder last year. This is a culture which idealizes and idolizes gangsta talk and attitude, a culture who thinks they will never make it without some desperate measure, like crime or government assistance, and never bothers to try.\n\nAbout one-third of my friends are African-American. I couldn't \"go racial\" on this incident, even if I felt it in my heart, which I don't. The racial angle is really complicated. I see people here all the time - black people - who teach their kids racism. They spoon-feed it to them, and the kids are scared to death of white people, like they've never seen a white woman, or one who would speak to them. With so many of our white middle class kids in private and parochial schools here, most of our kids never encounter a kid in public school who only gets fed whatever meals he has at school each day, or whose mother comes to school in slippers and curlers to cuss out the teacher for punishing her kid for something they supposedly \"didn't do.\" The blacks we do see on my side of town are \"cultured\" black people who drink Chardonnay and wear Brooks Brothers suits and tailored shirts, and send their kids to tennis camp in the summer. Our kids never hear about the poor black kid here who died last year because his father through him up against the wall so many times it ruptured his bowel and then put him to bed in that condition. The child died in his sleep. (We all have our guardian angels looking out for us.)\n\nThis is really about class. Class is the real divider. To be honest, I have more in common with African-Americans than with Asians or people from other parts of the United States. The blacks I know are all Southerners, we all read the same Bible and our grandmothers all took us to church growing up and taught us the Golden Rule. We have a basic set of values that can be summed up in biscuits and grits, you do not \"do people wrong,\" also known as the Golden Rule, \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\" The blacks I know are like the whites I know. We all have some nuts in our (family) trees, and we all have some trash we prefer not to acknowledge. We hope it's not our kids or grandkids doing these stupid things. Thank you, Jesus!\n\nThe science of statistics does not lie. The crime is black on black for the most part and far more black perpetrators than white. There has come to be a culture associated with inner-city blacks in the South of violence, desperation and hopelessness. The only way out is through drugs, alcohol or prison, unless you are part of the lucky one percent who gets out on an athletic scholarship (witness the Honey Badger, who screwed up with drugs anyway), gangsta rap or some other miracle.\n\nOur city is divided into public and private school kids. The lucky in private school and the poor kids who cannot afford or aren't lucky enough to get one of the few voucher spots. Those who are not well off enough to attend private school or thick-skinned enough to be unaffected by the news reports, have already moved or are planning to move to Ascension or Livingston parishes. We are and have been for decades becoming New Orleans.\n\nThe two most important things we do in public sector work is public safety and education and we are struggling at both right now. Both influence each other in some pretty important ways which impact the third thing we do in public sector: economic development. And without economic development we are all doomed. Now education is almost the most important thing we do because educated people commit less crime and are less the object of the crime, especially violent crime. We know that there is a correlation between money spent on education and crime rates. Now at a time when budgets are tight and tax revenues are low, we are cutting education funding.\n\nShe went on to say that her kids attend public school, and she keeps telling herself that she and her husband need to hold on until their kids finish school, and then they can get serious about moving out.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "Half a century ago this summer, the Voting Rights Act was passed, propelled by Bloody Sunday at Selma Bridge. The previous summer, the Civil Rights Act became law on July 2. We are in the seventh year of the presidency of a black American who has named the first two black U.S. attorneys general. Yet race relations seem more poisonous now than then, when the good will of America's majority was driving legislation.\n\nToday's issue, however, is not voting rights, open housing, or school busing. It is black vs. blue: African-Americans inflamed at what they see as chronic police brutality and police forces feeling besieged in a demagogic \"war on cops.\" And the media are obsessed with it, and determined to make us equally so.\n\nConsider. On June 9, America's \"newspaper of record\" ran four stories in the first section about police violence against blacks.\n\nPage one of the New York Times told of black leaders in Cleveland, \"distrustful of the criminal justice system,\" invoking a \"seldom-used Ohio law,\" by going \"directly to a judge to request murder charges\" against the cops involved in the death of Tamir Rice.\n\nResponding to reports of a man with a gun, a cop, two seconds out of his car, shot Tamir, 12. The gun was a toy. Yet, though this happened six months ago, the Times went into loving detail again on how Tamir died. It then regurgitated the deaths, also last year, of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner on Staten Island.\n\nOn page A11 was a story with three color photos, covering almost the whole page, about a cop who, called to a raucous pool party in McKinney, Texas, drew his gun and wrestled to the ground a 14-year-old black girl in a bathing suit. \"A Party at a Pool, a Jarring Image of Police Force\" was the banner over the Times' tale of \"powerful and disturbing\" images, from video showing \"a police officer pointing a gun at teenagers in bathing suits and shoving a young black girl's face into the ground.\" Had the girl been white, would the Times have splashed it?\n\nPage A12 was given over entirely to cops vs. blacks, with two fresh stories, plus continuations of the Tamir Rice and pool stories. The story across the top of A12 told of how a North Charleston, South Carolina, cop, held since April on murder charges, has now been indicted by a grand jury for murder.\n\nOfficer Michael Slager shot fleeing suspect Walter Scott in the back repeatedly, a killing caught on video, apparently after a fight over Slager's Taser. There was also a fresh story on terrorism suspect Usaamah Rahim, shot dead after being confronted by FBI and a Boston cop. Rahim was allegedly wielding a large knife. Blurry video from a Burger King camera shows the cops backing away from Rahim, but not the knife.\n\nSeven Times reporters got bylines for these four stories. What does the Times ' investment of all this journalistic talent and news space tell us? The Times does not want this issue to die. The Times editors and writers see \"blacks being victimized by white racist cops\" as a representative truth about America 2015 that we all must address.\n\nBut what is the larger reality? First, the vast majority of black males killed violently are killed by black males, and interracial crime in America is overwhelmingly black-on-white, not the reverse. While not the media truth, that is the statistical truth.\n\nThis is reality. Indeed, if the ugliest expressions of racism are interracial assaults, rapes and murders, the heaviest concentrations of racism in America are in the black communities themselves. But the preferred story of the Times and mainstream media, of most cable channels and social media, is white cops victimizing black folks.\n\nThus we have all heard about Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, and Freddie Gray, but few know even the number of black folks gunned down annually in their own black communities.\n\nThe press is not interested in ferreting out those statistics. Why? Such stats would muddy the message the media seek to send and reinforce: i.e., America must confront the crisis of rogue cops. What is coming is not difficult to predict.\n\nAs, invariably, white cops clash with black suspects, the media will seize upon and pump up every episode that fits and advances their scripted narrative. Angry and violent protests will occur. There will be judicial proceedings and trials, like that of the West Baltimore cops coming up.\n\nAmerica will divide and take sides. And the rival \"war on cops\" and \"Black lives matter!\" claims will be adjudicated in the election of 2016.\n\nIn 1968, Richard Nixon rode the law-and-order issue into the White House. Hillary Clinton seems to be moving to capture the \"Black-Lives-Matter!\" constituencies. As for the Republicans, they seem to be acting more like the John Lindsays and Bill Scrantons of yesteryear than the Nixons and Ronald Reagans.

      "text": "A reader posts the above map from the CDC , tracking 2011 gonorrhea rates. He compares it to the maps from Sully's site on the lack of social mobility and concentrations of African-Americans , which indicate a correlation. I posited yesterday that there is a correlation among those Sully maps and one showing that the highest rate of births to teen mothers is found in the same regions, pretty much. In 2011, the CDC found that 67 percent of the gonorrhea cases in the nation were found in blacks . That's 17 times the rate among whites. For black males 15 to 19, the rate was 30 times the rate among whites in the same age group. With the exception of some Hispanic majority\n\nThis doesn't tell us that blacks are having any more sex than whites, Hispanics, or Asians. But it does this tell us that they are far more reckless in how they conduct their sex lives. I'm not interested in making a moral judgment about that here, but rather interested to know if this data can be linked causally to the persistence of poverty. We know that poverty is linked to higher rates of out-of-wedlock pregnancy, as well as sexually transmitted disease. The CDC says:\n\nAs an example, in 2010, the poverty rates, unemployment rates, and high school drop-out rates for blacks, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Hispanics were considerably higher than for whites, differences commensurate with observed disparities in STD burden.\n\nMy question is this: What is the nature of the relationship between sexual practices and poverty? We know that they are closely associated, but in what ways are they associated? The connection between single motherhood and poverty has been very well established. This Jason De Parle story in The New York Times explores how the destinies of women who put off childbearing until marriage, versus those who do not, diverge. Black law professor Ralph Richard Banks writes about how the collapse of marriage culture within black America keeps black Americans in poverty. But I wonder if there are deeper lessons to be learned about the sexual norms within one's culture and economic mobility. Is the clap map relevant to the discussion? I'm not talking about making a moral point here, but a sociological one.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "Squires: Black 'male feminists' are the white liberals of black people\n\nKanye West has generated so much controversy over the past two weeks that he has forced other people to apologize for even being associated with him. But a recent Huffington Post column makes the argument that there is another rapper who is even more \" dangerous \" politically than the self-proclaimed richest black man in history.\n\nAccording to Stephen Crockett, Killer Mike (née Michael Render) is a politically savvy and socially conscious artist who has squandered his cultural capital by becoming a Republican shill. Crockett, a former writer at the Root, based his argument on the fact that the rapper chose to meet with Governor Brian Kemp in 2020, interviewed Herschel Walker during his current Senate run, and provided constructive feedback to the Stacey Abrams campaign.\n\nIn the world of black liberation political discourse, simply speaking to a conservative - and allowing one to speak to your audience - is an act of racial treason. To Stephen Crockett, conservatives are so evil and anti-black that there is no reason for black voters to listen to anything they have to say - especially when a black woman in the South has a chance to become governor.\n\nThis is an unsophisticated way to approach politics, but this hit piece is the logical byproduct of a worldview best described by another writer from the Root.\n\nDamon Young, author and co-founder of the site Very Smart Brothas, wrote a controversial opinion piece in 2017 entitled , \"Straight Black Men Are the White People of Black People.\" Young argued that black men benefit from male privilege and use it to center their concerns regarding racial injustice, while dismissing the concerns of black women (e.g., sexism, domestic violence) in the same way white people downplay and disregard racism and white supremacy.\n\nThe essay lacked substance, but the provocative thesis provides a useful framework for understanding the role men like Young and Crockett play in the larger political ecosystem.\n\nPut simply, black male feminists are the white liberals of black people.\n\nThe primary political purpose of white liberals today is to atone for the \"sin\" of whiteness and the actions of their historical doppelgangers. The BLM flags, black squares on social media, and \"racial justice\" activism are all attempts to receive absolution for the transgressions of white people past, present, and future.\n\nThe high priests of racial politics, from Rev. Al Sharpton to Dr. Ibram X. Kendi, demand a sacrifice, and white liberals are always ready and willing to offer up their conservative counterparts as an act of atonement. This is one reason they eagerly share stories about the 53% of white women who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 or the \"Karens\" destroying America. They want black people to know that they know and agree that white people are terrible and need to give up power and privilege for black people to thrive.\n\nBlack male feminists play a similar role within the black community. They see themselves as beneficiaries of male privilege in a systemically sexist culture and want to show black women that they are committed to black female liberation. The trick is doing so in a way that won't be seen as black men playing dark knights in shining armor swooping in to save black women. That would only reinforce the worst aspects of \"toxic masculinity.\"\n\nThe goal of the black male feminist is to signal to the women who run things (as well as black LGBT allies) that they are not those kinds of black guys - the \"hoteps\" who listen to Kevin Samuels and Dr. Umar Johnson. They have no issue periodically acknowledging the ways in which hip-hop culture objectifies and degrades black women, but they wouldn't be caught dead criticizing similar imagery from Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nThese are the pastors who declare \"I'm with her\" and comedians who wear \"I WILL AID AND ABET ABORTION\" shirts to show women that they too are committed to keeping as many black children from being born as possible.\n\nThe black male feminist doesn't just share similarities with white liberals in political purpose. They share a similar outlook and disposition. They are often neurotic and anxious, two qualities that will always warp a person's ability to assess threats and prioritize resources.\n\nThese men are the ones who think white domestic terrorism and genocidal police officers are the biggest threats to black lives in America's largest cities. Their white liberal comrades, similarly, believe upwards of 1,000 unarmed black men are shot and killed by police each year. It's easy for both groups to come to those conclusions when you completely ignore street crime and actual homicide data for fear of spreading \"conservative talking points\" about \"black-on-black crime.\"\n\nWhite liberals think systemic racism and white supremacy - terms they rarely define - are the biggest impediments to the success of black people. Black male feminists think whiteness and masculinity are the biggest threats to black women. And increasing numbers of black women in the media think that whiteness, traditional notions of masculinity, and the gender binary itself are existential threats to trans women. In the Oppression Olympics, black men take the bronze, black women get the silver, and black trans women own the gold.\n\nZerlina Maxwell, a political analyst and MSNBC host, complained about sexism among Democrats after Sen. Elizabeth Warren ended her presidential campaign in 2020. Maxwell didn't explain why Warren, the first female senator in the history of Massachusetts, came in third among women in the state, because she didn't need to. Instead, she jumped straight to charges of sexism and demanded more men publicly support women in leadership roles.\n\nCraig Melvin, the man moderating the discussion, sheepishly obliged: \"Um ... OK ... uh ... for the record, I want to see women in positions of power.\"\n\nThe other option for black male feminists in media is to sit silently when the women are doing the hard work of leadership. Tiffany Cross felt comfortable saying black men in Georgia should \" get in line \" behind black women and vote for Stacey Abrams because she knew none of the male panelists - including Roland Martin - would challenge her.\n\nPart of the reason people reacted so strongly to Stephen A. Smith telling Malika Andrews that she couldn't silence him on ESPN's First Take is because we have all become accustomed to seeing men like him roll over and show their bellies when a woman encroaches on their territory.\n\nThis is why the criticisms of Killer Mike will only get louder if he continues to withhold an endorsement in the Georgia gubernatorial race. He can expect to be the subject of numerous think pieces and drive-by tweets if an Abrams loss is due to black males who don't vote or who cast ballots for her opponent.\n\nBut ultimately, these critiques say more about men like Stephen Crockett, Damon Young, and the legion of black feminists eager to separate themselves from the black men who have unapproved thoughts and speak their minds freely.\n\nThere was a time when men with their platforms challenged the status quo. Not any more. Now they harangue professional athletes for not taking experimental drugs. These men are toothless guard dogs - they have plenty of bark, but their words have no bite. They recite predictable liberal pablum that boils every social problem down to a tidy list of \"-isms\" and \"phobias.\" More importantly, they completely misunderstand the \"power\" to whom they claim to be speaking truth.\n\nThere is absolutely no risk in being a black liberal accusing President Trump or Governor DeSantis of racism on MSNBC. But it takes actual courage to sit in between BLM's co-founders and ask, \"Why is an organization that claims to care about black people committed to destroying the nuclear family?\"\n\nThe same goes for an artist who takes the stage at the BET Awards and says, \"I appreciate this award, but I will not return to this awards show until this network stops platforming artists who degrade black women and sell murder music to our children.\"\n\nBlack male feminists don't have that in them. Men who mimic the language of personal therapy that is so common on the left today aren't built for the type of culture war playing out within black America.\n\nIf being mistaken for an Uber Eats driver in your luxury condo is a harmful, triggering microaggression that requires an extra hour of therapy, you're not the type of man who can stand firm when the black leadership class points its rhetorical guns at you or tries to make you an outcast within the culture. It's much easier to submit and obey.\n\nThe revolution won't be televised. But the revolutionaries have been domesticated.\n\nDelano Squires\n\nContributor"

Video shows several people just watching attack happen.\n\n'They're all a bunch of cowards to me.'\n\nThree males are wanted in the beating death of a lone victim at a Houston gas station earlier this month.\n\nPolice have released surveillance video of the beating as well as still images of the suspects. The video also shows several people just watching the attack happen.\n\n'They're all smiling and laughing and having a good time while they're pouncing on my son.'\n\nThe City of Houston said the deadly attack took place at 2900 Westridge Street around 1:10 a.m. March 2 and that \"all three suspects are described as black males.\"\n\nThe victim has been identified as 24-year-old Gavin Melchor, officials said.\n\nA preliminary investigation indicated the victim possibly was involved in an argument after which the assault took place, officials said.\n\nVideo police released shows the victim standing between two parked vehicles and talking to three individuals. At one point, the victim stretches his arms outward, and suddenly, one suspect wearing a white T-shirt lunges at him, slams him backward into one of the parked vehicles, and tackles him to the parking lot surface. The clip shows the same suspect appearing to pull objects from the victim's pockets while another suspect wearing a black sweater with an orange design kicks the victim in the head.\n\nInvestigators indeed said the suspect in the white T-shirt robbed the victim. Investigators also said a suspect carrying a pink bag knocked the victim unconscious.\n\nHouston Fire Department paramedics transported the victim to an area hospital where he was pronounced deceased, officials said.\n\nOfficials said those with information on the identities of the three wanted suspects can call Houston police homicide at 713-308-3600 or speak anonymously with Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS.\n\nPolice said in its video description that a $5,000 reward is available.\n\nKTRK-TV interviewed members of Melchor's family, and they urged people to come forward with information about the suspects.\n\n\"They're all a bunch of cowards to me,\" Melchor's father, Chris, told the station.\n\nChris Melchor noted to KTRK that his son had just left the rodeo and had stopped at a Valero gas station to withdraw money from an ATM.\n\nIn regard to those seen on surveillance video just watching the beating take place, Melchor told the station the sight left him feeling \"helpless as a dad.\"\n\nKTRK pointed out that the still image of the suspect who slammed the victim into a vehicle and tackled him to the ground shows him smiling.\n\nThat's too much for Melchor's father to take.\n\n\"That alone angers me,\" Chris Melchor told the station. \"They're all smiling and laughing and having a good time while they're pouncing on my son.\"\n\nThe victim's older sister Christa told KTRK she hasn't been able to bear looking at the clip of the attack: \"I haven't brought myself to watch it yet.\"\n\nYou can view the station's video report here .\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "The Curious Pacifism of Black Lives Matter and Other Political Movements\n\nThe country's gotten so bad, it's a wonder people aren't picking up guns in order to settle matters themselves. At least, that's what you'd believe given the words coming from Black Lives Matter and other groups.\n\nViolent rhetoric is a staple of political oratory: think, the \"war on women,\" \"war on Christians,\" and so forth. Sometimes this language is metaphorical and harmless (say, Martin Luther King's use of the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" ), other times it's hyperbolic.\n\nIn the case of the \"pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon\" chant from Black Lives Matter protesters - which one activist says was intended to be \"playful\" - it's hard to see it as being anything other than a literal call to arms.\n\nYouTube\n\nThe words of \"King Noble,\" a self-professed member of the movement, are even more clear : \"it's open season on killing whites and white police officers ... we are moving to a time where the predator will become the prey.\"\n\nIt's true that there are a number of cases of black males being shot by (or dying in the custody of) police that are troubling, to say the least: Samuel Dubose , Walter Scott , Freddie Gray , Tamir Rice , Chavis Carter , Victor White III , and Levar Jones . But it's not as if police in general are simply going out and intentionally killing African-Americans. If that were true, there would be thousands more shootings and deaths at the hands of police.\n\nYet that's the false apocalypse that's behind the call for police to be targeted. Even if they don't support \"King Noble's\" declaration, many members of Black Lives Matter describe a situation so hopeless that it's hard to understand why they wouldn't. If \"the police\" are wantonly killing black people, then why respond with pacifism? Why not pick up a gun and shoot the police first?\n\nThat's what happened with the killings of detectives Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos last year in New York City, who wrote on his Instagram account, \"I'm putting Wings on Pigs Today.\" It's what may have also happened with the killing of sheriff's deputy Darren Goforth .\n\nBut Black Lives Matter isn't the only group whose members sometimes give in the the temptation to describe their plight as cataclysmic, so much so that you have to wonder why they don't just pick up a gun. We hear over and over that there's a war on women, on liberty, on Christians, on freedom of speech, or that there are forces pushing the country inexorably into racism, fascism, communism, theocracy, or some form of degeneracy so horrible that it seems odd to vote merely against it. Shouldn't we be overthrowing it instead?\n\nI know I take a risk in saying this, that someone might read it and say, \"Yeah, we're not doing enough to combat this, the political process is too little, too late. The time has come for bullets, not ballots.\" But what I'm going for is the opposite: the fact that the vast majority of us have ruled out violence comes from a recognition that the rhetoric we hear is overblown.\n\nI can't think of anything going on in this country that makes it worth picking up a gun and shooting people. Can you?\n\nTake abortion: if the pro-life movement is really a crusade to deprive women of the right to control their own bodies, or if the pro-choice movement is really committing something on par with the Holocaust, then aren't markers and poster-board a disproportionately weak response? Or is it really the rhetoric that's outsized and exaggerated?\n\nI'm not saying that there's nothing worth fighting for on abortion, or in the Black Lives Matter movement, or a host of other political causes. But we've all clearly chosen to understand \"fighting\" not as literal bloodshed, but as engaging in the peaceful political process. Which is just to say that, on some level, the vast majority of people who indulge in \"war\" or other apocalyptic rhetoric realize that they're being melodramatic.\n\nA suggestion: let's play things safe, and stop being melodramatic.\n\n-\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.

Even among black women, Harris has historically low support compared to previous Democratic candidates.\n\n\"This is part of a long-standing trend of young black men moving away from the Democratic Party,\" Enten concluded. \"Kamala Harris is just the latest to face that magnitude of younger black men going toward Republicans.\"\n\nEnten posted video of his comments at CNN to his X account.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Squires: Nobody in America today believes in the superiority of white people more than black Democrats\n\nThe reaction to the recent Joe Rogan controversy has been a great opportunity for the left to focus on its two favorite activities - wielding political power and obsessing over identity.\n\nWhite liberals calling for Rogan's show to be pulled from Spotify are mainly motivated by a censorious desire to stop him from sharing opinions that contradict leftist COVID orthodoxy. They don't really care about racial offense. If they did, people like Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Howard Stern, Cenk Uygur, and even Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who have all used the N-word, dressed in blackface, or transgressed their race rules, would all be unemployed.\n\nThe reaction from black liberals is motivated by something that goes much deeper, to the core of modern black identity. It is a perverse remnant of the white supremacy that gripped our nation for centuries.\n\nThe dictionary defines the word \"supremacy\" as \"the state or condition of being superior to all others in authority, power, or status.\"\n\nNo one in America today believes in the superiority of white people more than black Democrats who think the thoughts, feelings, words, and actions of white people matter infinitely more than those of black people.\n\nPut simply, black liberals have an idol problem. Their worldview is powered by a perverse twisting of scripture. They think that \"black people shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouths of white people.\"\n\nThis issue goes much deeper than a few Joe Rogan episodes.\n\nJemele Hill, former ESPN personality and host of \"Jemele Hill Is Unbothered,\" said the following in response to the controversy surrounding her fellow Spotify podcaster.\n\n\"There is no context in which it is acceptable for somebody white to say the word, none, zero. Don't sing it. Don't rap it. Don't quote it from historical text. Don't quote an author's use of it. You don't get to say it. Period.\"\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist at the New York Times, had a series of tweets about the word, including this telling perspective.\n\n\"A Black person calling another Black person the N-word is inconsequential and irrelevant to this discussion because Black people did not use this word to reify the systematic subjugation of other Black people through laws, policies, housing, schools, employment, incarceration.\"\n\nThe notion that the N-word is only used between black people as a term of endearment is an obvious lie to anyone who has listened to hip-hop for the past 30 years.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest explained the history and evolution of the term in their song \"Sucka N***a\" nearly 30 years ago. The word has become even more ingrained in rap music since then.\n\nFast-forward a generation to the 2014 hit \"Hot N***a\" from Brooklyn rapper Bobby Shmurda, and you can get a sense of how the word is used today. Shmurda used the N-word over a dozen times in a song that only lasted three minutes. He punctuated his repeated references to shooting \"n***as\" with images of him and his friends exercising their trigger fingers while staring into the camera.\n\nThe rapper, whose real name is Ackquille Jean Pollard, was arrested in December 2014 along with several members of his GS9 crew and charged with conspiracy to murder, weapons possession, and reckless endangerment. He pleaded guilty in 2016 and was sentenced to seven years in prison. He was released in 2021 after serving five.\n\nThis isn't the only time that art has imitated life in hip-hop. Over 50% of deceased rappers were murdered, including cultural icons like Notorious B.I.G and Tupac Shakur and less influential artists like King Von and Young Dolph.\n\nAccording to a report from the CDC in 2019, approximately half of all deceased black males in 2017 between 15 and 24 were victims of homicide. Black people are 13% of the population but consistently account for more than 50% of homicide victims, a fact that drives a homicide victimization rate for black people that is seven times higher than that of whites.\n\nAll of these facts should provoke the black intellectual class to closely police anyone who publicly devalues or degrades black people, especially for personal profit.\n\nInstead, the black community is forced to reckon with a committed force of pundits and social commentators who convince us that a white guy singing along with Jay-Z and Kanye West to \"N*ggas in Paris\" has committed a grievous sin, while a black guy holding his gun sideways while shooting at another black man has no power.\n\nThese people believe \"representation matters\" and that children are inspired to emulate people who look like them - until it comes to the little black boys and girls who have had their minds bathed in lyrics about \"dead n*ggas\" and \"dumb b*tches\" for generations.\n\nJoe Rogan's fate now rests in the hands of Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. The tech billionaire has faced pressure to curtail Rogan's influence since the popular podcaster engaged in conversations with people who expressed views about COVID-19 - from its origin to the efficacy of the vaccination - that directly contradicted the Biden administration. According to them, Rogan committed the ultimate sin in today's culture by spreading \"misinformation,\" but the left will gladly use video of him saying the \"N-word\" as the pretext to push him off the airwaves.\n\nEven Hue Jackson, former coach of the Cleveland Browns, joined the chorus of people demanding Rogan be removed from Spotify. He also tied Rogan's past comments to the current racial discrimination lawsuit that was filed against the NFL by Brian Flores last week.\n\nThere was a time when the N-word was the last thing a black man would have heard before having his life taken. That isn't why people tune in to hear from Joe Rogan. It's what they'll hear if they check the catalogues of next week's Super Bowl acts, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Their song \"Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat\" is a natural fit for the big game since they proudly declared that they \"never hesitate to put a n*gga on his back.\"\n\nDelano Squires\n\nContributor"

He says that the constant burglaries are threatening to shut down his business.\n\n\"It's everything. It's crying, it's rage, it's anger, it's frustration, it's defeat,\" said Greer to KTVU-TV on Tuesday.\n\nHe said his business suffered a fourth burglary recently after only being open for about two years.\n\n\"It's a very defeating feeling to just try so hard every day and even as a leader you don't have time to grieve,\" Greer said.\n\nThe latest break-in happened on Monday at about 4:30 a.m.\n\n\"Couple guys, young guys, broke in, they basically hit the glass. Then they just go,\" Greer said. \"It's almost a routine.\"\n\nPrior to opening up his brick and mortar shop in downtown Oakland, Greer had operated the business as a pop-up in Jack London Square. He has over 20 years' experience as a chef.\n\n\"They have been ... my own people.\"\n\nHe said that the restaurant was just celebrating record sales in March when it was burglarized the last time.\n\n\"Unfortunately, all four of our break-ins have been young black males. They have been my own, my own people,\" Greer continued. \"And it's heartbreaking.\"\n\nWhen asked who was to blame for the situation, he said society has to look at the home and schools.\n\n\"This is an Oakland problem. It's not City Hall's fault, it's everyone's fault. We all need to step up and do something,\" said Greer.\n\nHe went on to say that even if he thought about leaving downtown, it would be tough to do logistically.\n\n\"Just because you get broken into a few times doesn't mean you can just pack up and leave. You're stuck into a lease, that if you leave, you're gonna have to deal with an eviction court,\" Greer explained.\n\n\"Hold yourself accountable. Grow.\"\n\nThe business owner provided security video showing the burglars climbing into the restaurant after breaking the glass on a door.\n\nGreer had a message for criminals who used their personal circumstances as an excuse to steal from others.\n\n\"Hold yourself accountable. Grow. Just because you were raised a certain way or weren't raised a certain way. Just because you come from a certain area, we can change,\" said Greer.\n\n\"We can improve,\" he concluded. \"There are jobs out here.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Horowitz: Justice for George Floyd and for all of the 7,000+ black homicide victims every year\n\nWhen thousands of rioters burn down private businesses and even violently attack a woman in a wheelchair in response to an abhorrent act committed by one police officer , it is clear that the George Floyd riots are not about justice, as shown by the viral footage of the Minneapolis riots and the attacks on L.A. police officers yesterday. But what exposes this so-called movement as nothing but a dangerous anarchist mob, more than when and how they act, is when they fail to protest and actually remain silent when even more black lives are at stake.\n\nThe act of the officer who placed his knee on George Floyd's neck for several minutes after he was completely neutralized and couldn't move is obviously indefensible. As with every criminal act that leads to murder, he should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nBut why is it we never heard on the news about the endless trend of cop ambushes and executions at the hands of violent criminals in recent months? Why do we never hear about the cases where cops engage in near-suicidal restraint to go the extra mile to defuse a situation? That is the balance of coverage and perspective we rarely see.\n\nThe reason we never see this balance is because the media doesn't have an agenda for justice or prudent policing, but to spark a racial war. This is why we never saw rioting or media outrage after a Somali immigrant police officer in Minneapolis fatally shot Justine Damond, an Australian woman, in cold blood in 2017 after she approached his patrol car to report a suspected rape behind her house. The only reason the cop was tried and sentenced to 12.5 years for manslaughter was that this was an international incident and the Australian government raised an outcry over it.\n\nThis illuminates a broader point about the focus of outrage on senseless murders in general. Why is the outrage related to policing and crime only in one direction and only when the race of the people affected is oriented a certain way?\n\nConsider the following: According to the Washington Post's database on police shootings, 17 unarmed African-Americans were killed by police in 2018 . Let's just assume the unlikely assumption that all 17 were unjustified in the mold of the choking death of George Floyd. That accounts for just 0.002% of the 7,407 black homicide victims that year , according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, the overwhelming majority of whom were killed by black criminals, not white criminals or police. In cases where the races of both the victim and offender were known, a staggering 88.9% of black homicide victims were murdered by black criminals.\n\nThis is a reoccurring epidemic every year and is made worse by the broad and indiscriminate war on cops and public safety. Even the fear of dying from coronavirus didn't stop the murder and mayhem in America's inner cities. If black lives actually mattered, as all lives do, where is the outrage?\n\nThis is why isolated incidents cannot be manipulated for the purpose of pushing a broad policy narrative. The notion that somehow black people are broadly mistreated by the justice system in a disproportionate way is simply not true, as shown by the crime rates. Despite composing 12% of the population, they compose 55% of the homicide offenders and 53% of the homicide victims. Black males, in particular, accounted for 45% of homicides, even though they make up just 7% of the population.\n\nIn 2018, African-Americans accounted for 54% of those arrested for robbery, 34% of those arrested for aggravated assault, and 43% of weapons violations. In total, they composed 37.4% of all violent crime arrests. Yet despite the complaint about black imprisonment, only 33% of state and federal inmates in 2017 were black. And their numbers are dropping quicker than any other group .\n\nDespite this, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics , the black imprisonment rate has been down 28% from 2008-2018, while the white imprisonment rate dropped by just 13%. The jail incarceration rate for black criminals dropped 30% - to the lowest level since 1990 - while the white incarceration rate actually increased 12% over the past decade.\n\nThus, the underlying problem of violence among black youth in inner cities has nothing to do with the police. We could abolish the police tomorrow, and it certainly would not save all those lives lost. Again, the most common victims of such breakdowns in law and order are African-Americans.\n\nThe sad reality is criminal interactions are disproportionately high among black citizens because of the aforementioned statistics. Therefore, the majority of justified police shootings as well as unjustified shootings will unfortunately be disproportionate among the black inner-city population. When it comes to individual incidents, it's all about the facts on the ground and pursuing color-blind justice. But if we are going to push broad public policy narratives because of these incidents, then we must also address the broader picture of this culture of violence. And that has nothing to do with the police.\n\nWas it the police who caused 23-year-old Leroy Davonte Davis-Miles to brutally murder a 75-year-old man in a knockout attack last November at a Minneapolis metro stop ? Was there rioting in the aftermath?\n\nLet's face it: What's going on in Minneapolis has nothing to do with George Floyd's murder. It's merely a pretext to accelerate the criminal activity that has already been increasing . Crime has been increasing dramatically in the Twin Cities area, with robberies up 53% last year , attacks on public transportation growing out of control , and St. Paul experiencing a record year of homicides .\n\nWhich leads me to the political reaction to the riots by local officials in Minnesota. The fact that one police officer is allegedly a murderer doesn't mean they need to cower in fear and allow rioters to burn down an entire city, harm innocent people, and destroy the remaining businesses not shut down by the coronavirus lockdown. Where are these big and strong police ordered to show force by dictatorial mayors and governors when it comes to dealing with actual violent criminals? Why is it that they only seem to arrest family-oriented people trying to hold prayer services or open a business, but somehow a gathering of well over 10 people to burn down a store is not met with swift justice and deterrent?\n\nIf nothing else, we are seeing what happens when politics and racial demagoguery trump true color-blind law and justice. Our country has descended to the lowest depths of tyranny and anarchy at the same time - tyranny for you and me; anarchy for the most violent criminals.\n\nDaniel Horowitz\n\nBlaze Podcast Host"

The latest policy rollout is notable because it comes with the stated purpose of motivating black men to vote mere weeks before Election Day.\n\nAs her campaign has done with the 'Hombres' group, Harris' team plans to organize gender-specific gatherings. Those include 'Black Men Huddle Up' events in battleground states featuring African American male celebrities for things like watch parties for NFL and NCAA football games. The campaign says it also plans new testimonial ads in battleground states that feature local black male voices.\n\nCedric Richmond, co-chair of the Harris campaign and a former Louisiana congressman who is black, said Harris wants to build an economy 'where black men are equipped with the tools to thrive: to buy a home, provide for our families, start a business and build wealth.'\n\nBlack Americans strongly supported Joe Biden when he beat Trump in 2020. Harris advisers say they are less worried about losing large percentages of black male support to the former president than that some will choose not to turn out at all.\n\nTrump, too, has stepped up efforts to win over black and Hispanic voters of both genders. He has held roundtables with black entrepreneurs in swing states and will sit for a townhall sponsored by Spanish-language Univision this week. He also has sought to openly stoke racial divisions, repeatedly suggesting that immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally are taking jobs from black and Hispanic Americans.\n\nHarris' new round of proposals includes a promise that, if elected, she will help distribute 1 million loans of up to $20,000 that can be fully forgivable to black entrepreneurs and others who have strong ideas to start businesses. The loans would come via new partnerships between the Small Business Administration and community leaders and banks 'with a proven commitment to their communities,' her campaign says.\n\nShe has already come out in support of legalising recreational marijuana\n\nAmong black men, Harris is polling behind Biden (pictured) was in 2020\n\nThe vice president also wants to offer federal incentives to encourage more African American men to train to be teachers, citing statistics that black males made up only a bit more than 1% of the nation's public school teaching ranks in 2020-21, according to data from the National Teacher and Principal Survey .\n\nHarris also is pledging to expand existing federal programs that forgive some educational loans for public service to further encourage more black male teachers. She also wants to use organizations like the National Urban League, local governments and the private sector to expand apprenticeships and credentialing opportunities in black communities.\n\nThe vice president's advisers have been urging her to talk more about cryptocurrency as a way to appeal to male voters. Her campaign said that as president, Harris will back a regulatory framework meant to better protect investors in cryptocurrency and other digital assets, which are popular with black men.\n\nHarris also promised to create a national initiative to better fund efforts to detect, research and combat sickle cell disease, diabetes, prostate cancer, mental health challenges and other health issues that disproportionately affect black men.\n\nA recent poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found about 7 in 10 black voters had a favorable view of Harris and preferred her leadership to that of Trump on major policy issues including the economy, health care, abortion, immigration and the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThere was little difference in support for Harris between black men and black women.\n\nIt comes after Harris challenged her rival to release his medical records , following the release of her own in the final weeks of the presidential election.\n\nKamala Harris: He refuses to release his medical records. He is unwilling to do a 60 Minutes interview. He is unwilling to meet for a second debate. Why does his staff want him to hide away? Are they afraid that people will see he is too weak and unstable to lead America? pic.twitter.com/bLrX3Eabya\n\nRepublican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump walks onstage for a campaign rally on October 12, 2024 in Coachella, California\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris arrives during a campaign rally at the Rawhide Event Center on October 10, 2024 in Chandler, Arizona\n\nMs Harris revealed her doctor's notes after her rival spent months targeting outgoing President Joe Biden's declining health during the election campaign.\n\nThe Democratic Party candidate is in 'excellent health' according to her doctors and recently received a report from the White House showing she has the 'mental stability' to lead the country.\n\nAfter making her records public, one of Ms Harris's election team said in a post on social media: 'Your turn, Donald Trump'.\n\nThe Republican Party has so far refused to publish Mr Trump's health details in response to Ms Harris's demands, but insists he is also in 'perfect and excellent health'.\n\nMs Harris, 59, and her team have been on the attack about 78-year-old Mr Trump's health after he used Mr Biden's age and apparent deteriorating condition against him.\n\nAccording to Ms Harris, Mr Trump is not a suitable choice because he 'goes off on tangents' and rants at colleagues.\n\nElection day is on November 5, and if Mr Trump wins a second term in office, by the time it is up, he will be the joint oldest US president at the age of 82 - the same age Mr Biden will be when he steps down.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Pictured here, two men being searched by officers during the Notting Hill Carnival in August 2017\n\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, pictured, told the Home Affairs Select Committee her officers have stopped and searched almost 22,000 young black men between March and May - with only 20 per cent of these searchers leading to arrest or further action\n\nThe Met were caught in a race row last weekend after officers pulled over international athletes Bianca Williams and her partner Ricardo dos Santos\n\nFormer Olympian Linford Christie, accused the Met of 'institutional racism' after the stop\n\nDuring lockdown, the equivalent of 30 per cent of all young black males in London were stopped in that time, though some individuals may have been approached more than once.\n\nCharities which campaign against the disproportionate use of stop and search have described the figures as 'shocking and saddening'.\n\nKatrina Ffrench, chief executive of Stopwatch, told the Guardian: 'How do those young people feel when this is their city, they're going about their daily business, could be caring for parents, all sorts of reasons as to why they're out?'\n\nThe figures emerged in a home affairs select committee, chaired by Yvette Cooper, in which Met police commissioner Cressida Dick also apologised to Team GB sprinter Bianca Williams for the distress her officers caused her in a heavy-handed stop and search.\n\nDame Cressida told the committee she echoed a senior officer who had said 'I'm sorry' to the 26-year-old over the incident, which was heavily criticised and branded 'racial profiling' after video of it went viral.\n\nWilliams and her Portuguese sprinter husband Ricardo dos Santos, 25, were hauled from their Mercedes and handcuffed in front of their three-month-old son in Lanhill Road, Maida Vale, on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe commissioner restated the apology made by her colleague and said they were reviewing handcuff policy, but defended the force's use of stop and search, insisting black people were eight times more likely to be perpetrators of violent crime.\n\nA video of the incident was posted online by former Olympic medallist Linford Christie.\n\nBianca Williams, 26, a European and Commonwealth gold medallist, and her partner, Ricardo dos Santos, 25, the Portuguese record holder over 400m were stopped and searched near their London home\n\nTwo internal reviews of the incident have cleared the officers involved of any wrongdoing\n\nThe Met has voluntarily referred itself to the police watchdog, despite two reviews by the force's directorate of professional standards finding no misconduct by its officers.\n\nDame Cressida told the Home Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday: 'We apologised yesterday to Ms Williams and I apologise again for the distress this stop clearly caused her.'\n\nThe commissioner said reviews of the evidence by two separate teams have found there was no apparent misconduct, but explained a referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) because of 'the level of public concern'.\n\nShe said: 'Yesterday two of my officers spoke on our behalf to Ms Williams, and I think all of us watching could empathise with somebody who is stopped in a vehicle, who has a young child in the back, who does not probably know what exactly is going on, and is subsequently found, together with her partner, not to be carrying anything illicit.'\n\nDame Cressida said she has asked a senior officer to review the Met's handcuffing practices to make sure it hasn't become a 'default', and has set up an 'oversight group' looking at the use of force.\n\n'Every time we see a video that is of concern we review them, we see if there are any lessons learned,' she told MPs.\n\n'My senior officer has said... I'm sorry to Ms Williams for the distress, it has clearly caused her, and I say that, too.\n\n'So, if there are lessons to be learned from it, we will learn them, and I'm looking at handcuffing as a specific issue.'\n\nDame Cressida told the committee stop and search has increased by around 50 per cent in the year to May, when there was a spike of 43,869 in a month, and that people are 3.8 times more likely to stopped if they are black.\n\nChair Yvette Cooper said analysis showed 10,000 of those searched in May were young black males, aged between 15 and 24, and more than 8,000 of those weren't found to be carrying, or doing, anything requiring further action.\n\nShe said between 70,000 to 80,000 of London's population is in that demographic, suggesting one in 10 young black men were stopped and searched, with nothing found, in the capital in May.\n\nDame Cressida, the UK's most senior police officer, said she was not 'alarmed' by the figures but is 'alert', adding that the positive outcome rate - where further action is required - is the same whatever a person's ethnicity.\n\nShe rejected claims the Met is 'institutionally racist' and described her officers as the 'most diverse bunch of people you can imagine'.\n\nThe commissioner said: 'They say to me they find it odious to be accused of, as they feel it, personally as being racist. They hate that, they say you just won't see it on my team.\n\n'But they do understand there's some misunderstandings, that there's some connections that aren't being made, that people are angry about things and they want to make the relationships better.\n\n'But they want to save lives and they want to save, amongst of course everybody else, they really want to save black lives and they care about that.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

The rate for Christian men was just 92.6.\n\nSimilar disparities were seen among females, with the death rate for Muslim women being 98.2, followed by 94.3 for Jewish women, 93.3 for Hindus and 69.4 for Sikhs. The rate for non-religious women was 47.9, while it was 54.6 for Christian women and 57.4 for Buddhists.\n\nThe ONS data released - described by one expert as being 'deeply disturbing' - also revealed the coronavirus is killing black men at triple the rate of white males in the UK, adding to a string of damning research that shows black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) groups are being disproportionately hit by the disease.\n\nThe Covid-19 death rate among black men was 255.7 per 100,000 people between March 2 and May 15, the highest of any ethnicity. For white men during the same time period there were 87 deaths per 100,000 people, the lowest of any ethnic group.\n\nBlack women were also being killed by the virus at nearly two-and-a-half times the rate of white women at the height of the crisis in the UK, the figures show. The death rate among black females was 119 per 100,000 people, compared to 52 per 100,000 white women.\n\nScientists are struggling to pin down exactly why death rates among BAME Brits are higher but they believe it may be because minority groups in the UK have considerably higher rates of health problems that raise their risk of catching a severe bout of Covid-19, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Links to higher rates of vitamin D deficiencies are also being investigated.\n\nIt comes after findings of a major study released today showed South Asians are 20 per cent more likely to die of coronavirus after being admitted to hospital than white people. The research analysed records of 35,000 infected patients across 260 hospitals.\n\nSeparate data released by the ONS today found the risk of dying from the virus was twice as high among Muslim Britons compared to non-religious people\n\nFigures show the Covid-19 death rate among black men was 255.7 per 100,000 people between March 2 and May 15, the highest of any ethnicity. The mortality rate was lowest for white men during the same time period, at 87 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the Office for National Statistics\n\nMuslims suffered 198.9 deaths per 100,000 males and 98.2 deaths per 100,000 females, the highest out of any religious group. By contrast, those with 'no religion' had the lowest rate of death involving Covid-19, with 80.7 deaths per 100,000 men and 47.9 deaths per 100,000 women\n\nStatisticians today admitted they were baffled as to why Jewish people appeared to be more at risk of dying from Covid-19, saying more research is needed to uncover the reason behind the increased odds of death.\n\nBut it is not the first time alarm bells have been rang over the risk of coronavirus in the Jewish community.\n\nAt the start of the crisis, Jewish leaders in Britain urged their community to 'preserve life' after it was claimed that 5 per cent of Covid-19 funerals up to March 27 were Jewish ceremonies.\n\nSources told MailOnline they were confident most Jewish people were abiding by government guidance, while those from the ultra orthodox said its communities were following the rules.\n\nFriday night dinners with family are often a highlight of the week in the Jewish community which involve close contact in the form of hugging and kissing. Jewish ceremonies such as bar mitzvahs also involve the sort of contact currently banned in the UK under social distancing guidelines.\n\nThe period before Passover, on April 8 this year, is always a popular time for celebrations within some parts of the community because it begins a period of semi-mourning called the Omer. Therefore, it is common for some Jewish families in Britain to hold many parties and social in February and March during the run-up to this period.\n\nConcerns of the risk to the Jewish community in New York were also raised early on because members were refusing to stay away from one another and adhere to strict social distancing rules.\n\nIn Williamsburg and Borough Park - two Brooklyn neighborhoods - hundreds flouted social distancing rules to attend funerals for people whose lives the virus has claimed.\n\nCommunity leaders argued it was only a small number that ignored public health advice, which prompted law-makers to call the situation 'maddening' given the lack of any proven Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nOne Republican official warned the continuous funerals would end 'condemning someone else to the ground'.\n\nThe figures, which are for England and Wales, are based on any confirmed or suspected coronavirus death that occurred between March 2 to May 15 and which were registered by May 29.\n\nAfter adjusting for factors that may affect the risk, including region, population density, socio-demographic and household sizes, the raised risk of death involving Covid-19 for black people was twice as high for males and 1.4 times greater for females compared to white people.\n\nMen from Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian backgrounds also had a significantly higher risk of falling victim to coronavirus when these factors were adjusted for.\n\nThe risk was 1.5 times greater for Bangladeshi men compared to white males, and 1.6 times higher in Pakistani and Indian men than whites.\n\nFor females in Bangladeshi or Pakistani, Indian, Chinese and Mixed ethnic groups, the risk of death involving Covid-19 was the same as it was for white women.\n\nNick Stripe, head of life events at the ONS, said: 'ONS analysis continues to show that people from a Black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID-19 than all other ethnic groups.\n\n'The risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males and nearly two and a half times higher for black females than white.\n\n'Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for Black males and around one and a half times for black females.\n\n'Significant differences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. The ONS will continue to research this unexplained increased risk of death, examining the impact of other health conditions.'\n\nBlack, Asian and minority ethnic people are no more likely to die from coronavirus than white people, a study given to government scientists has found.\n\nResearch presented to Number 10's SAGE panel found there was no greater risk of death for Brits of BAME backgrounds when all factors were taken into account.\n\nIt showed that 'comorbidities' - long-term health problems - appeared to account for higher rates of hospitalisation and intensive care among ethnic minority people.\n\nRisk among BAME communities has been a sensitive topic during Britain's outbreak and even given rise to calls for extra protection for non-white NHS staff.\n\nStatistics show BAME people in Britain are dying of COVID-19 at disproportionate rates, but scientists have struggled to explain why.\n\nThe research - done by scientists from the universities of Edinburgh and Liverpool - was one of around a dozen secret papers published last night by the government.\n\nIt did, however, claim BAME people did seem to be more likely to end up in intensive care in the first place.\n\nThe SAGE paper was met with scepticism, however, with one intensive care doctor saying the data it contained did not line up with what the scientists claimed.\n\nOxford University's Professor Duncan Young said: 'I'm not sure why they thought black patients were more at risk of ICU care.\n\n'The take-home message is that BAME patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 are no more likely to end up in ICU nor are they more likely to die.'\n\nProfessor Aziz Sheikh, a primary care expert at the University of Edinburgh, said: 'There have been concerns raised for many months now on the disproportionate effects of Covid-19 on minority faith communities.\n\n'This analysis on religion and COVID-19 outcomes is therefore - whilst revealing deeply disturbing findings - very welcome.\n\n'Whilst we need to understand the underlying reasons for these poor outcomes, it is important that we don't try and explain these away by referring to socio-economic disadvantage or other contextual factors.\n\n'We now need to meaningfully engage with our faith communities to more fully acknowledge and appreciate their concerns, identify potential mitigation strategies and rapidly evaluate the impacts of such interventions. We also urgently need similar faith-based analyses for Scotland and Northern Ireland.'\n\nMarsha de Cordova MP, Labour's Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary, said: 'Across the globe, racial injustice has always had a devastating impact on society, and coronavirus has demonstrated the deadly consequences of when racial inequalities go unchecked.\n\n'These findings are yet more evidence of the need for urgent action on this issue. But instead we have seen denial and delay from the Government.'\n\nConsultant cardiologist Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'Covid-19 is sometimes erroneously described as a leveller, but this virus in fact exacerbates existing health inequalities which particularly affect black and minority ethnic groups, as these latest figures show.\n\n'Evidence to date suggests that a wide range of biological and socioeconomic factors has contributed to a disproportionate number of Black and Asian people dying from Covid-19.\n\n'BHF-funded research has already shown that compared to the White British population, specific ethnic groups are at greater risk of developing heart disease or its risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes, which are amongst the most common pre-existing health conditions in people who have died with the virus in England and Wales.\n\n'For example, we know that people of African and African Caribbean background have higher rates of hypertension people and people of South Asian descent have higher rates of cardiovascular disease compared with other ethnic groups such as White British.\n\n'In the face of mounting evidence, it is time for the Government to act now to address these health inequalities by implementing the recommendations of the recent Public Health England review.\n\n'This is an important first step to protect the health of patients with Covid-19 both now and in the event of a second wave, as well as those with heart and circulatory diseases.'\n\nAround three in 10 workers whose job involves direct physical contact with others said they have not worn protective gear in their workplace in the last week, a survey suggests.\n\nSome 45 per cent of 110 people who did work requiring direct physical contact with others wore personal protective equipment (PPE) always or often in the workplace over the last seven days, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\n\nBut 29 per ecnt of this group said they had never done this during the past week.\n\nThe ONS analysed responses from 1,896 adults in Great Britain aged 16 and over between June 11 and 14 as part of its Opinions and Lifestyle Survey.\n\nOf the 160 workers whose jobs do not require direct physical contact, a slightly higher proportion (47 per cent) had worn PPE always or often in the workplace in the last seven days.\n\nJust under half (46 per cent) reported they had always stayed at least two metres away from others in the workplace, and 36 per cent said they had managed to do this \"often\".\n\nCalls have been made for all employers to ensure face coverings or screens are used by their staff where social distancing is not possible.\n\nIt comes as almost a fifth of adults who had left their homes this week said they had visited somewhere that was crowded.\n\nOf the 92 per cent of adults who said they had gone out during the last seven days, 18 per cent had visited somewhere that was crowded.\n\nLast month, two separate studies presented to SAGE suggested that ethnicity on its own does not raise the risk of Covid-19 death.\n\nResearchers at King's College London found that BAME patients were 11 years younger on average than their white counterparts on average and had more comorbidities.\n\nBAME patients aged 63, on average, compared to 74 for white patients.\n\nThey also had higher rates of high blood pressure (63.3 per cent) and diabetes (48.6 per cent) while white patients were more likely to have heart-related issues (21.2 per cent).\n\nIt is these long-term illnesses - now dubbed 'underlying conditions' by the NHS - which are thought to be putting ethnic minority people at higher risk from Covid-19.\n\nThe fact that the illnesses are more prevalent in BAME people suggest they start at a younger age, and therefore people may be at more risk from COVID-19 at an earlier age.\n\nWhereas lower rates of diabetes and high blood pressure among white people suggests it develops later in life - the risk is known to increase with age.\n\nNHS data shows that around 26 per cent of all people dying of COVID-19 in hospitals in England have diabetes.\n\nA separate study by researchers at the universities of Edinburgh and Liverpool came to the same conclusion that ethnicity on its own does not raise risk of death.\n\nThat study, of around 23,000 patients in the UK, found that 'comorbidities', and in particular diabetes, appeared to account for the difference in risk.\n\nIt suggested that BAME people were more likely to be admitted to intensive care but, when the illnesses were taken into account, the difference disappeared.\n\nONS data published today also found that those who identified as Jewish at the time of the 2011 Census showed an increased risk of a death involving Covid-19 compared with the Christian population.\n\nJewish males had a mortality rate of 187.9 deaths per 100,000, which was roughly twice the risk of Christian males (92.6 deaths per 100,000).\n\nFor Jewish females, the rate was 94.3 deaths per 100,000, compared with 54.6 deaths per 100,000 for Christian females.\n\nResponding to the findings, Mr Stripe said: 'For the most part the elevated risk of certain religious groups is explained by geographical, socio-economic and demographic factors and increased risks associated with ethnicity.\n\n'However, after adjusting for the above, Jewish males are at twice the risk of Christian males, and Jewish women are also at higher risk. Additional data and analyses are required to understand this excess risk.'\n\nThe analysis was restricted to those aged nine and over, because children under nine would not have been born at the time of the last Census, in 2011.\n\nThe rate for Hindu males was found to be 154.8 deaths per 100,000 people, while for Sikh males it was 128.6. For Hindu females the rate was 93.3, and for Sikh females it was 69.3.\n\nSouth Asians are 20 per cent more likely to die of coronavirus after being admitted to hospital than white people, a major study has found.\n\nThe extensive study - which adds to mounting evidence that BAME groups are being hit hardest by Covid-19 - looked at 35,000 infected patients across 260 hospitals in mid-May.\n\nResearchers said the findings should inform government policy on who is prioritised to get vaccinated against the disease first, if a jab is proven to work.\n\nData also showed there was no difference between ethnic groups when it came to the severity of illness on admission to hospital.\n\nIt comes just days after Public Health England published a long-awaited second part of its report into how coronavirus has hit BAME communities harder.\n\nThe report said 'hostile environments' towards immigrants may have affected settled BAME communities through 'heightened prejudice' and 'societal tensions' - but did not explain how this has directly raised the risk of Covid-19.\n\nThe study that found South Asians face a higher risk of dying, set to be published in the Lancet, involved experts from more than twenty-seven institutions across the UK as well as Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam.\n\nLead author Professor Ewen Harrison, of the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC : 'South Asians are definitely more likely to die from Covid-19 in hospital, but we don't see a strong effect in the black group.'\n\nSouth Asians are 20 per cent more likely to die of coronavirus after being admitted to hospital than white people, a major study has found\n\nOne graph showed how the percentage of Covid-19 patients dying in hospital increases with age. Data for men is on the left, while the figures for women are on the right. The darker circles take into account patients who had diabetes\n\nNo difference was seen between ethnic groups when it came to the severity of illness on admission to hospital\n\nIt comes just days after Public Health England published a long-awaited second part of its report into how coronavirus has hit BAME communities harder. A man in Bradford is pictured wearing a face mask\n\nThe study , which has been made public, also found that 290 die out of every 1,000 white people needing hospital treatment for Covid-19. This figure rose to 350 for South Asian people.\n\nNo similar estimates were made for other ethnic groups but the raw data revealed hospitalised Covid-19 patients who were black were 5 per cent more likely to die than white people. East Asians fared the same as white people.\n\nProfessor Harrison added: 'The South Asian population in hospital looks completely different to the white population.\n\n'They're 12 years younger on average, that's a massive difference, and they tend not to have dementia, obesity or lung disease, but very high levels of diabetes.'\n\nDiabetes increases the risk of developing severe Covid-19 and the 4million Brits who have the condition are considered to be in the 'at risk' group.\n\nThe study showed that around 40 per cent of South Asian patients had either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, compared with 25 per cent of white groups.\n\nMost of the infected patients in the study, yet to be peer-reviewed, were white (83 per cent).\n\nPeople of South Asian background made up 5 per cent of the total group, while 4 per cent of cases analysed were black people.\n\nThe study comes amid concerns prevalent since the start of the crisis that the BAME community has been more affected by the killer pandemic.\n\nThe report released by Public Health England (PHE) just a few days ago claimed a lack of trust in the NHS may have left some BAME groups reluctant to seek help early on, potentially making their disease harder to treat. It said some people were 'fearful of being deported' if they presented to hospital.\n\nAnd it claimed that BAME NHS staff may be less likely to speak up when they have concerns about personal protective equipment (PPE) or their risk.\n\nThe report - based on discussions with 4,000 people - noted that historic racism has meant non-white communities are generally poorer so have worse health, putting them at higher risk if they catch Covid-19.\n\nEthnic minority people - in particular those from black, Bangladeshi or Pakistani backgrounds - have for decades been more likely to have lower-paid jobs, leaving them with less money to live healthy lifestyles.\n\nBAME people are more likely to have conditions such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, PHE said, which make them more vulnerable to Covid-19. And they are more likely to work in risky jobs in which they spend time in contact with members of the public, increasing the chance of them catching the disease.\n\nData in Public Health England's first report showed that the mortality rate - the number of people dying with the coronavirus out of each 100,000 people - was considerably higher for black men than other groups. The risk for black women, people of Asian ethnicity, and mixed race people was also higher than for white people of either sex. The report warned the rate for the 'Other' category was 'likely to be an overestimate'\n\nThe report today shed more light on how ethnic minority people's interactions with the NHS may leave them with worse health.\n\nIt explained that 'hostile environments' for immigrants mean some may avoid medical care.\n\nPHE said: 'Fear of diagnosis and death from COVID-19 was identified as negatively impacting how BAME communities took up opportunities to test for COVID-19 and their likelihood of presenting early for treatment and care.\n\n'The effects of hostile environments against immigrants, particularly failed asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants, might affect settled BAME populations adversely through heightened prejudice and societal tensions.\n\n'For many BAME communities, lack of trust of NHS services and treatment resulted in their reluctance to seek care on a timely basis, again resulting in late presentation with disease.\n\n'Others were also fearful of being deported if they presented to hospital.\n\n'People in the asylum system and those with no recourse to public funds, who can often face additional barriers to accessing healthcare.'\n\nI'm sure the virus cant identify a persons religio...\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

They are a group that, you know, never gets courted. I mean, black people don't get courted either as a whole, but that old Democratic regime speaks to old black men and they think that everyone else in the black community, the black family is supposed to fall in line ... they think the rest of us all speak the same language.\n\n'So Trump is targeting young Black males. And promo ad and marketing, it works.'\n\nInfluential radio host Charlamagne Tha God has acknowledged the Trump campaign's efforts to reach young black male voters, saying the group is 'never courted' during election campaigns\n\nThe 42-year-old, whose real name is Lenard Larry McKelvey, said the Democratic Party has long targeted older black voters, mistakingly believing that all members of the black community share their concerns\n\nThe Breakfast Club host, whose real name is Lenard Larry McKelvey, had been asked about prominent black men endorsing or seeming willing to work with Trump during an appearance on CNN on Tuesday.\n\nRapper 50 Cent has indicated his support for Trump in social media posts, while his fellow actor and rapper Ice Cube has partnered with the Trump campaign on its Platinum Plan to benefit black Americans.\n\nBefore acknowledging the Trump campaigns efforts to reach young black male voters, Charlamagne said he 'didn't like' the narrative that the support of prominent black men could tip the scales in Trump's favour, saying it was problematic 'because if Trump wins, they're about to turn this into a \"Black men are the reason why Trump is in office.\"'\n\nRappers and actors 50 Cent (left) and Ice Cube (right) have shown support for Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election on November 3\n\nThe radio host has previously criticised Joe Biden's assertion that Donald Trump is America's 'first racist president', noting that 12 previous presidents had owned slaves and saying Trump was just the most 'overtly' racist\n\nDuring the interview, he told anchor Don Lemon that he himself wasn't 'necessarily voting for Joe Biden' but was interested in voting for Kamala Harris.\n\n'I believe she's a political change agent, exactly the leader this country needs to lead us in the future. If she's not, I'll just be wrong,' he said.\n\n'I'm just so tired of old white male leadership in politics.'\n\nCharlamagne has praised Democratic Vice Presidential Nominee Kamala Harris as a 'political change agent', saying he believes she is 'exactly the leader this country needs to lead us into the future'\n\nCharlamagne has criticized some of the comments Democratic candidate Joe Biden has made on race during his campaign.\n\nIn fact, Biden's now infamous comment to black voters that: 'If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black,' was made in an interview with the radio host in May.\n\nBiden later apologized for the controversial remark after a huge backlash.\n\nTwo months later, Charlamagne crowned Biden 'Donkey of the Day' for claiming Trump was America's 'first racist president.'\n\n'I really wish Joe Biden would shut the f up forever,' he said on his radio show before pointing out that 12 former presidents had owned slaves.\n\nWhile he acknowledged that Trump was more overtly racist than previous presidents, he called Biden's claim 'a lie that relinquishes America of all responsibility of its bigotry'.\n\n50 Cent: Rapper 50 Cent endorsed Donald Trump stating that Joe Biden's tax policy will turn him into '20 Cent.'\n\nThe Hip-Hop mogul, 45, sparked a social media circus when he shared an image of the super tax the Democrat candidate was proposing - 62 percent for those earning more than $400,000 in New York City, 50 Cent's home.\n\n'WHAT THE F---! (VOTE ForTRUMP) IM OUT.' 50 Cent wrote. 'I don't care Trump doesn't like black people 62% are you out of ya f---ing mind.'\n\n50 Cent later appeared to change his mind, saying: 'F*** Donald Trump, I never liked him.' After Lil Wayne's post he tweeted: 'oh no WAYNE, I WOULD HAVE NEVER TOOK THIS PICTURE.'\n\nIce Cube: The rapper confirmed that he will collaborate with the Trump Administration on a program to invest in black communities.\n\nHe defended his decision to work with Donald Trump on a plan for black Americans, insisting he is 'working with whoever is in power' and that he is 'not on nobody's team'.\n\nIce Cube hit headlines after it was revealed his organization would work with the Trump administration's Platinum Plan, which the President has held up as a program to support invest capital in black communities.\n\nHerschel Walker: The retired football great has also voiced his support for Trump.\n\nIn a recent interview, he slammed the press for not scrutinizing Joe Biden's relationship with a former Klansman-turned-senator while warning that voters should re-elect President Trump because 'Democrats do not like America.'\n\nThe former All Pro running back, who spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention this past summer, said Democrats will 'take your freedoms' if they win in November.\n\nDennis Rodman: Former NBA star Rodman has previously said that he likes Trump as a friend but has been more tight-lipped about whether he likes him as president.\n\nHe took an about turn this year, however, calling Trump for a 'Make America Great Again' tweet days after he death of black man George Floyd in police custody.\n\n'Make America Safe for minorities,' Rodman returned.\n\nMike Tyson: Trump and Tyson have had a rocky friendship and business partnerships for at least 30 years.\n\nTyson endorsed Trump for president in 2016 and is said to have played an instrumental part in securing votes.\n\nThe pair still appear to be close friends with Trump in May sending words of encouragement via Twitter after Tyson announced his plan to return to the ring.\n\n'Keep punching Mike!' he wrote.\n\nFloyd Mayweather: In November 2016 as Trump was elected, Mayweather defended his vulgar comments about women calling it 'locker room talk'.\n\n'Listen, if y'all didn't want the man in the White House, y'all should have voted the other way,' Mayweather told Hollywood Unlocked.\n\nMore recently he has tried to distance himself from the president, however, and hit back at claims that they are friends.\n\n'I don't want my name in no bulls--t,' Mayweather told TMZ in 2018. 'I'm out of it.'\n\nKanye West: While the rapper is attempting to run for the presidency himself this year, he has previously spoken out in support of Trump and worn a Make America Great Again hat as he visited the Oval Office in 2018.\n\nHe told Trump that he 'is on his hero's journey'. West told Trump, 'I love you,' as he came around to give him a hug.\n\nOn July 4, he announced that he no longer supported Trump as he launched his own presidential bid.\n\n'I am taking the red hat off, with this interview,' he told Forbes .\n\nHe also said it was wrong to assume that black people will always vote for Democrats. 'To say that the Black vote is Democratic is a form of racism and white supremacy,' he claimed.\n\nThe rapper has denied claims that he is being used by Trump to siphon black votes from the Democrats with his presidential bid this year.\n\nKentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron: The Kentucky AG has become a high-profile name this year for his role in the Breonna Taylor case.\n\nTrump also shortlisted him on his Supreme Court nominee list and he spoke at the Republican National Convention in support of the president.\n\nCameron has claimed that Trump is the 'best for this country' amid racial strife.\n\n'Whether it be economically, or whether it is related to how he fights every day for the American worker,' he told ABC News .\n\n'I appreciate the values that this party upholds and I think they've been consistent with the way that the president has conducted himself in the last four years.'\n\nShawne Merriman: The former linebacker has said that he believes Trump is misunderstood but that he has 'always been a good friend'.\n\n'He's a little bit more honest than others,' Merriman admitted.\n\nHe had been a critic of Clinton in the lead-up to the 2016 election, slamming her over the email scandal.\n\n'Moral of the story, you lose when you delete,' he tweeted after Trump's victory.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

      "text": "Police hold DNA of three in four young black men\n\nBy BEN TAYLOR\n\nLast updated at 22:00 05 November 2006\n\nThe police DNA database will soon have the profiles of three-quarters of Britain's young black men, it emerged yesterday.\n\nRace equality chiefs responded to the revelation by opening an investigation into whether ethnic minorities are being disproportionately targeted by officers.\n\nThe genetic profiles of suspects arrested by police stay on the database for life - even if no charges are ever brought against them.\n\nLatest figures suggest that 135,000 black men aged between 15 and 34 will be on the system by spring. That is equivalent to 77 per cent of the young black population of England and Wales.\n\nIn contrast, only 22 per cent of young white males and 6 per cent of the general population will be logged.\n\nTrevor Phillips, chairman of the\n\nCommission for Racial Equality, said the body would investigate whether the disparity was a breach of race relations laws.\n\n'This is tantamount to criminalising a generation of young black men,' he insisted. 'Stopandsearch statistics suggest that black males are more likely to be stopped simply because they are young black males.\n\n'The database figure is just perpetuating this stereotype and does nothing to instil confidence in a measure that seeks to serve all members of our community.\n\n'It is provocative, unfair, unjust and will do little to reduce crime.\n\nIt would be fairer to have a database that restricts itself to storing the DNA profiles of those who are convicted rather than this fast and loose approach, which opens up the potential for discrimination.'\n\nThe figures were obtained from the Home Office by Tory MP Bob Spink. Researchers told him that by next April the database will hold the DNA samples of 3.7million people. These include three million ' whiteskinned Europeans' and nearly 260,000 'Afro-Caribbeans'.\n\nSenior police chiefs maintain that the database reflects the fact that, in some parts of the country, young black men are more likely to be involved in crime than whites and Asians.\n\nThe race commission said the real problem was that the database held information on innocent citizens.\n\nBritain's DNA database is the biggest in the world and holds the genetic profiles of 750,000 children.\n\nAlso on it are the records of at least 340,000 people arrested and later cleared of any wrongdoing. A further 20,000 people, who voluntarily gave samples of DNA to help police carrying out manhunts, are also on the database.\n\nLast week one of the world's DNA pioneers, Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys, warned that the system discriminated against the innocent.\n\nAnd Tony Lake, who speaks on DNA issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers, has raised doubts about keeping the profiles of crime victims and witnesses.\n\nMr Lake, who is otherwise a staunch defender of the database, said he was 'personally uncomfortable' with this policy.\n\nLast month, however, Tony Blair suggested he could accept the idea of a system that held the DNA of every member of the population.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

      "text": "NANA AKUA: I've been stopped and searched but, like many mothers of black teenagers, I know it saves lives\n\nBy NANA AKUA\n\nPublished: 17:19 EDT, 19 June 2023 | Updated: 02:49 EDT, 20 June 2023\n\n16\n\nView comments\n\nThe first sign that anything was wrong was the flashing blue light behind our car. 'That can't be for us,' I thought. But it was.\n\nThis was in North London , years ago. I was in my 20s and on a date with a man I'd met only once before. As we pulled over, two uniformed police officers got out and approached us, one on each side.\n\nI stepped out of the car, as requested, and the policeman nearest to me started asking the strangest questions: How well did I know the driver? Where were we going? Where did I come from?\n\nAll sorts of explanations were racing in confusion through my mind. I barely knew my date, though he seemed a lovely guy.\n\nHe was driving safely, in a car that was expensive without being flashy.\n\nHe happened to be white and I, of course, am black.\n\nEven as someone who has been stopped by police, and whose racial profile may have played a part in this, I know it is the most effective tool we have in the fight against knife crime [File image]\n\nIt was only when I heard the other officer ask my date whether he knew my surname that the penny dropped.\n\nThey thought I was a hooker. Earlier, they'd seen me getting into a car and they assumed I could be a prostitute, being picked up by a customer on the street.\n\nMy jaw dropped. I was mortified. But the police were incredibly polite, even as they explained they were going to have to search us both. I don't know what they were looking for - drugs, perhaps, but maybe weapons too.\n\nAfterwards, the funny side struck me. I knew that those over-zealous officers had just given me an after-dinner story that would last me the rest of my life.\n\nBut I wouldn't have found it so easy to laugh it off if the police had not been so respectful and consistently courteous.\n\nThat story came back to me yesterday, when Suella Braverman told all 43 police forces in England and Wales that they have her 'full support to ramp up the use of stop and search, wherever necessary, to prevent violence and save more lives in communities which are disproportionately affected, such as among young black males.\n\nCarrying weapons is a scourge on our society', the Home Secretary said. 'This dangerous culture must be brought to a stop. We need to do everything in our power to crack down on this violence.'\n\nBraverman urged police to arrest and investigate anyone unlawfully obstructing a stop and search and called on forces to publish bodycam footage quickly to stop police facing 'trial by social media'.\n\nI back 'Suella the Brave', as I like to call her, to the hilt on this.\n\nI want to see stop and search used to maximum effect.\n\nEven as someone who has been stopped by police, and whose racial profile may have played a part in this, I know it is the most effective tool we have in the fight against knife crime. It has never been more important than it is now.\n\nI am not exaggerating. In the 12 months to September 2022, police recorded more than 45,000 assaults with knives and other offensive weapons across Britain. That figure is a 21 per cent increase from almost 38,000 in the previous year.\n\nI back 'Suella the Brave', as I like to call her, to the hilt on this. I want to see stop and search used to maximum effect\n\nSince 2019, 50,000 weapons have been found and confiscated through stop and search. That's 50,000 potential deadly assaults avoided.\n\nAnd the tragic truth is that black teens are disproportionately affected by knife crime.\n\nOf the 99 people aged under 25 who died in knife attacks between March 2021 and March 2022, 31 of them were black. That's nearly a third - yet black people make up only four per cent of the UK population.\n\nTake the case of 16-year-old Marques Walker, who was caught three times with a knife during searches.\n\nIn an awful indictment of our weak legal system, Walker was released on bail after the third instance, when he was found in possession of a very large zombie knife on a bus in Croydon, South London. The consequence was as tragic as it was predictable: Walker stabbed another black youth, 14-year-old Jermaine Cools, to death. Jermain was unarmed.\n\nFar from feeling any remorse, Walker recorded an ugly rap boasting about his crime.\n\nLast month, 16-year-old Renell Charles from East London became another tragic victim. In a heartbreaking twist, he had recorded a very different kind of video only a few months ago, talking about the dangers of knife crime.\n\nThere are too many teenagers walking the streets with knives, and that's a certain recipe for violence and murder.\n\nMany of those youths will say they carry weapons because they are scared, or because it's part of the gang culture that has poisoned their lives.\n\nOthers do it to defend themselves when they are peddling drugs. Some do it out of bravado, because they think it makes them look tough.\n\nWhatever their reason, the knives have to be taken away from them, for the sake of their own safety.\n\nAnd every mother of every black teenager will tell you the same thing.\n\nI have a child that age, and I have no objection if the police need to stop them and carry out a search - with one major caveat. It must be done in a respectful, polite and dignified way.\n\nSadly, I've seen why stop and search has been so controversial - particularly among ethnic minorities.\n\nJust yesterday morning, during a shopping excursion, I was stopped again.\n\nUnlike that time in my 20s, it was not so polite.\n\nSince 2019, 50,000 weapons have been found and confiscated through stop and search. That's 50,000 potential deadly assaults avoided [File image]\n\nAs I walked out of a High Street chemist, the security alarms went off. A guard demanded to know what I had in my bags, in a manner that was rude, aggressive and sarcastic. Of course, I understand shops have to crack down on theft, and the inconvenience of being stopped is the price the rest of us have to pay for the criminal intent of a few. But no one should be subjected to rudeness from the security staff.\n\nI proved I wasn't a thief and reprimanded him. Though he never apologised, I got on with my day.\n\nThat's a textbook example of how stop and search should never work, whether it's the police or a private security guard.\n\nAnd I'll also admit, the police have failed on this in the past. No right-thinking person wants to read of officers going into a school, as happened in Hackney last year, and strip-searching a 15-year-old girl.\n\nThe officers in question were suspended during an investigation, claiming they had reason to suspect she was in possession of cannabis. But that's no excuse for the appalling way the pupil was treated.\n\nThe answer is not to rein back on stop and search but to improve police training. In particular, forces including the Met should stop hiding behind the weasel phrase 'institutional racism'.\n\nThere's no such thing as a 'racist organisation' - only racist people who need to take responsibility for their own prejudices. As long as they are able to blame 'institutional racism', they will do.\n\nThere is nothing inherently racist about stop and search. I'd like to see it extended all over the country, wherever knife and drug crime is prevalent - and that means everywhere in the UK. If it saves lives, it's worth doing.\n\nAnd if you are stopped by police and searched, my advice is to treat it as my father does - as a necessary evil. He's a successful businessman, who has driven luxury cars with personalised number plates for as long as I can remember.\n\nEver so often, he tells me with a rich chuckle: 'Police stopped me again. They don't expect to see a black man driving a big Mercedes!'\n\nI swear he loves it.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nUrgent FBI warning about cruel scam suffered by thousands that leaves you with just 24 hours to save your home\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

In statements to The Wall Street Journal , the campaign said Wednesday that Harris' proposals will be open to all Americans, regardless of their race or ethnicity.\n\nHARRIS UNVEILS AGENDA TO HELP BLACK MEN 'GET AHEAD' AS POLLS SHOW TRUMP GAINS\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris arrives to speak during a campaign rally at Erie Insurance Arena, in Erie, Pa., Monday, Oct. 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nThe vice president is \"clear-eyed about how Black men have long been denied the tools that would allow them to grow their wealth, get a good-paying job and support their loved ones-she is championing solutions that will benefit all Americans and address these specific barriers to economic opportunity,\" a campaign aide told the WSJ.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.\n\nOBAMA, STUMPING FOR HARRIS, REPEATEDLY TAKES AIM AT TRUMP\n\nA person protests outside the Supreme Court in Washington, Thursday, June 29, 2023. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nThe report notes that the U.S. Supreme Court has recently shown hostility towards government programs tailored to a specific race. The court in 2023 struck down college and university affirmative action policies, which made institutions of higher learning consider race in admissions in an effort to mandate diversity on campus.\n\n\"Eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion.\n\nPRO-TRUMP BLACK GROUP FIRES BACK AT OBAMA\n\nActivist Edward Blum , founder and president of Students for Fair Admissions, has led the charge to force companies and government entities to abandon programs and policies that take race into consideration, arguing any such endeavor is discriminatory. The WSJ reported that in September, Blum settled a lawsuit with the Atlanta-based Fearless Fund, a group that promotes minority female entrepreneurs, in which the group agreed to end a grant program that awarded $20,000 to small businesses owned and operated by women of color.\n\nBlum told the Journal that he would seek to challenge the Harris administration if she delivered on programs that exclusively benefited Black men or any other racial group. \"Racially exclusive programs like the one she has proposed have been repeatedly struck down by the courts in the past,\" he said.\n\nThe Harris campaign's proposal comes as Democrats are increasingly concerned about wavering support among Black men, and in particular younger Black men, for Harris, who would make history if she is elected as the nation's first female president.\n\nHarris and Trump are locked in a neck and neck race in the seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided President Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump and will likely determine the winner of the 2024 White House race.

Obama's comments came as polls indicate former President Trump is making gains with Black men, who are traditionally some of the Democratic Party's most reliable supporters.\n\nThe Harris campaign, with just over three weeks to go until Election Day, hopes to spotlight its agenda to help Black men achieve \"the opportunity to get ahead, to thrive\" by equipping them \"with the tools to achieve financial freedom, lower costs to better provide for themselves and their families, and protect their rights.\"\n\nOBAMA, STUMPING FOR HARRIS, REPEATEDLY TAKES AIM AT TRUMP\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Harris speaks during a campaign event at East Carolina University, Oct. 13, 2024, in Greenville, N.C.

Cedric Richmond, a Harris campaign national co-chair, said the new agenda aims to make sure that \"Black men are equipped with the tools to thrive: to buy a home, provide for our families, start a business and build wealth.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump could care less about equipping hardworking Americans with the tools needed to get ahead,\" Richmond said. \"While Vice President Harris is promising to equip Black men with the tools needed to pursue our dreams and aspirations, Donald Trump is promising Black in America a national nightmare.\"\n\nRepublican presidential nominee and former President Trump is shown at a rally in Coachella, California, on Oct. 12, 2024. (REUTERS/Mike Blake)\n\nTo help spread the message, the Harris campaign said it is teaming up this week with Black male celebrities, influencers and activists in key battleground states this week for \"Black Men Huddle Up\" events. The campaign spotlights that it's also enlisting the support of influential entrepreneurs for what it calls an \"Economic Freedom Talk\" series with Black business owners.\n\nThe new effort comes as Democrats are increasingly concerned about wavering support among Black men, and in particular younger Black men, for Harris, who would make history if she is elected as the nation's first female president.\n\nHarris and Trump are locked in a neck and neck race in the seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided President Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump and will likely determine the winner of the 2024 White House race.

He bluntly said he couldn't understand why Harris wasn't enjoying the same level of enthusiasm, noting that the hesitation was \"more pronounced with the brothers.\"\n\nFormer President Obama speaks during a campaign event in support of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in Pittsburgh on Oct. 10, 2024.

(Breakfast Club Power 105.1 FM YouTube channel)\n\nBefore sitting down for the town hall conversation, which will be heard on radio stations and on-line nationwide, the vice president will stop at a local Black-owned business, where her campaign highlights that she will \"have a conversation with Detroit area Black men about how her 'Opportunity Agenda' will help equip them with the tools to achieve financial freedom, lower costs to better provide for themselves and their families, and protect their rights.\"\n\nHarris on Monday rolled out the new agenda, which aims to boost financial and career prospects for Black men.

Every one of those lives matter.\"\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), homicide is the leading cause of death in non-Hispanic Black males aged 1-44.\n\nHomicide is the cause of 35.2 percent of deaths in Black males aged 1-19, and 28.9 percent of Black males aged 20-44. The next leading cause is unintentional injuries, followed by suicide for the younger age group and heart disease for the latter.\n\nTRUMP TO 'SURGE' FEDERAL AGENTS TO CHICAGO, OTHER CITIES, AMID SPIKE IN VIOLENT CRIME\n\nAt the law and order event, President Trump, alongside Barr, announced that he is deploying 100 federal agents to Chicago to combat rising crime rates.\n\nThe \"surge,\" as Trump called it, of agents to Chicago and other American cities is part of Operation Legend -- named after 4-year-old LeGend Taliferro , who was fatally shot while sleeping in a Kansas City apartment late last month -- and comes as federal law enforcement officers have already descended on Portland, Ore., and Kansas City, Mo.\n\nWhile sending federal agents to aid local law enforcement is not unprecedented -- Barr announced a similar surge effort in December 2019 for seven cities that had seen spiking violence -- the type of federal agents being sent, and some of their tactics, have raised concerns among state and local lawmakers.\n\nAG BARR DECRIES 'LAWLESS, EVIL' ACTION AFTER SHOOTING ATTACK OF FEDERAL JUDGE'S SON, HUSBAND\n\nUsually, the Justice Department sends agents under its own umbrella, such as agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) or the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). But this surge effort will include Department of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) officers, who generally conduct drug trafficking and child exploitation investigations.\n\nA number of lawmakers from New York to Portland have spoken out against the Trump administration sending agents to their cities, especially following reports that unidentified federal agents detained protesters in Portland and took them away in unmarked vehicles. Portland has been hit with near-daily demonstrations against police brutality and racial injustice since the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody in late May.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she would not allow Trump to send in federal forces to \"terrorize\" her city, just as a mass shooting injured 15 at a funeral home in Chicago's South Side.\n\n\"Under no circumstances will I allow Donald Trump's troops to come to Chicago and terrorize our residents,\" Lightfoot had said.\n\n\"We do not welcome dictatorship,\" the mayor added in a newspaper interview.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

A lot of decisions have to be made,\" one voter told Jones. \"Me being an entrepreneur and a father and a grandfather, I'm looking at what state my children will be in ten years from now.\"\n\n\"I do think that Trump has some benefits as far as bringing and keeping our jobs right here, right here in this country, not sending another job overseas,\" he continued. \"We're already going through enough crises right here in our country, and I think the working class, we need more job security right here in this country.\"\n\nSome voters argued the race is a complete toss-up as recent polling has indicated Harris and Trump are neck-and-neck in key battleground states.\n\nVoters in a Detroit barber shop spoke with Fox News' Lawrence Jones to discuss the state of the 2024 presidential race.\n\n\"I think it's a coin flip at this time,\" one voter said. \"I really do.\"\n\n\"I think the country is so divided you wouldn't have numbers like you have if the country weren't divided between the two candidates,\" another voter said. \"It's pretty much 50/50.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Harris has tried to woo Black males specifically, as her support dwindles within the demographic.\n\nAccording to a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Saturday, Harris currently holds 78% of the Black vote, which is down from 2020, when President Biden won approximately 90% of that voting bloc. It's also down from 2016, when Hillary Clinton won approximately 92% of the Black vote. Harris' support among Black men has dropped even more significantly, according to the report: 70% said they would vote for Harris in November, down from Biden's 85% in 2020.\n\nHERSCHEL WALKER SAYS OBAMA 'FORGOT OUR FIGHT FOR RIGHT TO VOTE' AFTER SCOLDING BLACK VOTERS AGAINST HARRIS\n\nThe vice president dismissed concerns about the dismal polling earlier this week, suggesting that the trend could change in the coming weeks before the November election.\n\n\"One, that's not my experience,\" Harris said during an interview on Black-focused entertainment outlet \"The Shade Room.\" \"Two, Election Day has not arrived yet.\"\n\nJones said about half of the voters said they would support Trump and the other half would support Harris, although there were still some that were undecided.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I'm Trump because... My eyes [are] open,\" one voter said. \"I can see that he was doing a lot better than what we going through right now. You can't even go to the grocery stores right now without making a life decision or what you want to get... You got to compromise.\"\n\nTwo voters argued emotion should be taken out of the equation when deciding who to vote for.\n\n\"The problem is... We vote emotion. That's not smart,\" one voter said. \"We need to vote. We need to educate ourselves first.\"\n\nThis comes after former President Barack Obama scolded Black men on the campaign trail, bluntly saying he could not understand why Harris was not enjoying the same level of enthusiasm, noting that the hesitation was \"more pronounced with the brothers.\"\n\nHARRIS UNVEILS NEW AGENDA AS SHE COURTS BLACK MALE VOTERS\n\n\"You're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses,\" Obama said. \"I've got a problem with that.\"\n\nSpeaking directly to Black males, the former president said that \"part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"\n\nIn a bid to shore up support, Harris released her \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men\" this week, which includes providing 1 million loans that are fully forgivable to Black entrepreneurs and others to start a business, championing education, training and mentorship programs that help Black men get good-paying jobs in high-demand industries and lead their communities, including pathways to become teachers.\n\nRegardless, some voters are still torn.\n\n\"The presidency is not a person,\" one voter told Jones. \"It's an institution that should be protected... and I think we need to get back to that, understanding the position, understanding what the intended job is.\"\n\n\"It's not Kamala Harris. It's not Joe Biden. It's not Donald Trump,\" he continued. \"It's the United States of America.\"\n\nFox News' Kristine Parks, Nikolas Lanum and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.\n\nBailee Hill is an associate editor with Fox News Digital.

Who were the victims in these American cities?\n\nNew data provided by Freedom of Information Act requests and analyzed by Fox News shows Black males were overwhelmingly the No. 1 demographic killed in most cities.\n\nIn Chicago, which tallied the most homicides since 1996, 648 of the city's 797 homicide victims were Black.\n\nIn Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 105 of the city's 133 homicides were Black males. In Columbus, Ohio, 135 of the city's 204 homicides were of Black males. In Louisville, Kentucky, 133 of the city's 197 homicide victims were Black males. In St. Paul, Minnesota, 17 of the city's 38 homicides were of Black males.\n\nIn Los Angeles, 397 people were killed in 2021 - the most in a year since 2007. Hispanic males were the top demographic killed in L.A. last year, 183 in total, in a city that has a much larger Hispanic than Black population.\n\nCortlyn Bridges of Monrovia, California, sat down with Fox News to talk about the loss of her 28-year-old daughter, Ky Thomas, who was shot and killed in December 2020 after a sunset scooter ride on the Venice Beach boardwalk.\n\n\"It's an undescribable pain. It's a piercing pain that I don't think any mother should have to experience,\" Bridges told Fox News.\n\nBridges said Ky had an 8-year-old daughter and had just given birth to a son weeks before her murder.  Ky and her husband were returning rented scooters to the rental shop when something went awry, and Ky was shot.\n\n\"My daughter was not a gang member,\" Bridges said, \"under no circumstances.\"\n\nBridges said her entire family, the alleged killer's families and the community all have been bearing the pain of Ky's murder.\n\n\"We all lose out. Nobody wins. My daughter, she's never coming back,\" Bridges said. \"Their parents, their families, the only difference is, they can still get phone calls. They can get visits. They can get letters. My daughter, she can never call me.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA CHILDREN ROBBED OF IPHONES ON THEIR WAY TO SCHOOL\n\nLos Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón's office recently announced the arrest of two suspects in Ky Thomas' death. Isiah Eugene Caldwell Jr., 28, and Jonathan Michael Singh, 30. Both faced one count each of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nLos Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon in December 2021. (Robyn Beck / AFP, File)\n\nGascón now has been asking the public for help arresting additional suspects involved and wrote in a statement, \"My deepest condolences go out to the friends and family of Ky Thomas and my heart breaks for her small children and her mother who has fought so diligently for justice.\"\n\nThere is progress in Bridges' case - but Gascón and many other district attorneys have been under fire for what critics have called \"soft on crime\" policies contributing to the nation's spike in homicides.\n\nFox News spoke to Eric Siddall, a prosecutor in Gascón's office and vice president of the Association for Deputy District Attorneys in Los Angeles. Siddall is a registered Democrat and calls himself a socially \"liberal,\" but he said he blames Gascón's policies for L.A.'s homicide and crime spike.\n\n\"One of the big drivers of crime in Los Angeles are guns and gangs and right now, this district attorney has basically said we cannot prosecute people for gang crimes and is not interested in prosecuting people for gun crimes, and that has really led to this surge in homicides,\" Siddall said.\n\nCHICAGO MAYOR SPEAKS ON CARJACKING 'CRISIS'\n\nHe added that similar policies nationwide have affected people of color - primarily Black men.\n\nLos Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon at a December news conference in California. (Robyn Beck / AFP, File)\n\n\"Right now, the system, especially certain types of district attorneys, are siding with the criminal over the victim,\" Siddall said.\n\nFox News reached out to Gascón's office for comment about this case but did not hear back. At a news conference touting his accomplishments this past December, Gascón explained his philosophy of prosecuting L.A.'s crime, saying a \"punishment-based\" approach did not serve L.A. well.\n\n\"I have begun to transform the criminal legal system in ways that holds people accountable while serving the residents of Los Angeles County with fairness and humanity,\" Gascón said.\n\nBridges said she forgave her daughter's killers, but was concerned any additional suspects in the case could be tried as juveniles and face a minimum sentence for her daughter's murder.\n\n\"This crime is horrible and there's no accountability. The judicial system is failing our children,\" Bridges said. \"I have peace because I know where my daughter's soul is. I have peace because I know the kind of person she is. And, I have peace because I can forgive.\"\n\nMatt Finn currently serves as a Los Angeles based correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nStarting July 24, the Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys will host its latest summit in Washington, D.C., sharing a status report on the progress of Black males in America (or lack thereof). I will be there myself, joining members of Congress and other U.S. policymakers to assess the current state of race relations.\n\nThose expecting good news will be kept waiting. In President Joe Biden's America, the status quo for Black males is untenable. Across the country, Black men and boys are falling behind because their politicians are failing them. From portraying Black males as victims to ignoring the root causes of their struggles, Democrats like Biden are only turning their backs on the very people they claim to support.\n\nHere's a progress report for you: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a Black male aged 10 to 43 is 13 times more likely to be murdered than a White man in the same demographic. Over Father's Day weekend last month, 75 people were shot in Chicago, Illinois, 13 of them fatally - in a single weekend. Chicago and other Democrat-run cities have essentially turned into war zones.\n\nEX-DEMOCRAT TURNED REPUBLICAN BLAMES FORMER PARTY FOR FAILING SCHOOLS, HIGH CRIME IN HER COMMUNITY\n\nNew research shows that 38% of the people in prison are Black, despite making up barely 14% of the U.S. population. The problem isn't \"systemic racism,\" as Democrats so quickly claim. (After all, there are significantly more White Americans in prison.) The problem is fatherlessness, and it has been that way for decades.\n\nThe Black community is suffering through a crisis of fatherlessness. (iStock)\n\nAmerica is suffering through an epidemic of fatherlessness. It is our nation's top domestic problem, given the residual consequences such as crime. While a lack of fathers can afflict all American households, including White households, it is a particularly severe phenomenon in the Black community.\n\nNearly 70% of Black kids begin their lives in households with unmarried mothers. In 1965, the percentage of Black kids born out of wedlock was 25%, a number considered so alarming at the time that it prompted then-Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan to publish his now-controversial report: \"The Negro Family: The Case for National Action.\" (Today, the percentage of White children born out of wedlock is nearly 30%.)\n\nAnd where is the talk of family in modern culture? Crickets from Hollywood, Big Tech, and the liberal media.\n\nWith no role models, many Black children are growing up to become violent criminals, wreaking havoc, and ruining lives - including their own. Under Biden's \"leadership,\" people are losing their lives in broad daylight. Last year, my hometown of Los Angeles experienced an 11% increase in crime. In my old neighborhood, violent crime is roughly 1,700% higher than the national average.\n\nIn our nation's capital, carjackings have risen for their fifth straight year, more than tripling between 2019 and 2022. The D.C. police encounters over one carjacking per day on average, and there aren't enough police officers to stop it.\n\nThe common denominator is inept, ineffective leadership, primarily from Democrats who control most American cities. Of the 30 U.S. cities with the highest violent crime rates, the overwhelming majority are run by Democrats who care so much about affirmative action, reparations, and \"critical race theory\" that they refuse to be critical of the criminals making their streets less safe.\n\nGet this: Because of record car thefts in Baltimore, the city's left-wing politicians - rather than catching and holding car thieves responsible - have sued car manufacturers like Hyundai and Kia, accusing them of manufacturing cars that are too easy to steal. That's not a joke.\n\nIn the process of making victims out of Black people and pimping them for votes, Democrats are turning their backs on those most affected by crime in Black communities: Black people themselves.\n\n\"Woke\" district attorneys - funded by left-wing billionaire George Soros - only make the problem worse, emptying jail cells and keeping criminals on the streets.\n\nTake New York City, where District Attorney Alvin Bragg - one of America's worst Soros DAs - ordered his prosecutors to stop seeking prison sentences for violent offenders and to downgrade felony charges, even for drug dealers and armed robbers .\n\nI'm supporting model legislation called the \"Enforce the Law Act\" that would allow states to remove these DAs who refuse to do their jobs.\n\nMuch to his credit, Donald Trump supported the bipartisan Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys, amplifying a much-needed conversation on U.S. race relations. He understood the power of leadership - the only viable solution to America's top domestic problem.\n\nGet this: Because of record car thefts in Baltimore, the city's left-wing politicians - rather than catching and holding car thieves responsible - have sued car manufacturers like Hyundai and Kia, accusing them of manufacturing cars that are too easy to steal. That's not a joke.\n\nAnd, since its beginning, the Commission's vision hasn't changed: To lead \"a national discussion to address the complexity and nuances of the varying conditions affecting Black males in the history of America's cultural landscape.\"\n\nIgnoring the 10,000-pound elephant in the room - fatherlessness and crime - is a betrayal of that vision. Blaming \"white supremacy,\" as Biden so often does, does nothing to address the millions of kids - and not just Black kids - entering the world without a father in the home married to a mother.\n\nThat attitude only does a disservice to the parents and children who ultimately suffer the consequences.\n\nOn race, America's current status report is \"failure.\" Joe Biden receives a failing grade. Our only chance for an \"A\" is a change of leadership come 2024.\n\nLarry Elder is a bestselling author and nationally syndicated radio talk show host.

      "text": "'Who Does This F*cking Lady Think She Is?': Teamsters Boss Reveals To Tucker How Harris Turned Her Back On The Union\n\nTeamsters President Sean O'Brien told Daily Caller News Foundation co-founder Tucker Carlson during a podcast Monday how Vice President Kamala Harris turned her back on the union, before the group decided against endorsing a candidate for president.\n\nIn September, the Teamsters, one of the largest labor unions in the United States, announced they would not endorse a candidate, marking the first time since 1996 that the group had not supported a presidential contender. On \"The Tucker Carlson Show,\" O'Brien told Carlson that after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, Harris had met with one of the union's executive board members at an event.\n\n\"They're going through the line to get the picture, and Joan introduces herself to Vice President Harris [and] says, 'I'm Joan Corey. I'm on the general executive board for the Teamsters.' She [Harris] goes, 'Teamsters? You better get on board. Better get on board soon.' Says it to my vice president,\" O'Brien said.\n\n\"To her face?\" Carlson asked. \"Damn, I thought I was arrogant. That's really arrogant!\"\n\nO'Brien continued, saying that he then called former Democratic U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh to relay Harris ' reaction, warning about her tone toward the union.\n\n\"So she comes back. We have the meeting the next day,\" O'Brien said. \"She tells me this. So I call up Marty Walsh - he wasn't the secretary of Labor, but, you know, he was pushing hard for us to make the endorsement. I'm like, 'Let me ask you a question, Marty. Excuse my French. Who does this fucking lady think she is?' If I want support from any organization I am not gonna point my finger in someone's face and say, 'You better get on board or else.' But that's the attitude of this whole party.\"\n\nHarris only agreed to that interview after the group had pressured her, O'Brien told Carlson. O'Brien had earlier conducted media interviews saying that the Democrats hadn't invited the labor union to their convention and that Harris hadn't accepted the roundtable discussion.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"So she comes to the roundtable. Same format, same questions - rank-and-file members are asking her questions just like they asked every other candidate. They were trying to negotiate with us. She only wants to answer three questions. We're like 'There's 16 questions here.' She answers three of them and on the fourth question one of her operatives or one of her staff slips a note in front of me: 'This will be the last question.' And it was 20 minutes earlier than the time that it was gonna end,\" O'Brien added. \"So, you know, you're there trying to get our support and her declaration on the way out was, 'I'm gonna win with you or without you.'\"\n\nDespite the labor union's tendency to support Democratic candidates, O'Brien had spoken at the Republican National Convention in July, where he said the group is \"not beholden to anyone or any party.\" In September two major internal polls were released by the group, showing 59.6% of rank-and-file members electronically submitted their vote in favor of having the group endorse Trump for president, while just 31% threw their support behind Harris. Similarly, in a research phone poll, 58% supported Trump, with 31% favoring Harris, 6% undecided and 5% claiming they \"don't know.\"\n\nWhile Carlson described Harris' behavior as \"crazy,\" O'Brien said that Biden and Harris were unwilling to talk to the media following their meeting with members, which was in stark contrast to how Trump behaved.\n\n\"The one difference between all the candidates that came was that at the conclusion of all these roundtables we had the media set up. So after [the] conclusion of [the] meeting with Trump, I did a press conference down in the lobby of my building. Well, Donald Trump did a press conference down in the lobby of my building after he spoke. The same offer was extended to both President Biden and Vice President Harris, and they refused,\" O'Brien said.\n\n\"So you're meeting with the biggest labor organization that you want and you've got an opportunity for media to question you about how you felt the meeting went and what you wanted to achieve and you don't want to speak to the media? That's a problem. But Trump, to his credit, in our building, in our foyer, had a press conference.\"\n\nDuring Harris' campaign, the vice president was consistently called out for her lack of in-depth conversations with the media, as well as giving vague responses when she did sit down with the press. Despite her attempts and use of surrogates to appeal to voters, Harris lost favor among key Democratic voting blocs such as Hispanic and black males.\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screenshot/X/\"The Tucker Carlson Show\")\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Lawyer for NYC 'Karen' Announces Big Plans for Media That Wronged Her\n\nSarah Comrie went viral when a video showed her arguing with a group of black teens over a bike in New York City, and she was instantly labeled a \"Karen\" and white supremacist. But now she is prepared to file defamation lawsuits against the media that labeled her. (@herandrews / Twitter screen shot)\n\nThe pregnant nurse accused of trying to steal a bike from a black man has announced plans to sue every media outlet who falsely misrepresented the incident.\n\nA video recently went viral, showing Sarah Comrie cry out for help as a group of young men claimed she was trying to steal their bike .\n\nThe video, taken on May 12, began by showing Comrie shouting, \"Help! Help me! Please help me!\" as a young black man grabs the bike and tells her, \"This is not your bike,\" and another says \"It's his. It's his.\"\n\n\"Get off me,\" Comrie repeatedly said to the man holding onto the bike. \"You're hurting my fetus. You're hurting my unborn child ,\" she said, to which the man replied: \"I'm not touching you. You're putting your stomach on my hand.\"\n\nAt one point she began crying as she asks a nearby man for help. \"You are acting. Stop fake crying,\" the man recording told her.\n\nThe video ended with Comrie getting off of the bike and looking down at her phone, likely to pay for another bike.\n\nWhen the video of the incident was posted online, Comrie was instantly painted as a \" Karen \" and white supremacist.\n\nThe rhetoric also went beyond just a few small media outlets, with even famous civil rights attorney Ben Crump sharing the video and saying: \"This is unacceptable! A white woman was caught on camera attempting to STEAL a Citi Bike from a young Black man in NYC.\"\n\n\"She grossly tried to weaponize her tears to paint this man as a threat,\" he claimed in the now-deleted tweet. \"This is EXACTLY the type of behavior that has endangered so many Black men in the past!\"\n\nBen Crump and the rest are trying to delete the evidence. This tweet is now gone. LOL pic.twitter.com/7mlkPczsaW\n\n- Nate The Lawyer (@NatetheLawyer) May 20, 2023\n\nOne news outlet went so far as to compare Comrie to Carolyn Bryant Donham - the woman largely responsible for the 1955 lynching of Emmett Till .\n\nSarah Jane Comrie, the \"Citi Bike Karen\" who fake cried for help from a group of young Black men, reminds us Carolyn Bryant Donham, who accused Emmett Till and got him lynched. https://t.co/32ixN1q4h1\n\n- NewsOne (@newsone) May 16, 2023\n\nComrie's attorney, Justin Marino, has since provided receipts showing that the bike in question was indeed actually purchased by Comrie.\n\nMarino appeared on \"America's Newsroom\" on Friday, where he explained how Comrie, a 6-month pregnant physician's assistant, had just gotten off a 12-hour shift and was trying to go home when the group of young men stopped her.\n\n\"She went to a vacant bike where no one was touching, no one was on. She mounted the bike, she paid for the bike. She ended up actually pulling back off the docking station, and then around that time these individuals were claiming that was their bike,\" he told Fox anchor Bill Hemmer , according to Mediaite .\n\n\"Someone pushed the bike while she was on it back into the docking station, so it locked again, and that's where the rest of the video picks up.\"\n\nWhile many have questioned who was the true purchaser of the bike, Marino said the receipts \"show she rented the bike.\"\n\n\"The serial numbers match, so there's no question that the bike that she is on in that video is a bike that she reserved.\"\n\nSo many people have no common sense and no ability to detect bullshit. Did you actually believe that a pregnant white lady randomly picked a fight with a group of black males? How could that have ever seemed like the most plausible explanation? How stupid do you have to be\n\n- Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) May 18, 2023\n\nIf she has receipts proving the bike was hers, then what actually happened was a bunch of youths ganged up to harass a 6 months pregnant woman-as you might have guessed from the beginning, if you actually watched the video and heard them laughing at her. https://t.co/KpdbL8tto3\n\n- Helen Andrews (@herandrews) May 18, 2023\n\nHe also noted that the reason Comrie sought an attorney was because she was afraid of losing her job, after having been placed on leave by her employer, pending their own review into the \"disturbing\" incident.\n\n\"We are aware of the video involving a health care provider off duty and away from the hospital campus. The incident in the video is disturbing. The provider is currently out on leave and will remain on leave pending review,\" NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue said in a statement posted on Twitter. \"As a health system, we are committed to providing an environment for our patients and staff that is free from discrimination of any kind.\"\n\npic.twitter.com/a0Rs3h010i\n\n- NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue (@BellevueHosp) May 16, 2023\n\nBut according to Marino, \"Race had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"There's a reason defamation laws exist, and we plan to pursue them,\" he said, according to Mediaite.\n\nThe target of their lawsuit, he said, is \"Every organization that referred to her as a Karen, a racist, and a thief.\"\n\n\"We're looking to right a wrong. We're doing that here through the public, letting them know what happened, but we're doing it through the court system as well so these institutions are going to think twice before they try to ruin someone's life,\" Marino said.\n\nHe also spoke of death threats against Comrie in a separate interview.\n\n\"She's been threatened. People have been outside the house. She's had someone send her a picture of her front door, saying, 'I'm here for you,'\" he said, according to CBS News .\n\nHe also clarified that they aren't targeting the young men in the video, only \"the media who defamed her,\" according to Mediaite\n\n\"We have no ill will towards these young men. And in fact, we wish them the best,\" he said.\n\nA GoFundMe was set up by Comrie's uncle and has since raised close to $100,000 to pay for her legal bills.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal .\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

      "text": "Teen Who Says He Knew Shooter Shares Disturbing Details He Says No One Is Reporting\n\nA student at Uvalde High School in Texas who says he knew Salvador Ramos rejected the prevailing media narrative that the gunman was the victim of bullying, and this was the catalyst for his May 24 mass shooting at Robb Elementary School.\n\nIvan Arellano, a senior at Uvalde High School, told WFAA-TV in Dallas that Ramos \"was not a good person\" and had been a bully himself.\n\n\"Salvador Ramos was a boy who was not bullied,\" Arellano said on Wednesday. \"He would try to pick on people but fail, and it would aggravate him.\"\n\n[firefly_embed]\n\n[/firefly_embed]\n\nRamos was shot to death by a Border Patrol agent after his shooting rampage at Robb Elementary School, which left 19 children and two adults dead.\n\nShortly before the attack, the 18-year-old gunman shot his grandmother in her home. Celia Martinez Gonzales , 66, was reported to be in stable condition at a San Antonio hospital.\n\nArellano, who was friends with one of the victims, wanted to set the record straight because he had not seen any media coverage spotlighting Ramos' cruel personality.\n\n\"I don't see this covered and I'm going to put this out there: He would hurt animals. He was not a good person,\" he said.\n\nArellano's statements belie the initial media coverage of Ramos as a victim who was subjected to gay slurs and bullied over his lisp.\n\nSo do the observations of 17-year-old Crystal Foutz, who attended school with Ramos and worked with him at the fast-food restaurant Whataburger.\n\n\"He always seemed to take his anger out on the most innocent person in the room,\" Foutz told KTBC-TV in Austin.\n\nOur understanding of people and events generally morphs as the dust settles after a horrific crime like this shooting and research unearths more about the perpetrator's background.\n\nHowever, one thing is already clear: The school system and his own family failed Ramos, who should have been red-flagged over his threatening, anti-social behavior, which included self-mutilation , animal abuse and shooting people with BB guns.\n\nAmerican culture is cratering at a chilling pace, fueled in large part by toxic left-wing policies that marginalize nuclear families, decimate the working class and demonize hard work and meritocracy.\n\nOur schools have devolved into mindless incubators of destructive leftist propaganda that lionizes victimhood, socialism, transgenderism and mediocrity .\n\nIs it any wonder that American children lag behind their international peers academically and report increasing depression and hopelessness?\n\nDaily shootings and escalating violence in Democrat-run cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Atlanta are the symptoms of a failed system and a flailing culture.\n\nWhere's the outrage over these crimes?\n\nWar on Police !\n\nCHP officer ambushed in random attack by two suspects in East LA https://t.co/12qaCv9kto\n\n- Make L.A Great Again ?? - RECALL GEORGE GASCON (@lalovestrump) May 25, 2022\n\nTen people were shot, two killed, in a shooting outside a McDonald's on the North Side of Chicago.

      "text": "Racist Transgender Arrested By FBI After Threatening To Kill 'Transphobes' And Minority Groups\n\nOAN's Brooke Mallory 1:32 PM - Thursday, January 18, 2024\n\nA biological man who identifies as a transgender woman was placed in custody last week by FBI agents after expressing hatred and anger towards \"transphobes\" and certain minority groups while posting pictures of a wide range of firearms online.\n\nElizabeth West, 56, of Cottage Grove, was arrested by FBI agents last week in Oregon following their review of a plethora of social media posts from West that featured images of weapons and other images of West holding firearms while making threats towards \"transphobes\" and racial groups in captions, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nWest purportedly received diagnoses for PTSD, dissociative disorder, and bipolar disorder during prior hospitalizations.\n\nWest's September Facebook threats and the 56-year-old's arsenal of firearms, which West refused to give up willingly, made FBI special agent Damara Gonzalez label the individual \"an interstate threat.\"\n\n🚨 #BREAKING : The FBI has Arrested Transgender Woman Plotting Violence Against Jews, Black People, and Allegedly Targeting Transphobic Co-workers with Nazi Imagery and Stockpile of Guns and Ammunition00📌 #CottageGrove | #Oregon The FBI has arrested a 56-year-old transgender... pic.twitter.com/73mHn8VZfa\n\nThe FBI first received information about West on September 26 th , 2023, when agents in Eugene, Oregon, learned that West was posting disturbing content online in a Facebook (Meta) group called the \"Trans Woman Support Group.\" Some of the posts included two firearms with threatening, racist captions. West also expressed in another post that \"she\" had endured bullying by people who were \"transphobic.\"\n\nAccording to the website transactual.org.uk, \"The core value underlying all transphobia is a rejection of trans identity and a refusal to acknowledge that it could possibly be real or valid.\" Meanwhile, Webmd.com says, \"Transphobia describes someone who has hate, fear, or disgust for transgender people or anyone who does not fit into the male/female gender binary.\"\n\n\"Well, I wish I had better news to tell but what I'm writing to you right now is the fact that I'm at the end of my rope I'm probably gonna get fired from this job...I'm too old to keep looking for jobs and I've had it up to here being bullied by trans phobic a**holes, I am left with no alternative. I'll probably have to go out in a blaze of glory. I've been preparing for this moment a long time at least then I'll be remember I have no family no friends,\" one of West's Facebook posts stated.\n\nThe criminal complaint breaks down how, despite discovering many social media posts by West that displayed various firearms and an indicated interest in extremist ideals, such as Nazism, which is occasionally termed \"National Socialism,\" authorities still refrained from taking West into custody until last week.\n\nAdditionally, West had posted images of what looked to be a bedroom filled with Nazi flags and different White Supremacist flags as well.\n\nAccording to an insider source who spoke with the press as well as investigators, West would go to neo-Nazi demonstrations and events with his boyfriend in his previous homosexual relationship before transitioning.\n\nWest's arrest also occurs in the midst of a national discussion surrounding a rise in non-binary and transgender individuals coming into the criminal spotlight, such as Audrey Elizabeth Hale, a 28-year-old transgender mass shooter and domestic terrorist who killed six people, both children and adults, at Tennessee's Covenant Christian private school.\n\nThe Colorado Springs shooter identified as non binary. The Denver shooter identified as trans. The Aberdeen shooter identified as trans. The Nashville shooter identified as trans. One thing is VERY clear: the modern trans movement is radicalizing activists into terrorists.\n\nHowever, the majority of U.S. Democrat officials, especially President Joe Biden, have turned their attention away from these acts of violence, specifically since the perpetrators are \"gender-non-conforming individuals,\" and members of a protected class. After the devastating mass shooting at the Covenant Christian private school, Biden posted a tweet that expressed how transgenders are treated poorly in this country and that they consistently face discrimination, completely disregarding the Christian children and adults whose lives were taken by the hateful, mentally disturbed 28-year-old.\n\n\"My Administration ended the ban on transgender Americans serving our country and I signed historic executive action to strengthen civil rights protections for all LGBTQI+ Americans,\" Biden said in a November statement.\n\nIn regards to West's Facebook posts, the 56-year-old said \"I got upset and jealous\" after speaking to another trans woman online from Oregon who \"had gender reassignment surgery and didn't have to pay anything out-of-pocket for it.\" This was said during West's interview with the FBI.\n\nAfter West created a profile on X (Twitter), the trans online sleuth posted even more concerning statements on social media.\n\nWest's X (Twitter) account bio stated at one point that the gender-dysphoric individual is \"a Nazi dominatrix from Hell, who is tired of the blackening of America and Europe and ready to stand up to the Black orcs and the Jewish wizards.\"\n\nLater, West also admitted to FBI agents that their particular \"hatred of Blacks\" was prompted by an alleged 1990 attack by three Black males, as well as another claim where West said that \"Black customers\" have a propensity to \"purposefully misgender me,\" adding fuel to the fire. West's pro-Palestinian sentiments appear to have reinforced the transgender's animosity against Israel and Jews in general.\n\n\"From November 27 through December 15, 2023, agents frequented West's page as it was available to the public. Agents observed that West posted and reposted multiple memes, videos and statements that contained violence toward Black and Jewish people and immigrants, images of weapons owned, idolizing of Hitler and the Nazi flag, and a live-streamed video of the Christchurch Mosque shooting in New Zealand,\" the complaint states.\n\nIn one photo caption, West wrote, \"Bring it on, blackie,\" in a post on November 24 th that featured more attached pictures of firearms.\n\n\"On December 5, 2023, West uploaded a picture depicting a shotgun, an assault rifle, two handguns and an AK-47 with a white and green camouflaged body. The comment on the picture states 'don't forget White women,'\" the complaint continued.\n\nFBI investigators purportedly made many attempts to communicate with West, but the calls were never returned. In early January, West also \"acknowledged\" a deep hatred for \"Jews, African Americans, and immigrants\" and that \"she\" owns many different firearms, according to the FBI.\n\n\"Upon searching West's residence, the same day, agents seized approximately 11 handguns and 16 rifles, tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, firearm accessories, a black book that matched the description of West's \"black shadow\" journal, 48 drawings, and a black and white composition notebook containing notes made by West,\" the complaint states.\n\nAfter being taken into custody, West was shockingly registered as a female prisoner at the Lane County Jail.\n\nOregon Live News reported that West has not yet made an appearance in court.\n\nThis is a developing story.

They demanded that the two give up their belongings, or risk being shot and killed.\n\nFollowing the initial robbery, the thieves then crossed the street to rob two more victims before taking off in their vehicle.\n\nThe two unidentified criminals have been connected to a string of robberies in the city and they have been described as \"two Black males dressed in all black with ski masks, armed with a semi-automatic handgun.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Chicago police issued a community alert regarding the robberies. Authorities urged citizens to contact city detectives if they have any information which could lead to either of their arrests.\n\nViolent crime has become an expected occurrence in Chicago, as the city was named \"the murder capital\" of the U.S. in 2023. This year, there have been almost 1,400 shooting incidents in addition to 344 murders.\n\nOver the weekend, there were 26 shooting incidents in the city, including 30 victims and 5 deaths.\n\nStay informed!

Luke Wood told student paper the Daily Aztec , \"[Educators] are not overtly white supremacists but they harbor perceptions of black males that are informed by what they have seen in wider society through the media, news, in books and in film. They engage black males from a point of stereotypes, microaggressions, and bias.\"\n\nHis course, \"Black Minds Matter: A Focus on Black Boys and Men in Education,\" will tell future educators to use the classroom as a place of \"civil resistance against racism\" and to develop new pedagogical practices inspired by the \"intentional application Black Lives Matter principles of loving engagement, restorative justice, and collective value.\"\n\nWood told the Daily Aztec that black men and boys are either perceived as academically inferior or \"criminalized\" in the classroom. Subsequently, he said, the demographic is \"exposed to exclusionary discipline or put in special education as a dumping ground for them, which really only does one thing well, and it's to socialize people to go into the prison-industrial complex.\"\n\nJ. Luke Wood wrote in an email to the Washington Free Beacon , \"I would like to note that the quote 'nearly all educators are racist' was significantly decontextualized. The quote derived from a conversation about institutional racism. Noting that as individuals within systems that are racist that we are therefore influenced by those systems. I believe that the vast majority of educators are good people who want to do the right thing but fail to do so because they are influenced by these systems.\"\n\nThe course will feature speakers like Black Life Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors and Ilyasah Shabazz, the activist daughter of Malcolm X. It will be taught in person to approximately 30 students and available via livestream for some 10,000 participants.\n\nThe course has garnered criticism from the campus community and beyond.\n\nBrandon Jones, president of the SDSU College Republicans, has called on the university to \"distance itself\" from the course.\n\n\"Taxpayer money must not be used to fund political campaigns of any kind, especially those associated with Black Lives Matter,\" he said, adding that the class will \"teach students to become victims instead of preparing them to become contributing members of society.\"\n\nCraig DeLuz, a trustee of the Robla Elementary School District and legislative advocate for the Fredrick Douglass Foundation, has been pressuring the school to cancel the course before its scheduled Oct. 23 start sate.\n\nDeLuz, who is black, has said he is primarily concerned by the association with Black Lives Matter, a \"movement whose members have promoted segregation and violence against law enforcement.\"\n\nWood, who in addition to teaching at SDSU's education college serves as director of the school's joint doctoral education program with Claremont College, said he \"anticipated that there would be some people who were not happy with the course, because whenever you speak love into a system of hate, there is a visceral reaction.\"\n\nUpdate 12:10 p.m.: This post has been updated with comment from J.

      "text": "'A Mockery Of Education': Dean of Michigan State's Top-Ranked Ed School Is a Serial Plagiarist, Complaint Alleges\n\nThe dean of Michigan State University's College of Education, Jerlando Jackson, plagiarized extensively over the course of his career, according to a complaint filed with the university on Thursday, lifting text without attribution and raising questions about his fitness to lead one of the top teacher training programs in the country.\n\nThe complaint includes nearly 40 examples of plagiarism that span nine of Jackson's papers, including his Ph.D. thesis, and range from single sentences to full pages. It adds to the allegations of research misconduct already facing the embattled dean, who was a coauthor on several papers implicated in complaints against diversity officials earlier this year, including Harvard University's chief diversity officer, Sherri Ann Charleston.\n\n\"Jackson has failed all ordinary standards of academic honesty,\" said Peter Wood, the head of the National Association of Scholars and a former provost at Boston University, where he helped lead plagiarism investigations of faculty and alumni. \"As long as he remains as a dean, the university has no legitimate basis to hold students and faculty to basic standards of intellectual integrity.\"\n\nMichigan State University defines plagiarism as \"copying another person's text or ideas and passing the copied material as your own.\" And Jackson-who can expel students for \"academic misconduct,\" per the university's handbook -has a decades-long record of doing just that.\n\nIn a 2002 paper, for example, he lifts pages of material from Lorraine McDonnell, a political scientist at UC Santa Barbara, and Richard Elmore, a professor at Harvard's Graduate School of Education, without attribution, keeping the order of their sentences while swapping out synonyms and details.\n\nHe does the same thing to Gary Orfield, a professor of law at UCLA, in a 2003 paper. None of those scholars appear in the bibliography of either article.\n\nThe complaint raises serious questions about the academic standards at one of the top education schools in the nation, which has topped the U.S. News & World Report rankings of K-12 teacher education for 30 years straight-an achievement Jackson celebrated in an April press release .\n\n\"We always innovate and engage in high‐quality research,\" he wrote. \"We work with and for our local, national and global communities to create meaningful change for learners of today and tomorrow.\"\n\nThe allegations against Jackson come as teachers are confronting a wave of AI-generated plagiarism in student writing. Demand for AI detection tools has surged since the release of ChatGPT, according to data from the Center for Democracy and Technology, jumping by 30 percentage points in just one year and corresponding to an increase in student discipline.\n\nThat context makes the allegations all the more galling, said Steve McGuire, a fellow at the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, given that graduates of Jackson's program will inherit a plagiarism crisis with no precedent in modern memory.\n\n\"It makes a mockery of the whole enterprise of education to have someone who appears to be a serial plagiarist running a school of education, especially in an age in which teachers and professors are increasingly encountering extensive academic dishonesty facilitated by the rise of artificial intelligence,\" McGuire wrote in an email. \"How can educators combat this very real crisis if students can point to academic leaders and accuse them of plagiarism too?\"\n\nJackson and Michigan State University did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThursday's complaint follows a string of plagiarism allegations against prominent university officials, including former Harvard president Claudine Gay and University of Maryland president Darryll Pines . Other allegations have targeted diversity deans at Harvard , Columbia , and UCLA .\n\nUnlike most of those officials, however, Jackson has direct oversight of both academic programs and student discipline. And he is not just an administrator but a scholar-with hundreds of papers under his belt and grants from the National Science Foundation-albeit one who studies diversity programs for a living.\n\nBefore arriving at Michigan State in 2022, Jackson led the department of Education Leadership and Policy Analysis at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. There he founded the Equity and Inclusion Laboratory, which conducts research on \"equitable and inclusive learning,\" and the International Colloquium on Black Males in Education.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2020, he also produced 75 percent of the research \"exclusively on African American/Black individuals in computing,\" according to his bio on Michigan State's website. It is not clear how that statistic was derived.\n\nAt Wisconsin, Jackson met Sherri and LaVar Charleston-now the top diversity officials at Harvard and UW-Madison, respectively-and coauthored several papers with them, two of which contained survey results that they had already published in other journals.\n\nNeither paper acknowledged that its findings had been published elsewhere, a form of academic dishonesty known as duplicate publication. Sometimes considered a form of self-plagiarism, duplicate publication often leads to retractions and can even violate copyright law. Jackson was the most senior scholar on both papers, which were also accused of plagiarizing other authors.\n\nThursday's complaint reiterates those allegations and adds 27 new ones that have not been previously reported, painting the most comprehensive picture to date of Jackson's academic transgressions. It runs 68 pages, single-spaced.\n\n\"No professor who takes plagiarism seriously would accept this kind of work from an undergraduate student, let alone a dean,\" said McGuire, who previously taught political theory at Villanova University.  \"It is galling to see that someone who appears to have repeatedly made such liberal use of the work of others without giving them proper credit has risen through the ranks of the academy to become the dean of a college that is responsible for educating future teachers.\"\n\nMany of the new allegations center on Jackson's doctoral dissertation, submitted to the University of Iowa in 2000, which borrows liberally from Henry Mintzberg, a professor of management at McGill University.\n\nThe complaint describes over a dozen cases in which Jackson quotes or paraphrases Mintzberg without attribution, at times changing the subject of the passage while retaining its structure.\n\nSome of those examples also come from a 2003 paper Jackson coauthored with Walter Gmelch-the dean of the School of Education at the University of San Francisco-which says it is using Mintzberg's \"parameters\" but copies large portions of his work without footnotes or quotation marks.\n\nWhile attribution is not always expected for methodological jargon in the social sciences, the passages from Mintzberg do not describe technical methods.\n\n\"This is very simple content,\" Wood said, \"which makes me wonder why he would need the crutch of plagiarism to walk through it.\"\n\nReached for comment, Mintzberg sent the Washington Free Beacon a garbled email in which he waffled about whether Jackson had plagiarized his work, adding that there was \"an awful lot to go through.\"\n\n\"A lot of it is clearly not plagiarism, but coming to the same conclusions,\" Mintzberg wrote. \"I don't know what he references of my work, but there are places where he could have. There may be some passages that are close, and should've been quoted; I'll leave you to list what those are. Overall, this does not look to me to be a blatant example of plagiarism, certainly not much that you have highlighted.\"\n\nMintzberg added: \"You do not have my permission to quote from the above selectively.\"\n\nOther scholars named in the complaint did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn some cases, such as with UCLA's Gary Orfield, Jackson peppers a passage with citations but not to the scholar he is actually quoting, creating the impression of attribution while omitting the most important source.\n\n\"Why does he cite all these supposed sources but not his main source?\" Wood said. \"The apparent answer is that he understood that citing Orfield would make it easy for readers to spot that his whole section is just Orfield's writing re-purposed and lightly camouflaged.\"\n\nIn other cases, Jackson cites the source in the passage but not in the relevant sentences. His dissertation borrows eight sentences from a 1936 monograph by C.A Milner, for example, but cites Milner in just four of them, attributing the remaining four to other authors or presenting them as his own work.\n\nSuch moves appear to violate the definition of plagiarism outlined by the ombudsman's office at Michigan State.\n\n\"This definition of plagiarism applies for copied text and ideas,\" the office says, \"regardless of whether the author(s) of the text or idea which you have copied actually copied that text or idea from another source.\"\n\nPublished under: Academia , DEI , Diversity , Higher Education , Michigan State , plagiarism\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

In an interview with New York Times Magazine writer Ana Marie Cox, Waters responded to a question about the House Ethics Committee's investigation of her in 2012 for improperly intervening on behalf of a bank her husband had a financial stake in.\n\n\"Do you think it's odd that [Republicans] did that to you but won't go after President Trump?\" Cox asked.\n\n\"I was completely exonerated,\" Waters said. \"There have been numerous times when Trump should have been convicted of a crime. If Robert Mueller does the investigation that I think he's going to do, I think he will connect the dots.

      "text": "FBI Study: Police Scared, Demoralized, Less Proactive Due to Anti-Cop Activism\n\nPolice officers are \"scared and demoralized\" and have reduced \"proactive policing\" due to intense criticism from the public and national politicians amid heightened anti-cop activism, according to a recent FBI study.\n\nThe demoralization is in part due to the spike in attacks on police last year, which is partly driven by an anti-police narrative spread by the media and not discouraged by elected officials, the agency found.\n\nThe report , titled \"Assailant Study-Mindsets and Behaviors,\" was first reported Thursday by the Washington Times. It was written in April, according to FBI spokesman Matthew Bertron, and examined 50 of the 53 incidents last year in which police officers were killed on duty.\n\nThe report comes at a time when the killing of police officers is conspicuous in the news. Last summer, five officers were killed in Dallas and three in Baton Rouge in the wake of the shooting death of Alton Sterling by Baton Rouge police. These were two of the most high-profile incidents; 135 law enforcement officers were killed in 2016, a 10 percent increase from the prior year and the highest total since 2011, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.\n\nThe main cause of officers' deaths was firearms-related incidents, with 64 being shot and killed, representing a a 56 percent spike from 2015. Among those shootings, 21 deaths were due to ambush-style attacks, including the deaths in Dallas and Baton Rouge. The NLEOMF said this was the highest total in more than two decades.\n\nThe FBI report, which focused on \"mindsets and behaviors,\" broke down the thinking that inspired attacks on police, as well as the underlying factors that it believes drove them. In surveying assailants, there were two expressed reasons for their actions: \"a desire to kill law enforcement,\" and the fear that the assailant was \"going to lose their freedom by going back to jail or prison.\"\n\nThe former category, containing 28 percent of assailants, included those with social or political reasons for attacking officers, as well as a general hatred of police. This group included the ambushers in the Dallas and Baton Rouge killings, who, according to the report, \"said they were influenced by the Black Lives Matter movement, and their belief that law enforcement was targeting black males.\"\n\nAssailants motivated by social or political reasons or hatred of the police often expressed their views on social media or told friends and family before their attack. In general, the desire to \"get justice\" for those they believed were unjustly killed by police was a major driving force in the decision to attack.\n\nThe study further highlighted the negative impact of highly scrutinized police incidents over the past few years.\n\n\"Specifically, the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, and the social disturbances that followed, initiated a movement that some perceived made it socially acceptable to challenge and discredit the actions of law enforcement,\" the report stated.\n\n\"This attitude was fueled by the narrative of police misconduct and excessive force perpetuated through politicians and the media,\" it continued. \"Assailants were constantly exposed to a singular narrative by news organizations and social media of police misconduct and wrong-doing,\" which elected officials did little to disrupt.\n\nThis narrative led, for example, to an officer afraid to shoot an assailant who had slammed him to the ground and was beating him. According to the report, the officer did not not shoot the assailant because of not wanting his or her \"family or the department to have to go through the scrutiny the next day on the national news.\"\n\nThe problem is compounded by what the report called a \"turnstile justice system,\" with criminal justice reform bills, including decriminalization and reducing penalties for drug use, driving an increased rate of release for criminals. This factor, the report argued, leads to criminals doubting the severity of punishments for wrongdoing, especially while under the influence of drugs.\n\nThis intersection of narrative and decreased effectiveness of the justice system causes what the report called \"de-policing\": police making \"the conscious decision to stop engaging in proactive policing.\" Police are increasingly \"scared and demoralized,\" and avoid engagement with communities where they are not trusted and defiance and hostility are the norm.\n\nDe-policing, the report warned, led to a state of affairs where police were \"purely reactive,\" unwilling to engage with distrustful communities and cowed by a critical news media.\n\nAcross the 50 assailants examined, several common features were apparent. Eighty-six percent had prior criminal histories, and 56 percent were \"known to the local police or sheriff's department.\" Twenty-four percent had known gang affiliations, 44 percent had a history of domestic violence, 26 percent had active warrants, and 32 percent were on probation or parole.\n\nDemographically, all of the assailants were male. Nearly half, 48 percent, were white, 36 percent were black, 14 percent Hispanic, and 2 percent were Alaskan native.\n\nMoreover, 18 percent had \"diagnosed mental health issues,\" but \"mental health concerns were anecdotally identified\" in 40 percent of cases. Sixty percent had a history of drug use, with at 32 percent under the influence at the time of the incident.\n\nPublished under: FBI , Police\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "How Surging Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Introduced Anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan to the Anti-Vaxx Movement\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr., who has won a substantial amount of Democratic support since announcing his run for president, is a longtime ally of the notorious anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan, who credits the candidate with turning him on to anti-vaccine theories.\n\nThe Kennedy-Farrakhan courtship began in 2015, when Kennedy visited the Nation of Islam leader at his home in Chicago to discuss the measles vaccine administered routinely to young kids. Farrakhan said in a social media post after the meeting that the vaccine was \"designed\" to harm black males. \"Some of us are afraid, but Mr. Kennedy found his way to our door,\" Farrakhan has said .\n\nKennedy now has vocal support from Farrakhan, who has praised Adolf Hitler, compared Jews to \"termites,\" and maintains a massive following through the Nation of Islam. Farrakhan has credited Kennedy with introducing him to the controversial and widely disputed theory that childhood measles vaccines are linked to autism. Kennedy has cosponsored events with the Nation of Islam and its leader, whom he has praised as a \"truly great partner\" in the \"battle\" to publicize the autism theory.\n\nNineteen percent of Democratic voters say they support Kennedy over President Joe Biden, according to a Fox News poll . The anti-vaccine activist's popularity among Democrats could cut against the party's efforts to portray the Republican base as anti-science bigots. While Biden is still the heavy favorite, Kennedy's surprisingly strong numbers show that a sizable chunk of Democratic voters are open to supporting a candidate who has pushed anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.\n\nThe Kennedy family scion's numbers could be cause for concern for Biden, with one analyst arguing they show the commander in chief \"ceding a significant and potentially embarrassing chunk of voters to an anti-vaccine activist.\"\n\nResearchers have largely disputed Kennedy's claims about the measles vaccine, asserting it is based on a misinterpretation of data regarding autism cases for children who have been vaccinated.\n\nThat hasn't deterred Kennedy and Farrakhan.\n\n\"I thank God for Minister Farrakhan for getting involved in this. He's been a truly great partner in this battle,\" Kennedy said at a protest with the Nation of Islam outside CDC headquarters in Atlanta in Oct. 2015.\n\nThe Nation of Islam in 2016 promoted Kennedy's film Vaxxed , which accuses the federal government of covering up a link between vaccines and autism in black children. Kennedy, who runs the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, in 2017 hosted Nation of Islam officials at a press conference with actor Robert De Niro in which they promoted a vaccine-autism link. In 2021, Kennedy hosted Nation of Islam's Tony Muhammad for a discussion of Kennedy's documentary Medical Racism: The New Apartheid . Kennedy posited that health officials \"are conducting an experiment on black Americans\" by vaccinating black children against measles.\n\nKennedy debuted the documentary at a Feb. 2021 Nation of Islam conference, winning the praise of Farrakhan, who called the movie \"brilliant.\"\n\nFarrakhan and Kennedy carried their unlikely alliance through the coronavirus pandemic. During a 2020 speech in which Farrakhan called a vaccine a \"vial of death,\" the preacher urged his supporters to \"follow Robert Kennedy.\" In another speech that year, Farrakhan asserted that Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates had plotted to administer the vaccine across the globe to \"depopulate the Earth.\"\n\nNation of Islam minister Ava Muhammad said at the event that the goal of the vaccine was to \"cull the population of our planet by 2-3 billion\" because \"white people see their [population] numbers going down, and the numbers of indigenous people, black, red, and brown, going up.\" The Nation of Islam has cited Kennedy in its claim that the polio vaccine is linked to higher cancer rates in black people.\n\nBut Kennedy hasn't always felt so warmly about Farrakhan. According to excerpts of Kennedy's private diary leaked in 2013 , Kennedy lamented that civil rights leader Jesse Jackson had a \"love affair with Louis Farrakhan and his Jewish xenophobia.\"\n\nKennedy is hardly the only prominent liberal to find common cause with Farrakhan, and the minister is hardly a pariah in Democratic politics. Former president Barack Obama managed to suppress a picture of himself engaged in what the Philadelphia Tribune described as a \"warm conversation.\" The British boy band Coldplay last year dedicated a song to the anti-Semitic preacher, who once mocked Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin for having Jewish friends.\n\nFarrakhan and Kennedy did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPublished under: 2024 Election , Anti-Semitism , Conspiracy Theory , Democratic Primary , Louis Farrakhan , Nation of Islam , Robert F.

      "text": "88-Year-Old World War II Veteran Beaten to Death by Teenagers\n\nTwo teenagers allegedly beat an 88-year-old World War II veteran to death in Spokane, Wash., Wednesday night, leading to a large manhunt and widespread outrage over the senseless violence.\n\nOne suspect is in custody facing charges of first-degree murder and first-degree robbery, while another remains on the loose. Police originally described the suspects to be 16-19 in age, black males and both wearing black clothing, with one wearing a black \"Do-Rag.\"\n\nDelbert Benton, who took a bullet in his leg at the Battle of Okinawa, was headed to the Eagles Lodge , a pool hangout he frequented, when the two perpetrators evidently chose him at random, KHQ reports :\n\nBelton was rushed to the hospital where he was placed in the intensive care unit but later died ... Family & friends of Delbert Belton tell KHQ's Dylan Wohlenhaus that Delbert was \"full of life\" at 88-years-old.\n\nThey say Belton loved working on cars and helping out others. Belton also served overseas in the military in WWII.  Friends of Belton say he was wounded in WWII in Okinawa but survived. Police have not said if or what the motive was for the beating. Police believe this was a random attack. A makeshift memorial has been set up at the crime scene to honor Belton.\n\nPublished under: Crime Blotter , Video\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
