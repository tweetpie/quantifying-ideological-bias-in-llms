      "text": "Ralph Nader: Republican kingmakers know Trump is a threat to the country - but they're too cowardly to act\n\nIn 1956, then-Senator John F. Kennedy authored a best-selling book titled Profiles in Courage , in which he told the stories of Senators in American history who, on principle, bucked the tides of power. Today, some Republican writer or conservative syndicated columnist - George Will or Max Boot - should write a book called Profiles in Cowardliness. It should cover Republican leadership's near-total cowardliness in the face of Donald Trump, whom they despise on many fronts. Many in Republican leadership believe he has hijacked their Grand Old Party (GOP).\n\nClearly the Republicans - except for Rep. Justin Amash, who recently quit the Party after accusing Trump of impeachable crimes - are intimidated by this foul-mouthed president. Republican politicians are cowed by Trump's bellicose personal rhetoric. We have seen this cycle repeat itself countless times, with the media boosting their ratings by recklessly repeating Trump's insults.\n\nRepublicans remember what Trump did to Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio during the 2016 Republican primary. They observe how loud-mouthed Donald spews toxic falsehoods at Democrats and gets away with it. Why, Republicans ask themselves, should they take any chances provoking this unstable Twitter Emperor and his ditto-heads on social media whom he deliberately incites? The answer: because patriotism demands action.\n\nDonald Trump acts as if he is above the law - coming off his career as a corporate criminal, he has become a government outlaw. He has always cheated justice. Trump flouts the Constitution, refuses to faithfully execute the laws preventing corporate crimes, and obstructs justice.  Just as bad are Trump's ethical and personal failings; he has brought disgraceful personal behavior, serious daily lies, expensive nepotism, denials of grave realities facing the country, bigotry, violent incitement, and disrepute to the White House. All of these failings are why the Founding Fathers gave impeachment authority to the House of Representatives and the authority of open trial to the Senate.\n\nThere are many more indictable and impeachable offenses, but the focus here is on why the entire GOP has completely fallen in line.  Only former Republican Governor of Massachusetts William Weld has dared to officially challenge Trump in the upcoming Republican primary.  This week, former Republican Congressman and Governor of South Carolina Mark Sanford announced he is testing the waters for a run against President Trump, emphasizing Trump's huge expanding deficits. It is shocking that so few opponents have emerged considering Trump lost the popular vote in 2016 and remains more consistently unfavorable in the polls than any president in modern times.\n\nRepublicans must think \"crooked Donald\" is invincible. So why try? Plenty of Republican politicians consider Trump to be a clear and present danger to Party and country. They include Former Senators Flake and Corker; current Senator Mitt Romney; former Governor of Ohio John Kasich; former New Jersey Governor and EPA head, under Reagan, Christine Todd Whitman; and former House Speaker Paul Ryan. All have spoken out about Trump's dangerous ignorance and loutishness. All believe him to be unqualified and fear his reckless actions. On trade, immigration, climate crisis, and his open admiration of brutal dictators, they find him appalling.\n\nYet there are few signs of a serious challenge. In the 1990s, John Kasich was the Chairman of the powerful House Budget Committee. At the time he was critical of the wasteful, unauditable Pentagon budget then (imagine now). Asked about 2020, Kasich told The Washington Post that he's \"never gotten involved in a race that [he] didn't think [he] could win,\" adding, \"things are very volatile in this business and you just cannot predict what might change.\" Such words hardly signal anything beyond extreme caution.\n\nOne would think, these persons and others who could take on Trump (for example, the very popular former Governor of New Jersey Thomas Kean) would want to stand up for traditional Republican principles and positions (think about Senator Robert Taft, Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Theodore Roosevelt, and of course, Abraham Lincoln). In sharp contrast, current Republican leaders almost never criticize Trump publically apart from a mild op-ed (Romney) or the occasional public comments (Whitman).\n\nIt gets worse. Apart from William Kristol, Trump's arch-critic, there doesn't seem to be any activity among Republican kingmakers to find a challenger or even consider mounting a third-party accountability challenge from the political right.\n\nThere is someone, were he younger, who would take on Trump. He is former Republican Senator from Connecticut, Lowell Weicker. He was known in the Senate as a ferocious defender of the Constitution and was prominent during the Watergate hearings that exposed Richard Nixon.\n\nApart from elected officials, what about those cabinet secretaries and White House chief of staff, whom Trump praised to the skies, before he drove them out with a frenzy of ruthless epithets (\"dumb as a rock,\" etc.)? They know the insides of mad Trump's White House, which would receive media attention.\n\nAt the least, Republicans who challenged Trump in the primaries would put Trump on the defensive and hold him more accountable.\n\nTime is passing on the road to November 2020. There are countless Republicans who deeply believe that Trump is a disgrace to his office and a threat to the Republic, as well as to the future of the Republican Party. Who amongst them will stand up and be counted?\n\nIs their moral courage totally AWOL?"

      "text": "Sunday-Night Shutdown Reader: Advise, Dissent\n\n\"Maybe it is just that Baby-Boomer trash\": potential sources of error on my part\n\nI haven't forgotten my promise to report back on the views and activities of the Atlas Shrugged Guy. It will happen-for now I'm hoping to hear back from him.\n\nMeanwhile, in the spirit of transparency, here are specimen \"You are full of crap\" and \"The situation is worse than you're saying\" messages. This is the kind of thing the daily mailbag holds; both messages are in response to the same item this weekend.\n\nFirst, dissent, though couched as \"more in sorrow ...\" Forgive my quoting the flattering-seeming part at the beginning; you'll see that it's a set-up for the criticism that follows.\n\nYou are such a nice person. Really nice, I have no doubt. You are a lover of good beer, lover of a good woman, and good father to some (I assume) fine American children. [JF note: On wife and children, you're right, and thanks! But what about my skills as an aviator? Or one-time tennis player and current runner?] You are a talented writer. I am not well enough read to call you great, but you seem to hit the mark more often than not, and have for many years. There is something to be said for that.\n\nBut ... you are so fundamentally mistaken about some important things (like the nature of republican democracy, and America) that I am at a loss to figure out how you could be all those other good things! Tone deaf comes to mind, but that can't be right. Blinded by decades of leftist cant also, but you seem (I do not know you) too smart for that.\n\nMaybe it is just that Baby-Boomer trash. For instance, I cannot imagine that you have anything but the rankest contempt for Sens. Reid, Schumer or Landrieu, but you reserve your vitriol for the contemptible McConnell and (not so much, in my view) Cruz. It is clear that both named sets pursue the interests they have, and that yours conform to the former, not the latter, but still you act as though the latter have no right (even duty) to obstruct and oppose, which is what the opposition DOES in a democracy. Is it possible that you are not a democratic republican (both small, mind you) but a real believer in benevolent despotism? Perhaps a sort of pleasantly strict meritocracy? It is bit a short step from there to Fascist. I hate to think that of you.\n\nThese are such interesting times. You left a list of Representatives to be remembered in a recent post . I was reminded (second-hand, I was not alive then) of Sen. McCarthy, and that is not fair to you. But still ... lines are getting drawn, people are lining up. I know that I am on the side of a radically smaller government, and know that a lot less government will be best for every American. You are stone-cold certain that we need a lot more government to ensure the best for every American, and every other person who can manage to land here. There is very little room for compromise here. Do you realize that? I think that there are about 25-30 million Americans who get most of the important work in this nation done. I think you are not among them, and that you do not know many people that are. I recommend that you widen the scope of your acquaintances. If the line drawing continues (as I think it well may) you might just find yourself among a bunch of people that you are fond of, but who are incapable or unwilling to do what it takes to keep this nation going. On the other side might well be the people that do. That might not end well.\n\nOn the other side, a letter in response to this item earlier today, from someone with recent service as a U.S. military officer:\n\nI always thought I was a Republican. The Grand Old Party (GOP) that I grew up in stood for individual opportunity, confidence in the free market; and belief in the great human promise and purpose of the United States of America. The GOP's heroes: Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, were leaders with conservative instincts, but pragmatic dispositions .\n\nThey did not idolize federal government, but they honored and wielded its power to achieve great, practical ends: emancipation of the slaves; preservation of the Union; the defeat of global totalitarianism; and the conservation of the great natural treasures of America for our children. This kind of Republicanism inspired me to consistently vote for Republican candidates. The same spirit led me to repeatedly seek opportunities to serve, first as a soldier in the United States Army, more recently as a federal prosecutor, and constantly in my community as a tutor, coach, scout leader, and involved parent. But the cynical zealots who have hi-jacked the Republican Party in recent years have torn away the moorings of my political identity. Tea Party radicalism has no respect for the practical business of governing a democracy. They deride as \"Republicans in Name Only\" (RINOs) anyone with regard for the virtues of moderation and effective government. Tea Partiers seem to have more in common with the fire eating secessionism of John Calhoun, than with the statesmen of the GOP. Like Calhoun, the Tea Party is obsessively fixed on a peculiar institution, regarding which they will accept no compromise. Congress must defund Obamacare, they insist, or they will burn down both our government and the full faith and credit of the United States of America. This Tea Party strategy is simultaneously lunatic and moronic : lunatic because House Republicans have put themselves in the position of a hostage-taker: in order to succeed, they must convince Democrats that really are insane enough to put a bullet through the head of our nation's economic well-being. The strategy is moronic because the Government shutdown spectacle has rescued the Obama Administration from the political consequences of a disastrous Syria policy and incompetent Obamacare launch. And while the Republican Party plunges along on this game of blind chicken, true American public servants and hard-pressed families are paying the real price in missed mortgage payments and life opportunities .... I believe it is past time for pragmatically-disposed citizens, RINO or otherwise, to stand up and take back the political space that the Tea Party has dominated for too long. This duty is greater than allegiance to any single political party; our nation and children's interests require it. A clique that despises and dishonors American government can no longer be allowed to cripple American politics. The United States of America will overcome the problems of Tea Party zealotry by citizens challenging that creed's advocates in the public square and at the ballot box. We should start that process right here in [his home area].\n\nI will not try to answer or reconcile these now. I am just saying: these are the passions of our times. I am moved (a little) toward sympathy for our politicians when I imagine trying to govern, lead, or form consensus in circumstances like these. More soon.\n\nAP picture, via WaPo . John Galt painting, which I added to the reader's note, from here .\n\nAnd to spare those tempted to write: Yes, in fact I do know that the standard legal formulation is \"advice [not advise ] and consent [not dissent ].\" I changed the words on purpose!"

But the actions of certain ambitious Republican officeholders in the days leading up to the tragedy were not clouded by confusion.\n\nTrump may have lost the election, but his movement was on the march, and for politicians hoping someday to succeed Trump as president, that meant an opportunity was afoot.\n\nWith Trump now finally accepting he will leave office, the future leadership of his movement is increasingly up for grabs, with a ragtag band of senators, congressman, Trump family members - and Trump himself - already jostling for the position.\n\nWhether anyone apart from the president is able to successfully ride the tiger of racism, nihilism and grievance politics that carried Trump to near-re-election after four years of American chaos and hundreds of thousands of preventable pandemic deaths is an open question.\n\nIt also might be an irrelevant question, if Trump decides to stage a 2023-24 stadium tour doubling as a new presidential campaign.\n\n\"Absent disqualification, the 2024 GOP presidential nomination remains his if he wants it,\" tweeted Dave Wasserman, Congress editor of the Cook Political Report.\n\nBut with Trump gone, for the moment, after years of rock-like reign over the Republican party, powerful currents of political ambition and realignment have swirled into the vacuum.\n\nLongtime Trump loyalists, chief among them the vice-president, Mike Pence, have suddenly broken with the president over his fight to reverse the election result. Mick Mulvaney, the former chief of staff and special envoy to Northern Ireland whose loyalty helped Trump escape conviction in the impeachment scandal, resigned over the Capitol riot debacle, saying: \"I can't do it. I can't stay.\"\n\nTwo firebrand conservative senators, Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, went the other direction, taking up Trump's cause - only to see their campaign result almost immediately in the death of a police officer and four others, and the vandalization of the US Capitol.\n\nA third young senator with designs on the presidency, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, blasted his plotting colleagues \"who, for political advantage, were giving false hope to their supporters\", he said. The Republican old guard, meanwhile, in the guise of Mitt Romney, who has actually run for president - twice - accused his colleagues of being \"complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy\".\n\nEven the former Republican House speaker John Boehner, who since his 2015 retirement has mostly limited his commentary on politics to tweeted pictures of himself mowing his lawn, said the Grand Old party (GOP) was in trouble.\n\n\"I once said the party of Lincoln and Reagan is off taking a nap,\" Boehner wrote on Thursday. \"The nap has become a nightmare for our nation. The GOP must awaken.\"\n\nFor certain Republicans , the violent and deadly near-sacking of the Capitol on Wednesday by white supremacists and other Trump sympathizers seemed to be only the second most disturbing event of the week.\n\nThe night before, Republicans had lost two runoff US senate elections in Georgia, a state that until 2020 had not voted for a Democrat for president for 30 years. The two Georgia losses meant that Republicans lost control of the Senate - and leader Mitch McConnell lost his majority.\n\n\"Emotions [are] running high among McConnell-aligned Republicans,\" National Journal columnist Josh Kraushaar reported, \"after [the] reality of what transpired in Georgia settled in. May be the heat of the moment, but mood is for declaring war on Team Trump.\"\n\nA former McConnell chief of staff and campaign manager, Josh Holmes, was quick to knock down the idea.\n\n\"A lot of emotions. People are angry,\" Holmes replied on Twitter to Kraushaar. \"Nobody is declaring war on anything. We'll get through this.\"\n\nBut even the people with money, whose interests McConnell has expertly defended, grew agitated at the mess Trump had made.\n\n\"This is sedition and should be treated as such,\" Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, an influential business trade group, said . \"The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy.\" The chiefs of multiple Wall Street banks echoed the sentiment.\n\nThat is not even to mention the cavalcade of Republicans who had long since broken with Trump, who piled on the president after the Capitol was sacked. The conservative columnist George Will said : \"The three repulsive architects of Wednesday's heartbreaking spectacle\" - Trump, Hawley and Cruz - \"will each wear the scarlet 'S' of sedition.\" The conservative National Journal declared : \"Trump must pay.\" Matt Drudge's website ran the sarcastic banner \"Thanks, Donald\". The National Review hailed \"Trump's final insult\". A second former Trump chief of staff, John Kelly, joined those calling for his immediate removal from office.\n\nThe Republican cross-currents do not mean that the party will not find direction in time to win back the Senate, plus the House, in 2022 - or to win the presidency in 2024, whether with Trump's name on the ticket or tattooed on the nominee's forehead.\n\nBut Trump's role in the party, and the politics, has never been to introduce order, except when that means that everybody falls behind him. For now, everybody is doing the opposite: falling out."

      "text": "The Republican party is at last paying the price of its Faustian pact with Trump\n\nM ore than 11 years ago, before Donald Trump emerged from the primordial ooze of the far-right fever swamp, before the aborted January 6 insurrection and before the latest spasm of Republican extremism felled House speaker Kevin McCarthy , two renowned political scientists, Thomas Mann, and Norman Ornstein, put their finger on the essence of increasingly dysfunctional US politics: the Republican party. Mann and Ornstein argued that the Grand Old Party (GOP) had become an \"insurgent outlier\" that was \"ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition\".\n\nEleven years later, the enfant terrible of American politics has somehow got unimaginably worse. The GOP today is less a political party and more an inchoate mass of cultural grievances, conspiracy theories and lowest common denominator political slogans. Trump, for all his toxicity, is a symptom of the GOP's decades-long descent into madness. Legislating is not seen as a tool for bettering the plight of the American people but rather an opportunity to troll Democrats and play to the perceived slights of the party's rank-and-file supporters.\n\nBut Republican indifference to governing is, perhaps, the least of the party's pathologies. In slavishly supporting Trump and his Maga - Make America Great Again - supporters, they have empowered a political movement that is increasingly testing the limits of the US democratic experiment.\n\nMcCarthy's political trajectory tells the sorry tale. After January 6, McCarthy, who, along with his political colleagues, was forced to hide from the marauding insurrectionists, turned against the man responsible for the day's violence. Privately, he told fellow Republicans: \" I've had it with this guy \". But within weeks, he travelled to the ex-president's palatial digs in South Florida and, on bended knee, pledged loyalty to the GOP's orange god. He tried to block a bipartisan congressional committee to investigate January 6 and allied himself with conspiracy theorists who continued to spread lies about the 2020 election. Earlier this year, he gave in to Republican extremists and announced an impeachment inquiry of Joe Biden , even though there is no evidence that the president has committed any impeachable offences.\n\nMcCarthy, like countless Republican supplicants over the past eight years, realised that his political aspirations were directly tied to his willingness to support Trump and the extremist forces within the party that have rallied around him. In a tale as old as time, he made a deal with the devil, only to be burned by the political forces he'd empowered. Trump's hold over the Republican party is so complete that it borders on the pathological. Since March, he has been indicted four times and charged with 91 separate felonies . Yet his poll numbers among Republicans have dramatically improved. He enjoys a more than 45-point lead in the race for the party's presidential nomination.\n\nThere simply is no future in the GOP for an elected official who refuses to prostrate themselves to Trump. Liz Cheney was the most vocal and impassioned Republican in speaking out against him after January 6. Her reward: McCarthy engineered her removal from the GOP House leadership . Then, in 2022, a Maga Republican challenged Cheney in a GOP primary and defeated her by nearly 40 points . Another Republican apostate, former presidential candidate and current Utah senator Mitt Romney , who twice voted to convict Trump in his impeachment trials, recently announced that he wouldn't run for re-election .\n\nIn a series of interviews with the Atlantic 's McKay Coppins, he recounted how, \"in public\", his fellow Republican senators \"played their parts as Trump loyalists, often contorting themselves rhetorically to defend the president's most indefensible behaviour. But in private, they ridiculed his ignorance, rolled their eyes at his antics and made incisive observations about his warped, toddler-like psyche.\"\n\nLike other principled Republicans , Romney is choosing to walk away, and it's hard to blame him. His criticisms of Trump have led to death threats and he is now spending an estimated $5,000 a day on private security. But the result is that the GOP's ranks are now increasingly filled by those with bottomless reservoirs of ambition and empty cupboards of integrity. So for those hoping that a principled and mature Republican party will somehow emerge from this mess, think again. The political incentives in the GOP run in a singular direction - to the far right. If there is any silver lining, it is this: for all the Republican voters who love Trump, there is a larger mobilised group of voters who loathes him.\n\nIndeed, what is perhaps most striking about Trump is the static nature of his political support. In fact, if one compares his approval ratings from February 2020 - before the Covid pandemic ravaged the nation - to those in November 2020, when he ran for re-election, they were largely unchanged. Since leaving office, his approval numbers have also largely stayed the same. Americans have, by and large, made up their minds about Trump - and the verdict is: \"We don't like him.\"\n\nThe last three US elections prove the point. In what was largely seen as a rebuke to Trump, in the 2018 midterms, Democrats picked up more than 40 seats and control of the House of Representatives. In 2020, he lost re-election by at least 7m votes to Biden(4m more than he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016). In the 2022 midterms, the Democrats dramatically overperformed, picking up a seat in the Senate and barely losing the House of Representatives . So far this year, in dozens of special elections, Democrats are overperforming by a whopping 11 points. Part of this is a byproduct of the supreme court's decision on abortion rights , but it's also a backlash to the extremism that Trump has engendered.\n\nOf course, elections are tricky things and there is no guarantee that the unpopular Biden will emerge victorious next November. But take his current lousy polling with a grain of salt. It's one thing to want a different Democratic nominee, as many Democrats do, but elections are about choices. That the likely option for voters in November 2024 will be Biden, or a deeply unstable opponent who could be a multiple convicted felon, has a way of narrowing one's focus. But even if Trump loses, the problem of the Republican party will still be with us long after he's left the political scene.\n\nMichael Cohen is an Observer columnist.

It is what Joe Biden and the Democrats should do when faced with a party determined to subvert democracy through any means necessary, including violence.\n\nOn Friday Republicans in the Senate torpedoed an effort to create a bipartisan commission to investigate the deadly insurrection by Donald Trump's supporters at the US Capitol on 6 January, deploying the procedural move known as the filibuster to stop it even being debated.\n\nFearful perhaps of what such a commission might uncover about their own role as co-conspirators, most brushed aside personal pleas by Gladys Sicknick, the mother of a police officer who was that day sprayed with a chemical, collapsed and later had a stroke and died.\n\n\"A country that cannot even agree to investigate an assault on its Capitol is in big trouble, indeed,\" observed Susan Glasser in the New Yorker magazine.\n\nTellingly Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, who previously condemned Trump's role in the riot, reportedly asked senators to nix the commission as a \"personal favour\". It was a sign that the rot now goes deeper than a cult of personality into the foundations of the Grand Old Party (GOP).\n\nIt is a party that still has room for Matt Gaetz, a Florida congressman under investigation over sex trafficking allegations, who this week appeared to incite supporters to take up arms. \"We have a second amendment in this country, and I think we have an obligation to use it,\" he said.\n\nGaetz was speaking in Georgia on his \"America First\" tour alongside local congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who recently compared coronavirus mask mandates to the Holocaust. The pair of mini-Trumps are taking his playbook of attention-grabbing outrage to new extremes.\n\nBill Kristol, director of the Defending Democracy Together advocacy organisation, tweeted on Friday morning: \"Marjorie Taylor Greene bragged yesterday that she and Matt Gaetz are taking over the GOP. Today Senate Republicans are set to block a January 6th commission that could make that somewhat more difficult. Violence and authoritarianism has enablers as well as instigators.\"\n\nOne of America's two major parties now falls outside the democratic mainstream - think \"far right\" in European terms. But are Democrats taking the existential threat sufficiently seriously or sleepwalking towards disaster in the next election cycle?\n\nJoe Manchin , a moderate senator from West Virginia, had said Republicans have \"no excuse\" to oppose the commission. Yet he also repeated his refusal to contemplate abolishing the filibuster, effectively giving Republicans carte blanche to block infrastructure spending, voting rights legislation, statehood for the District of Columbia and more.\n\nMinutes after Friday's vote, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, seemed to get it, arguing that Republicans acted out of \"out of fear or fealty\" to Trump and made his false claim of a stolen election their official policy. \"Trump's big lie is now the defining principle of what was once the party of Lincoln,\" Schumer said. \"Republican state legislatures, seizing on the big lie, are conducting the greatest assault on voting rights since the beginning of Jim Crow.\"\n\nBut national voting rights legislation that would counter such steps is in deep trouble on Capitol Hill. Biden's deadline for a police reform law named after George Floyd has come and gone due to Republican objections. His ambitious infrastructure investment is stalling as Republicans seek to shave billions off.\n\nWhatever the president's head tells him, his heart has always favoured bipartisan compromise. He may also feel obliged to make a show of reaching across the aisle to satisfy moderates such as Manchin. Yet Democratic majorities are painfully narrow and each day brings the midterm elections closer.\n\nFred Wellman, a military veteran who is executive director of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, tweeted: \"We need to fight for our Republic. I don't understand at all what the Democratic leadership is thinking. Stop fucking around. Stop letting McConnell walk all over you. For God's sake act like you are the majority. We are all out here fighting. Where are you?\"\n\nThat question just became even more urgent and the case for abolishing the filibuster, passing Biden's agenda and acknowledging that the Republican party has gone rogue just became stronger."

      "text": "Everything you need to know about the Midterms\n\nSeán Clarke , Niko Kommenda , Ben Jacobs and Sam Morris\n\nThe key question in these elections is: will Republicans be able to keep control of both chambers of Congress? Just 35 of the 100 seats in the Senate , and all of the 435 seats in the lower House of Representatives are up for grabs. To take control of the legislative agenda and block Trump's ability to implement his programs, the Democratic party needs to control both houses. With a Senate majority, the Democrats would be able to block cabinet and supreme court appointments. But while they may be able to take the House, clinching the Senate will be much harder. Impeachment , by the way, requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate, so would require Republican votes even if the Democrats won every available seat in November.\n\nHere comes the math: the Grand Old Party (GOP) does have a big advantage over the Democrats in this showdown, because the Democratic party is defending 26 seats (including two independents, who usually vote with them) while the Republicans only have to defend nine .\n\nThe Senate electoral system is also weighed against the Democrats. Each state gets two senators, irrespective of population, so Wyoming has as many as California, despite the latter having more than 60 times the population. The smaller states also tend to be the more rural, and rural areas traditionally favor the Republicans. One hopeful note for the Democrats is that Nevada and Arizona are both open races - in which the incumbent senator is not running - and both were only narrowly won by the Republicans in 2012.\n\nKey race - Arizona The Senate seat held by Barry Goldwater and John McCain could be picked up by Democrats in 2018. After a tough primary, Republican Martha McSally has been pushed to the right and faces a tough race against Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in a state with a growing Latino population and with deep tensions between traditional business oriented Republicans like McCain and hard right Trumpists.\n\nThe Democrats have a much better chance of winning here. Representation in the House is (relatively) proportional to population, and the whole chamber is re-elected every two years. They need a net gain of 23 seats to win a majority. But in the last 50 years they've scored a net gain of that size only twice, in 1974 and in 2006. In the same period the Republicans have made a 23+ net gain only three times, but the most recent was in 2010, in the midterm elections of Barack Obama's first term.\n\nAmerican voters are usually reluctant to eject a sitting representative. So for Democrats, some of their best hopes are in seats where the incumbent is not standing again. The good news for Dems is that a record 39 Republicans - many of whom were anti-Trump - have chosen to bow out instead of contest their seats in November, and some of those are in key swing states such as Florida and Pennsylvania.\n\nKey race - Pennsylvania's 17th district Democrat Conor Lamb won a shock special election win in March. Now, after court ordered redistricting, he'll face off against Republican incumbent Keith Rothfus in a far more friendly district. However, it's still a district Trump narrowly won. More key races\n\nEach US state has a governor, who is like a local president. Their interactions with the federal government can be significant; they may have a large amount of sway, for instance, over local gun laws or the implementation of health insurance policies. But this year, Democrats think their salience is national because many of them have a veto over redistricting . Remapping of electoral districts happens in the US after every census. The next round will happen in 2022 when the 2020 census results are in. Governors elected this year who serve four-year terms will still be in office then. Democrats are hoping to win office in several swing states that have open races, such as Ohio, Nevada, Michigan and Florida, and thereby prevent gerrymandering that would affect congressional races as far away as to 2032.\n\nKey race - Florida African American Democrat Andrew Gillum won an upset victory in the primary, bolstered by heavy financial support from Tom Steyer, a billionaire hedge-fund manager. The unabashed progressive will face off against Republican Ron DeSantis, an ardent Trump supporter, in what will be one of the marquee races of the midterms."

      "text": "And they're off and writing in the great race to the White House\n\nThis week, the big beasts of the Grand Old Party (GOP) - ex-mayor Rudy Giuliani and ex-governors Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee - will go head-to-head for the Republican nomination in the treacherous electoral waters of the Iowa caucus. Simultaneously, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards and Barack Obama will slug it out for supremacy among Democrats. These are the most open and volatile races in years. Anything could happen. Even a book could make a difference.\n\nWhat, you might ask, do books have to do with the bare-knuckle business of politics in the age of YouTube? But here's the odd thing. Although Americans spend more on their lawns than on literature, come the high noon of the democratic process, the presidential primaries, you find that all the serious contenders have published some kind of memoir.\n\nThe campaign autobiography offers a kind of calculated full disclosure, but it does not usually encourage further investigation. Typically, for instance, your candidate's memoir contains no index, is often dedicated to some version of 'the American people' and contains photographs that fall somewhere between the embarrassingly hokey (me with 'Wifey' and the kids) and the numbingly official (that's me addressing the state legislature). Every last one of them tries to project that granite-jawed certainty for which (each candidate has been told) the focus groups are hungering. So the titles of this pocket library of presidential aspiration feature words like 'character', 'courage' and 'leadership'.\n\nYet despite the ambition to be a serious campaign tool, each of these books betrays something about its 'author' or at least its subject. They turn out to be reassuringly eccentric. For instance, Dennis Kucinich, the bat-eared congressman from Ohio, has mobilised his celebrity connections to promote The Courage to Survive. There's a scarcely credible blurb from Gore Vidal ('Beautifully written, hypnotically mesmerising... as good as Theodore Dreiser') and an effusive note of thanks to Shirley MacLaine for 'taking time to help edit' his book. Shirley MacLaine? Gore Vidal? No wonder Kucinich is the butt of Jon Stewart and the Comedy Central crowd.\n\nJohn McCain tries to co-opt the heroes of the past on to his faltering campaign to be an American hero of the future. But who are the 'extraordinary people' he wants to associate himself with? Winston Churchill and Reinhold Neibuhr for sure. No quarrel with that. But King Camp Gillette, the razor-blade millionaire (motto: 'Sell the Shave, not the Razor')? Gertrude Ederle, the first woman to swim the English Channel, against the advice of her coach? Read his Hard Call: Great Decisions and the People Who Made Them and you wonder what on earth a McCain administration would look like. More serious, in the polls, are Republicans Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney. Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, comes from Bill Clinton country and has come to the front of the pack with a mixture of good ol' boy humour, Bible-thumping rhetoric (he's a Southern Baptist ex-pastor) and sheer, down-home ordinariness that might make him one of the scariest candidates in recent memory. His book is called Character Makes a Difference: Where I'm From, Where I've been and What I Believe. Short answer: Nowhere, nowhere and the Bible.\n\nMitt Romney is the Mormon in the race, now celebrated as the candidate who drove his wife and kids in the family car with the dog on the roof. Somehow, he's overcome that one to be a contender. He makes his pitch to the voters in Turnaround: Crisis, Leadership and the Olympic Games. The Olympic Games? That's the Salt Lake City Winter Games of 2002, which Romney organised.\n\nAnd then there's Rudy Giuliani. In the opening line of Leadership, he tells the reader: 'I have always loved to write. I have also always loved to research.' But this is a book avowedly co-authored and researched by a magazine journalist, Ken Kurson. Giuliani/Kurson open their account with a blow-by-blow account of Rudy's 'finest hour' (Churchillian allusions pepper the narrative), the emergency of 11 September 2001. Arguably, it was this crisis that made Giuliani a national figure and launched his presidential bid. He certainly takes a lot of credit for his coolness under fire on that momentous day.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton's autobiography, Living History, has all the control freaky hallmarks of her campaign: no personality, no quirks. She can't deny that she is married to a man called Bill Clinton, but she turns this to her advantage in narrating the story of how she became 'wife, mother, lawyer, First Lady and international icon'. Her message is: 'Vote for me; I'm an all-American superstar.' At the same time, she goes out of her way to associate herself with the women of the electorate, a potentially match-winning constituency. 'I wasn't born a First Lady or a senator,' she writes. 'I was born an American.' Hers is the richest of these memoirs, and the most diplomatic. There are no fewer than six closely printed pages of acknowledgements. And there is an index, with an entry for Monica Lewinsky, but no reference either to John Edwards or Barack Obama.\n\nEdwards , a southern trial lawyer with an expensive haircut, is perhaps the dark horse of the potential Democratic ticket. His campaign book is a collection of papers about ending poverty in the US and is wilfully lacking in glamour and/or celebrity. Which is probably just as well for a man famous for his $400 haircuts.\n\nWhich brings us, finally, to Barack Obama who is now, according to many polls, narrowly ahead of his rivals. Obama is the junior senator from Illinois, Abraham Lincoln's home state, and he misses no opportunity to link his name to Honest Abe's. In one important sense, the association is justified: Obama is a graceful, natural writer and his book, The Audacity of Hope, is visibly the work of its author and has an authenticity and freshness that sets it apart. If it's contrived, then the contrivance seems to contain spontaneity.\n\nObama's extraordinary popularity means that this book is a No 1 bestseller. It deals with issues like 'faith', 'race' and 'the constitution' with refreshing candour, but is much less gripping in autobiographical terms. However, it would indeed be a bonus if 2008 saw at least one nominee display a gift for language equal to Jefferson, Kennedy and, yes, Lincoln. Obama may yet be in their company.\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media."

      "text": "Bush's star wars, Hollywood-style\n\nUnlike his glamorous predecessor, President Bush has never exactly twinkled among the stars. He is more a baseball-and-oil kind of guy. But the president's celebrity ratings have reached a new low. In the run-up to next week's global warming summit in Bonn, Robert Redford, the cinematic patron saint of the environment, has poured scorn on an \"ignorant\" leader who \"doesn't have a clue\".\n\nThe withering judgment appeared in the German magazine, Stern, and seems to be an opening salvo in a celebrity-rich campaign to persuade Mr Bush to rethink his rejection of the Kyoto treaty on climate change. Bianca Jagger also weighed in yesterday, accusing the US president of playing Russian roulette with the planet.\n\n\"He has refused to back the Kyoto protocol despite the fact that there has been a UN report written by 3,000 scientists that shows that unless we cut fossil fuel emissions, global warming will be inevitable,\" the ex-model, former Rolling Stone wife and global activist said, at the London launch of a Green Party campaign.\n\nMr Redford was far more scathing. He has been a constant critic of Mr Bush's environmental policies, even writing a column in the New York Times to attack the administration's energy policy, but this time the actor-director and environmentalist appears to have lost his patience.\n\nHe told Stern that Mr Bush was apparently unaware \"we are all living in a global village\" as he relied too much on advisers from the military-industrial complex. \"They are blind and deaf to the changes over the last 40 years,\" he said. \"It's a tragedy because we could really learn a lot from other countries.\"\n\nThe criticism is timed to raise the curtain at Monday's Bonn summit, which is due to restart stalled negotiations over the future of the 1997 Kyoto agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions. In March, the Bush administration said it considered the Kyoto agreement dead, arguing that the deal required the US to shoulder too much of the burden and asked too little of developing countries. At the time, US officials said they would come up with an alternative plan to address the global warming threat, but the White House has so far come up with little apart from vague endorsements of voluntary emissions targets.\n\nThis latest wave of high-wattage criticism is symptomatic of George Bush's longstanding celebrity-deficit. During the election campaign Al Gore was embraced by the Hollywood A-list: Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Affleck and Warren Beatty.\n\nGeorge Bush, meanwhile, had to make do with such waning stars as Bo Derek and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Even longstanding Republican supporters such as Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone and Clint Eastwood, did not make much of an effort for the party's presidential candidate. Mr Willis confined his contribution to calling Mr Gore a \"knucklehead\".\n\nThe online magazine, Salon, summed up the problems of the Grand Old Party (GOP) as the Republicans are known with the headline: \"GOP: Our Celebs suck!\", pointing out that the main political dilemma in Hollywood in the last election was whether to back Mr Gore or his Green opponent, Ralph Nader.\n\nThe crisis came to a head at Mr Bush's presidential inauguration, where a string of leading acts turned down the opportunity to perform before the nation. Michael Levine, a Hollywood publicist told the Los Angeles Times that: \"Booking entertainment for a Republican inaugural is like trying to push a wet mattress up a spiral staircase\".\n\nIn the end, the Bush inaugural committee saved face by snagging Ricky Martin, but the Latino star fell out with the new administration soon afterwards over the use of Vieques in his native Puerto Rico as a US navy bombing range.\n\nThe president's standing in Hollywood is so dire that the White House has set up an informal taskforce to try to attract more celebrities. According to the latest edition of the conservative journal, National Review: \"White House officials have been compiling lists of entertainment figures who might be persuaded to support some of the president's policies (and who might also lend a touch of glamour to state dinners and other White House events).\"\n\nThe administration's strategy has been to point out the interests George Bush and the stars have in common. The president, for example, has significantly lowered the tax burden on the extremely wealthy and he is a forthright advocate of copyright enforcement.\n\nBut despite calling Hollywood's biggest talent agents \"in the hope of making connections\", the celebrity recruitment drive seems to be making little headway. The stars are less interested in \"nickel-and-dime\" issues such as tax and intellectual property laws, than in more emotive subjects such as the environment and abortion rights.\n\nThe celebrity-courting has also, on occasion, been woefully heavy handed. In May, the interior secretary, Gale Norton, invited Mr Redford to take part in a photo-opportunity in which endangered California condors would be released into the wild. Ms Norton was sure he would be interested in view of his starring role in the film Three Days of the Condor. It had to be pointed out that the film was about spies, not birds."

But the actions of certain ambitious Republican officeholders in the days leading up to the tragedy were not clouded by confusion.\n\nTrump may have lost the election, but his movement was on the march, and for politicians hoping someday to succeed Trump as president, that meant an opportunity was afoot.\n\nWith Trump now finally accepting he will leave office, the future leadership of his movement is increasingly up for grabs, with a ragtag band of senators, congressman, Trump family members - and Trump himself - already jostling for the position.\n\nWhether anyone apart from the president is able to successfully ride the tiger of racism, nihilism and grievance politics that carried Trump to near-re-election after four years of American chaos and hundreds of thousands of preventable pandemic deaths is an open question.\n\nIt also might be an irrelevant question, if Trump decides to stage a 2023-24 stadium tour doubling as a new presidential campaign.\n\n\"Absent disqualification, the 2024 GOP presidential nomination remains his if he wants it,\" tweeted Dave Wasserman, Congress editor of the Cook Political Report.\n\nBut with Trump gone, for the moment, after years of rock-like reign over the Republican party, powerful currents of political ambition and realignment have swirled into the vacuum.\n\nLongtime Trump loyalists, chief among them the vice-president, Mike Pence, have suddenly broken with the president over his fight to reverse the election result. Mick Mulvaney, the former chief of staff and special envoy to Northern Ireland whose loyalty helped Trump escape conviction in the impeachment scandal, resigned over the Capitol riot debacle, saying: \"I can't do it. I can't stay.\"\n\nTwo firebrand conservative senators, Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, went the other direction, taking up Trump's cause - only to see their campaign result almost immediately in the death of a police officer and four others, and the vandalization of the US Capitol.\n\nA third young senator with designs on the presidency, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, blasted his plotting colleagues \"who, for political advantage, were giving false hope to their supporters\", he said. The Republican old guard, meanwhile, in the guise of Mitt Romney, who has actually run for president - twice - accused his colleagues of being \"complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy\".\n\nEven the former Republican House speaker John Boehner, who since his 2015 retirement has mostly limited his commentary on politics to tweeted pictures of himself mowing his lawn, said the Grand Old party (GOP) was in trouble.\n\n\"I once said the party of Lincoln and Reagan is off taking a nap,\" Boehner wrote on Thursday. \"The nap has become a nightmare for our nation. The GOP must awaken.\"\n\nFor certain Republicans , the violent and deadly near-sacking of the Capitol on Wednesday by white supremacists and other Trump sympathizers seemed to be only the second most disturbing event of the week.\n\nThe night before, Republicans had lost two runoff US senate elections in Georgia, a state that until 2020 had not voted for a Democrat for president for 30 years. The two Georgia losses meant that Republicans lost control of the Senate - and leader Mitch McConnell lost his majority.\n\n\"Emotions [are] running high among McConnell-aligned Republicans,\" National Journal columnist Josh Kraushaar reported, \"after [the] reality of what transpired in Georgia settled in. May be the heat of the moment, but mood is for declaring war on Team Trump.\"\n\nA former McConnell chief of staff and campaign manager, Josh Holmes, was quick to knock down the idea.\n\n\"A lot of emotions. People are angry,\" Holmes replied on Twitter to Kraushaar. \"Nobody is declaring war on anything. We'll get through this.\"\n\nBut even the people with money, whose interests McConnell has expertly defended, grew agitated at the mess Trump had made.\n\n\"This is sedition and should be treated as such,\" Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, an influential business trade group, said . \"The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy.\" The chiefs of multiple Wall Street banks echoed the sentiment.\n\nThat is not even to mention the cavalcade of Republicans who had long since broken with Trump, who piled on the president after the Capitol was sacked. The conservative columnist George Will said : \"The three repulsive architects of Wednesday's heartbreaking spectacle\" - Trump, Hawley and Cruz - \"will each wear the scarlet 'S' of sedition.\" The conservative National Journal declared : \"Trump must pay.\" Matt Drudge's website ran the sarcastic banner \"Thanks, Donald\". The National Review hailed \"Trump's final insult\". A second former Trump chief of staff, John Kelly, joined those calling for his immediate removal from office.\n\nThe Republican cross-currents do not mean that the party will not find direction in time to win back the Senate, plus the House, in 2022 - or to win the presidency in 2024, whether with Trump's name on the ticket or tattooed on the nominee's forehead.\n\nBut Trump's role in the party, and the politics, has never been to introduce order, except when that means that everybody falls behind him. For now, everybody is doing the opposite: falling out."

      "text": "The Republican party is at last paying the price of its Faustian pact with Trump\n\nM ore than 11 years ago, before Donald Trump emerged from the primordial ooze of the far-right fever swamp, before the aborted January 6 insurrection and before the latest spasm of Republican extremism felled House speaker Kevin McCarthy , two renowned political scientists, Thomas Mann, and Norman Ornstein, put their finger on the essence of increasingly dysfunctional US politics: the Republican party. Mann and Ornstein argued that the Grand Old Party (GOP) had become an \"insurgent outlier\" that was \"ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition\".\n\nEleven years later, the enfant terrible of American politics has somehow got unimaginably worse. The GOP today is less a political party and more an inchoate mass of cultural grievances, conspiracy theories and lowest common denominator political slogans. Trump, for all his toxicity, is a symptom of the GOP's decades-long descent into madness. Legislating is not seen as a tool for bettering the plight of the American people but rather an opportunity to troll Democrats and play to the perceived slights of the party's rank-and-file supporters.\n\nBut Republican indifference to governing is, perhaps, the least of the party's pathologies. In slavishly supporting Trump and his Maga - Make America Great Again - supporters, they have empowered a political movement that is increasingly testing the limits of the US democratic experiment.\n\nMcCarthy's political trajectory tells the sorry tale. After January 6, McCarthy, who, along with his political colleagues, was forced to hide from the marauding insurrectionists, turned against the man responsible for the day's violence. Privately, he told fellow Republicans: \" I've had it with this guy \". But within weeks, he travelled to the ex-president's palatial digs in South Florida and, on bended knee, pledged loyalty to the GOP's orange god. He tried to block a bipartisan congressional committee to investigate January 6 and allied himself with conspiracy theorists who continued to spread lies about the 2020 election. Earlier this year, he gave in to Republican extremists and announced an impeachment inquiry of Joe Biden , even though there is no evidence that the president has committed any impeachable offences.\n\nMcCarthy, like countless Republican supplicants over the past eight years, realised that his political aspirations were directly tied to his willingness to support Trump and the extremist forces within the party that have rallied around him. In a tale as old as time, he made a deal with the devil, only to be burned by the political forces he'd empowered. Trump's hold over the Republican party is so complete that it borders on the pathological. Since March, he has been indicted four times and charged with 91 separate felonies . Yet his poll numbers among Republicans have dramatically improved. He enjoys a more than 45-point lead in the race for the party's presidential nomination.\n\nThere simply is no future in the GOP for an elected official who refuses to prostrate themselves to Trump. Liz Cheney was the most vocal and impassioned Republican in speaking out against him after January 6. Her reward: McCarthy engineered her removal from the GOP House leadership . Then, in 2022, a Maga Republican challenged Cheney in a GOP primary and defeated her by nearly 40 points . Another Republican apostate, former presidential candidate and current Utah senator Mitt Romney , who twice voted to convict Trump in his impeachment trials, recently announced that he wouldn't run for re-election .\n\nIn a series of interviews with the Atlantic 's McKay Coppins, he recounted how, \"in public\", his fellow Republican senators \"played their parts as Trump loyalists, often contorting themselves rhetorically to defend the president's most indefensible behaviour. But in private, they ridiculed his ignorance, rolled their eyes at his antics and made incisive observations about his warped, toddler-like psyche.\"\n\nLike other principled Republicans , Romney is choosing to walk away, and it's hard to blame him. His criticisms of Trump have led to death threats and he is now spending an estimated $5,000 a day on private security. But the result is that the GOP's ranks are now increasingly filled by those with bottomless reservoirs of ambition and empty cupboards of integrity. So for those hoping that a principled and mature Republican party will somehow emerge from this mess, think again. The political incentives in the GOP run in a singular direction - to the far right. If there is any silver lining, it is this: for all the Republican voters who love Trump, there is a larger mobilised group of voters who loathes him.\n\nIndeed, what is perhaps most striking about Trump is the static nature of his political support. In fact, if one compares his approval ratings from February 2020 - before the Covid pandemic ravaged the nation - to those in November 2020, when he ran for re-election, they were largely unchanged. Since leaving office, his approval numbers have also largely stayed the same. Americans have, by and large, made up their minds about Trump - and the verdict is: \"We don't like him.\"\n\nThe last three US elections prove the point. In what was largely seen as a rebuke to Trump, in the 2018 midterms, Democrats picked up more than 40 seats and control of the House of Representatives. In 2020, he lost re-election by at least 7m votes to Biden(4m more than he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016). In the 2022 midterms, the Democrats dramatically overperformed, picking up a seat in the Senate and barely losing the House of Representatives . So far this year, in dozens of special elections, Democrats are overperforming by a whopping 11 points. Part of this is a byproduct of the supreme court's decision on abortion rights , but it's also a backlash to the extremism that Trump has engendered.\n\nOf course, elections are tricky things and there is no guarantee that the unpopular Biden will emerge victorious next November. But take his current lousy polling with a grain of salt. It's one thing to want a different Democratic nominee, as many Democrats do, but elections are about choices. That the likely option for voters in November 2024 will be Biden, or a deeply unstable opponent who could be a multiple convicted felon, has a way of narrowing one's focus. But even if Trump loses, the problem of the Republican party will still be with us long after he's left the political scene.\n\nMichael Cohen is an Observer columnist.

It is what Joe Biden and the Democrats should do when faced with a party determined to subvert democracy through any means necessary, including violence.\n\nOn Friday Republicans in the Senate torpedoed an effort to create a bipartisan commission to investigate the deadly insurrection by Donald Trump's supporters at the US Capitol on 6 January, deploying the procedural move known as the filibuster to stop it even being debated.\n\nFearful perhaps of what such a commission might uncover about their own role as co-conspirators, most brushed aside personal pleas by Gladys Sicknick, the mother of a police officer who was that day sprayed with a chemical, collapsed and later had a stroke and died.\n\n\"A country that cannot even agree to investigate an assault on its Capitol is in big trouble, indeed,\" observed Susan Glasser in the New Yorker magazine.\n\nTellingly Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, who previously condemned Trump's role in the riot, reportedly asked senators to nix the commission as a \"personal favour\". It was a sign that the rot now goes deeper than a cult of personality into the foundations of the Grand Old Party (GOP).\n\nIt is a party that still has room for Matt Gaetz, a Florida congressman under investigation over sex trafficking allegations, who this week appeared to incite supporters to take up arms. \"We have a second amendment in this country, and I think we have an obligation to use it,\" he said.\n\nGaetz was speaking in Georgia on his \"America First\" tour alongside local congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who recently compared coronavirus mask mandates to the Holocaust. The pair of mini-Trumps are taking his playbook of attention-grabbing outrage to new extremes.\n\nBill Kristol, director of the Defending Democracy Together advocacy organisation, tweeted on Friday morning: \"Marjorie Taylor Greene bragged yesterday that she and Matt Gaetz are taking over the GOP. Today Senate Republicans are set to block a January 6th commission that could make that somewhat more difficult. Violence and authoritarianism has enablers as well as instigators.\"\n\nOne of America's two major parties now falls outside the democratic mainstream - think \"far right\" in European terms. But are Democrats taking the existential threat sufficiently seriously or sleepwalking towards disaster in the next election cycle?\n\nJoe Manchin , a moderate senator from West Virginia, had said Republicans have \"no excuse\" to oppose the commission. Yet he also repeated his refusal to contemplate abolishing the filibuster, effectively giving Republicans carte blanche to block infrastructure spending, voting rights legislation, statehood for the District of Columbia and more.\n\nMinutes after Friday's vote, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, seemed to get it, arguing that Republicans acted out of \"out of fear or fealty\" to Trump and made his false claim of a stolen election their official policy. \"Trump's big lie is now the defining principle of what was once the party of Lincoln,\" Schumer said. \"Republican state legislatures, seizing on the big lie, are conducting the greatest assault on voting rights since the beginning of Jim Crow.\"\n\nBut national voting rights legislation that would counter such steps is in deep trouble on Capitol Hill. Biden's deadline for a police reform law named after George Floyd has come and gone due to Republican objections. His ambitious infrastructure investment is stalling as Republicans seek to shave billions off.\n\nWhatever the president's head tells him, his heart has always favoured bipartisan compromise. He may also feel obliged to make a show of reaching across the aisle to satisfy moderates such as Manchin. Yet Democratic majorities are painfully narrow and each day brings the midterm elections closer.\n\nFred Wellman, a military veteran who is executive director of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, tweeted: \"We need to fight for our Republic. I don't understand at all what the Democratic leadership is thinking. Stop fucking around. Stop letting McConnell walk all over you. For God's sake act like you are the majority. We are all out here fighting. Where are you?\"\n\nThat question just became even more urgent and the case for abolishing the filibuster, passing Biden's agenda and acknowledging that the Republican party has gone rogue just became stronger."

Eisenhower during a particularly troubling occasion during his tenure in office. How would he feel today, if he witnessed that sage advice being spurned by his own party?\n\nThe Republican Party in America appears to be slowly losing whatever cohesion it may have possessed prior to Donald Trump 's remarkable election win last November. As it wrestles with foreign intrigues and domestic extremes, it appears as a party lost in the proverbial wilderness even after winning the promised land of electoral success only a few months ago.\n\nDespite the extremes, the Grand Old Party (GOP) still contains many moderate and experienced voices that for whatever reason have gone silent instead of rogue. Many had hoped that, following his surprise election win, Donald Trump would himself become more moderate as he listened to the experienced lights in the party and in the public service. They held their breath but it wasn't to be - the president is just as unpredictable as during the campaign, only with the keys of ultimate power in his hands. What are they to do?\n\nThey remember those better days, when the Republican Party successfully found common ground with their opponents, regardless of who was in power. They were diplomatic women and men who, despite their differences, reached across the aisle on those initiatives vital for the country - infrastructure, the Cold War, civil rights, education and Social Security, and many more. These individuals still exist yet have opted to remain largely quiet as the extremes of their party slowly drag it to shreds in polarized directions.\n\nCould the example of one of their great predecessors, Margaret Chase Smith, yet stir them to take a principled stand?\n\nReams of books on the turbulent times of Senator Joseph McCarthy fill shelves, especially in the Senate library, yet there are no books on Smith, despite her remarkable courage and insightful reasoning at one of those pivotal points in American history where a darker path could have been taken. She first served in the House of Representatives and then as a Senator from 1949 -1973 - the first woman to do so. She was a Republican from Main - the first woman to represent that state in both Houses - and, more importantly for our purposes here, was a deeply respected moderate.\n\nWhen McCarthy had gone too far in his Communist witch hunts and began dragging the Republican Party down with him, Smith gave one of the most stirring speeches in the Capitol, titling it, \"The Declaration of Conscience.\" Here words now speak for themselves, and must surely speak to moderate Republicans in their present dilemma. She rose in the Senate to say:\n\n\"I speak as a Republican. I speak as a woman. I speak as a United States senator. I speak as an American. I don't want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on the Four Horsemen of calumny - fear, ignorance, bigotry and smear ... I think that it is high time for the United States Senate and its members to do some soul-searching -- for us to weigh our consciences -- on the manner in which we are performing our duty to the people of America -- on the manner in which we are using or abusing our individual powers and privileges.\"\n\nIt was enough and it was monumental. Many of her fellow Republicans in the Senate came to their senses, largely through her challenge, and before long McCarthy was gone and the party he threatened to defile recaptured its conscience and its future.\n\nHere was a woman of her time, and of all time, reminding her party that acquiring power at the expense of conscience is merely a deal with the devil. Powerful individuals listened to her on that day and the better angels of their natures captured their imaginations. The decisions they made over the next few months permitted the Republican Party to regain its footing and its fitting place in Washington.\n\nRepublicans control both Houses and the Executive, but decades of moderate leadership have given way, first to extremes and now to possible anarchy. Margaret Chase Smith's counsel is still there for them to consider and her portrait yet hangs in the Senate gallery above them to witness their actions. Though dead since 1995, her voice still calls to her compatriots, urging them to stand not only for their own conscience, but equally for the future of the very nation they profess to love and serve.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:"

      "text": "Is the GOP a Far Right Party?\n\nAssociate Professor in School of Public and International Affairs, University of Georgia\n\nI know what you are thinking... no, of course not. After all, the Republican Party , or Grand Old Party (GOP), is a party of the right, conservative, but square within the political mainstream. Just because Donald Trump is leading the primaries, and the GOP seems unable and unwilling to stop him, does not make the whole party far right. The official party platform is more or less mainstream conservative, as is the (toothless) party leader Reince Priebus. And only a minority of the party's Members of Congress, most notably in the House of Representatives, is ideologically far right -- such as Michelle Bachmann (Minnesota), Louie Gohmert (Texas), Steve King (Iowa) and Jeff Sessions (Alabama).\n\nThe situation is much less clear at the state level, however. Here authoritarianism and nativism run rampant among governors and legislators alike. It is almost exclusively among GOP-controlled states that strict anti-immigration and \" anti-Sharia \" legislation was introduced. And the vast majority of Republican governors refused to accept Syrian refugees to their state, on the unfounded allegation that they would include terrorists.\n\nAmerican parties are not the centralized, homogeneous political organizations that European parties are. The particular combination of a first-past-the-post electoral system and extremely expensive campaigns means that individuals can create some independence vis-à-vis national party leaders, particularly if they have their own financial backers or sources. Consequently, the parties are strongly influenced by some individual members, particularly if one of those individuals wins the presidency. In other words, the major presidential candidates play a major role in the (self-)characterization of the party.\n\nThe real problem of the GOP today is that Donald Trump is not just a far right outsider, who has infiltrated a mainstream right-wing party, as the establishment is desperately trying to tell you and most mainstream media continue to confirm. The success of Trump is in many ways the product of a decade-long radicalization of the grassroots and cadres of the party and, consequently, Trump represents the party at least as much as Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell or failed establishment candidate Jeb Bush.\n\nThe case for labeling Trump \"far right\" is pretty straightforward. The core of his campaign is authoritarianism and nativism fueled with fierce and vulgar anti-establishment rhetoric. No minority is safe from him: Mexicans, Muslims, African-Americans, and even Jews -- who were treated to beautiful examples of anti-Semitic philosemitism -- including the already legendary \"I'm a negotiator, like you folks\" -- at a speech to the Republican Jews Coalition last year. For Trump every issue is, in essence, a security issue that has to be dealt with in an authoritarian manner -- from the wall with Mexico to terrorism -- in which he does not shy away from using violence (including torture). Not surprising then that authoritarianism is a key factor explaining support for Trump among voters. While he is not a true populist , as he believes in his own unique virtues and not those of the (common) people, his anti-establishment discourse is very similar to that of far right populists in Europe, i.e. claiming all elites are essentially corrupt and on the same side.\n\nThe problem for the GOP is that Trump is not the only major candidate whose core beliefs are at odds with liberal democracy, in particular minority rights. Each of the remaining five presidential candidates has proposed to limit the rights of minorities, including the gay community and Muslims. In fact, the top three candidates have all called for increased monitoring of \"Muslim communities\" in sharp opposition to religious freedom and, obviously, the First Amendment.\n\nIn fact, if the 2016 primaries had been normal by any conventional standard, even the standards of the 2012 GOP primaries (which were also lathered with religious extremism and Islamophobia ), all the attention and outrage would have been focused on the behavior and ideas of Ted Cruz. And I am not talking about him cooking bacon with a machine gun. Cruz has a long and well-established track record of supporting far right causes and conspiracies. In a recent article in the SPLC's Intelligence Report on the ten most popular far right conspiracy theories in the United States, Cruz featured regularly as one of the most prominent supporters of those theories -- including the insane conspiracies around Agenda 21 , an alleged attempt to put \"the tentacles of the UN into US institutions\" (one of the key conspiracy theories of the far right John Birch Society ), and Jade Helm , the 2015 US military training exercise in several Southern states that many far right activists in Texas thought was a secret Pentagon plan to invade their state.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Log in to hide these messages.\n\nAnd, despite Trump's recent re-invention as a devout Christian, uncritically accepted by large portion of the Religious Right , the real religious extremism comes from other candidates within the party, most notably Ben Carson and Ted Cruz. Asked \"a simple question\" on MSNBC , namely \"Does the Bible have authority over the Constitution?\", Carson answered \"That is not a simple question\", arguing that it depended on the \"specific context.\" Cruz has said, on multiple occasions, \"That our rights do not come from the Democratic Party or the Republican Party or even from the Tea Party. Our rights come from our creator.\" In other words, two of the five remaining GOP presidential candidates believe that the Bible is more important than the Constitution, which suggests a theocratic understanding of politics that is directly at odds with democracy, not just liberal democracy.\n\nEven the last hope of the GOP establishment, Marco Rubio, is not a traditional mainstream conservative. First, he was catapulted into national politics by the Tea Party movement, even though he quickly abandoned them when he found other, richer backers. Second, he has supported classic far right tropes, such as the denial of man-made climate change or the obviously wrong assertion that Christianity is being treated as \" hate speech \" under President Obama. In one of the most bizarre moments in the campaign so far, a very high bar, Rubio and Cruz, both Cuban Americans, were trying to out-Trump each other on immigration with Rubio outright denying his previous support for immigration reform and blurring lines between immigrants and terrorists. Similarly, there is little light between Rubio's anti-Muslim comments and those of Trump (or Cruz). In fact, after Trump had stated that mosques should be under surveillance because of the risk of \"radical Islam\", Rubio extended that to \"any place -- whether it's a cafe, a diner, an internet site -- any place where radicals are being inspired\".\n\nSo, what does this say about the GOP today? Is the GOP a far right party? Clearly not if one only looks at the official front of the party, i.e. the fairly irrelevant party leader and platform. And only at the margins if one looks at the main (national) representatives in US Congress. But increasingly it is if one focuses at the most popular candidates for presidency, which, if successful, will be the most powerful person within the party. Consequently, it is high time that the GOP leadership and supporters who do still support liberal democracy take their responsibility and see their party for what it is. Not a party that was hijacked by Trump (and Cruz), but a party that created him, and that is now increasingly being shaped in his image.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "What To Read On Trump(ism)\n\nAssociate Professor in School of Public and International Affairs, University of Georgia\n\nI recently criticized US political science for being blind of the right eye, arguing that scholars of American politics have been ill-prepared for three of the main political developments in American politics this century: the role of neoconservatives in the George W. Bush administration, the rise of the Tea Party, and the current success of Donald Trump . I argued that the reasons for this blond spot are of a structural nature, affecting the study of American politics even more than other parts of the discipline.\n\nI ended the post with a promise to provide a list of the limited scholarship that could help provide a better understanding of the rise of Donald Trump and Trumpism, i.e. his unique form of radical right politics. I don't claim to include all relevant resources; most notably, I focus exclusively on books (referencing the original and most recent and updated version). Few of these studies have been written by political scientists, let alone by mainstream political scientists, but perhaps the phenomenal public attention paid to Trump will change that.\n\nAs I have argued in several other posts, nativism and radical right politics have a long history in the United States. The classic study to understand the long tradition of American nativism is historian John Higham's seminal Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1860-1925 (1955/2002), which covers the period of the Know Nothings to the second coming of the Ku Klux Klan. The classic study of the postwar radical right is sociologist Daniel Bell's edited volume The Radical Right: The New American Right (1963/2001), which focuses particularly on the anti-communist radical right of the 1950s, which the progressive historian Richard Hofstadter famously referred to as \"the paranoid style in American politics.\"\n\nThere are three books that focus on the whole period of the mid-19th century to the late-20th century. Sociologists Seymour Martin Lipset and Earl Raab's The Politics of Unreason: Right Wing Extremism in America, 1790-1977 (1970/1978), discusses the US radical right on the basis of a sociological theory of status politics and working class authoritarianism that is still highly current today. Historian David H. Bennett's The Party of Fear: The American Far Right from Nativism to the Militia (1988/1995) is more a \"narrative history,\" which puts individual groups and movements within their specific historical context. In Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort (2000) political activists Chip Berlet and Matthew N. Lyons , finally, provide the most comprehensive and detailed overview of the US radical right through the conceptual lens of populism and producerism, tying it somewhat to the much more developed literature on the European radical right.\n\nBut to understand the rise of Trump and Trumpism we should not only look at the (often fringe) radical right, or what the media have come to misguidedly call \"alt right\" in recent times, but also on the transformation of the two-party system in general, and the Republican Party in particular. In From the New Deal to the New Right: Race and the Southern Origins of Modern Conservatism (2009) University of Oregon political scientist Joe Lowndes analyzes the conscious strategy within the Grand Old Party (GOP) to use \"race\" to force a re-alignment in the South, where nativist and racist voters had traditionally supported the so-called Dixiecrats. In many ways the Trump campaign can be seen as the extremist swan song of the Southern Strategy of the GOP. The bestseller It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein , provides a useful complementary perspective to Lowndes study, focusing more specifically on the radicalization of the GOP in Congress, clearly showing that the GOP was not \"hijacked\" by Trump, it created Trump!\n\nSurprisingly, the rise of the Tea Party, just a few years ago, features little in the current debate on Trump. And yet, as the few insightful studies of the Tea Party show, the both phenomena play on very similar attitudes and frustrations. In the most empirical account, Change They Can't Believe In: The Tea Party and Reactionary Politics in America (2013), political scientists Christopher S. Parker (University of Washington) and Matt A. Barreto (UCLA) hark back to the theories of the 1960s and 1970s (e.g. Bell and Lipset) as they interpret the Tea Party primarily as a reactionary response to recent changes in American society, most notably related to majority-minority relations. Harvard University political scientists Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson take a different approach in their The Tea Party: The Remaking of Republican Conservatism (2013), emphasizing the internal struggles within Republican conservatism and the role of the conservative media (notably Fox News ). Finally, Steep: The Precipitous Rise of the Tea Party (2012) is a highly original volume edited by Lawrence Rosenthal and Christine Trost , who direct the Center for Right-Wing Studies at the University of California at Berkeley, as far as I know the only research center in the US specifically devoted to right-wing politics (full disclosure: I am affiliated with the Center). Steep is of particular value because it includes scholars from various disciplines adopting different, and sometimes opposing, theoretical perspectives on the character and explanations of the Tea Party.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

In a fascinating new book, Right-Wing Critics of American Conservatism , University of Alabama political scientist George Hawley presents an overview of the heterogeneous fauna of right-wing groups and individuals that exist in the shadows of the GOP, from libertarians to white supremacists. In his book Terrified: How Anti-Muslim Fringe Organizations Became Mainstream (2016) Duke University sociologist Christopher A. Bail focuses on a specific subculture that has been instrumental in bridging the mainstream right and the radical right in the US. The importance of Islamophobia to the 2016 presidential campaign of Trump, as well as some other candidates (like Ted Cruz), is difficult to overstate.\n\nFinally, while there are several specific American aspects to the character and rise of Trump and Trumps, they are part of a broader rise in radical right politics in western democracies, most notably in Western Europe. And while the radical right is a fairly marginal topic of study in American politics, it is among the most studied topics in European politics. My own Populist Radical Right Parties in Europe (2007) provides a critical \"state of the art\" overview of the rich scholarship on radical right parties in Europe, while Revolt on the Right: Explaining for the Radical Right in Britain (2013), by British political scientists Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin , is an accessible and concise application of the European literature to the British case, specifically the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), perhaps the most familiar to American readers.\n\nThis list is not meant to be exhaustive and will undoubtedly miss some other useful resources. If anyone knows additional books that provide solid analysis, rather than political advocacy, on the radical right in the US, please suggest them in the comments.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Springtime for Authoritarians\n\nAlan Briskin, Ph.D. is an author, artist, and leadership consultant specializing in organizational change.\n\n\"Don't be stupid, be a smarty, come and join the Nazi party!\" --Mel Brooks, Springtime for Hitler\n\nWhen I applied to graduate schools in the late 1970s, I was interviewed at one institution by a dignified Southern gentleman who happened also to be the school's founder. His name was Nevitt Sanford, and the program in psychology he created was named, with a touch of irony, the Wright Institute. Sanford had gained prominence as the coauthor of The Authoritarian Personality, originally a research project sponsored by the American Jewish Committee in the aftermath of the Holocaust. The organization sought to engage social scientists in helping to develop rigorous methods for the study of prejudice and hatred. And that is exactly what they did.\n\nSanford, deeply influenced by what he learned during his years of research, was tested immediately by a new form of prejudice sweeping the American collective psyche. In 1950, the same year The Authoritarian Personality was published, he became one of 12 professors at the University of California's Berkeley campus who refused to sign a loyalty oath during the McCarthy era of communist witch hunts. For his courage, he was dismissed by the university, but in 1959 he was reinstated by a Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn 1968, he founded the graduate school where I was applying and later accepted. I had been drawn by the school's declaration that graduate education should be informed by a multidisciplinary approach, humanistic, and ethically responsive to the social conditions of its time. He told me that his vision was to create \"clinicians for society,\" a role that did not yet exist. I think this is what defines certain kinds of visionaries. They see productive responses to social dilemmas long before others even perceive the need.\n\nAs Daniel Goleman noted in a New York Times obituary following his death in 1995, \"Dr. Sanford was among the first to study the interaction between social systems and personality. He wrote about how social conditions could encourage people with dogmatic biases to persecute groups they were prejudiced against.\" His seminal work on authoritarianism became, in the words of social psychologist Dr. Susan Fiske, \"a main taproot of all the later research on prejudice, as well as the field of social psychology.\"\n\nIt's now over sixty-five years since The Authoritarian Personality was first published. And the academic world has not been kind to this taproot of seminal ideas. Denigrated for its methodology, dismissed for its conceptual underpinnings in psychoanalysis, and relegated to the margins of social science for its hypothesis of an authoritarian personality linked with European fascism, the research fell into disfavor.\n\nNow, in the midst of a political storm that few saw coming, the conceptual relevance of authoritarianism is greater than ever. Fortunately, novel approaches by social scientists have brought new perspectives to a redrawn authoritarian disposition , a quality no longer associated with a fixed personality structure. Rather, authoritarianism appears to ebb and flow with the perception of threat and, as Sanford hypothesized, is associated with the experience of social disruption.\n\nDonald Trump 's candidacy, and the heightened attention it has brought, sheds light on a nascent authoritarian movement, uniquely American. And it is growing inside the bowels of the Republican party--large enough to be a political party of its own. A Vox poll estimated that more than 55 percent of members of the Grand Old Party (GOP) score \"high or very high\" on an authoritarian scale. Far less worked up about traditional conservative issues, such as limited government and free trade, this group takes its animus from perceptions of threat--the most visible being outsiders, such as terrorists and immigrants, but also internal threats to social order and established hierarchies, such as the growing acceptance of same-sex couples and the increased influence of women and minorities.\n\nThe discomfort felt among the established Republican elite is palpable. They are witnessing a political experiment that has gotten out of hand. Having positioned themselves as a law-and-order party, a home for the silent majority, and a promoter of American exceptionalism, they cobbled together voters with a predilection for authoritarian views. Now, the alliances they helped create are turning on them as not being extreme or strong enough. Lurching between Trump and a similarly disliked candidate, Ted Cruz, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham described the dilemma as a choice between \"being shot in the head or poisoned.\" Asked the difference, Graham explained, \"Donald is like being shot in the head; you might find an antidote to poison.\"\n\nOf course, it is not just Republicans who are upset but any of us who find the incendiary rhetoric repugnant. Vox journalist Amanda Taub , fascinated with the phenomena of an authoritarian political movement, summarized a key finding from her investigation into the subject. \"People who score high in authoritarianism, when they feel threatened, look for strong leaders who promise to take whatever action necessary to protect them from outsiders...\" The Vox poll concluded that authoritarianism \"was the best single predictor of support for Trump.\"\n\nTrump instinctively understands the connection between his audience and the desire for protection against outsiders. Referencing his remarks about building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, he told the New York Times : \"You know, if it gets a little boring, if I see people starting to sort of, maybe thinking about leaving, I can sort of tell the audience, I just say, 'We will build the wall!' and they go nuts.\" He also seems to embody the black-and-white terms in which authoritarian-minded individuals think. Trump gained prominence early on in the nominating process by declaring the need to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants with the proposition that \"we either have a country, or we don't have a country.\" The either/or framework is consistent with an authoritarian hatred for ambiguity and an underlying fear that if selected rules are not followed, an existential threat exists.\n\nWhile the media focuses on the contradictions, bombast, and resilience of Donald Trump's campaign, we must look beyond the personality and ask how such a figure rises in prominence. It is tempting to discredit Trump as an exception, an extreme case, or a product of a flawed political process. However, there are deeper and more uncomfortable questions related to the rise of authoritarianism. What latent urge for prejudice still lurks in our collective psyche? How might a Trump or even a Cruz candidacy be prologue to a new chapter in collective madness?\n\nMel Brooks got it partially right with his satirical insight that there is an alluring tug ( be a smarty ) to join a party, or even a mob, but that is not the whole story. Nor is the notion of a simple authoritarian personality, a person generally submissive to any authority. We must discover a more sophisticated link that, even while revealing the darker shades of our collective behavior, illuminates what is unfolding. We are talking about a growing movement, likely in the tens of millions, willing to support military force over diplomacy, alter the Constitution to bar citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, and target Muslims and others of Middle Eastern descent for continuous police surveillance.\n\nWhat is important to know, albeit disturbing, is that the authoritarian disposition is a psychological potential in each of us. In fact, the research on authoritarianism clearly suggests that under high conditions of threat, the majority of us will act in ways that \"mirror the behavior and opinions of authoritarians...\" (Hetherington and Weiler ). In other words, this is not about us (nonauthoritarian) and them (authoritarian), but all of us and our collective response to fear.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

To me this is about showing up with curiosity and courage, a commitment to genuinely understand what tears at the fabric of our social bonds. It is also, however, a rejection of attempts to amplify the danger from external threats or create internal scapegoats. Being a clinician for society is a declaration of power to act constructively and even therapeutically. Maya Angelou put it poetically when she said, \"We are all at once both a composition and a composer. We have the ability not only to compose the future of our own lives, but to help compose the future of everyone around us and the communities in which we live.\"\n\nThe invitation is to create healthy environments, be they in educational settings, health care, workplaces, or our own family constellations. Each of us in our own way can support social justice, create beauty, and contribute to an ecology of kindness. However, we cannot do this blindly or with our heads in the sand. We must appreciate that there are many others, some of whom are friends and relatives, who see the world through a glass darkly. They are willing to support extreme positions and are looking for a strong leader who will protect them. They may not see what Mel Brooks captured so comically and tragically in his parody of an authoritarian leader, a temporary spring for some, winter for the rest of us. If there is a clue to the authoritarian disposition, it is that the need for an internal sense of order is more crucial than authority itself. We are dealing with responses to fear as much as any particular prejudice. Let us recall that when fear arises, there is also an opportunity to act with courage, understanding, and love.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.
